This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

Brian K. Finneran





















Suffolk County National Bank
Location: Riverhead, NY
Founded: 1890
Industry: Not-for-profit; banking
Brian K. Finneran
EVP and CFO
Years at company: 2
DRIVING GROWTH: EVP and CFO Brian K. Finneran joined Suffolk County National Bank as part of a new management team to help turn around the troubled financial institution. At the time, the bank was facing several major problems, including class-action and shareholder lawsuits, a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigation, and the threat of de-listing by NASDAQ. Within two years of joining the company, Finneran settled shareholder lawsuits, satisfied the SEC enough to close its investigation and filed all SEC reports in time to avoid NASDAQ de-listing.
Quick Tip: “The same quote that I tell my children: An honest man’s pillow is his peace of mind.”
MAKING AN IMPACT: Finneran also completely rebuilt the bank’s financial group with high-quality professionals and instituted a disciplined annual budget and quarterly forecast process, while re-vamping the company’s quarterly SEC financial reporting process.
STRIVING FOR SUCCESS: Finneran has a reputation in the industry for honesty and ethical behavior. That reputation (along with regularly working 60- to 70-hour weeks), has helped him forge excellent relationships with his co-workers and with all of the bank’s professional partners. “There are no shortcuts with respect to financial integrity,” Finneran says.

The Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") is a United States copyright law that provides guidelines for online service providers in case of copyright infringement.

Accordingly, if you are not sure whether material infringes your copyright, we suggest that you first contact an attorney.
This notice and any attachments we receive will be forwarded to the alleged infringer, who will then have the opportunity to file a counter notification pursuant to Sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. Should a properly filed counter notification be filed, you will be notified and have 10 business days within which to file for a restraining order in Federal Court to prevent the reinstatement of the material.

Suffolk Bancorp Appoints Brian K. Finneran As Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer






Business Wire




Feb 7, 2012 6:00 AM EST













 




























































  Suffolk Bancorp (NASDAQ - SUBK) today announced the appointment of Brian K. Finneran as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of both Suffolk and its banking subsidiary, Suffolk County National Bank, effective immediately. The position has been open since June 24, 2011.  President and Chief Executive Officer, Howard C. Bluver, remarked, “I am absolutely thrilled that Brian has joined Suffolk as our Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer. I have known Brian for a long time, and am keenly aware of the outstanding reputation he has attained on both Long Island and nationally as a result of his long tenure as the Chief Financial Officer at State Bancorp. We could not have found a more seasoned and respected professional to take over this critical area for us, and I am looking forward to partnering with Brian as we move forward into 2012 and beyond.”  Mr. Finneran had served as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of State Bancorp since 1997, and Senior Vice President and Comptroller from 1990 to 1997. Mr. Finneran holds an MBA from Pace University and a BBA from Bernard M. Baruch College. Mr. Finneran also holds the “Certified Risk Professional” designation from the Bank Administration Institute. Mr. Finneran is a member of the New York Society of Security Analysts, the Financial Managers Society, the Institute of Management Accountants, the Financial Executives Institute, and the National Investor Relations Institute.  Suffolk Bancorp is a one-bank holding company engaged in the commercial banking business through the Suffolk County National Bank, a full service commercial bank headquartered in Riverhead, New York. “SCNB” is Suffolk Bancorp’s wholly owned subsidiary. Organized in 1890, Suffolk County National Bank has 30 offices in Suffolk County, New York.  Safe Harbor Statement Pursuant to the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995  This press release includes statements which look to the future. These can include remarks about Suffolk, the banking industry, the economy in general, expectations of the business environment in which Suffolk operates, projections of future performance, and potential future credit experience. These remarks are based upon current management expectations, and may, therefore, involve risks and uncertainties that cannot be predicted or quantified and are beyond Suffolk’s control and are subject to a variety of uncertainties that could cause future results to vary materially from Suffolk’s historical performance, or from current expectations. Factors that could affect Suffolk Bancorp include particularly, but are not limited to: a failure by Suffolk to meet the deadline under SEC rules for filing its Annual Report on Form 10-K (or any permitted extension thereof), or any further delay in filing its Annual Report beyond April 15, 2012; changes in interest rates; increases or decreases in retail and commercial economic activity in Suffolk’s market area; variations in the ability and propensity of consumers and businesses to borrow, repay, or deposit money, or to use other banking and financial services; results of regulatory examinations; any failure by Suffolk to comply with our written agreement with the OCC (the “Agreement”) or the individual minimum capital ratios for the Bank established by the OCC; the cost of compliance with the Agreement; any failure by Suffolk to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting; larger-than-expected losses from the sale of assets; potential litigation or regulatory action relating to the matters resulting in Suffolk’s failure to file on time its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2011, June 30, 2011, and September 30, 2011 or resulting from the revisions to earnings previously announced on April 12, 2011 or the restatement of its financial statements for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2010 and year ended December 31, 2010; and the potential that net charge-offs are higher than expected or for further increases in our provision for loan losses. Further, it could take Suffolk longer than anticipated to implement its strategic plans to increase revenue and manage non-interest expense, or it may not be possible to implement those plans at all. Finally, new and unanticipated legislation, regulation, or accounting standards may require Suffolk to change its practices in ways that materially change the results of operations.
