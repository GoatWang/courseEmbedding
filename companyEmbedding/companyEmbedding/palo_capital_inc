					Investment Approach	

HomeInvestment Approach 













Individualized Solutions
Palo Capital offers a range of investment strategies though which we provide investment solutions individualized to each client’s needs for:

Growth
Income
Capital preservation.

Proprietary, In-House Investment Process
While many investment advisors effectively “outsource” the investment process to third-parties through mutual funds or other vehicles, Palo Capital’s core competency is its research-driven investment process.  This enables us to effectively invest assets primarily in individual issues, avoiding the layered fees and tax inefficiencies associated with mutual funds.
Investment Approach: Quality at a Discount
Palo Capital’s investment approach is based on a multi-year, empirically-driven research effort to develop a process that targets:

Attractive long-term returns
Consistent performance relative to benchmarks
Protection against drawdowns during weak market periods.

The heart of Palo Capital investment’s process is a quantitative method for rating stocks which we call “Quality at a Discount”.  This method targets quality companies whose stock prices offer good value at an acceptable level of risk.  This process entails quantitative assessment of metrics for the following factors:

Quality factors: financial productivity, margin consistency, business momentum
Value factors: multiples of "owner earnings," shareholder yield, etc.
Risk factors: operating and financial leverage, profit margin variability, stock price volatility.

Investment styles are commonly characterized as either “growth” or “value.”  Palo Capital’s Quality at A Discount  (“QAD”) method combines elements of both the growth and value styles.  However, the added emphasis on metrics for “quality” introduces a more consistent return profile in comparison to either the growth or value styles based on our research and our results with QAD.
Palo Capital’s equity strategies implement QAD in different ways, with the Core Equity strategy being the purest implementation of the QAD process.
Investing Insights

Long term, the market may be efficient, but in the short term, it is not.  Securities gravitate toward fair value over time, but deviate in the short run due to investor emotions and analytical errors. Legendary investor Ben Graham probably said this best: "In the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run it is a weighing machine.


Corect investment moves are often counterintuitive. Interpreting widely known information in a way that differs from the consensus - but turns out to be correct - is difficult. Palo Capital’s quantitative orientation helps us stay objective and rational. That said, we have learned that our best moves are often the ones that we and our clients most question, while the seemingly obvious and “easy” trades don’t work out nearly as well.

					Our History	

HomeAbout  Our History 














 
Investing success requires an ability to diverge from the behavior of the herd. Kevin O’Grady, Palo Capital’s founder, came to investment management with a unique background as an economist, physician, tech company CFO, and successful entrepreneur. Having applied this unusual skillset to successfully managing money for friends and family, Palo Capital was created to expand the range and sophistication of investment offerings to those who had entrusted their assets to him.
Since its 2005 founding, the firm’s compounded growth in assets under management has exceeded 35% per year. This growth has been achieved not through marketing prowess, but by a focus on delivering solid investment returns and superior client service. It is also testimony to the superior talent that has been recruited to the Palo Capital team. While the firm now has clients in 19 U.S. states and several countries, the client experience retains the “friends and family” feel on which the firm was founded.

					Why Palo Capital?	

HomeWhy Palo Capital? 














Investment depth. Palo Capital differentiates itself based on our ability to offer effective, proprietary, well-performing investment solutions. While most financial services firms are essentially "distribution channels" for their parent companies, our time, personnel, and budgets are highly focused on the investment process.
Aligned interests. Our owners and principals invest along-side our clients in the same investment strategies. Moreover, they have a significant portion of their net worth tied to the success of the business and the success of our clients in achieving their investment objectives.
Individualized investment solutions. Palo Capital offers multiple investment strategies addressing a range of investment objectives and risk tolerances. Our investment solutions are individualized to each client‘s situation in contrast to the “one size fits all” approach of many firms.
High level of client service & communication. Because we don’t receive commissions or any other “up-front” fees, our business model only works if we keep our clients satisfied for multiple years. Hence, we provide a higher level of service and communication than most other firms.
Third party custodians. All client assets are held by nationally recognized third party custodians such as Charles Schwab, Fidelity and Interactive Brokers. We never hold custody of any client funds.
Employee-owned. A multi-generational partnership among employee owners of the firm provides clients the long term stability they want from an investment management firm, without the conflicts of interest associated with a corporate ownership structure.
Fiduciary standard. Palo Capital is an SEC-Registered Investment Advisor, a designation which means we must adhere to a fiduciary standard to always act in the best interests of our clients - a higher standard than what most brokerage firms are held to.
Transparent fee structure. Palo Capital charges a fee based on the client's assets under management. We do not receive any commissions or payments from third parties. Our fee schedule is available upon request to all current and prospective clients.
Liquidity. All investments made directly by Palo Capital are fully liquid. We do not not invest in securities which are not publicly traded and we do not have any "lock-up" provisions or minimum investment times.

HomeAbout  Giving Back 














 
Giving back is a core belief at Palo Capital. We are committed to contributing our time and our treasure to organizations that improve the lives of others through science, the arts, or education, or by promoting economic self-sufficiency. Examples of our involvements include:

Nella Webster O’Grady was named "2015 Philanthropist of the Year" by the United Way of Orange County’s Tocqueville Society. While such awards are often given to those who have made the largest donations, in Nella’s case it followed nine years of enthusiastic service on the United Way Board of Directors, and a long history of service to multiple other Orange County charitable entities.


In Palo Capital’s early years, we sent a small gift to our clients each holiday season. In 2008 amidst the economic downturn, we replaced such gifts with a donation to 501(C)(3) entities selected by clients. Clients applauded this move and we have continued it ever since.


Palo Capital staff have contributed their expertise by serving on investment policy committees or as treasurers of multiple local non-profit entities including the Girl Scouts, the Pacific Symphony, the American Cancer Society, the Newport Beach Public Library Foundation, etc.
