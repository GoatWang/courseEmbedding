Marty Bradley, father convicted of racketeering charges | savannahnow.com | Savannah Morning News














 









 













Marty Bradley, father convicted of racketeering charges
Father and son convicted of racketeering; federal court jury acquits five defendants after marathon deliberations.



Posted: Wednesday, March 29, 2006 







It started out badly for Martin J. "Marty" Bradley III on Wednesday afternoon.
As Wayne Williams, federal courtroom deputy, read the jury's verdicts, it got worse.
Bradley, 40, of Coral Gables, Fla., was guilty of racketeering and guilty of underlying racketeering offenses resulting from a Florida Medicaid scheme.



As the first convictions were read before a hushed courtroom, Bradley's wife, Maria, burst into tears and was removed.
Other family members and friends also appeared distraught as Williams recited the convictions.
By the time Williams finished reading the 70-page verdict form, about 30 minutes later, Bradley and Bio-Med Plus Inc., his blood products business, were in ruins.
The verdicts - handed down immediately after the lunch recess - came after the seven women and five men on the panel deliberated over the 286-count indictment for almost seven days in virtual silence.
Unlike some juries, this one sent almost no requests or questions to the judge after the initial hours of deliberations last Thursday.
Prosecutors, lead by Assistant U.S. Attorney James Durham, contended the defendants' schemes snared life-saving medications for inflated profits and  threatened untold patients' health and even lives.
Programs that were affected included Florida and California Medicaid programs, the California Genetically Handicapped Persons Program for such illnesses as hemophilia, and the Immune Deficiency Foundations Safety Net Program, which was designed to ensure that hard-to-obtain medications were available.
Also jeopardized, the government argued, were group pharmaceutical organizations and foreign prescription drug markets.
Government officials and defense financial specialist Art Leach were putting final touches on negotiations on two forfeiture counts in which prosecutors are seeking to recoup not less than the $45 million they charged were taken from Medicaid as a result of the schemes.
The jury also convicted Bradley's father, Martin J. Bradley Jr., 67, of Savannah, on the racketeering charge, but acquitted him on a count for conspiring to commit racketeering.
The jury repeatedly found the son guilty, then ruled his father not guilty.
They did convict him on two charges of failing to report foreign financial transactions; his son on one such count.
Jurors convicted Albert Tellechea, of Miami, as well, on a conspiracy charge in the Florida Medicaid scheme.
The remaining defendants - Sara Griffin, of Savannah and Jose Trespalacios, Edwin Rivera Jr., Marlene Caceras and Stephen Getz, all of Miami - were acquitted.
Sentencing for the three convicted defendants will be determined following an investigation by probation officers to determine sentencing ranges for each.
The final word will come from U.S. District Judge B. Avant Edenfield.
The judge rejected pleas by the younger Bradley's lawyer, Roy Black, and ordered the defendant taken into custody pending sentencing.
Lead government prosecutor James Durham opposed continuing  Bradley's $2.5 million pre-trial bond, telling Edenfield the defendant faces "decades" in prison and had the resources to flee.
Edenfield did allow the elder Bradley to remain free on his $2.5 million bond after his lawyer, Alex Zipperer, argued his client's age and heart problems were a concern.
"If I learned one thing during this trial, patients did not come first at Bio-Med. Money came first,'' Edenfield said in considering Zipperer's request.
The judge, after some hesitation, also allowed Tellechea to remain free on his $1 million bond, but ordered electronic monitoring for the defendant.
The judge allowed lawyers for the three convicted defendants 30 days to file new-trial motions.
They will have 10 days after sentencing to file notice of appeal.
"We have substantial issues for appeal,'' Black told Edenfield.
Black, who assumed the lead role for the defense, declined comment following the verdicts.
"We're very appreciative of the not-guilty verdicts,'' said Griffin's attorney, Edward Tolley of Athens. "We think it restores her credibility in the community, which was very important to her.''

Victims Of Largest Fraud Case Prosecuted In Southern District Of Georgia Receive Over $27 Million In Restitution
Assets of Defendants convicted in U.S. v. Bradley also used to satisfy $39.5 million forfeiture order and approximately $15 million in fines 
SAVANNAH, GA – United States Attorney Edward J. Tarver announced today the payment of over $27 million in restitution to the victims of the largest fraud case ever prosecuted in the Southern District of Georgia, United States v. Martin J. Bradley III, et al., Case No. 405-059 (S.D. Ga.).
The Bradley case involved the dismantling of a criminal enterprise dealing in blood derivative prescription drugs obtained by fraud and through the black market, then resold through Bio-Med Plus (Bio-Med), then the largest privately held secondary wholesaler of blood derivatives in the country.  Martin Bradley III and Martin Bradley, Jr. were the leaders of the corrupt enterprise who orchestrated fraud schemes from Georgia to Florida to California, Puerto Rico, the Bahamas, and elsewhere, with shell companies and offshore accounts used to perpetrate and conceal the schemes.  After a lengthy investigation, a grand jury sitting in Savannah returned a 288-Count RICO indictment alleging a dozen different schemes to defraud Medicare, Medicaid programs, drugs manufacturers and others of tens-of-millions of dollars worth of prescription drugs essential to the lives of cancer patients and those suffering from AIDS, hemophilia and other illnesses.  After a six-week trial held in Savannah, the jury convicted the Bradleys and Bio-Med of racketeering, money laundering and related charges.  Bio-Med was forfeited to the Government and the Bradleys received stiff prison sentences, 25 years for Bradley III and 15 years for Bradley, Jr.  The Court also entered a restitution order of over $27.8 million; a forfeiture judgment of $39.5 million; and fines totaling over $30 million against the Bradleys and Bio-Med.
A federal receiver was appointed to liquidate the assets of the Bradleys after their convictions.  More than $60 million in assets were liquidated, including jet planes, automobile
collections, yachts, vacation homes and office buildings.  As part of the liquidation, the assets of Bio-Med were also sold.
After the Defendants’ direct appeal rights were exhausted, the Government moved the Court to direct that restitution be made to all victims of the Bradley case.  As a result, the Clerk of Court for the Southern District of Georgia this week forwarded United States Treasury checks in the following amounts to the following victims: $2,738,373.50 to Medicare; $10,117,601.03 to Florida Medicaid; $10,419,801.96 to the Genetically Handicapped Persons Program; $2,260,514.01 to Medi-Cal; and, $353,338.52 to Blue Shield of California. An additional $1,907,975.53 will be provided to the SCEET.  In addition to the payments of restitution, proceeds from the liquidation of the Bradleys’ assets have been used to satisfy the $39.5 million forfeiture judgment and approximately $15 million of the fines imposed.
United States Attorney Edward Tarver stated, “Restitution payments made this week to the victims of the Bradley case represent the largest payment of restitution in the history of the Southern District of Georgia.  This is the culmination of an enormous effort by agents and prosecutors to put an end to a corrupt enterprise that sold prescription drugs with fabricated pedigrees and unknown histories to hospitals, pharmacies and doctors nationwide.  No matter how complex the scheme, our mission is to investigate and prosecute criminal enterprises intent upon stealing from the taxpayers of the United States.  Let this case serve as notice to any would-be fraudster that the end of the road not only involves a lengthy prison sentence but also the return of your ill-gotten gains.”
The investigation of the Bradley case was led by FDA-OIG Special Agent Pamela Chambers and IRS-CI Special Agent Michael Palmer.  Agents with ICE Homeland Security Investigations and the Florida Medicaid Fraud Control Unit also assisted with the investigation.   Assistant United States Attorneys James D. Durham, Jeffrey J. Buerstatte, Frederick W. Kramer III, Joseph D. Newman and R. Brian Tanner prosecuted the case on behalf of the United States.

The Office prosecutes cases involving violations of federal laws, and represents the interests of the United States government and its agencies in criminal and civil matters. The Office investigates and prosecutes a broad array of criminal conduct of every conceivable magnitude, even when the conduct arises in distant places. Today, the Office is at the forefront of many important areas of criminal law enforcement, including terrorism, white collar and cyber crime, mortgage fraud, public corruption, gang violence, organized crime, international narcotics trafficking and civil rights violations. Similarly, the Office litigates among the most complex and significant civil cases the Department of Justice handles - from large affirmative civil fraud cases to cases in the environmental, health care, immigration and bankruptcy areas, as well as cases implicating classified information.
The Southern District of Georgia is home to HAAF, Fort Stewart, Fort Gordon, Kings Bay Naval submarine base. We are headquartered in Savannah, have a fully staffed branch office in Augusta, and have four unstaffed branches in Waycross, Brunswick, Statesboro and Dublin, Georgia.

HISTORY. Bradley Corporation celebrated its 90th Anniversary in 2011. This milestone was possible due to many years of innovation, superior sales rep force, commitment to customers needs, and the company’s vision for continued success.
In 1917, Harry Bradley (founder of Allen Bradley Corporation), sought a way to reduce the floor space required for a bank of sinks, and help workers wash their hands quicker so as not to waste all their break time standing in lines.
By 1918, "washfountain" prototypes were created which allowed multiple users to wash up quickly. The idea was so successful, Harry Bradley patented the concept in 1919.
When word spread of the revolutionary product, Bradley decided to sell the patent in order to concentrate on his own business. In 1921, The Bradley Washfountain Company opened for business with Gustav Grossenbach, Louis Schlesinger, and Howard A. Mullett as founding partners.
Today, Bradley sells more washfountains, showers and accessories each year than the company sold in all its first 50 years combined. The product offering has also expanded to include the first all-in-one touchless handwashing fixture, the first molded natural quartz material wash basin, Keltech tankless water heaters and stainless steel ablution panels for religious cleansing throughout the world. Innovative new products and processes are introduced every year to offer better solutions to the market and create a truly exceptional customer experience.
Bradley has the product you need for any application and helps you get it right, the first time.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
