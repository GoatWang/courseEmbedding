History[edit]
Tricon Global Restaurants[edit]
Yum! was created on May 30, 1997, as Tricon Global Restaurants, Inc. from PepsiCo's fast food division as the parent corporation of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell restaurant companies.[4][5] Tricon Global was spun out in late 1997. Tricon selected Louisville as its headquarters moving near the KFC Restaurant Support Center from the Pepsi HQ in Purchase, New York, by early 1998.[5]
In 2000, Tricon Global agreed to test multi-branded locations with Yorkshire Global Restaurants. By March 2002, the Tricon-Yorkshire multibranding test consisted of 83 KFC/A&Ws, six KFC/Long John Silver's and three Taco Bell/Long John Silver's and was considered successful by the companies.[6]
In 2001, KFC started test restaurants in Austin, Texas, called "Wing Works", which is a chicken wing line sold with one of a few flavored sauces. Also, KFC hired a consultant to develop a breakfast menu.[7]
Yum! Brands[edit]
In March 2002, Tricon announced the acquisition of Lexington, Kentucky-based Yorkshire Global Restaurants, owner of the Long John Silver's and A&W Restaurants[8] chains and its intention to change the company's name to Yum! Brands, Inc. On May 16, 2002, the name change became effective after a vote during the company's annual shareholders meeting, and on June 17, 2002, Yum! executed a two-for-one stock split. Shortly afterwards, due to Yum!'s lifetime contract with Pepsi, Long John Silver's and A&W Restaurants (both of which previously served Coca-Cola products) began gradually switching to Pepsi products, with A&W Restaurants retaining A&W Root Beer from a separate deal with Dr Pepper/Seven Up (now Dr Pepper Snapple Group).
In 2002, Yum! began testing co-branding locations pairing Pizza Hut with Pasta Bravo, Back Yard Burgers and A&W.[9] The Pasta Bravo concept was acquired in 2003 from Pasta Bravo, Inc. of Aliso Viejo, California for $5 million to pair with Pizza Hut.[10]
In 2003, Yum! launched WingStreet as a hybrid combo unit with an existing Pizza Hut franchise.[11] In 2007 and 2008, a thousand WingStreet stores a year were opened. On October 19, 2009, Company president Scott Bergren publicize WingStreet's national launch.[11]
An East Dawning test cafeteria-style restaurant was opened in Shanghai in 2004. After initially failing, Yum! Brands chose the KFC business model (KFC is the most successful Western chain in China) and found greater success.[12] As of September 30, 2007, eight East Dawning restaurants were in operation.[13]
International focus[edit]




A single Yum! restaurant facility co-branded as Taco Bell and KFC in San Francisco, California






Another cobranded KFC and Taco Bell in Oscoda, Michigan


In January 2011, Yum! announced its intentions to divest itself of its Long John Silver's and A&W brands to focus on its core brands of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. For the decade leading up to the company's announcement, major growth had relied on international expansion. With little presence outside North America, the two chains no longer fit in the company's long-term growth plans.[14] The foreign expansion—particularly that of Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza Hut—was cited in the firm's January 18, 2011, announcement of its intention to sell the A&W and Long John Silver's chains. Both of those chains also suffered from poor sales, and had fewer locations compared to the other chains in the Yum! Brands portfolio. In September 2011, Yum! announced they had found buyers for the A&W and LJS chains. A Great American Brand will buy A&W, and LJS will be acquired by LJS Partners LLC.[8]
In May 2011, Yum! agreed to purchase Chinese hot pot chain Little Sheep for HK$4.56 billion.[15] The deal spent more than 4 months in anti-trust review by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce, to determine whether or not the transaction would result in a monopolistic positioning of Yum! in the country's restaurant industry. The Ministry approved the deal in November 2011, according to Little Sheep representatives.[16]
In 2012, a KFC opened in Ramallah and became the first American fast food restaurant to operate in the West Bank; a Pizza Hut is also planned.[17]
In 2013, a few KFC locations in China supplied chicken found to contain "excess levels of chemical residue". Yum! has lost 6% of sales from publicity in China as of January 25.[18]
The company opened its first restaurant in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, in May 2013. For Mongolia, KFC is the first western fast food to open its doors in the country. The company is planning to open 15 more restaurants in Ulaanbaatar in the next 5 years, including the country's first drive-thru service.[19] Yum! Brands has also opened Taco Bell and Pizza Hut restaurants in newer Target stores.
Yum! Brands opened its 40,000th store in Calangute, Goa, India in October 2013.[20]
In 2013, its KFC subsidiary opened a fast casual version, KFC eleven, test location in Louisville on Bardstown Road.[21] In the third quarter of 2013, Yum! Brands had to book an impairment of the goodwill resulting from the takeover of Little Sheep in 2011 in the amount of $222 million, which reduced profits for 2013.[22]
In 2014, Yum! launched a number of additional restaurant test concepts, Super Chix, U.S. Taco Co. and Banh Shop.[23] Yum! opened Super Chix in Central Arlington, Texas that is similar in format to Chick-fil-A on April 9, 2014.[24] In the summer of 2014, Yum!'s Taco Bell subsidiary launched its U.S. Taco Co and Urban Tap Room fast-casual taco concept restaurant in Huntington Beach, California, to take on fast casual restaurants like Chipotle and Panera.[25]
In the first quarter of 2015, Third Point Management and Corvex Management separately acquired an unspecified stake in the company.[26] The sole KFC Eleven was closed in April 2015.[21] A second Chix unit opened in May 2015 with additional menu items. Super Chix was sold to founder Nick Ouimet and an investment group in August 2015.[23]
In 2017, Yum! announced plans to open 10 Pizza Hut restaurants in Ethiopia, after signing a franchise with the country's Belayab Foods and Franchise PLC.[27]
Corporate[edit]




The KFC Yum! Center, Louisville's largest arena


The current executive chairman of Yum! Brands is Greg Creed. The previous CEO was David C. Novak.[28] Novak became CEO of predecessor firm Tricon Global on January 1, 2000, and chairman of the board on January 1, 2001.[29] Greg Creed replaced Novak in his role as CEO on January 1, 2015.[30] At the AGM in May 2016, Robert D. Walter became non-executive chairman.
On October 20, 2015, Yum! Brands, Inc., announced that it intended to separate into two independent, publicly traded companies.[31] Yum China was spun off on November 1, 2016.[32]
Since 2006, Yum! Brands has served as the corporate sponsor of the Kentucky Derby.[33]

History[edit]
Tricon Global Restaurants[edit]
Yum! was created on May 30, 1997, as Tricon Global Restaurants, Inc. from PepsiCo's fast food division as the parent corporation of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell restaurant companies.[4][5] Tricon Global was spun out in late 1997. Tricon selected Louisville as its headquarters moving near the KFC Restaurant Support Center from the Pepsi HQ in Purchase, New York, by early 1998.[5]
In 2000, Tricon Global agreed to test multi-branded locations with Yorkshire Global Restaurants. By March 2002, the Tricon-Yorkshire multibranding test consisted of 83 KFC/A&Ws, six KFC/Long John Silver's and three Taco Bell/Long John Silver's and was considered successful by the companies.[6]
In 2001, KFC started test restaurants in Austin, Texas, called "Wing Works", which is a chicken wing line sold with one of a few flavored sauces. Also, KFC hired a consultant to develop a breakfast menu.[7]
Yum! Brands[edit]
In March 2002, Tricon announced the acquisition of Lexington, Kentucky-based Yorkshire Global Restaurants, owner of the Long John Silver's and A&W Restaurants[8] chains and its intention to change the company's name to Yum! Brands, Inc. On May 16, 2002, the name change became effective after a vote during the company's annual shareholders meeting, and on June 17, 2002, Yum! executed a two-for-one stock split. Shortly afterwards, due to Yum!'s lifetime contract with Pepsi, Long John Silver's and A&W Restaurants (both of which previously served Coca-Cola products) began gradually switching to Pepsi products, with A&W Restaurants retaining A&W Root Beer from a separate deal with Dr Pepper/Seven Up (now Dr Pepper Snapple Group).
In 2002, Yum! began testing co-branding locations pairing Pizza Hut with Pasta Bravo, Back Yard Burgers and A&W.[9] The Pasta Bravo concept was acquired in 2003 from Pasta Bravo, Inc. of Aliso Viejo, California for $5 million to pair with Pizza Hut.[10]
In 2003, Yum! launched WingStreet as a hybrid combo unit with an existing Pizza Hut franchise.[11] In 2007 and 2008, a thousand WingStreet stores a year were opened. On October 19, 2009, Company president Scott Bergren publicize WingStreet's national launch.[11]
An East Dawning test cafeteria-style restaurant was opened in Shanghai in 2004. After initially failing, Yum! Brands chose the KFC business model (KFC is the most successful Western chain in China) and found greater success.[12] As of September 30, 2007, eight East Dawning restaurants were in operation.[13]
International focus[edit]




A single Yum! restaurant facility co-branded as Taco Bell and KFC in San Francisco, California






Another cobranded KFC and Taco Bell in Oscoda, Michigan


In January 2011, Yum! announced its intentions to divest itself of its Long John Silver's and A&W brands to focus on its core brands of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. For the decade leading up to the company's announcement, major growth had relied on international expansion. With little presence outside North America, the two chains no longer fit in the company's long-term growth plans.[14] The foreign expansion—particularly that of Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza Hut—was cited in the firm's January 18, 2011, announcement of its intention to sell the A&W and Long John Silver's chains. Both of those chains also suffered from poor sales, and had fewer locations compared to the other chains in the Yum! Brands portfolio. In September 2011, Yum! announced they had found buyers for the A&W and LJS chains. A Great American Brand will buy A&W, and LJS will be acquired by LJS Partners LLC.[8]
In May 2011, Yum! agreed to purchase Chinese hot pot chain Little Sheep for HK$4.56 billion.[15] The deal spent more than 4 months in anti-trust review by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce, to determine whether or not the transaction would result in a monopolistic positioning of Yum! in the country's restaurant industry. The Ministry approved the deal in November 2011, according to Little Sheep representatives.[16]
In 2012, a KFC opened in Ramallah and became the first American fast food restaurant to operate in the West Bank; a Pizza Hut is also planned.[17]
In 2013, a few KFC locations in China supplied chicken found to contain "excess levels of chemical residue". Yum! has lost 6% of sales from publicity in China as of January 25.[18]
The company opened its first restaurant in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, in May 2013. For Mongolia, KFC is the first western fast food to open its doors in the country. The company is planning to open 15 more restaurants in Ulaanbaatar in the next 5 years, including the country's first drive-thru service.[19] Yum! Brands has also opened Taco Bell and Pizza Hut restaurants in newer Target stores.
Yum! Brands opened its 40,000th store in Calangute, Goa, India in October 2013.[20]
In 2013, its KFC subsidiary opened a fast casual version, KFC eleven, test location in Louisville on Bardstown Road.[21] In the third quarter of 2013, Yum! Brands had to book an impairment of the goodwill resulting from the takeover of Little Sheep in 2011 in the amount of $222 million, which reduced profits for 2013.[22]
In 2014, Yum! launched a number of additional restaurant test concepts, Super Chix, U.S. Taco Co. and Banh Shop.[23] Yum! opened Super Chix in Central Arlington, Texas that is similar in format to Chick-fil-A on April 9, 2014.[24] In the summer of 2014, Yum!'s Taco Bell subsidiary launched its U.S. Taco Co and Urban Tap Room fast-casual taco concept restaurant in Huntington Beach, California, to take on fast casual restaurants like Chipotle and Panera.[25]
In the first quarter of 2015, Third Point Management and Corvex Management separately acquired an unspecified stake in the company.[26] The sole KFC Eleven was closed in April 2015.[21] A second Chix unit opened in May 2015 with additional menu items. Super Chix was sold to founder Nick Ouimet and an investment group in August 2015.[23]
In 2017, Yum! announced plans to open 10 Pizza Hut restaurants in Ethiopia, after signing a franchise with the country's Belayab Foods and Franchise PLC.[27]

History[edit]
Tricon Global Restaurants[edit]
Yum! was created on May 30, 1997, as Tricon Global Restaurants, Inc. from PepsiCo's fast food division as the parent corporation of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell restaurant companies.[4][5] Tricon Global was spun out in late 1997. Tricon selected Louisville as its headquarters moving near the KFC Restaurant Support Center from the Pepsi HQ in Purchase, New York, by early 1998.[5]
In 2000, Tricon Global agreed to test multi-branded locations with Yorkshire Global Restaurants. By March 2002, the Tricon-Yorkshire multibranding test consisted of 83 KFC/A&Ws, six KFC/Long John Silver's and three Taco Bell/Long John Silver's and was considered successful by the companies.[6]
In 2001, KFC started test restaurants in Austin, Texas, called "Wing Works", which is a chicken wing line sold with one of a few flavored sauces. Also, KFC hired a consultant to develop a breakfast menu.[7]
Yum! Brands[edit]
In March 2002, Tricon announced the acquisition of Lexington, Kentucky-based Yorkshire Global Restaurants, owner of the Long John Silver's and A&W Restaurants[8] chains and its intention to change the company's name to Yum! Brands, Inc. On May 16, 2002, the name change became effective after a vote during the company's annual shareholders meeting, and on June 17, 2002, Yum! executed a two-for-one stock split. Shortly afterwards, due to Yum!'s lifetime contract with Pepsi, Long John Silver's and A&W Restaurants (both of which previously served Coca-Cola products) began gradually switching to Pepsi products, with A&W Restaurants retaining A&W Root Beer from a separate deal with Dr Pepper/Seven Up (now Dr Pepper Snapple Group).
In 2002, Yum! began testing co-branding locations pairing Pizza Hut with Pasta Bravo, Back Yard Burgers and A&W.[9] The Pasta Bravo concept was acquired in 2003 from Pasta Bravo, Inc. of Aliso Viejo, California for $5 million to pair with Pizza Hut.[10]
In 2003, Yum! launched WingStreet as a hybrid combo unit with an existing Pizza Hut franchise.[11] In 2007 and 2008, a thousand WingStreet stores a year were opened. On October 19, 2009, Company president Scott Bergren publicize WingStreet's national launch.[11]
An East Dawning test cafeteria-style restaurant was opened in Shanghai in 2004. After initially failing, Yum! Brands chose the KFC business model (KFC is the most successful Western chain in China) and found greater success.[12] As of September 30, 2007, eight East Dawning restaurants were in operation.[13]
International focus[edit]




A single Yum! restaurant facility co-branded as Taco Bell and KFC in San Francisco, California






Another cobranded KFC and Taco Bell in Oscoda, Michigan


In January 2011, Yum! announced its intentions to divest itself of its Long John Silver's and A&W brands to focus on its core brands of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. For the decade leading up to the company's announcement, major growth had relied on international expansion. With little presence outside North America, the two chains no longer fit in the company's long-term growth plans.[14] The foreign expansion—particularly that of Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza Hut—was cited in the firm's January 18, 2011, announcement of its intention to sell the A&W and Long John Silver's chains. Both of those chains also suffered from poor sales, and had fewer locations compared to the other chains in the Yum! Brands portfolio. In September 2011, Yum! announced they had found buyers for the A&W and LJS chains. A Great American Brand will buy A&W, and LJS will be acquired by LJS Partners LLC.[8]
In May 2011, Yum! agreed to purchase Chinese hot pot chain Little Sheep for HK$4.56 billion.[15] The deal spent more than 4 months in anti-trust review by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce, to determine whether or not the transaction would result in a monopolistic positioning of Yum! in the country's restaurant industry. The Ministry approved the deal in November 2011, according to Little Sheep representatives.[16]
In 2012, a KFC opened in Ramallah and became the first American fast food restaurant to operate in the West Bank; a Pizza Hut is also planned.[17]
In 2013, a few KFC locations in China supplied chicken found to contain "excess levels of chemical residue". Yum! has lost 6% of sales from publicity in China as of January 25.[18]
The company opened its first restaurant in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, in May 2013. For Mongolia, KFC is the first western fast food to open its doors in the country. The company is planning to open 15 more restaurants in Ulaanbaatar in the next 5 years, including the country's first drive-thru service.[19] Yum! Brands has also opened Taco Bell and Pizza Hut restaurants in newer Target stores.
Yum! Brands opened its 40,000th store in Calangute, Goa, India in October 2013.[20]
In 2013, its KFC subsidiary opened a fast casual version, KFC eleven, test location in Louisville on Bardstown Road.[21] In the third quarter of 2013, Yum! Brands had to book an impairment of the goodwill resulting from the takeover of Little Sheep in 2011 in the amount of $222 million, which reduced profits for 2013.[22]
In 2014, Yum! launched a number of additional restaurant test concepts, Super Chix, U.S. Taco Co. and Banh Shop.[23] Yum! opened Super Chix in Central Arlington, Texas that is similar in format to Chick-fil-A on April 9, 2014.[24] In the summer of 2014, Yum!'s Taco Bell subsidiary launched its U.S. Taco Co and Urban Tap Room fast-casual taco concept restaurant in Huntington Beach, California, to take on fast casual restaurants like Chipotle and Panera.[25]
In the first quarter of 2015, Third Point Management and Corvex Management separately acquired an unspecified stake in the company.[26] The sole KFC Eleven was closed in April 2015.[21] A second Chix unit opened in May 2015 with additional menu items. Super Chix was sold to founder Nick Ouimet and an investment group in August 2015.[23]
In 2017, Yum! announced plans to open 10 Pizza Hut restaurants in Ethiopia, after signing a franchise with the country's Belayab Foods and Franchise PLC.[27]
Corporate[edit]




The KFC Yum! Center, Louisville's largest arena


The current executive chairman of Yum! Brands is Greg Creed. The previous CEO was David C. Novak.[28] Novak became CEO of predecessor firm Tricon Global on January 1, 2000, and chairman of the board on January 1, 2001.[29] Greg Creed replaced Novak in his role as CEO on January 1, 2015.[30] At the AGM in May 2016, Robert D. Walter became non-executive chairman.
On October 20, 2015, Yum! Brands, Inc., announced that it intended to separate into two independent, publicly traded companies.[31] Yum China was spun off on November 1, 2016.[32]
Since 2006, Yum! Brands has served as the corporate sponsor of the Kentucky Derby.[33]

A Fortune 500 corporation, Yum! operates the brands Taco Bell, KFC, Pizza Hut, and WingStreet worldwide, except in China, where the brands are operated by a separate company, Yum China. Prior to 2011, Yum! owned Long John Silver's and A&W Restaurants.
Based in Louisville, Kentucky, it is one of the world's largest fast food restaurant companies in terms of system units—with 43,617 restaurants (including 2,859 that are company-owned and 40,758 that are franchised) around the world in over 135 countries and territories.[3]

History[edit]
Tricon Global Restaurants[edit]
Yum! was created on May 30, 1997, as Tricon Global Restaurants, Inc. from PepsiCo's fast food division as the parent corporation of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell restaurant companies.[4][5] Tricon Global was spun out in late 1997. Tricon selected Louisville as its headquarters moving near the KFC Restaurant Support Center from the Pepsi HQ in Purchase, New York, by early 1998.[5]
In 2000, Tricon Global agreed to test multi-branded locations with Yorkshire Global Restaurants. By March 2002, the Tricon-Yorkshire multibranding test consisted of 83 KFC/A&Ws, six KFC/Long John Silver's and three Taco Bell/Long John Silver's and was considered successful by the companies.[6]
In 2001, KFC started test restaurants in Austin, Texas, called "Wing Works", which is a chicken wing line sold with one of a few flavored sauces. Also, KFC hired a consultant to develop a breakfast menu.[7]
Yum! Brands[edit]
In March 2002, Tricon announced the acquisition of Lexington, Kentucky-based Yorkshire Global Restaurants, owner of the Long John Silver's and A&W Restaurants[8] chains and its intention to change the company's name to Yum! Brands, Inc. On May 16, 2002, the name change became effective after a vote during the company's annual shareholders meeting, and on June 17, 2002, Yum! executed a two-for-one stock split. Shortly afterwards, due to Yum!'s lifetime contract with Pepsi, Long John Silver's and A&W Restaurants (both of which previously served Coca-Cola products) began gradually switching to Pepsi products, with A&W Restaurants retaining A&W Root Beer from a separate deal with Dr Pepper/Seven Up (now Dr Pepper Snapple Group).
In 2002, Yum! began testing co-branding locations pairing Pizza Hut with Pasta Bravo, Back Yard Burgers and A&W.[9] The Pasta Bravo concept was acquired in 2003 from Pasta Bravo, Inc. of Aliso Viejo, California for $5 million to pair with Pizza Hut.[10]
In 2003, Yum! launched WingStreet as a hybrid combo unit with an existing Pizza Hut franchise.[11] In 2007 and 2008, a thousand WingStreet stores a year were opened. On October 19, 2009, Company president Scott Bergren publicize WingStreet's national launch.[11]
An East Dawning test cafeteria-style restaurant was opened in Shanghai in 2004. After initially failing, Yum! Brands chose the KFC business model (KFC is the most successful Western chain in China) and found greater success.[12] As of September 30, 2007, eight East Dawning restaurants were in operation.[13]
International focus[edit]




A single Yum! restaurant facility co-branded as Taco Bell and KFC in San Francisco, California






Another cobranded KFC and Taco Bell in Oscoda, Michigan


In January 2011, Yum! announced its intentions to divest itself of its Long John Silver's and A&W brands to focus on its core brands of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. For the decade leading up to the company's announcement, major growth had relied on international expansion. With little presence outside North America, the two chains no longer fit in the company's long-term growth plans.[14] The foreign expansion—particularly that of Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza Hut—was cited in the firm's January 18, 2011, announcement of its intention to sell the A&W and Long John Silver's chains. Both of those chains also suffered from poor sales, and had fewer locations compared to the other chains in the Yum! Brands portfolio. In September 2011, Yum! announced they had found buyers for the A&W and LJS chains. A Great American Brand will buy A&W, and LJS will be acquired by LJS Partners LLC.[8]
In May 2011, Yum! agreed to purchase Chinese hot pot chain Little Sheep for HK$4.56 billion.[15] The deal spent more than 4 months in anti-trust review by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce, to determine whether or not the transaction would result in a monopolistic positioning of Yum! in the country's restaurant industry. The Ministry approved the deal in November 2011, according to Little Sheep representatives.[16]
In 2012, a KFC opened in Ramallah and became the first American fast food restaurant to operate in the West Bank; a Pizza Hut is also planned.[17]
In 2013, a few KFC locations in China supplied chicken found to contain "excess levels of chemical residue". Yum! has lost 6% of sales from publicity in China as of January 25.[18]
The company opened its first restaurant in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, in May 2013. For Mongolia, KFC is the first western fast food to open its doors in the country. The company is planning to open 15 more restaurants in Ulaanbaatar in the next 5 years, including the country's first drive-thru service.[19] Yum! Brands has also opened Taco Bell and Pizza Hut restaurants in newer Target stores.
Yum! Brands opened its 40,000th store in Calangute, Goa, India in October 2013.[20]
In 2013, its KFC subsidiary opened a fast casual version, KFC eleven, test location in Louisville on Bardstown Road.[21] In the third quarter of 2013, Yum! Brands had to book an impairment of the goodwill resulting from the takeover of Little Sheep in 2011 in the amount of $222 million, which reduced profits for 2013.[22]
In 2014, Yum! launched a number of additional restaurant test concepts, Super Chix, U.S. Taco Co. and Banh Shop.[23] Yum! opened Super Chix in Central Arlington, Texas that is similar in format to Chick-fil-A on April 9, 2014.[24] In the summer of 2014, Yum!'s Taco Bell subsidiary launched its U.S. Taco Co and Urban Tap Room fast-casual taco concept restaurant in Huntington Beach, California, to take on fast casual restaurants like Chipotle and Panera.[25]
In the first quarter of 2015, Third Point Management and Corvex Management separately acquired an unspecified stake in the company.[26] The sole KFC Eleven was closed in April 2015.[21] A second Chix unit opened in May 2015 with additional menu items. Super Chix was sold to founder Nick Ouimet and an investment group in August 2015.[23]
In 2017, Yum! announced plans to open 10 Pizza Hut restaurants in Ethiopia, after signing a franchise with the country's Belayab Foods and Franchise PLC.[27]
Corporate[edit]




The KFC Yum! Center, Louisville's largest arena


The current executive chairman of Yum! Brands is Greg Creed. The previous CEO was David C. Novak.[28] Novak became CEO of predecessor firm Tricon Global on January 1, 2000, and chairman of the board on January 1, 2001.[29] Greg Creed replaced Novak in his role as CEO on January 1, 2015.[30] At the AGM in May 2016, Robert D. Walter became non-executive chairman.
On October 20, 2015, Yum! Brands, Inc., announced that it intended to separate into two independent, publicly traded companies.[31] Yum China was spun off on November 1, 2016.[32]
Since 2006, Yum! Brands has served as the corporate sponsor of the Kentucky Derby.[33]

Yum China








As of November 1, 2016, Yum China Holdings, Inc. became a licensee of Yum! Brands in Mainland China. Yum China has exclusive rights to KFC, China’s leading quick-service restaurant concept, Pizza Hut, the leading casual dining brand, and Taco Bell, which is expanding globally but is not yet in China. It also owns the Little Sheep and East Dawning concepts. Yum China has more than 7,300 restaurants and more than 400,000 employees in over 1,100 cities, and generated over $8 billion in system sales in 2015. The standalone company, Yum China, began trading “regular way” on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “YUMC” on November 1, 2016.

KFC® was the first quick-service restaurant chain to enter China in 1987. Today, KFC is the number one Western QSR brand in China with more than 5,000 restaurants in over 1,100 cities. In terms of number of restaurants, we have a two-to-one lead over our nearest competitor and we’re growing in both large and small cities. In addition to Original Recipe, KFC in China has an extensive menu featuring beef, seafood, rice dishes, fresh vegetables, soups, breakfast, desserts, and many other delicious products. We’re also leveraging our restaurants throughout the day with breakfast, delivery and 24-hour operations.
Pizza Hut® was the first restaurant chain to introduce pizza and Western-style casual dining to China in 1990. Today, Pizza Hut Casual Dining is the number one Western casual dining brand in China in over 400 cities and over 1,600 restaurants. Pizza Hut Casual Dining has an extensive menu offering a broad variety of pizzas, entrees, pasta, rice dishes, appetizers, beverages and desserts. In addition, Yum! introduced pizza delivery to China in 2001 and there are more than 300 Pizza Hut Home Service units in almost 50 cities.
The growth of our category-leading brands in China is driven by an experienced local management team, a highly educated workforce, an unmatched real estate and development team, a country-wide distribution system, best-in-class operations and dedication to innovation and product quality.

Yum China shares downgraded to neutral at Goldman after sharp price gains
Goldman Sachs downgraded Yum China Holdings stock  on Friday, and said it sees limited upside as the stock has gained 22% since the company reported earnings on April 6. The S&P 500  has gained just 2% in the same period, the bank wrote in a note. Analyst Michelle Cheng said she is still positive on margins, but the market is pricing in a roughly 2% rise in same-store sales growth in 2017, while Goldman is expecting growth of just 1%. "Our sensitivity analysis also suggests a 2 percentage point increase in 2018 same-store sales growth vs. Goldman Sachs estimate would result in an implied value that is only about 5% higher than the current share price," Cheng wrote. "As such, we downgrade the stock to Neutral from Buy, with an unchanged target price, and await a better re-entry point." Yum China shares have gained 32% in 2017, while the S&P 500 has gained 6.7%.

Shares of Yum China drop following second-quarter results 
Shares of Yum China Holdings Inc.  fell in Wednesday's extended session after the fast-food chain posted in-line earnings but flat revenue growth. The operator of KFC and Pizza Hut in China reported its second-quarter earnings rose to $107 million, or 27 cents a share, from $77 million, or 21 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue, however, remained at $1.59 billion while same-stores sales grew 3%. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had forecast earnings of 27 cents on revenue of $1.6 billion. Yum China had spun off from Yum Brands  late last year. Yum China shares slid 5%  while Yum edged down 0.3% after hours.

Yum China shares downgraded to neutral at Goldman after sharp price gains
Goldman Sachs downgraded Yum China Holdings stock  on Friday, and said it sees limited upside as the stock has gained 22% since the company reported earnings on April 6. The S&P 500  has gained just 2% in the same period, the bank wrote in a note. Analyst Michelle Cheng said she is still positive on margins, but the market is pricing in a roughly 2% rise in same-store sales growth in 2017, while Goldman is expecting growth of just 1%. "Our sensitivity analysis also suggests a 2 percentage point increase in 2018 same-store sales growth vs. Goldman Sachs estimate would result in an implied value that is only about 5% higher than the current share price," Cheng wrote. "As such, we downgrade the stock to Neutral from Buy, with an unchanged target price, and await a better re-entry point." Yum China shares have gained 32% in 2017, while the S&P 500 has gained 6.7%.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.
