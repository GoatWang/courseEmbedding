VIDA Diagnostics, Inc. announced an expanded collaboration with Olympus Respiratory America at the 2016 American Thoracic Society Meeting. Under the agreement, VIDA and Olympus will incorporate precision informatics into current and future diagnostic and therapeutic procedural workflows to manage patients with pulmonary diseases. The collaboration covers North America and Europe and will include marketing and development programs in interventional pulmonology, tightly integrating imaging informatics software and services to drive diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.


Vida Diagnostics, Inc. Releases VIDA|vision™
May 15 16
VIDA Diagnostics, Inc. announced the release of VIDA|vision™, a suite of clinical software applications built specifically for the pulmonary clinician.  VIDA|vision is launching with two applications: Lung Bronchoscopy Planning and Lung Volume Reduction.  The base platform enables new applications and expanding clinical utility. Lung Bronchoscopy Planning focuses interventional pulmonologists on planning and performing diagnostic biopsy procedures for the peripheral nodule.  The automated path planning and virtual bronchoscopy features of the software help interventional pulmonologists gain procedural confidence and efficiency in reaching targets of interest. Lung Volume Reduction provides physicians with information to select an appropriate therapy for severe emphysema patients, using evidence-based quantitative CT (QCT) biomarkers to include heterogeneity and fissure integrity.  Once a treatment is selected, the product also provides procedural planning tools to boost procedural confidence and efficiency.

VIDA Wins Product of Outstanding Interest Award for Precision Pulmonary Imaging Solution
Amsterdam, Netherlands (Sept 30, 2015) — VIDA Diagnostics, Inc. (“VIDA”), the leader in precision pulmonary imaging, today announced it has received the European Respiratory Society’s Product of Outstanding Interest (POINT) award.  The honor recognizes innovation in the area of respiratory healthcare, with a focus on solutions solving clinical care challenges.
“We are delighted and honored to receive the POINT award here at ERS,” said Susan A. Wood, Ph.D, President and CEO of VIDA. “We thank the ERS for recognizing and supporting our mission of improving patient outcomes through precision imaging.”
VIDA’s solution transforms raw imaging data into concise, quantified measures that inform highly personalized care decisions.  For example, VIDA’s Lung Volume Reduction (LVR) workflow provides individual metrics for fissure integrity, disease severity by lobe, and disease heterogeneity, all of which are critical input in selecting and planning therapy.  VIDA is demonstrating this workflow and others at ERS, with its next-generation viewing platform, VIDA|vision™.
“VIDA’s solution captures the personalized medicine theme of ERS,” said Felix Herth, MD, Ph.D, Chairman, Department of Pneumology and Critical Care Medicine at ThoraxKlinik, University of Heidelberg. “An informed decision process is increasingly necessary as pulmonary diagnoses and therapeutics become more personalized.  VIDA takes into account the uniqueness of the patient and helps us plan a unique care path to match.”
About VIDA
VIDA is a leader in precision pulmonary imaging to aid early detection, evaluation, and treatment planning of lung diseases including COPD, emphysema, lung cancer, and asthma. FDA approved, CE, CMDCAS and TGA certified, VIDA’s software and services are routinely used in clinical practice, along with academic, device, and pharmaceutical clinical trials.  VIDA’s offices are located in Coralville, IA and Minneapolis, MN. For more, contact Marcel Nienhuis, Director of Marketing (info@vidadiagnostics.com).

Partners

Our HistoryVIDA’s founders envisioned that patients with, or at risk of, lung disease would be managed via imaging with multi-disciplinary
expertise. Our founding team represented this cross-functional philosophy: Eric Hoffman, PhD, representing physiology & radiology; Milan Sonka, PhD representing electrical engineering; Joe Reinhardt, PhD representing biomedical engineering, and Geoffrey McLellan, MD, PhD, representing interventional pulmonology.  These University of Iowa colleagues co-founded VIDA and began to build a business focused on advanced pulmonary analysis using medical images.
