It’s been said (by Steve Jobs, no less) that good design is not just about how a thing looks but rather about how a thing works. But maybe design is also about how a thing feels.The design of Tumblr, the blogging tool and social network, is guided by feeling. In particular, the feelings of David Karp, the company’s 26-year-old founder, whose instincts tend to run counter to current Web conventions. Tumblr does not display “follower” counts, for example, or other numerical markers of popularity that are viewed as crucial social-media features, because Karp finds them “really gross.” The culture of public friend-and-follow reciprocity that theoretically expands a social networking service can, in his view, “really poison a whole community.”Possibly such a view of Internet culture could be arrived at by way of deliberate study of online group behavior. But that’s not how Tumblr was made. “David built it for himself,” John Maloney, until recently the company’s president, told me. Marco Arment, Karp’s first employee, who participated directly in the service’s creation, put it even more succinctly: “Tumblr is David.”I met Karp in Tumblr’s offices in the Flatiron district in New York. In his standard uniform of Jack Purcell sneakers, dark pants and a hoodie over a patterned shirt, Karp was polite, upbeat, inclusive and big on eye contact. Asked a question about competitors, he answered: “The last thing we want to do is compete with someone. That’s for bankers.” Karp likes to talk about Tumblr less as a business than as a “platform for creativity.” And indeed, it has been used to make more than 60 million blogs — among them a visual scrapbook kept by Michael Stipe; silly meme-blogs like Hey Girl, It’s Paul Ryan; and the clever graphic analysis that became the recent book “I Love Charts” — drawing a combined 17.5 billion page views a month.

The trick is making page views equal money. “Pretty much every large tech company today,” Karp said, is essentially “metrics driven.” Google, Twitter, Facebook: they’re obsessed with “optimizing” services, design, functionality and aesthetics through constant testing and tweaking. That ability to optimize and (not incidentally) monetize user experiences by reacting to microlevel data is the essence of Web-business magic, as it is generally understood.

Karp chose not to operate that way. Rather than monetizing clicks, he wants advertisers to view Tumblr as a place to promote particularly creative campaigns to an audience whose attention is worth paying for. It’s an approach that may or may not guide Tumblr into the black. But Karp isn’t worried. His nice-young-man aspect makes it easy to miss the brashness of what he is saying: he isn’t interested in competing, but not because he doesn’t like competition. He just feels that he sees something everyone else has missed.Trying to blog at first made David Karp feel bad: that big, empty text box seemed to demand a lot of carefully constructed words, an intimidating sight for a nonwriter. The first iteration of Tumblr was a tool for “tumblelogging” (a short-form variation on blogging) designed to make it easier and less off-putting. It was released in 2007, and Tech Crunch promptly praised its simplicity: “There is absolutely no learning curve.”Like any blogging tool, Tumblr allows users to design a site from a behind-the-scenes “dashboard,” where you type a post or upload a photo, and choose a visual “theme.” Tumblr’s dashboard incorporates some familiar elements of social Web services: in addition to making your own posts, you can “follow” or appreciate those of other Tumblr users. You can repost images and other content onto your own blog easily, and this helped Tumblr develop a reputation as a more visually oriented, multimedia version of Twitter.

In the beginning, most traffic came to Tumblr from without; but now more than 70 percent of the traffic on Tumblr occurs in the dashboard zone, where users read, react to and repurpose one another’s posts. The upshot is “the mullet theory of social software design,” summarizes Chris Muscarella, a tech-entrepreneur friend of Karp’s. “It’s all business in the front: you have your blog that looks like any other blog, although usually prettier. And then the real party is in the back, through the social interaction on the dashboard.”The features Tumblr eliminates are as important to the way it feels as those it adopts. Bijan Sabet of Spark Capital, an early Tumblr investor who sits on its board, says that it is “normal behavior” for a founder to be excited about adding new bells and whistles, but Karp seems excited about doing the opposite: “He’ll tell us, ‘Hey, got a new version coming up — and I took four features out!’ ”Karp’s thinking about the comments section, which is generally assumed to be a core blog feature, helps illustrate his broader ideas about how design shapes behavior online. Typically, a YouTube video or blog post or article on a newspaper’s site is the dominant object, with comments strewed below it, buried like so much garbage. Thus many commenters feel they must scream to be noticed, and do so in all caps, profanely and with maximum hyperbole. This, Karp argues, brings out the worst in people, so Tumblr’s design does not include a comments section.How, then, to encourage feedback while discouraging drive-by hecklers who make you never want to post again? First, Karp notes, you can comment on someone else’s post, by reblogging it and adding your reaction. But that reaction appears on your Tumblr, not the one you’re commenting on. “So if you’re going to be a jerk, you’re looking like a jerk in your own space, and my space is still pristine,” Karp explains. This makes for a thoughtful network and encourages expression and, ultimately, creativity. “That’s how you can design to make a community more positive.”

Another example: when users wanted a private message system, Tumblr’s answer involved clicking on the words “Send Fan Mail” — a prompt to encourage positivity. “We don’t want to allow you to have your feelings hurt on Tumblr,” Zack Sultan, a Tumblr designer, says.Karp is even more expansive in his claims for the emotional goals for Tumblr’s design. To express approval without reblogging, users click a heart icon. It’s easy and upbeat, and replaces the “garbage little OMGs and LOLs” in a traditional comment section with “much more orderly little hearts,” he says. (This feature on Tumblr slightly predates “liking” on Facebook, and a semiotics thesis could be written on the communicative implications of the thumbs up vs. the heart.)When he explains Tumblr, Karp breaks its users into three groups. The first is, he concedes, the smallest, but it’s the one he emphasizes the most: the “creators,” who post their own photographs, original writing and so on. Then there are the “curators,” who cull, heart and reblog the best of this material for the benefit of the biggest group, the “consumers.” In reality, a lot of what is curated and consumed on Tumblr originated elsewhere, but at least some of it was made on the platform. This, Karp argues, makes Tumblr distinct from, say, Pinterest, the lately hot service that is associated with gathering and highlighting material from around the Web. (Not that Karp sees Pinterest as competition. He says that a lot of what’s on Pinterest comes from Tumblr and helps drive his traffic.) More to the point, Karp asserts that Tumblr was built for creative people to create things, and for those more interested in sharing or discovering. It’s a system built for positive reinforcement: “Everybody loves everybody,” he concludes, “through the chain.”Karp is the kind of New Yorker who is so conditioned to the orderly street grid of the Upper West Side of Manhattan, where he grew up, that he finds the West Village a little disorienting. His mother teaches science at the progressive Calhoun School, and his father is a composer for television and film. (They separated when Karp was 17.) He has a younger brother, Kevin, who studies literature at SUNY Stony Brook. As a kid, Karp was interested in technology, but until the end of the summer after his freshman year at Bronx Science, one of the city’s more prestigious public schools, nothing really distinguished his experience.The change began with an act of empathy. Karp was fooling around on his computer one day when his mother came into his room and asked how he was feeling about going back to school. Actually she knew the answer, and he knew that she knew. He hadn’t been particularly engaged with his classes, his teachers or his fellow students, but he couldn’t get enough of the internship he worked at all summer. Still, he was surprised at what she said next: Perhaps he would prefer not to go back at all and instead be home-schooled and (more crucially) continue the internship.

The internship was at Frederator Studios, an animation production company partly focused on the Web and founded by Fred Seibert, a veteran of MTV and Hanna-Barbera. Seibert’s children went to Calhoun, and his wife was friendly with Karp’s mother. “He was a typical 15-year-old,” Seibert recalls. “He couldn’t quite look you in the eye.” The exception: His fluency talking to Frederator’s coders and engineers. Seibert was impressed (even though, he acknowledges: “I had no idea what they were talking about. None”). When an entrepreneur named John Maloney sought technical help with his start-up, UrbanBaby.com, a Frederator employee recommended Karp. The project had to be done in a couple of days; Karp did it in four hours. Maloney made him UrbanBaby’s head of product and gave him a bit of equity. He was 16.Karp never got around to earning a high-school diploma. CNET bought UrbanBaby, and Karp started his own company, Davidville, envisioning a mix of client work and original products. He put an ad on Craigslist seeking another engineer. “What do I do when someone actually responds to this thing?” he recalls worrying. “I have to, like, meet this person.” He persuaded Seibert to join him when he interviewed Marco Arment, the engineer who applied.Arment, just two years out of college, was slightly confused about who his boss would be, but he chose Davidville over an offer from Bloomberg. During a weeklong lull in client work, they decided to build the tumblelogging tool that Karp had dreamed up, replacing the features on the traditional blogging dashboard with six big buttons illustrated with task-specific icons (text, photo, video, link, quote and dialogue). This ancillary project took on a life of its own. Soon, Karp heard from Bijan Sabet, of Spark Capital, and after some initial resistance, decided to put aside everything else; Spark, Union Square Ventures and a small group of angel investors put up a combined $775,000, valuing Tumblr at $3 million. Karp brought in John Maloney, his ex-boss from UrbanBaby, to handle business matters while he focused on Tumblr’s design and functionality and Arment (who left in 2010 to focus on his own start-up, Instapaper) oversaw the knottier engineering challenges.

Karp was only 20 at that point, but more surprising than his age was that someone who largely skipped the standard socialization process of high school and college would turn out to have such insightful behavioral-design intuition. Karp’s friend Chris Muscarella suggests that because Karp never had that familiar experience, “he has very little notion of what it means to be a conformist” or to measure his thinking against abstract conventional wisdom.

Karp did operate in social contexts, of course. He grew up on the early Internet and fondly recalls the chat rooms and messaging and games from the period “when AOL was really in its prime.” He also learned early how to interact with adults like a peer. But he gives the most credit to his parents, as unconditional “enablers.” His father, Michael Karp, exposed him to a variety of geeky gadgetry at a young age and prodded him to pursue the Seibert internship. And I was more than a little surprised at how many people insisted that I needed to meet his mother, Barbara Ackerman.When I did meet her, Ackerman greeted me with a hug, and we walked to a pizza place in the Upper West Side neighborhood where she has lived since leaving her native California in the 1970s. Of course, she says, people have questioned why she — a teacher! — would suggest that her son opt out of high school. David seemed less social than his younger brother, always holed up with his computer, Ackerman explained, but uncommonly sure of himself. His parents could tell that he was far more engaged in his work at Seibert’s office than in school. She recalls feeling the sense of relief through her hand on her son’s shoulder when she floated the idea.Karp remembers needing “a few minutes” to wonder about what he’d miss out on in high school, before concluding: “Yeah, it sounds like a dream.”Like lots of so-called Web 2.0 companies, Tumblr is now reckoning with the very banker-ish concern of figuring out how to make money. It has tried, over the last five years, to do so by selling tools that allowed users to snazz up their blogs or promote posts. But efforts like those haven’t generated nearly enough cash to offset its expenses — let alone justify the $800 million valuation suggested by its most recent round of venture-capital investment last year.Shortly before Facebook’s initial public offering, Karp started talking about making money from advertising — which seemed to run counter to a declaration he made in 2010 that advertising “really turns our stomachs.” Then again, pretty much every social network chieftain, including Mark Zuckerberg, seems sour on ads until the moment they start making ads the center of their entire business.

Around this time, I had dinner with Karp and his girlfriend, Rachel Eakley. Karp was reflective about how his role at Tumblr was changing. He had not, he confessed ruefully, “committed code” in about six months. For years, Tumblr was made up of a handful of mostly young guys who could knock out a site redesign and head off to lunch together, a small-enough group to fit in an elevator. As with many early-stage Web start-ups, the focus was on the product and the user base, not money. “I didn’t care how the bills got paid, or about facilities or H.R. stuff,” Karp said.For a time, Karp popped up with some regularity on blogs that gossip about the social antics of young New York Internet hotshots. That ended a couple of years ago, when he started dating Eakley, who has just finished a master’s degree in psychology and is starting nursing school in the fall. They live with their dog and are remodeling a loft in Williamsburg. That said, his life is not exactly normal. He often commutes on one of his three motorcycles (one of which has a sidecar). When he talks about dealing with critics, he mentions advice he got from John Mayer, the musician, when they had an impromptu dinner at a rooftop hotel restaurant in Tokyo. When he vacationed in the Virgin Islands, he stopped by Richard Branson’s island to hang out. (They met last year, and Branson became a Tumblr investor.) Somehow he manages to pass along such anecdotes in a way that makes them relatable.I sat in on the “all team” meeting Karp recently implemented as a Friday-afternoon ritual. I agreed to keep certain details confidential, but it was clear that Karp is thinking pretty hard about profitability. Tumblr has learned to assemble some data that advertisers want (and that it had previously not bothered to collect). Notable features of the meeting included a new system for measuring the effectiveness of various departments.

After a hiring binge over the past nine months or so, Tumblr now has more than 100 employees. In May, Maloney stepped down from his role as president. He and Karp say the move was in the works for months — a combination of Karp’s increased interest in the business side, a stronger crew of experienced managers and Maloney’s lack of interest in running an established company. (Maloney remains on the board.) If Karp is worried about taking on more responsibilities, it doesn’t show. I asked him if, given Tumblr’s significant burn rate, he was perhaps a little more stressed out than he let on. “For whatever reason, I’m not,” he replied. In the past year he has become engaged with the challenge of designing not just a product but a business. It’s quite distinct from the Zen experience of solitary problem-solving that is coding, but, he continued, “I’ve really gotten a kick out of trying to make running a company as Zen an experience as it can be.”He seemed particularly enthusiastic, in fact, about advertising. That old quote about it turning his stomach was, he says, imprecise: It’s specifically Web advertising as we know it that he opposes. “The Web has mega-optimized the smallest chunk of advertising, which is direct response,” he continued. And that’s fine for, say, an online electronics retailer. But it doesn’t do much to enable the kind of creative advertising that is “intended to make you feel something for the brand.” That’s what the ad industry was built on, and it’s what people remember, he says: “Can you remember the last Twitter ad you’ve seen, the last Facebook ad?” And so, he concludes, there is a huge, untapped opportunity. Not that he’s interested in competing, you understand; he just has a feeling this is something everyone else has missed.Karp has said Tumblr could be “wildly profitable” overnight by simply incorporating conventional online ads into the platform, but he believes that would spoil the community and the creativity that have taken shape there. His proposed solution entails advertisers’ being just as creative and expressive as Tumblr users. For now, that means that a spot on the Tumblr dashboard generally used to highlight the company’s picks for the coolest stuff happening in its network will include occasional content from paid sponsors. The first participants included Adidas, Calvin Klein and the movie “Beasts of the Southern Wild,” generating more than $150,000 in revenue within a month.This strategy means a brand must use Tumblr and use it well — which, actually, lots of brands already do, free. In fact, Tumblr helped many of them do so — again, free — during the years it was more concerned with boosting its audience than with making money. Karp argues that this is a strength: “A lot of these brands showed up on Tumblr, figured out how to use the tools, created value for our community and got a response.” Now they have the option to “elevate” what they’ve created within Tumblr, by way of a sponsorship.

This scheme is not instantly convincing, given the degree to which it breezily marginalizes thinking that has built some multibillion-dollar enterprises and brought plenty of others to their knees. Online advertising’s highly specific targeting and measurable results are seen as its great advantage over traditional advertising capable of delivering the (unquantifiable) emotional payoff Karp is talking about.Karp acknowledges all this, but points out that the emphasis on feeling over data is exactly what made Tumblr popular. Sometimes, he admits, his investors push him on this subject. “But I think I can make a pretty good case for — ” uncharacteristically, he stopped and gazed at the floor. Karp is rarely at a loss for smoothly delivered words, but now he seemed to be searching for something precise. He started and stopped again and then said what it is he believes in: “Following our hearts.”

Karp began his career as an intern under Fred Seibert at the animation company Frederator Studios, where he built the studio's first blogging platform and conceived, wrote, and edited their first internet video network, Channel Frederator.[5] Karp went on to work for online parenting forum UrbanBaby until it was sold to CNET in 2006. Karp then started his own software consulting company, Davidville, where he worked with computer engineer Marco Arment on projects for clients. During a gap between contracts in 2006, the two began work on a microblogging website, which was launched as Tumblr in February 2007. As of June 1, 2017, Tumblr hosts over 349.3 million blogs.[6] In August 2009, Karp was named Best Young Tech Entrepreneur 2009 by BusinessWeek[7] and in 2010, he was named to the MIT Technology Review TR35 as one of the top 35 innovators in the world under the age of 35.[8]
On May 20, 2013, it was announced that Yahoo! and Tumblr had reached an agreement for Yahoo! to acquire Tumblr for $1.1 billion. Karp remained CEO of the company.

Early life[edit]
Born in New York City, Karp grew up on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. His parents are Barbara Ackerman, a science teacher from San Anselmo, California, and Michael D. Karp, a film and television composer.[9] He has a younger brother named Kevin.[10] His parents separated when he was 17.[10] Karp attended the Calhoun School from aged three through 8th grade, where his mother teaches science.[4] At 11, he began learning HTML and was soon designing websites for businesses.[3] Karp went on to attend Bronx Science for one year before dropping out at the age of 15 and started homeschooling.[4] At the time, Karp had aspirations of getting into a college in New York or MIT and saw homeschooling and doing other projects on the side as a way to impress the colleges.[11] Karp never returned to high school or earned his high school diploma.[10] Marco Arment, the first employee of Tumblr, would later recall that Karp was keen to avoid letting his age shape people's assumptions about him: "He wanted to keep it quiet for as long as he could because he knew that as soon as it got out, every story about Tumblr would just be about David's youth."[12]
Career[edit]




Karp in 2007


Karp began interning at age 14 for animation producer Fred Seibert, founder of Frederator Studios.[4] Karp's mother had taught Seibert's children at the Calhoun School and was friends with his wife.[10][13] Karp was fascinated with the work of Frederator's computer engineers and his visits became regular. After he started homeschooling, Karp also began taking Japanese classes at the Japan Society and saw a math tutor, with whom he worked on writing software for winning at blackjack and poker.[13] When entrepreneur John Maloney sought technical help with UrbanBaby, an online parenting forum, a Frederator employee recommended Karp for the job. Karp completed the project, which had to be done in a couple of days, within four hours. Maloney made him UrbanBaby's head of product and gave him a small amount of equity.[10] At age 17, while still working for UrbanBaby, Karp moved alone to Tokyo for five months. It was a full three months after Karp had moved to Tokyo that UrbanBaby found out he wasn't in New York.[4]


I realized that I got to spend that entire day working on this product that I absolutely loved. ... And it was this incredible, liberating, unbelievably inspiring feeling.
“
”

—Karp in an interview with Fast Company about his
first day of work dedicated solely to Tumblr[14]
Karp left UrbanBaby after it was sold to CNET in 2006.[10] Using money from the sale of his shares, Karp started his own software consultancy company, Davidville, envisioning a mix of client work and his own products.[13] Marco Arment joined the company as an engineer after replying to Karp's Craigslist ad.[10] Karp had been interested in tumblelogs (short-form blogs) for some time and was waiting for one of the established blogging platforms to introduce their own tumblelogging platform. As no one had done so after a year of waiting, Karp and Arment began working on their own tumblelogging platform during a two-week gap between contracts in 2006.[2][4][15] Tumblr was launched in February 2007[14] and within two weeks, the service had gained 75,000 users.[8]
In October 2007, Karp shut down his consultancy business as his work with Tumblr was interfering with his client work.[16] Davidville was renamed Tumblr, Inc.[17] and 25 percent of the company was sold to a small group of investors.[4]
On May 20, 2013, it was announced that Yahoo! and Tumblr had reached an agreement for Yahoo! to acquire Tumblr for $1.1 billion. Karp remained as CEO.[18][19] As of June 1, 2017, Tumblr hosts over 349.3 million blogs.[6]
Advocacy[edit]
Karp joined the Planned Parenthood Board of Directors in 2014.[20] In March 2017, Tumblr and Planned Parenthood launched an initiative calling on the tech industry to support Planned Parenthood.[21]
Karp endorsed Hillary Clinton for president in the lead-up to the 2016 United States election.[22]
Personal life[edit]
Beginning in 2011, Karp's girlfriend was Rachel Eakley, a psychology graduate and nursing student.[23][24] They lived together in Williamsburg with their pet dog, Clark.[1][25] The pair split in 2014.[26]
Karp has made personal investments into several companies including Superpedestrian, Inc. (the company behind the Copenhagen Wheel),[27] Sherpaa, Inc. (a healthcare app startup)[28] and Splash (an event marketing platform).[29]

Early life[edit]
Born in New York City, Karp grew up on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. His parents are Barbara Ackerman, a science teacher from San Anselmo, California, and Michael D. Karp, a film and television composer.[9] He has a younger brother named Kevin.[10] His parents separated when he was 17.[10] Karp attended the Calhoun School from aged three through 8th grade, where his mother teaches science.[4] At 11, he began learning HTML and was soon designing websites for businesses.[3] Karp went on to attend Bronx Science for one year before dropping out at the age of 15 and started homeschooling.[4] At the time, Karp had aspirations of getting into a college in New York or MIT and saw homeschooling and doing other projects on the side as a way to impress the colleges.[11] Karp never returned to high school or earned his high school diploma.[10] Marco Arment, the first employee of Tumblr, would later recall that Karp was keen to avoid letting his age shape people's assumptions about him: "He wanted to keep it quiet for as long as he could because he knew that as soon as it got out, every story about Tumblr would just be about David's youth."[12]
Career[edit]




Karp in 2007


Karp began interning at age 14 for animation producer Fred Seibert, founder of Frederator Studios.[4] Karp's mother had taught Seibert's children at the Calhoun School and was friends with his wife.[10][13] Karp was fascinated with the work of Frederator's computer engineers and his visits became regular. After he started homeschooling, Karp also began taking Japanese classes at the Japan Society and saw a math tutor, with whom he worked on writing software for winning at blackjack and poker.[13] When entrepreneur John Maloney sought technical help with UrbanBaby, an online parenting forum, a Frederator employee recommended Karp for the job. Karp completed the project, which had to be done in a couple of days, within four hours. Maloney made him UrbanBaby's head of product and gave him a small amount of equity.[10] At age 17, while still working for UrbanBaby, Karp moved alone to Tokyo for five months. It was a full three months after Karp had moved to Tokyo that UrbanBaby found out he wasn't in New York.[4]


I realized that I got to spend that entire day working on this product that I absolutely loved. ... And it was this incredible, liberating, unbelievably inspiring feeling.

—Karp in an interview with Fast Company about his
first day of work dedicated solely to Tumblr[14]
Karp left UrbanBaby after it was sold to CNET in 2006.[10] Using money from the sale of his shares, Karp started his own software consultancy company, Davidville, envisioning a mix of client work and his own products.[13] Marco Arment joined the company as an engineer after replying to Karp's Craigslist ad.[10] Karp had been interested in tumblelogs (short-form blogs) for some time and was waiting for one of the established blogging platforms to introduce their own tumblelogging platform. As no one had done so after a year of waiting, Karp and Arment began working on their own tumblelogging platform during a two-week gap between contracts in 2006.[2][4][15] Tumblr was launched in February 2007[14] and within two weeks, the service had gained 75,000 users.[8]
In October 2007, Karp shut down his consultancy business as his work with Tumblr was interfering with his client work.[16] Davidville was renamed Tumblr, Inc.[17] and 25 percent of the company was sold to a small group of investors.[4]
On May 20, 2013, it was announced that Yahoo! and Tumblr had reached an agreement for Yahoo! to acquire Tumblr for $1.1 billion. Karp remained as CEO.[18][19] As of June 1, 2017, Tumblr hosts over 349.3 million blogs.[6]
Advocacy[edit]
Karp joined the Planned Parenthood Board of Directors in 2014.[20] In March 2017, Tumblr and Planned Parenthood launched an initiative calling on the tech industry to support Planned Parenthood.[21]
Karp endorsed Hillary Clinton for president in the lead-up to the 2016 United States election.[22]
Personal life[edit]
Beginning in 2011, Karp's girlfriend was Rachel Eakley, a psychology graduate and nursing student.[23][24] They lived together in Williamsburg with their pet dog, Clark.[1][25] The pair split in 2014.[26]
Karp has made personal investments into several companies including Superpedestrian, Inc. (the company behind the Copenhagen Wheel),[27] Sherpaa, Inc. (a healthcare app startup)[28] and Splash (an event marketing platform).[29]

Early life[edit]
Born in New York City, Karp grew up on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. His parents are Barbara Ackerman, a science teacher from San Anselmo, California, and Michael D. Karp, a film and television composer.[9] He has a younger brother named Kevin.[10] His parents separated when he was 17.[10] Karp attended the Calhoun School from aged three through 8th grade, where his mother teaches science.[4] At 11, he began learning HTML and was soon designing websites for businesses.[3] Karp went on to attend Bronx Science for one year before dropping out at the age of 15 and started homeschooling.[4] At the time, Karp had aspirations of getting into a college in New York or MIT and saw homeschooling and doing other projects on the side as a way to impress the colleges.[11] Karp never returned to high school or earned his high school diploma.[10] Marco Arment, the first employee of Tumblr, would later recall that Karp was keen to avoid letting his age shape people's assumptions about him: "He wanted to keep it quiet for as long as he could because he knew that as soon as it got out, every story about Tumblr would just be about David's youth."[12]
Career[edit]




Karp in 2007


Karp began interning at age 14 for animation producer Fred Seibert, founder of Frederator Studios.[4] Karp's mother had taught Seibert's children at the Calhoun School and was friends with his wife.[10][13] Karp was fascinated with the work of Frederator's computer engineers and his visits became regular. After he started homeschooling, Karp also began taking Japanese classes at the Japan Society and saw a math tutor, with whom he worked on writing software for winning at blackjack and poker.[13] When entrepreneur John Maloney sought technical help with UrbanBaby, an online parenting forum, a Frederator employee recommended Karp for the job. Karp completed the project, which had to be done in a couple of days, within four hours. Maloney made him UrbanBaby's head of product and gave him a small amount of equity.[10] At age 17, while still working for UrbanBaby, Karp moved alone to Tokyo for five months. It was a full three months after Karp had moved to Tokyo that UrbanBaby found out he wasn't in New York.[4]


I realized that I got to spend that entire day working on this product that I absolutely loved. ... And it was this incredible, liberating, unbelievably inspiring feeling.

—Karp in an interview with Fast Company about his
first day of work dedicated solely to Tumblr[14]
Karp left UrbanBaby after it was sold to CNET in 2006.[10] Using money from the sale of his shares, Karp started his own software consultancy company, Davidville, envisioning a mix of client work and his own products.[13] Marco Arment joined the company as an engineer after replying to Karp's Craigslist ad.[10] Karp had been interested in tumblelogs (short-form blogs) for some time and was waiting for one of the established blogging platforms to introduce their own tumblelogging platform. As no one had done so after a year of waiting, Karp and Arment began working on their own tumblelogging platform during a two-week gap between contracts in 2006.[2][4][15] Tumblr was launched in February 2007[14] and within two weeks, the service had gained 75,000 users.[8]
In October 2007, Karp shut down his consultancy business as his work with Tumblr was interfering with his client work.[16] Davidville was renamed Tumblr, Inc.[17] and 25 percent of the company was sold to a small group of investors.[4]
On May 20, 2013, it was announced that Yahoo! and Tumblr had reached an agreement for Yahoo! to acquire Tumblr for $1.1 billion. Karp remained as CEO.[18][19] As of June 1, 2017, Tumblr hosts over 349.3 million blogs.[6]
Advocacy[edit]
Karp joined the Planned Parenthood Board of Directors in 2014.[20] In March 2017, Tumblr and Planned Parenthood launched an initiative calling on the tech industry to support Planned Parenthood.[21]
Karp endorsed Hillary Clinton for president in the lead-up to the 2016 United States election.[22]
Personal life[edit]
Beginning in 2011, Karp's girlfriend was Rachel Eakley, a psychology graduate and nursing student.[23][24] They lived together in Williamsburg with their pet dog, Clark.[1][25] The pair split in 2014.[26]
Karp has made personal investments into several companies including Superpedestrian, Inc. (the company behind the Copenhagen Wheel),[27] Sherpaa, Inc. (a healthcare app startup)[28] and Splash (an event marketing platform).[29]

David Karp and Tumblr Internet Biographies 
Sometimes in business, success comes not by reinventing the wheel but by simply building a better mousetrap. That's exactly what David Karp did when he founded his microblogging site, Tumblr. This book introduces readers to Karp and follows him from his humble beginnings as a shy kid to the head of one of the most successful tech companies today. He grew his business simply because he believed he could build a simpler, leaner blogging platform that was easier to use. His idea was a hit, and Tumblr's success took off. As with most companies, though, Karp's business experienced growing pains from its rapid expansion and struggled to turn a profit. However, readers learn that Karp, the once introverted kid who transformed into a confident leader, is looking toward further growing Tumblr into an even greater success. With fact sheets on the founder and the company itself, readers see that it's possible to turn a simple idea into a revolutionary business.

David Karp, the Nonconformist Who Built Tumblr


As a kid, David Karp, the founder of Tumblr, taught himself to code and dropped out of high school. Now Karp runs his company his way--and refuses to keep a schedule.

Away From the Computer Tumblr lets users share their thoughts online, but Karp prefers to jot his ideas for the company on paper.











In 2007, when others his age were studying for midterms and living on dorm food, David Karp was busy launching Tumblr, an easy-to-use blogging platform that now hosts 17.5 million blogs and receives about 1.5 billion page views per week. The company has also attracted some $40 million in venture funding.
Karp, 24, is used to doing his own thing. At 11, he taught himself how to write code. At 15, he dropped out of high school. A year later, he got a job as CTO of UrbanBaby, a New York City parenting site. At Tumblr, Karp likes to spend his time sketching ideas in notebooks, lunching as a group with his 30 employees, and of course, perusing blogs on Tumblr. One thing he doesn't like is being pinned down. That quickly becomes clear if you try to make an appointment with him. Or happen to spot him zipping around New York City on his Vespa.
I'm very antischedule. Except for board meetings, I don't really schedule things or keep a calendar. I think appointments are caustic to creativity. It's so frustrating when you're in the middle of a great conversation or work groove, and you realize, "Oh, I've got an appointment. I've got to bolt." I prefer the "let's just call each other when we need something or want to hang out" approach. That way, I never have to cancel on people, which is always a bummer. People tell me I need an assistant, but I don't want one.
I live in Manhattan, about 15 minutes from my office. In the morning, I usually walk to work or take my Vespa. I got it in October, and I love it. I've always wanted a motorcycle, and I thought a Vespa was a good first step. It's a lot cheaper than cabs for getting around the city. It costs $5 to fill it up, and a tank of gas lasts all week.
I try hard not to check e-mails until I get to the office, which is usually between 9:30 and 10 a.m. Reading e-mails at home never feels good or productive. If something urgently needs my attention, someone will call or text me.
I used to suck at e-mail. I'd let e-mails pile up, get overwhelmed, and miss important messages-;or forget to reply. So I set up filters on my e-mail, and that's been working pretty well. Now, my inbox gets e-mails only from people in my company and from my girlfriend. A folder called Robots gets anything not written by a human, like bank statements and Google Alerts. Most everything else goes into the Unsorted folder. When I get to the office, I go through my inbox first and try to respond right away. Then I go through my Unsorted folder, but I respond to very few of those. I've found that if you're not responsive to e-mail, it trains people to leave you alone.
As I go through my e-mail, I make a list of things that I need to do that day in my notebook. I have a bad memory, so I've become a thorough note taker. I use Action Method notebooks from a company called Behance. They are really beautiful. The pages have rows of dots instead of lines. I ordered a bunch for our team. I always write with a Pilot Precise V7 pen. It's inky but doesn't smudge. In addition to to-do lists, I also use the notebooks to sketch out ideas for new features on Tumblr. The notebooks are big, so it takes me four to six months to fill one up. I keep all of the old ones in a drawer.
Every Monday morning, we have an all-team meeting in our conference room, a place I designed to be quiet and cozy. There are no conference tables-;just a couch and a few comfortable chairs. Our customer support team, a group of eight people in Virginia, attends via Skype. I started holding these meetings in January as a way for everyone to get up to speed on what everyone else is doing. The first few meetings were pretty awkward. I tend to get excited and ramble on. So I've been trying to go around the room and have everyone else talk about the projects they're working on. I still probably talk too much.
Our office is a big, open loft space, and I'm right in the middle. The engineers, who run the site, are clustered on one side of me. And the community outreach team-;the company evangelists who interact with our users-;is on the other side. People are really quiet and respectful of one another. I use headphones if I listen to music. We mostly use e-mail to communicate. I love e-mail, because it doesn't interrupt anyone. The fewer distractions, the better.
I have two screens on my desk. The first is a 30-inch Mac monitor. I always have Tumblr open in the Web browser. The second is a vertical screen, which I use only for writing code. You can turn most Dell or Hewlett-Packard monitors sideways, a trick I learned from Marco Arment, who used to be Tumblr's lead developer. I like using two screens, because if you do everything on the same monitor, you end up constantly flipping back and forth between programs, which is distracting. A lot of our engineers have the same setup now.
I'm on Tumblr all day. I don't follow a ton of people, but I post and reblog stuff I really care about. I love my blog. I get most of my news from my Tumblr dashboard. I used to be a 24-hour news consumer, but so much of the reporting is bad these days. I find tech reporting incredibly tedious and dull. And I've kind of given up on reading anything that anyone writes about Tumblr. It's often inaccurate.
I used to spend all day coding, but that changed when we hired engineers who were a lot smarter than me. I still jump in to help code as needed. The engineers have scrums every day. Occasionally, I'll sit in on their meetings to get a sense of what's going on and see if I can help with anything. I'm really good at asking questions about edge cases or unusual scenarios. So when our engineers are describing a new way to build something, I'll ask, "What if it's in a different language?" or "Will it get totally messed up if that button has to be a different dimension?" Basically, what part of this aren't we thinking about?
We roll out changes to the site every day at 11 a.m. We stagger out small changes, so we can see what works and what doesn't. We chose that time because we want engineers around if there's an issue. Plus, it's early enough that there's not much traffic. Basically, everything that was finished the day before gets pushed the next morning. It could be a bug fix or a new language file-;say, a feature that was translated into French. Or it could be a new feature that's dark launched-;the public can't see it, but we have the ability to test it.
After we launch a new feature, I keep a close eye on how many people are using it. If it's unpopular, we'll discontinue it and try something else. Every feature has some maintenance cost, and having fewer features lets us focus on the ones we care about and make sure they work very well. For every new feature we add, we take an old one out. A lot of big sites don't do that, and it's a problem. Twitter started as a beautifully simple product, but it's now going the same route as Facebook. The drive to innovate can overencumber and destroy a product. My goal is to keep Tumblr very focused.
There's kind of a hive mentality at the office. We all break for lunch between 12 and 1. Usually, one person gets up, and the rest follow. We all cram into the elevator. Once we hit the street, we break off into two or three groups and go get food to bring back to the office. Then, we all eat together.
I always carry my camera with me. In January, I bought my dream camera, a Leica M9. It's the smallest digital camera they make with a full sensor. I post lots of photos on my blog, and I actually took most of the Tumblr employee photos.
I don't do much of the hiring anymore. Each department is in charge of hiring its own members. I like autonomous people. I want people who can take a project and figure out how to do it themselves. I don't really care about how things get done. Only that they get done.
Lately, I've been focused on our community outreach team-;it's responsible for figuring out how to connect with and promote the people who use Tumblr. I recently brought in my friend Richard Tong to be our fashion editor. He started Weardrobe, a fashion website that is now owned by Google. About 18 percent of our blogs are fashion related, and he focuses on reaching out to that demographic. As a result, Tumblr had a huge presence at New York's Fashion Week. I meet with the community team at least once a week to brainstorm about ways we can connect with users, like sponsoring a literary event or organizing meetups for Tumblr users around the world. I love that part of my job.
Usually around 3 p.m., I need a pick-me-up. A handful of us will pop out for tea at a place around the corner. I either order an iced tea or an Armenian mint tea. I used to drink coffee, but it messes me up-;I have a very fast metabolism, so I go from drowsy to unbearably hyper. Tea has just the right amount of caffeine.
In the afternoons, I usually want to bury my head in some project-;either screwing around with design or coding something. Recently, I took a stab at redesigning our photo sets feature, which lets users post several photos together, like a slide show. I may spend a couple of hours scraping together my thoughts before sending an idea out to the product team to get their take on it.
One or two nights a week, I usually work late-;until 8 or 9. When I do, I like to see who is still in the office and then take them out for dinner as a way to say thank you. We are surrounded by great restaurants, so we go somewhere nice.
I rarely work on weekends unless there's a serious database or infrastructure emergency. The company is growing fast, and we've had some problems scaling. Any time we add capacity, it immediately fills up. In December, the site was down for an entire day. It happened on a Sunday-;there was a whole lot of scrambling to figure out what broke. Everything about it sucked.
One of my favorite things to do on the weekend is take road trips. I just joined the Classic Car Club in Manhattan. You pay an annual fee, which gives you access to all these cool cars. My girlfriend and I took a 1996 Porsche 993 Carrera 4S up to Montreal one weekend. It was amazing. We've also taken trips to Boston and Maine. Other times, we'll jump on the Vespa and drive around the city. We might have brunch at our favorite place in the East Village, then pop over to see friends in Brooklyn before heading back up to Union Square to see a movie.
I spend a lot of time with people who work at Tumblr, but I make a very poor effort to hang out with other people in my life. I'm trying to do a better job of that. But, honestly, I love quiet nights at home. My girlfriend is a spectacular chef. She usually cooks dinner for us two or three nights out of the week. And then we wind down by watching TV. We use Apple TV to watch television shows from iTunes. We both love Futurama. I recently got her into Top Gear, a car show on the BBC.
Sleep is precious to me. I'm very disappointed if I don't go to bed before midnight. We have a rule: no laptops in the bedroom. Being on computers all the time makes me feel gross.

Tumblr's plan to reach owner company Yahoo CEO's Marissa Mayer's vision of becoming a business with $100 million in revenue by next year isn't to take on other internet giants like Facebook and Twitter for advertising money. Instead, the blogging platform wants to steal ad money from TV broadcasters and newspaper and magazine publishers, Tumblr CEO David Karp told the Financial Times.
Tumblr is on a mission to prove to advertisers that it is the best platform for "aspirational" marketing campaigns, which are typically placed on TV or in premium glossy magazines, the Financial Times report suggests. Tumblr doesn’t just want to be speaking to the digital agencies; it wants to be forming partnerships with the top creatives and marketers behind big-brand Super Bowl ads.
Karp told FT that while the rest of the industry was focused on direct response advertising — when consumers are likely to be on the lookout for one particular product and are served with a "buy me now" ad — and narrow targeting that uses data to show ads based on very strict sets of criteria, Tumblr offers advertisers a broader base of interests. That is why he thinks Tumblr is the best place for brand marketing campaigns online.
He said in the interview: "The whole industry is obsessed with harvesting intent when, if you look at the biggest brands, they want to create intent, to get people to aspire to wear the clothes, drive the car, drink the soda. Right now there aren't a lot of pleas in any of these digital networks which inspire people to become a customer … which they used to do with great TV and print campaigns.
"The general message to big brands and agencies from Silicon Valley and all the digital networks is 'leave the creative people at home, show up with the data scientists.' We want them to show up with the guys putting together the Super Bowl ads."
One of the advantages of Tumblr over Facebook or Twitter, Karp says, is that people come to Tumblr with the intent to consume content rather than to communicate with their friends. So in that way the site's sponsored posts, radar posts, and trending blogs ad formats are not a "jarring surprise" that take you away from your very "personal place," Karp added.
Yahoo acquired Tumblr for $1 billion last year. However, many observers have criticized the move, as the acquisition does not appear to be immediately paying off.
However, in Yahoo's latest earnings call, Mayer said Tumblr was likely to report its first profit (before interest, tax, depreciation, or amortization — otherwise known as EBITDA) by the end of 2015.
Mayer on Tuesday said, in announcing Yahoo’s $640 million acquisition of the video adtech platform BrightRoll, that Tumblr was on track to generate more than $100 million in revenue next year. 
Business Insider’s Nicholas Carson revealed last month that Yahoo was planning to use BrightRoll to turn Tumblr into a video site to rival the likes of YouTube. 
YouTube has also recently confirmed it is coming after TV’s money, by putting more effort into mimicking broadcasters' "upfront" events to secure long-term bulk advertising deals.

��It Was the Biggest Game of Chicken I’ve Ever Seen.’’
David Karp built a massive, culturally totemic company that was losing millions of dollars a month. After a huge infusion of Yahoo cash, he’s breathing easier.

Tumblr
Founded: 2007 
Age of CEO: 27
Number of Tumblr users: 140 million
Lesson: Youth can be worth more than $1 billion to a twenty-year-old Internet company.
In mid-May, a few days before Yahoo announced it would be acquiring Tumblr, there was a housewarming party in Greenpoint. A Tumblr employee was moving into an apartment with a friend who happened to be dating another �Tumblr employee, and the overlapping social circles resulted in a room full of Tumblr people. It was Saturday night. Late the previous afternoon, a cluster of posts had appeared on tech blogs with the announcement that Yahoo’s board would be meeting on Sunday to approve a $1.1 billion offer for Tumblr, and though everyone at the party had read the posts�or fielded texts from someone who had�nobody had really paid attention. Rumors skittered around the office on a weekly basis. Employees always joked that it didn’t matter what kind of options you had because Tumblr was never going to sell.
Plus: Yahoo? Really? When a similar idea circulated back in 2009, Tumblr’s then�lead developer, Marco Arment, summed up the party line in a scornful blog post: �I hope they let me work on some of the many exciting projects at Yahoo � I want to move to California and get stuck in traffic every day on the way to my midlevel engineering job where I sit in a cubicle all day and can’t make any product decisions while working on something nobody will ever see to manage regional ad clickthrough stats tracking.� Thanks, but no thanks. Yahoo was a lumbering Sunnyvale company with irrelevant products that no one used. Tumblr was a nimble startup in the nation’s greatest city with a boy-genius founder. An acquisition wasn’t just unlikely, it was insulting. The only company to whom they might have sold, an early employee said, was Apple (if Apple had asked).
Yahoo’s reputation as a wet blanket may have been allayed by the arrival of Marissa Mayer as CEO, but an acquisition still struck employees at the party as too icky to be true. (One guest summed it up: �No one who works in tech wants to work at Yahoo.�) As more wine and whiskey were consumed, however, the incredulity turned into fidgety speculation. One employee pointed out that Mayer had been dropping into the Tumblr office as far back as December; he remembered peering into the fishbowl conference room to see her meeting with their CEO, David Karp, and head of product, Derek Gottfrid. Nothing secret about it. Other employees were aware that after a hiring spree and floor-to-ceiling office remodel, the amount of cash left in �Tumblr’s coffers was dwindling. At some point, partygoers who worked on the engineering side began forecasting how shitty the company would become if Yahoo were to buy it, and by the end of the night, guests were running numbers, trying to figure out how much their options might be worth. On Monday, Karp called an all-team meeting to announce the deal.
If low- and mid- and even some high-level employees were shocked��I don’t think anyone saw it coming necessarily,� says Gottfrid�anyone paying attention to Tumblr’s burn rate should have been expecting an exit. Despite its popularity (it is the fourteenth-most-visited site in the U.S., according to Quantcast, a few slots above Wikipedia), Tumblr was a six-year-old blogging platform with disappointing revenue targets, no clear path to profitability, and alarmingly little cash in the bank (just $16.6 million when it was purchased). To stay afloat without selling, it would have needed a sixth round of funding, which, given the situation, might have led to a �down round,� and to Karp ceding a substantial chunk of his equity. As one person watching the deal unfold put it: �It was the biggest game of chicken I’ve ever seen in a startup. Literally months away from bankruptcy, and he manages to find an angel in Marissa Mayer.�’
On a smotheringly hot morning a few months after the acquisition, Tumblr’s 27-year-old CEO took a train from the Williamsburg duplex he shares with his girlfriend and bulldog into Manhattan’s Gramercy Park neighborhood for breakfast. Maialino�the Danny Meyer version of a Roman trattoria, with tourists and egg-white frittatas�is not a place Karp would have chosen for a social occasion. For that he prefers the Brooklyn outpost of Cafe Mogador, where he orders an �Über-breakfast� of pancakes, eggs Florentine, avocado, and bacon. But for work-related meals, Maialino is perfect: two blocks from the Tumblr office, with tables spaced far enough apart to furnish guests with privacy and the general sense that it has been zoned for high-net-worth individuals. (Mark-up on eggs: 5,000 percent.)

When David Karp was 14, he was clearly a bright teenager. Quiet, somewhat reclusive, bored with his classes at the Bronx High School of Science. He spent most of his free time in his bedroom, glued to his computer.But instead of trying to pry him away from his machine or coaxing him outside to get some fresh air, his mother, Barbara Ackerman, had another solution: she suggested that he drop out of high school to be home-schooled.“I saw him at school all day and absorbed all night into his computer,” said Ms. Ackerman, reached by phone Monday afternoon. “It became very clear that David needed the space to live his passion. Which was computers. All things computers.”Clearly.Now 26 years old, Mr. Karp never finished high school or enrolled in college. Instead, he played a significant role in several technology start-ups before founding Tumblr, the popular blogging service that agreed to be sold to Yahoo for $1.1 billion this week. With an expected $250 million from the deal, Mr. Karp joins a tiny circle of 20-something entrepreneurs, hoodie-wearing characters like Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg and Foursquare’s Dennis Crowley, who have struck it rich before turning 30.

“When I first met David he was 20 years old and wearing sneakers and jeans,” said Bijan Sabet, a general partner at Spark Capital, who was one of the first people to invest in Tumblr. “But I knew he was one of these rare entrepreneurs that grew up on the Web and who could come up with an idea, build it himself, and then ship it that night.” Continue reading the main story

Since founding Tumblr six years ago, Mr. Karp has been admired for his programming skills and Web site design acumen but at times has been a polarizing figure in New York tech circles because he so often blogged about his personal life and party-hopping. He has popped up in the New York Post’s Page Six Magazine, and has been a recurring target for the gossip Web site Gawker, where he was labeled a “fameball,” a derogatory term for someone who has an unquenchable desire for fame.Tall and willowy, with a mop of brown hair and piercing blue eyes, Mr. Karp typically dresses in jeans, a T-shirt and sneakers. He speaks at a rapid clip and, often, for minutes without stopping. Technically, he never graduated from high school, which he cracked in an interview is “hopefully not a condition of Yahoo employment.”After dropping out and working for a time in small New York tech outfits, Mr. Karp made his way to Tokyo, where he worked for several months for a start-up. He returned to the United States and became the chief technology officer for UrbanBaby, an Internet message board for parents. CNET Networks bought UrbanBaby in 2006, and Mr. Karp took the several hundred thousand dollars he made from the sale to start his own company, called Davidville. One of Davidville’s projects was a simple blogging service called Tumblr.Mr. Karp’s run at Tumblr has not been without problems. He had trouble hiring in Tumblr’s early days, unsure how to even interview recruits. He often thought large companies were too big for their own good, proclaiming he could manage Tumblr with a team of four.But Mr. Karp stepped out of the party scene and started dating his current girlfriend, a graduate nursing school student at New York University, four years ago. He also appeared to get more serious about his company as it grew from less than a dozen employees to more than 175 today. “David has grown up in Tumblr,” said Mark Coatney, who oversees Tumblr’s relationship with media companies.Still, Mr. Karp’s unsure footing led to discussions about his taking a different role at Tumblr, according to two people who worked with the company and who agreed to speak on the condition of anonymity. Because revenue was not growing as fast as they would have liked, investors considered putting Mr. Karp in charge of Tumblr’s product development and finding a more seasoned chief executive.

Mr. Karp denied in an interview that there was a plan for him to give up the chief executive’s job. He said that when Tumblr’s chief operating officer left in the middle of last year, filling that job and other critical roles like head of marketing was “top of mind,” but he said there was no plan for him to step aside.

Like many who run so-called social Internet companies, Mr. Karp can teeter on reclusive. In an interview last year at the F.ounders conference in New York, he said he preferred to come to the office early to work alone, avoiding other people.“Where I feel the most productive and engaged is when I’m buried in code, buried in some project, tweaking some designs,” he said. “I’m certainly introverted.”

Fred Seibert, a television producer who was MTV’s first creative director, first met Mr. Karp in 2000 while he was still in high school. His children attended a private school on the Upper West side of Manhattan called the Calhoun School, where Mr. Karp’s mother was a science teacher.“My wife and Barbara became very friendly,” Mr. Seibert said. “Over coffee, she was describing how bored David was in high school and my wife said, ‘Fred really likes teenagers, you should send him over.’ And that’s how I met him. He was 14.”Mr. Karp arrived at Mr. Seibert’s offices on Park Avenue and said he wanted to “learn about engineering and become a good engineer.” At first, Mr. Karp came to the office a few days a week. But then, one day, Mr. Karp announced that he would be coming in every day.“I asked him if his school schedule changed,” recalled Mr. Seibert. “And David said ‘No, I’ve dropped out!’ ”Mr. Seibert said it wasn’t long before Mr. Karp became invaluable. He asked him to build the site for his new company, a Web video production outfit called Next New Networks.“He comes in two weeks later and he hasn’t done it,” Mr. Seibert recalled. “I thought he was being a flaky 19-year-old. But he said, ‘No, no, your idea is just so 2000.’ ”Mr. Karp pulled out a Sony PlayStation Portable gaming device and told him that soon, Apple would be releasing an iPod with video capabilities. “He said, ‘This is the way people are going to watch video and you really ought to be there.’ ” Next New Networks was one of the first video products on iTunes and was eventually acquired by Google for around $50 million.

“Because of his prescience and timing, we were ahead of the curve,” Mr. Seibert said. Mr. Seibert eventually became an investor in Tumblr and sits on the company’s board.Mr. Karp, who lives in a $1.6 million one-bedroom loft in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, with his girlfriend and dog, said he is staying put in New York and with Yahoo. He intends to “figure out something” with philanthropy. And one day he might even go to college.“At least I should be able to afford it,” he said.

In its early days in 2007, blogging platform Tumblr was a two-person operation: founder David Karp and lead developer Marco Arment. Now that Tumblr is being acquired by media giant Yahoo Inc. for $1.1 billion in cash, Arment has written a post on his personal blog recalling his memories of working with Karp and of building and growing Tumblr.
"He's a workaholic -- he truly lives and breathes Tumblr," Arment wrote about Karp, who is staying on through the acquisition as Tumblr's chief executive. "I've never even seen him show any desire to work on a side project. David is all Tumblr, all the time."
Arment, who later founded Instapaper, a service that allows users to save articles they see online so they can read them later on, left Tumblr in 2010.
While Karp's management style has been criticized as being unpredictable, he led his team in developing a product that has more than 300 million monthly unique visitors and was bought for a huge sum of money. What follows are three lessons on startup leadership, gleaned from Arment's post:
Related: In Yahoo Deal, Tumblr Becomes the Next $1 Billion Startup
1. Find your 'idea editor.'
Entrepreneurs who have big ideas sometimes need to bounce those ideas off someone they can trust. Tumblr was Karp's vision. Although he hired Arment to help with coding and other back-end duties, Karp often used Arment as a sounding board.
"I often served as an idea editor," Arment said. "David would come in with a grand new feature idea, and I'd tell him which parts were infeasible or impossible, which tricky conditions and edge cases we'd need to consider, and which other little niceties and implementation details we should add."
2. Don't try to do everything yourself.
There comes a time for many startups when an entrepreneur simply cannot manage every task on his or her own. Everything from product development to scaling the business to grunt work can simply become too much for one person to handle adequately.
By 2008, Karp's desire to focus solely on product development pushed him to hire a president to handle the business operations. And as the Tumblr team continued to grow, Karp needed to learn how to be a leader.
"David needed to become a product manager, start overseeing a lot more people, and delegate some of the duties he really wanted to keep doing himself," Arment wrote. "After a rough start, David got the hang of being a manager."
3. When leading a team, channel your inner Steve Jobs (or David Karp).
Getting a big startup idea off the ground takes lots of work. Entrepreneurs who hire smart and passionate people, and who inspire those people to exceed their expectations, can increase their chances for success.
At Tumblr, Karp has been ultra-passionate about the product and about the people who use it since the very beginning, according to Arment. He expects his team members to share his enthusiasm and to work hard.
"[Karp] often drove me hard with seemingly impossible demands," Arment wrote. "But David has a lot of Steve Jobs-like qualities, and like many people who worked for Steve, I look back on Tumblr's crunch times with mixed feelings: I don't want to return to that stress level, but David pushed me to do amazing work that I didn't think was possible."

404 - PAGE NOT FOUND











ERROR 404 - PAGE NOT FOUND



Why am I seeing this page?

404 means the file is not found. If you have already uploaded the file then the name may be misspelled or it is in a different folder.
Other Possible Causes
You may get a 404 error for images because you have Hot Link Protection turned on and the domain is not on the list of authorized domains.
If you go to your temporary url (http://ip/~username/) and get this error, there maybe a problem with the rule set stored in an .htaccess file. You can try renaming that file to .htaccess-backup and refreshing the site to see if that resolves the issue.
It is also possible that you have inadvertently deleted your document root or the your account may need to be recreated. Either way, please contact your web host immediately.
Are you using WordPress? See the Section on 404 errors after clicking a link in WordPress.



How to find the correct spelling and folder

Missing or Broken Files
When you get a 404 error be sure to check the URL that you are attempting to use in your browser.This tells the server what resource it should attempt to request.
http://example.com/example/Example/help.html
In this example the file must be in public_html/example/Example/
Notice that the CaSe is important in this example. On platforms that enforce case-sensitivity example and Example are not the same locations.
For addon domains, the file must be in public_html/addondomain.com/example/Example/ and the names are case-sensitive.
Broken Image
When you have a missing image on your site you may see a box on your page with with a red X where the image is missing. Right click on the X and choose Properties. The properties will tell you the path and file name that cannot be found.
This varies by browser, if you do not see a box on your page with a red X try right clicking on the page, then select View Page Info, and goto the Media Tab.
http://example.com/cgi-sys/images/banner.PNG
In this example the image file must be in public_html/cgi-sys/images/
Notice that the CaSe is important in this example. On platforms that enforce case-sensitivity PNG and png are not the same locations.



404 Errors After Clicking WordPress Links

When working with WordPress, 404 Page Not Found errors can often occur when a new theme has been activated or when the rewrite rules in the .htaccess file have been altered.
When you encounter a 404 error in WordPress, you have two options for correcting it.
Option 1: Correct the Permalinks

Log in to WordPress.
From the left-hand navigation menu in WordPress, click Settings > Permalinks (Note the current setting. If you are using a custom structure, copy or save the custom structure somewhere.)
Select  Default.
Click Save Settings.
Change the settings back to the previous configuration (before you selected Default). Put the custom structure back if you had one.
Click Save Settings.

This will reset the permalinks and fix the issue in many cases. If this doesn't work, you may need to edit your .htaccess file directly.
Option 2: Modify the .htaccess File
Add the following snippet of code to the top of your .htaccess file:


										# BEGIN WordPress
										<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
										RewriteEngine On
										RewriteBase /
										RewriteRule ^index.php$ - [L]
										RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
										RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
										RewriteRule . /index.php [L]
										</IfModule>
										# End WordPress
									

If your blog is showing the wrong domain name in links, redirecting to another site, or is missing images and style, these are all usually related to the same problem: you have the wrong domain name configured in your WordPress blog.



How to modify your .htaccess file

The .htaccess file contains directives (instructions) that tell the server how to behave in certain scenarios and directly affect how your website functions.
Redirects and rewriting URLs are two very common directives found in a .htaccess file, and many scripts such as WordPress, Drupal, Joomla and Magento add directives to the .htaccess so those scripts can function.
It is possible that you may need to edit the .htaccess file at some point, for various reasons.This section covers how to edit the file in cPanel, but not what may need to be changed.(You may need to consult other articles and resources for that information.)
There are Many Ways to Edit a .htaccess File

Edit the file on your computer and upload it to the server via FTP
Use an FTP program's Edit Mode
Use SSH and a text editor
Use the File Manager in cPanel

The easiest way to edit a .htaccess file for most people is through the File Manager in cPanel.
How to Edit .htaccess files in cPanel's File Manager
Before you do anything, it is suggested that you backup your website so that you can revert back to a previous version if something goes wrong.
Open the File Manager

Log into cPanel.
In the Files section, click on the File Manager icon.

Early life[edit]
Born in New York City, Karp grew up on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. His parents are Barbara Ackerman, a science teacher from San Anselmo, California, and Michael D. Karp, a film and television composer.[9] He has a younger brother named Kevin.[10] His parents separated when he was 17.[10] Karp attended the Calhoun School from aged three through 8th grade, where his mother teaches science.[4] At 11, he began learning HTML and was soon designing websites for businesses.[3] Karp went on to attend Bronx Science for one year before dropping out at the age of 15 and started homeschooling.[4] At the time, Karp had aspirations of getting into a college in New York or MIT and saw homeschooling and doing other projects on the side as a way to impress the colleges.[11] Karp never returned to high school or earned his high school diploma.[10] Marco Arment, the first employee of Tumblr, would later recall that Karp was keen to avoid letting his age shape people's assumptions about him: "He wanted to keep it quiet for as long as he could because he knew that as soon as it got out, every story about Tumblr would just be about David's youth."[12]
Career[edit]




Karp in 2007


Karp began interning at age 14 for animation producer Fred Seibert, founder of Frederator Studios.[4] Karp's mother had taught Seibert's children at the Calhoun School and was friends with his wife.[10][13] Karp was fascinated with the work of Frederator's computer engineers and his visits became regular. After he started homeschooling, Karp also began taking Japanese classes at the Japan Society and saw a math tutor, with whom he worked on writing software for winning at blackjack and poker.[13] When entrepreneur John Maloney sought technical help with UrbanBaby, an online parenting forum, a Frederator employee recommended Karp for the job. Karp completed the project, which had to be done in a couple of days, within four hours. Maloney made him UrbanBaby's head of product and gave him a small amount of equity.[10] At age 17, while still working for UrbanBaby, Karp moved alone to Tokyo for five months. It was a full three months after Karp had moved to Tokyo that UrbanBaby found out he wasn't in New York.[4]


I realized that I got to spend that entire day working on this product that I absolutely loved. ... And it was this incredible, liberating, unbelievably inspiring feeling.

—Karp in an interview with Fast Company about his
first day of work dedicated solely to Tumblr[14]
Karp left UrbanBaby after it was sold to CNET in 2006.[10] Using money from the sale of his shares, Karp started his own software consultancy company, Davidville, envisioning a mix of client work and his own products.[13] Marco Arment joined the company as an engineer after replying to Karp's Craigslist ad.[10] Karp had been interested in tumblelogs (short-form blogs) for some time and was waiting for one of the established blogging platforms to introduce their own tumblelogging platform. As no one had done so after a year of waiting, Karp and Arment began working on their own tumblelogging platform during a two-week gap between contracts in 2006.[2][4][15] Tumblr was launched in February 2007[14] and within two weeks, the service had gained 75,000 users.[8]
In October 2007, Karp shut down his consultancy business as his work with Tumblr was interfering with his client work.[16] Davidville was renamed Tumblr, Inc.[17] and 25 percent of the company was sold to a small group of investors.[4]
On May 20, 2013, it was announced that Yahoo! and Tumblr had reached an agreement for Yahoo! to acquire Tumblr for $1.1 billion. Karp remained as CEO.[18][19] As of June 1, 2017, Tumblr hosts over 349.3 million blogs.[6]
Advocacy[edit]
Karp joined the Planned Parenthood Board of Directors in 2014.[20] In March 2017, Tumblr and Planned Parenthood launched an initiative calling on the tech industry to support Planned Parenthood.[21]
Karp endorsed Hillary Clinton for president in the lead-up to the 2016 United States election.[22]
Personal life[edit]
Beginning in 2011, Karp's girlfriend was Rachel Eakley, a psychology graduate and nursing student.[23][24] They lived together in Williamsburg with their pet dog, Clark.[1][25] The pair split in 2014.[26]
Karp has made personal investments into several companies including Superpedestrian, Inc. (the company behind the Copenhagen Wheel),[27] Sherpaa, Inc. (a healthcare app startup)[28] and Splash (an event marketing platform).[29]

David Karp (born July 6, 1986)[2] is an American web developer and entrepreneur. He is the founder and CEO of the short-form blogging platform Tumblr.[3][4] According to Forbes, Karp's net worth exceeds $200 million, and Tumblr has been valued at $800 million.[1]
Karp began his career as an intern under Fred Seibert at the animation company Frederator Studios, where he built the studio's first blogging platform and conceived, wrote, and edited their first internet video network, Channel Frederator.[5] Karp went on to work for online parenting forum UrbanBaby until it was sold to CNET in 2006. Karp then started his own software consulting company, Davidville, where he worked with computer engineer Marco Arment on projects for clients. During a gap between contracts in 2006, the two began work on a microblogging website, which was launched as Tumblr in February 2007. As of June 1, 2017, Tumblr hosts over 349.3 million blogs.[6] In August 2009, Karp was named Best Young Tech Entrepreneur 2009 by BusinessWeek[7] and in 2010, he was named to the MIT Technology Review TR35 as one of the top 35 innovators in the world under the age of 35.[8]
On May 20, 2013, it was announced that Yahoo! and Tumblr had reached an agreement for Yahoo! to acquire Tumblr for $1.1 billion. Karp remained CEO of the company.

Early life[edit]
Born in New York City, Karp grew up on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. His parents are Barbara Ackerman, a science teacher from San Anselmo, California, and Michael D. Karp, a film and television composer.[9] He has a younger brother named Kevin.[10] His parents separated when he was 17.[10] Karp attended the Calhoun School from aged three through 8th grade, where his mother teaches science.[4] At 11, he began learning HTML and was soon designing websites for businesses.[3] Karp went on to attend Bronx Science for one year before dropping out at the age of 15 and started homeschooling.[4] At the time, Karp had aspirations of getting into a college in New York or MIT and saw homeschooling and doing other projects on the side as a way to impress the colleges.[11] Karp never returned to high school or earned his high school diploma.[10] Marco Arment, the first employee of Tumblr, would later recall that Karp was keen to avoid letting his age shape people's assumptions about him: "He wanted to keep it quiet for as long as he could because he knew that as soon as it got out, every story about Tumblr would just be about David's youth."[12]
Career[edit]




Karp in 2007


Karp began interning at age 14 for animation producer Fred Seibert, founder of Frederator Studios.[4] Karp's mother had taught Seibert's children at the Calhoun School and was friends with his wife.[10][13] Karp was fascinated with the work of Frederator's computer engineers and his visits became regular. After he started homeschooling, Karp also began taking Japanese classes at the Japan Society and saw a math tutor, with whom he worked on writing software for winning at blackjack and poker.[13] When entrepreneur John Maloney sought technical help with UrbanBaby, an online parenting forum, a Frederator employee recommended Karp for the job. Karp completed the project, which had to be done in a couple of days, within four hours. Maloney made him UrbanBaby's head of product and gave him a small amount of equity.[10] At age 17, while still working for UrbanBaby, Karp moved alone to Tokyo for five months. It was a full three months after Karp had moved to Tokyo that UrbanBaby found out he wasn't in New York.[4]


I realized that I got to spend that entire day working on this product that I absolutely loved. ... And it was this incredible, liberating, unbelievably inspiring feeling.
“
”

—Karp in an interview with Fast Company about his
first day of work dedicated solely to Tumblr[14]
Karp left UrbanBaby after it was sold to CNET in 2006.[10] Using money from the sale of his shares, Karp started his own software consultancy company, Davidville, envisioning a mix of client work and his own products.[13] Marco Arment joined the company as an engineer after replying to Karp's Craigslist ad.[10] Karp had been interested in tumblelogs (short-form blogs) for some time and was waiting for one of the established blogging platforms to introduce their own tumblelogging platform. As no one had done so after a year of waiting, Karp and Arment began working on their own tumblelogging platform during a two-week gap between contracts in 2006.[2][4][15] Tumblr was launched in February 2007[14] and within two weeks, the service had gained 75,000 users.[8]
In October 2007, Karp shut down his consultancy business as his work with Tumblr was interfering with his client work.[16] Davidville was renamed Tumblr, Inc.[17] and 25 percent of the company was sold to a small group of investors.[4]
On May 20, 2013, it was announced that Yahoo! and Tumblr had reached an agreement for Yahoo! to acquire Tumblr for $1.1 billion. Karp remained as CEO.[18][19] As of June 1, 2017, Tumblr hosts over 349.3 million blogs.[6]
Advocacy[edit]
Karp joined the Planned Parenthood Board of Directors in 2014.[20] In March 2017, Tumblr and Planned Parenthood launched an initiative calling on the tech industry to support Planned Parenthood.[21]
Karp endorsed Hillary Clinton for president in the lead-up to the 2016 United States election.[22]
Personal life[edit]
Beginning in 2011, Karp's girlfriend was Rachel Eakley, a psychology graduate and nursing student.[23][24] They lived together in Williamsburg with their pet dog, Clark.[1][25] The pair split in 2014.[26]
Karp has made personal investments into several companies including Superpedestrian, Inc. (the company behind the Copenhagen Wheel),[27] Sherpaa, Inc. (a healthcare app startup)[28] and Splash (an event marketing platform).[29]

David Karp (born July 6, 1986)[2] is an American web developer and entrepreneur. He is the founder and CEO of the short-form blogging platform Tumblr.[3][4] According to Forbes, Karp's net worth exceeds $200 million, and Tumblr has been valued at $800 million.[1]
Karp began his career as an intern under Fred Seibert at the animation company Frederator Studios, where he built the studio's first blogging platform and conceived, wrote, and edited their first internet video network, Channel Frederator.[5] Karp went on to work for online parenting forum UrbanBaby until it was sold to CNET in 2006. Karp then started his own software consulting company, Davidville, where he worked with computer engineer Marco Arment on projects for clients. During a gap between contracts in 2006, the two began work on a microblogging website, which was launched as Tumblr in February 2007. As of June 1, 2017, Tumblr hosts over 349.3 million blogs.[6] In August 2009, Karp was named Best Young Tech Entrepreneur 2009 by BusinessWeek[7] and in 2010, he was named to the MIT Technology Review TR35 as one of the top 35 innovators in the world under the age of 35.[8]
On May 20, 2013, it was announced that Yahoo! and Tumblr had reached an agreement for Yahoo! to acquire Tumblr for $1.1 billion. Karp remained CEO of the company.

Early life[edit]
Born in New York City, Karp grew up on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. His parents are Barbara Ackerman, a science teacher from San Anselmo, California, and Michael D. Karp, a film and television composer.[9] He has a younger brother named Kevin.[10] His parents separated when he was 17.[10] Karp attended the Calhoun School from aged three through 8th grade, where his mother teaches science.[4] At 11, he began learning HTML and was soon designing websites for businesses.[3] Karp went on to attend Bronx Science for one year before dropping out at the age of 15 and started homeschooling.[4] At the time, Karp had aspirations of getting into a college in New York or MIT and saw homeschooling and doing other projects on the side as a way to impress the colleges.[11] Karp never returned to high school or earned his high school diploma.[10] Marco Arment, the first employee of Tumblr, would later recall that Karp was keen to avoid letting his age shape people's assumptions about him: "He wanted to keep it quiet for as long as he could because he knew that as soon as it got out, every story about Tumblr would just be about David's youth."[12]
Career[edit]




Karp in 2007


Karp began interning at age 14 for animation producer Fred Seibert, founder of Frederator Studios.[4] Karp's mother had taught Seibert's children at the Calhoun School and was friends with his wife.[10][13] Karp was fascinated with the work of Frederator's computer engineers and his visits became regular. After he started homeschooling, Karp also began taking Japanese classes at the Japan Society and saw a math tutor, with whom he worked on writing software for winning at blackjack and poker.[13] When entrepreneur John Maloney sought technical help with UrbanBaby, an online parenting forum, a Frederator employee recommended Karp for the job. Karp completed the project, which had to be done in a couple of days, within four hours. Maloney made him UrbanBaby's head of product and gave him a small amount of equity.[10] At age 17, while still working for UrbanBaby, Karp moved alone to Tokyo for five months. It was a full three months after Karp had moved to Tokyo that UrbanBaby found out he wasn't in New York.[4]


I realized that I got to spend that entire day working on this product that I absolutely loved. ... And it was this incredible, liberating, unbelievably inspiring feeling.
“
”

—Karp in an interview with Fast Company about his
first day of work dedicated solely to Tumblr[14]
Karp left UrbanBaby after it was sold to CNET in 2006.[10] Using money from the sale of his shares, Karp started his own software consultancy company, Davidville, envisioning a mix of client work and his own products.[13] Marco Arment joined the company as an engineer after replying to Karp's Craigslist ad.[10] Karp had been interested in tumblelogs (short-form blogs) for some time and was waiting for one of the established blogging platforms to introduce their own tumblelogging platform. As no one had done so after a year of waiting, Karp and Arment began working on their own tumblelogging platform during a two-week gap between contracts in 2006.[2][4][15] Tumblr was launched in February 2007[14] and within two weeks, the service had gained 75,000 users.[8]
In October 2007, Karp shut down his consultancy business as his work with Tumblr was interfering with his client work.[16] Davidville was renamed Tumblr, Inc.[17] and 25 percent of the company was sold to a small group of investors.[4]
On May 20, 2013, it was announced that Yahoo! and Tumblr had reached an agreement for Yahoo! to acquire Tumblr for $1.1 billion. Karp remained as CEO.[18][19] As of June 1, 2017, Tumblr hosts over 349.3 million blogs.[6]
Advocacy[edit]
Karp joined the Planned Parenthood Board of Directors in 2014.[20] In March 2017, Tumblr and Planned Parenthood launched an initiative calling on the tech industry to support Planned Parenthood.[21]
Karp endorsed Hillary Clinton for president in the lead-up to the 2016 United States election.[22]
Personal life[edit]
Beginning in 2011, Karp's girlfriend was Rachel Eakley, a psychology graduate and nursing student.[23][24] They lived together in Williamsburg with their pet dog, Clark.[1][25] The pair split in 2014.[26]
Karp has made personal investments into several companies including Superpedestrian, Inc. (the company behind the Copenhagen Wheel),[27] Sherpaa, Inc. (a healthcare app startup)[28] and Splash (an event marketing platform).[29]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
