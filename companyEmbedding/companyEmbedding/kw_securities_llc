Top five dividend yielding stocks

Data delayed by 15 minutes
Top five lists are not a recommendation by E*TRADE Securities or its affiliates to buy, sell or hold any security, financial product or instrument, nor is it an endorsement of any specific security, company, fund family, product, or service.
Selection criteria: stocks from the Dow Jones Industrial Average that were recently paying the highest dividends as a percentage of their share price.
Dividend yield is a ratio that shows how much a company pays out in dividends each year relative to its share price. It is a way to measure how much income you are getting for each dollar invested in a stock position.
Dividend yields provide an idea of the cash dividend expected from an investment in a stock. Dividend Yields can change daily as they are based on the prior day's closing stock price. There are risks involved with dividend yield investing strategies, such as the company not paying a dividend or the dividend being far less that what is anticipated. Furthermore, dividend yield should not be relied upon solely when making a decision to invest in a stock. An investment in high yield stock and bonds involve certain risks such as market risk, price volatility, liquidity risk, and risk of default.
Data provided by Wall Street on Demand and Thomson Reuters.
Data quoted represents past performance. Past performance is not an indication of future results and investment returns and share prices will fluctuate on a daily basis. Your investment may be worth more or less than your original cost when you redeem your shares. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted.
