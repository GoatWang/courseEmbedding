Capital One® Secured Mastercard®


                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time.

                                            Approached at airport to sign up for this card. Already had a few. Signed up anyway as some pressure applied.

                                            WalletHub is by far my favorite credit monitoring tool and has made it really easy for me to gain an understanding of my score. Signing up was a very simple process and there were no extra strings attached.

Bed Bath & Beyond® Credit Card

Woodforest National Bank


                                            It is my opinion that you would do better to find a different company. In the long run they will charge you plenty and the support is virtually non-existent. They don't even have a working answering system. They are disorganized  and a nightmare to work with.

                                            It's not the worst, but it's certainly deceptive. I can't trust a company that lies to me for two bucks.

Veridian Credit Union


                                            i love banking with veridian, but the new updated online banking is garbage.10x harder to navigate than before staring from the log in page. Making simple transfers or even looking at accounts is harder and more confusing. bring back the old version.

Virginia Credit Union


                                            I was pre qualified for a mortgage loan. They waited until the week before closing and decided that I did not qualify.  This was after i put $500.00 down and paid for the inspection and gave notice to where I was renting .

Lowe's Store Card


                                            You will never get a credit line increase. I have good credit and zero late payments and get turned down every time. I don't have this problem with any of my other credit accounts. Had my account over a year in good standing. Paid it down to zero twice. What a joke!

If the company isn't reporting the account correctly, you can submit a dispute to the credit bureaus asking them to correct it.

I live on a fixed income. Its very difficult. My father and I are fairly comfortable, but due to the 40+ derogatory items on my credit report, which are all medically related. Lexington law, if you can afford their services, have done soo much for me. In only two months time, they removed 25+ items off my report. Unfortunately I'm unable to continue working with them, due to the roughly $100/mo fee, which is a bit too high for me.… read more

Who is taking it?  If you are just paying taxes and insurance no one can take it from you if you send a letter of intentions and pay what you can every month.  You might put the home up for a fast sale and with the money move into something affordable while paying the six thousand.
