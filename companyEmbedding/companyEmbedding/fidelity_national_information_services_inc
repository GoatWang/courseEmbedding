Operations[edit]
FIS has a large portfolio of products for the financial services sector, including both retail and investment banking.[6]
They include "Profile" - a banking application based on the open source GT.M—a transaction processing database engine maintained by FIS.[7]
Mergers and acquisitions[edit]
Throughout its history FIS has made many significant acquisitions [8]

Alltel Information Services, 2003 $1.05 billion [8]
WebTone Technologies, 2003
Sanchez Computer Associates, 2004 $175 million [9]
Aurum Technology, 2004 [10]
BankWare, 2004 [11]
InterCept, 2004 [12]
Kordoba GmbH & Co, 2004 $163.2 million [8]
Merger with Certegy Inc.,2006 $1.8 billion [8][13]
eFunds Corporation (EFD)
Metavante Corporation, 2009 $2.94 billion in stock [14]
Compliance Coach, Inc, 2010 [15]
Capco, 2010, $292 million [16]. In May 2017 FIS sold a 60% stake in Capco to CD&R funds for $477 million.[17]
TDWI - Toronto Dominion Wealth Institutional - now re-branded as Platform Securities, 2013 [18]
mFoundry, 2013, $120 million [19]
Reliance Trust Company, 2014 [20] $110 million
Clear2Pay, 2014 [21][22] $480 million
SunGard, 2015 [23] $9.1 billion

Controversies[edit]
On July 3, 2007, Certegy Check Services, part of FIS, announced that a worker at one of its subsidiaries stole 2.3 million consumer records containing credit card, bank account, and other personal information. This estimate was later increased to 8.5 million consumer records. The next month, a law firm filed a class-action lawsuit against CCS and parent company FIS based on the privacy breach; the firm claims that, since CCS provides check-verification services to many major U.S. stores, "consumers do not choose to use the services of these companies but rather are forced to do so".[24]
In August 2011, Florida based eFunds Prepaid Solutions, part of FIS, was the victim of a sophisticated cyberattack that saw hackers steal $13 million from ATMs using 22 stolen prepaid cards belonging to a single client of FIS.[25]

Operations[edit]

They include "Profile" - a banking application based on the open source GT.M—a transaction processing database engine maintained by FIS.[7]
Mergers and acquisitions[edit]
Throughout its history FIS has made many significant acquisitions [8]

Alltel Information Services, 2003 $1.05 billion [8]
WebTone Technologies, 2003
Sanchez Computer Associates, 2004 $175 million [9]
Aurum Technology, 2004 [10]

eFunds Corporation (EFD)
Metavante Corporation, 2009 $2.94 billion in stock [14]
Compliance Coach, Inc, 2010 [15]
Capco, 2010, $292 million [16]. In May 2017 FIS sold a 60% stake in Capco to CD&R funds for $477 million.[17]
TDWI - Toronto Dominion Wealth Institutional - now re-branded as Platform Securities, 2013 [18]

Clear2Pay, 2014 [21][22] $480 million
SunGard, 2015 [23] $9.1 billion

Controversies[edit]
On July 3, 2007, Certegy Check Services, part of FIS, announced that a worker at one of its subsidiaries stole 2.3 million consumer records containing credit card, bank account, and other personal information. This estimate was later increased to 8.5 million consumer records. The next month, a law firm filed a class-action lawsuit against CCS and parent company FIS based on the privacy breach; the firm claims that, since CCS provides check-verification services to many major U.S. stores, "consumers do not choose to use the services of these companies but rather are forced to do so".[24]
In August 2011, Florida based eFunds Prepaid Solutions, part of FIS, was the victim of a sophisticated cyberattack that saw hackers steal $13 million from ATMs using 22 stolen prepaid cards belonging to a single client of FIS.[25]

Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.: Initiation of Research Coverage

            Tuesday, March 28, 2017







William Blair & Company initiated research coverage of Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (FIS $80.12), a global financial technology and services company providing solutions for retail and commercial banking, capital markets, asset and wealth management, risk and compliance, treasury, and insurance.
Analyst Chris Shutler estimated the company would generate adjusted EPS growth of 12% in 2017, to $4.29, and 12% in 2018, to $4.80, driven by low- to midsingle-digit organic revenue growth, margin expansion, debt pay-down, and share repurchases.
“FIS is one of the largest financial technology companies in the world,” Shutler said, “with services ranging from core banking and ancillary solutions such as digital banking and card processing to risk and compliance, treasury and corporate liquidity, financial recordkeeping, and consulting. Seventy-eight percent of 2016 revenue was recurring, client concentration is low, retention rates are high, adjusted EBITDA margins are 31%, and cash flow conversion is roughly on par with adjusted net income. Vendor rationalization and an increasing focus by financial institutions on total cost of ownership are advantages for FIS. In addition, the company has had boots on the ground in Asia and Latin America for years, providing a solid base from which to expand in faster-growing markets.”
Shutler continued, “FIS closed the acquisition of SunGard in November 2015. Despite pressure on capital markets, SunGard has performed well, increasing revenue 4%-5% in each of the last two years. The acquisition improved FIS’s share of wallet with many large financial institutions, and the retooling of SunGard’s salesforce from a vertical to a more horizontal approach should enhance cross-selling. The acquisition, along with FIS’s global footprint, opens the door to a wider range of future M&A opportunities than may be available to its peers.”
William Blair is a global investment banking and asset management firm. We are committed to building enduring relationships with our clients and providing expertise and solutions to meet their evolving needs.

					The first quarter of 2017 started out strong for our title business. FNF generated an 11.1% adjusted pre-tax title margin, recorded the largest amount of first quarter adjusted pre-tax title earnings in the history of the company, and experienced increases in both open and closed residential purchase orders. We expect seasonal acceleration over the next few quarters and look forward to continued strong, industry-leading performance from our title insurance business.
