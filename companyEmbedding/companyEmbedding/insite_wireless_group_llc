Experience matters
Trust your site to the largest privately owned independent tower company in the United States




When InSite’s tower division began in October 2006, it had no tower 
assets and only one tower development agreement—but experienced 
managers with valuable knowledge of the wireless infrastructure 
business allowed InSite to grow quickly. By the end of 2007, InSite’s 
tower portfolio included 50 sites. After additional acquisitions and 
new tower development through 2015, InSite today owns and operates more than 1,200 
wireless communication tower sites in the United States, Puerto Rico, 
the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Canada—and that number is 
growing every day.  InSite’s success is built on more 
than 30 years of real-world tower company experience. Our managers 
honed their skills at many other successful privately owned tower 
companies, including Mountain Union Telecom, Titan Towers, 
Vangard Wireless, Optasite, Lattice Communications, DukeNet, 
Carribbean Tower Sites, and Idaho Tower Company. Members of the 
InSite towers team have owned, managed and leased thousands of 
tower sites—and our customers and landlords benefit from our expertise 
as a result. 




       
    




  Our goal is to continue to grow and improve our portfolio of sites and level of service to our tenants and customers. What can InSite do for you? Put our experienced team to work on your next site.


We can help you get your site up and on-air quickly

    In December 2012, InSite acquired a controlling ownership interest in Turris Sites, Inc., expanding InSite’s tower portfolio into Canada. Turris Sites Inc. forms part of the Turris Group whose related entities provide engineering, procurement and project management services for communications, broadcast and wind energy applications across Canada, the United States, and internationally.

    In July 2014, InSite entered into a partnership with Lease Advisors, adding a land under towers division to InSite’s growing business. Lease Advisors is a financial services and ground lease consulting firm that works with cellular and billboard lease owners on acquisition, negotiation, and financial or real estate issues related to ground leases.

Cox Enterprises to Invest in InSite Wireless Group, LLC

		  Partnership to Focus on Continued Growth
		

Apr 19, 2012, 12:00 ET
		  		  					
						 from   Cox Enterprises, Inc. 











 
















































 

 




















 


ATLANTA and ALEXANDRIA, Va., April 19, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- Cox Enterprises, Inc. (CEI), a leading communications, media and automotive services company and its subsidiary Cox Communications (CCI), the nation's third largest cable and broadband company, today announced an investment in InSite Wireless Group, LLC ("InSite"), owner, operator and manager of wireless communication tower site facilities and distributed antenna systems (DAS) across the United States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Under terms of the agreement, CCI will contribute approximately 150 of its existing wireless towers while CEI will make an additional cash investment in InSite. Terms of the agreement were not immediately released.
Jamie Kennedy, vice president of Corporate Development for CEI, describes the new partnership as an example of Cox's strategy of helping build growth businesses within the technology, media and telecommunications sectors.
"The investment we're announcing is not only in InSite's business, but also its people. The wireless tower industry continues to see significant opportunities for growth, and InSite's experienced management team has a successful history of capitalizing on these opportunities.  Not only do they share our outlook on growing the business, but they also share similar values and goals with our other Cox companies. We look forward to working with them in the years to come," Kennedy said.
"InSite, its investors, and its employees are enthusiastic about this new relationship with Cox," said David E. Weisman, president and CEO of InSite. "We view this as a unique opportunity not only to add to our current tower portfolio, but also to continue the strong growth of both our tower and DAS divisions as we benefit from Cox's equity investment, as well as their knowledge and expertise in the communications sector."
The transaction is scheduled to close May 31, 2012. Wells Fargo Securities, LLC served as financial advisor to Cox and Dow Lohnes PLLC provided legal counsel.  InSite was represented by Kirkland & Ellis LLP and Sullivan & Worcester LLP, with advisory assistance from InSite investor Catalyst Investors.
