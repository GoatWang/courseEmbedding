Green Sense Farms, LLC
Transforming farming 


Company Information

Website:
http://www.greensensefarms.com 
Sector:
Fresh foods
Location:
Portage, IN



Green Sense Farms is the world's largest indoor vertical farm. 
By growing in a controlled indoor environment in stacking towers, it can plant 24/7 and harvest 365 days a year, pesticide, herbicide and GMO free.   
All environmental factors can be controlled including LED lights, environmental control (humidity, temperature, and CO2) and fertigation (irrigation, drainage and fertilization).
As Heather Clancy from Forbes recently wrote: “Vertical farms are capturing attention for two big reasons: local interest in produce that doesn't have to be transported hundreds of miles before it makes it to the kitchen, and the need to find new food sources for the world’s growing population. That means farmers will need to produce up to 70% more food, tough to do in a world where 80% of the land suitable for farming is already in use. It stands to reason that indoor alternatives will continue to blossom, especially in expanding urban communities.”
Green Sense Farms is currently raising funds so it can expand its operations and build a network of Farms in the USA, Canada, China and Scandinavia so its produce is always locally grown and fresh. It grows high-quality micro-greens, baby green culinary herbs and lettuces.
It can grow these high-quality crops consistently through its automated computer controls which provide the precise amount of light, nutrients, water, temperature and humidity, to create ideal growing conditions year-round.  
By putting these farms at the point of consumption and distribution, it reduces the amount of miles food travels and ensures that its crops are always fresh and nutritious.  
Its sustainable growing practices reduce waste and conserve resources, making its product good for consumers and the environment. 
It currently serves produce companies and supermarkets (like WholeFoods) that seek high-quality leafy greens and culinary herbs that are locally grown, sustainably farmed and chemical free.
Green Sense Radio Show, hosted by Founding Farmer, Robert Colangelo, is heard in syndication nationwide on 37 stations coast to coast and available through podcasts. The radio show plays an important role in its education and outreach as well as its marketing strategy.
KEY FACTS
- 2015 Revenue: $788K
- Harvest capacity ~3 million plants per year
- Opened first farm in China in August, 2016
- Innovation partners include Phillips
- Products currently distributed to grocery stores, produce companies, and select restaurants
- Harvest year-round, using a fraction of the land, water, and fertilizer of traditional field farming
EXIT STRATEGY
The company believes there is a tremendous financial opportunity for indoor vertical farming. 
Its goal is to build a network of indoor vertical farms and grow the value of its business by operating profitable Farms.  
Its options for an exit strategy might include:
- Selling the network of Farms to a strategic investor or a financial investor.
- An IPO.
- Merging with or acquiring other indoor vertical farming operations and paying investors a dividend from profits.

“Vertical farms are capturing attention for two big reasons: local interest in produce that doesn't have to be transported hundreds of miles before it makes it to the kitchen, and the need to find new food sources for the world’s growing population. That means farmers will need to produce up to 70% more food, tough to do in a world where 80% of the land suitable for farming is already in use. It stands to reason that indoor alternatives will continue to blossom, especially in expanding urban communities.” -Heather Clancy, Forbes 



Market Leader
Largest network of commercial indoor vertical farms 
Total Assets $2.6M; 2015 Revenue: $788K
Harvest capacity ~3M plants per year
Opened first farm in China in August, 2016
Primus food safety audit with a 94% or above rating 
Innovation partners include Phillips, Hortimax, Rizk Zwaan, Desert Aire and Dramm
Products currently distributed to grocery stores, produce companies, and select restaurants 
Harvest year-round, using a fraction of the land, water, and fertilizer of traditional field farming
Growing pesticide, herbicide, preservative and GMO free produce

 
Build a network of indoor vertical farms, and locate them at perishable food distribution centers owned by large grocery stores, and at institutional campuses wherever large volumes of meals are served daily. Our goal is to profitably and sustainably grow the best leafy greens in a controlled indoor environment.




We took an old idea and made it new.  Green Sense Farms is transforming farming by growing leafy green in stacking vertical towers, 365 days a year. We grow high quality crops consistently using automated computer controls which provide the precise amount of light, nutrient, water, temperature and humidity, so we can harvest year-round.  
Our first farm was built in Portage, Indiana and made its first shipment to Whole Foods Midwest distribution center in March 2014 when it was -20 degrees Fahrenheit outside. 
We are a high tech agriculture company that is constantly innovating and developing better ways to grow indoors that use less energy, reduce greenhouse gas emission, minimize waste and recycle water to produce the best crop. By putting these farms at the point of consumption and distribution, we reduce the amount of miles food travels and ensure that our vegetables are fresh and nutritious.
Green Sense Farms controls the entire process from seed-to-supermarket. We grow, pack and ship our leafy green vegetables and comply with a rigorous food safety and product traceability programs. Each year we have passed our Primus food safety audit with a 94% or above rating.   We sell micro greens, baby greens, culinary herbs and lettuces in volume to grocery stores chains and produce companies and direct to a select few restaurants.




Offering Size: Minimum $100,000; Maximum $1,000,000
Cost per Common Unit:  $100
Available Common Units: 10,000
Minimum Investment: $100
Subscriptions Closed: October 29, 2016
Reports Annual: K-1
Exit Strategy:  Green Sense Farms is a market leader in the emerging indoor vertical farming market. We believe there is a tremendous opportunity indoor vertical farming and will constantly evaluate business strategies that are in the best interest of our members to maximize the value of the Company. Our goal is to build network of indoor vertical farms and grow the value of each share through operating profitable Farms.  Our exit strategy can include:

Merge with other indoor vertical farming operations and pay investors a dividend from profits
Acquire other indoor vertical farms and pay  investors a dividend from profits
Sell the network of Farms to a strategic investor or a financial investor and investors can liquidate their shares
Evaluate an Initial Public Offering of our securities





The funds raised will  primarily be used for R&D to create new farm designs, and for pre-development activities to expand our network of farms  with remaining funds for operating capital. 
Farm locations will target perishable food distribution centers at major grocery store chains, and institutional campus locations: including hospitals, military bases, colleges, and corporate campuses in the United States, Canada, Scandinavia, and China. 



 
Green Sense Farms’ mission is to farm sustainably, creating an environment that is good for our workers and the planet while generating a profit. We take a common sense approach to making the world a better place to live.  
For the first time ever, we’re making a public offering in order to build a community of like minded individuals that support sustainable farming that's changing the world.



We continue to perfect our indoor growing technology and formed partnerships with leading Dutch and American horticultural companies to create a proprietary state of the art growing system (Phillips, Hortimax, Rizk Zwaan, Desert Aire and Dramm). 
From our first 20,000 sq./ft. farm in Portage, Indiana, we are expanding our farm network and have 10 farms in our development pipeline in the USA, Canada, China and Scandinavia.  Our current business model is to design, build, operate and own indoor vertical farms in the USA; and to own a minority interest with a local operating partner for farms offshore. In March 2015, Green Sense Farms formed a Hong Kong company to partner with Star Global Agriculture to build a network of farms in China to serve a growing middle class population that is demanding chemical free produce. We broke ground for the first farm in December  2015 and became  operational in August, 2016.  Located in the city of Shenzhen, with a population of 48 million people within 50 miles of the Farm. 
Our long term goal is to expand our network of vegetable farms and then to spin off  a biopharmaceutical business that grows plant proteins using non-GMO seeds that can be synthesized into vaccines and medicine.
We have also developed a sustainability course with  Indiana University South Bend, called the Art of Sustainability. This course is now taught annually and includes a final mural painted by the class. These murals will be hung in every future Green Sense Farm.
Green Sense Radio Show, hosted by Founding Farmer, Robert Colangelo, is heard in syndication nationwide on 37 stations coast to coast and available through podcasts. The radio show plays an important role in our education and outreach as well as our marketing strategy.
 We also have additional revenue channels that include pharmaceutical plant proteins and consumer packaged goods that we plan to bring on line within the next 5 years.




Robert Colangelo is a scientist, author and environmental entrepreneur who founded several leading market based organizations that include: Environmental Planning Group, American Business Center Nizhnevartovsk, Siberia, Russia, Brownfield Development LLC, Environomics Communications, Brownfield News magazine, The National Brownfield Association, The Surplus Property Roundtable, Green Sense radio show and Green Sense Farms, LLC.

What is vertical farming?
Vertical farming is the practice of growing produce in vertically stacked layers using controlled-environment agriculture (CEA) technology. All environmental factors can be controlled including LED lights, environmental control (humidity, temperature, CO2...) and fertigation (irrigation, drainage and fertilization).

What is the difference between vertical farming and field farming?
Field Farms have to mitigate much more risks, animals, pests, invasive species, weather, drought and have a much greater impact on the environment. By growing indoor without the use of pesticides, and precisely controlling  the water, nutrients and light a consistent crop can be grown year round with minimal impact to the environment. 

What kind of crops are suitable for a vertical farms?
Farming is stratifying and indoor vertical farms are best to grow leafy green vegetables, greenhouses are great for tomatoes, peppers and cucumbers and field farms are well suited to grow commodity crops such as wheat, corn and soybeans.  

What are the costs of building  a vertical farm?
An indoor vertical farm with two individual climate controlled grow rooms, with a seeding area , packing area, cooler and shipping area,  cost approximately $3 million to build, excluding a building.  Space is typically leased.

How often can you grow crops? 
The time to grow  a plant to maturity varies based on the cultivar.  Microgreens can be grown in 8-12 days, culinary herbs and baby greens in 20-35 days and lettuces in  30-40 days.  We have developed a process which allows us to accelerate the growth time by placing the plant in different areas during various phases (germination, nursery and growth) so that we can turn over our growth towers more times each year.  

Will I incur any additional costs outside of my investment?
There is a one time $2.50 transactional charge for every $100 invested. Green Sense Farms is a new company and we’re experiencing rapid growth since we shipped our first crop in March 2014. Each investor should carefully assess the risk with investing in any new company and conduct the property due diligence, and is responsible for covering this cost.

While we can share some information, other material is quite sensitive and could impair our operation and future success if discovered by others in the farm-tech industry. This report is an annual communication to investors, and will address both 2016 activities and forward looking projections.The SEC requires that any issuer that sold securities under a Title III Regulation Crowdfunding offering will post an annual report 120 days after the end of the fiscal year for investors to review. Our financial page on the StartEngine website will have this information and can be found at https://www.startengine.com/startup/green-sense-farms-llc.In addition, we will periodically post investor information to the company website www.greensensefarms.com under the Investor Relations tab. Occasionally we will send direct emails to investors on actionable items, so please keep your email and all contact information current. All inquiries should be directed to Rob Schlyer, General Counsel & Manager Investor Relations rschlyer@greensensefarms.comOverviewGreen Sense Farms, LLC, is an Indiana limited liability company (“GSF” or the “Company”) whose goal is to build a vegetable brand that is “nationally known and locally grown” by establishing a network of indoor vertical farms.Established in 2012, GSF is currently the largest US based commercial indoor vertical farm. Our expansion plan is to design, build, own and operate farms in the USA and Canada and to design, oversee construction and license our growing technology to local operating partners in Scandinavia and Asia Pacific countries. GSF grows leafy greens in grow rooms where all inputs are controlled, creating an ideal environment for consistent, healthy, plant growth. The temperature, humidity, air flow and lighting are constantly monitored in the grow rooms. The nutritious produce includes, micro greens, baby greens, culinary herbs and lettuces and sold to consumers within approximately 250 miles of the farm. Sustainable farming practices can increase overall crop yields, and provide healthy foods to the growing population year-round, with little impact to the environment.We are better vertical farm designers because we operate and grow produce in a vertical farm; and we are better growers because we also design and build vertical farms. The goal of the Company is to build farms that have the same equipment and operational design so that they can be easily replicated and operated to consistently grow high yield quality crops wherever they are located.According to a forecast published in the New Market Research report in January 2017:Vertical Farming Market by Growth Mechanism (Hydroponics, Aeroponics, and Aquaponics), Structure (Building Based and Shipping Container), Offering (Hardware, Software, and Service), Crop Type, and Geography - Global Forecast to 2022, the vertical farming market is estimated to be valued at USD 5.80 Billion by 2022, growing at a CAGR of 24.8% between 2016 and 2022. The factors driving the growth of the vertical farming market include high quality food with no use of pesticides, less dependency on the weather for production, growing urban population, increase in the year around production of the crops, and reduced impact on the environment.According to the 2016 State of Indoor Vertical Farming Report published by Agrilist One of the reasons indoor farming is gaining significant traction in the United States is the ability to produce more while using less resources. According to the United States Department of Agriculture’s (UDSA) July projection for the 2016 - 2017 growing year, corn prices range from $3.10 - $3.70 per bushel and farms are producing an average of 168 bushels per acre; conventional lettuce and tomatoes are between 23 and 25x more productive at about $12,000 and $13,000 per acre respectively.In comparison, on a revenue basis alone, indoor horticulture is about 4,000x more productive than conventional outdoor commodity farming; indoor cannabis is about 9,000x more productive. Responses came from growers around the world, including the United States, Canada, the Caribbean, Slovakia, Taiwan, Bahrain, Dubai, Tunisia, Finland, Belgium, China, and Japan. Indoor vertical farms and hydroponic greenhouses were the most prominent primary facility type of survey respondents. Small farms primarily consisted of indoor vertical farms while larger farms primarily consisted of hydroponic greenhouses.Indoor vertical farming is a new emerging market with great growth potential. Green Sense Farm is an early entrant and at the tip of the spear of this new market, poised for rapid growth.Goals & Accomplishments We have been calculated in our expansion, and frugal with our capital. We are positioned to be a significant long-term player in this growing market. Benchmarking against other large commercial indoor vertical farms in our industry, we have invested 1/10th the capital to prove our technology, generate sales, refine our business model and to build expansion farms. Our short-term focus is to continue to build market share by constructing our farm network at institutional campuses and grocery store perishable food distribution centers. Under our business model, our produce is fresher, travels fewer food miles, and can be more competitive with conventionally grown leafy greens and herbs than other indoor vertical farms. To accomplish this goal, we require patient capital to fund expansion in this emerging market. We are in discussions with family offices, accredited investors, impact investment funds and private equity for the next tranche of capital.Green Sense Farms has progressed in line with our strategic goals. Our accomplishments for 2016 include the following:· Formed strategic partnerships with industry leaders· Tested and installed new equipment· Conducted R&D on growing process· Developed new farm design· Built and turned on China Farm· Filled farm development pipeline· Launched Online Public Offering (OPO)· Updated website, and implemented marketing and PR planGoals for 2017 include:· Increase produce sales at the Portage Farm· Employ new management at the Portage Farm· Begin construction on the South Bend and Las Vegas farms· Identify a local operating partner to license technology in target countries· Conduct R&D on new cultivars· Continue to fill the farm development pipeline in the USA, Asia Pacific, Canada and Scandinavia· Raise expansion capital to fund farm expansion Technology Green Sense Farms has a superior indoor growing technology. The Company deployed significant time, capital and resources in establishing technology partnerships, and installing/testing/fine-tuning new fertigation, HVAC and water treatment systems at the Portage farm. We continue to refine a new and improved farm design (that will be deployed in future farms). In 2016, research also began on conveyance systems, testing LED lights from new manufacturers, designing new growing trays and tubs, and refining nutrient recipes.Green Sense Farms has created partnerships with the leading providers of greenhouse technology and growing equipment and integrated their proven technologies into our growing system, rather than developing all equipment in-house. We have determined that it’s more efficient to partner with experts in different disciplines then to develop from scratch. This also allows us to be more efficient with R&D spending as we can leverage our technology partners’ resources in this market. To date we have partnerships with:◦ Rizk Zwaan, Non-GMO seeds.◦ Hortimax, Fertigation, sensors and automation controls◦ Desert Aire, HVAC dehumidification and cooling equipment◦ Dramm, Pre-water treatment and return water treatment◦ Phillips, LED lightingLED lights are the most critical and expensive part of our growing system. The manufacture of LED horticultural growing lights has become a very competitive business as technology advances, and prices decrease. This has accelerated our search for other LED light vendors, and to consider using multiple vendors, rather than aligning with one LED light partner. We are currently looking to form partnership with racking, automation, ventilation and renewable energy companies.Farm Expansion DomesticGreen Sense Farms’ revenue model has two streams: revenue from farm produce sales; and, revenues for license agreements to local operating partners in target expansion countries. Much effort was spent in 2016 identifying locations to build future farms. We have more than 10 prospective farm projects in the development pipeline.Currently at the top of the domestic list are the South Bend, Indiana, and Las Vegas, Nevada, farms. The South Bend farm will be built in a partnership with Ivy Tech Community College. This location will be our first “Earn to Learn” training center/working commercial farm. The “Earn to Learn” farm will train much-needed growers, farmers and packers as well as create job-ready graduates to work in the produce and food service industries. This project demonstrates our recognition of the shortage of qualified indoor growers, and works toward a solution. Ivy Tech has approved and will deed 0.8 acres of land on campus to Green Sense Farms and the City of South Bend has approved a low-cost loan from a revolving loan fund to improve the property. Preliminary site plans and farm design are complete and we are scheduled to begin construction in Q3 2017.The Las Vegas farm’s produce will be initially purchased exclusively by a large casino located on the strip. We are in the process of identifying potential locations to build the farm and have been directed to break ground by September 2017.Additional expansion farms are possible in 2017. We have met with the CEO of a publicly-traded food company and are conducting a feasibility study to build farms adjacent to their production facilities. We are also in discussion with grocery store chains to build farms at their distribution centers, each serving more than 200 stores. We have started trial sales at one chain’s retail store in Portage.  International Farm License  The farm in Shenzhen China is operational. All equipment has been installed, the farm is turned on, and growth trials have begun. Green Sense Farms has fulfilled our obligations under the existing agreement. We have restructured the relationship with our China partner and have transitioned from an equity partner under our new agreement.For future international expansion, we have determined it is in the best interest of the company to enter into a licensing agreement with a local operating partner that has the capability to build a network of farms in country, in lieu of retaining a minority equity position. The local operating partner will be responsible for marketing, sales, distribution of produce, as well as managing day-to-day farm operations. Green Sense Farms will design, procure and oversee construction for a development fee, plus a licensing fee and a percentage of gross annual sales. We are in discussion with several parties in Asia Pacific and Scandinavia countries regarding this arrangement. OPOGreen Sense Farms was one of the first 50 companies to launch an Online Public Offering (OPO) in compliance with the SEC regulations that now allow for the sale of equity online through Regulation Crowd Funding. In addition, the Company has been one of the most successful companies raising Title III crowdfunding in the USA. Our efforts were noted in the May 2017 issue of Inc. magazine in an article on Regulation Crowd Funding efforts:“This month, BrewDog became the first crowdfunded "unicorn," when it raised $264 million from American private equity firm TSG Consumer Partners. Prior to taking institutional capital, BrewDog had raised money from tens of thousands of average investors across the U.K. The most recent round valued the Scottish company at more than $1 billion.A crowdfunded American unicorn could be close behind. Since the Jumpstart Our Businesses Startups, or JOBS, Act passed under then-President Barack Obama in 2012, a growing number of U.S. small businesses have raised cash from so-called non-accredited investors. (Previously, private companies could not advertise stock offerings to these investors, nor could they accept money from them in exchange for equity.)On the leading edge of this trend stateside is Green Sense Farms, an Indiana-based indoor farming startup which raised more than $600,000 on the equity crowdfunding site StartEngine. And last year, San Francisco startup Cruise Automation--which makes technology for self-driving cars--sold to General Motors for more than $1 billion, having raised some money via AngelList.”As of the closing on December 31st, and after reconciling the final accounting, the Company raised more than $628,000 through 380 investors and ranked 7th as most capital raised from a Title III offering in 2016.Challenges As a leader in the emerging indoor vertical farming market, Green Sense Farms encounters challenges daily including managing growth and assimilating new technology into our grow system. Green Sense Farms is restructuring the Company and will be forming a parent company with each expansion farm to be held in a separate LLC owned by the parent. Details of this restructuring will be forthcoming, and equity positions in Green Sense Farms, LLC will hold an equal initial ownership position in the to be formed parent company.The Portage farm has evolved into both a working commercial farm and test center for growth trials of new cultivars, equipment and technology.

This reduced the amount of expected licensing revenue; and sales from the Portage farm were short of projections because it took longer to install, test and operate updated HVAC and fertigation equipment impacting produce quality and supply. The new equipment is now operational and will add efficiency and consistency to future production at the Portage farm. Expenses were reduced commensurate with income.  Green Sense Farms, LLC Profit and LossJanuary - December 2016Total Income 442,277.25Cost of Goods Sold 120,558.03Gross Profit 321,719.22 Operating Expenses843,396.91Operating Income(521,677.69)Total Other Expenses248,404.16Net Loss before Income Taxes(770,081.85)Income Tax Benefit169,400.00Net Loss(600,681.85)Green Sense Farms, LLC Balance SheetAs of December 31, 2016ASSETS Total Current Assets423,709.21Total Fixed Assets1,693,140.72Total Other Assets643,321.00TOTAL ASSETS2,760,170.93LIABILITIES AND EQUITY Total Liabilities1,441,198.29Total Equity1,318,972.64 TOTAL LIABILITIES AND EQUITY2,760,170.93  Sustainability Sustainability is key to Green Sense Farms’ operations; we understand that conserving resources is good for the environment and for the bottom line.

          What is equity crowdfunding?
        

          10 months ago
        

Some of you have likely talked to family and friends about this campaign and have heard them ask, “What is equity crowdfunding?”Tell them this: Equity crowdfunding is a unique opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a company. It used to be that only wealthy people could invest in companies and get big payouts when they did well, but now everyone can.With rewards-based crowdfunding (like you see on Indiegogo and Kickstarter), backers get a reward, usually the product being created. With equity crowdfunding (like all the companies you see on StartEngine), backers get a piece of the company.As a backer, you understand this. But The JOBS Act, which brought about equity crowdfunding, was just signed into law in 2012, so many people are still unaware that they can participate in this kind of investment.Therefore, part of every campaign is education. For us, that means explaining equity crowdfunding along with vertical farming and its benefits. We appreciate not only your investment, but also your willingness to help your networks understand what we’re doing here.So please, share this campaign today. Use the copy above for emails, or the copy below for social media:Twitter:With #equitycrowdfunding you can own a piece of @GreenSenseFarms and play a part in the future of #farming! http://bit.ly/GSFcrowdFacebook:Think you can’t be an investor? You can with equity crowdfunding. Help transform farming by investing in Green Sense Farms, the nation’s largest indoor, vertical farm. http://bit.ly/GSFcrowdThank you!

That means farmers will need to produce up to 70% more food, tough to do in a world where 80% of the land suitable for farming is already in use. It stands to reason that indoor alternatives will continue to blossom, especially in expanding urban communities.”Green Sense Farms is currently raising funds so it can expand its operations and build a network of Farms in the USA, Canada, China and Scandinavia so its produce is always locally grown and fresh. It grows high-quality micro-greens, baby green culinary herbs and lettuces.It can grow these high-quality crops consistently through its automated computer controls which provide the precise amount of light, nutrients, water, temperature and humidity, to create ideal growing conditions year-round.By putting these farms at the point of consumption and distribution, it reduces the amount of miles food travels and ensures that its crops are always fresh and nutritious.Its sustainable growing practices reduce waste and conserve resources, making its product good for consumers and the environment.It currently serves produce companies and supermarkets (like WholeFoods) that seek high-quality leafy greens and culinary herbs that are locally grown, sustainably farmed and chemical free.Green Sense Radio Show, hosted by Founding Farmer, Robert Colangelo, is heard in syndication nationwide on 37 stations coast to coast and available through podcasts. The radio show plays an important role in its education and outreach as well as its marketing strategy.KEY FACTS– 2015 Revenue: $788K– Harvest capacity ~3 million plants per year– Opened first farm in China in August, 2016– Innovation partners include Phillips– Products currently distributed to grocery stores, produce companies, and select restaurants– Harvest year-round, using a fraction of the land, water, and fertilizer of traditional field farmingEXIT STRATEGYThe company believes there is a tremendous financial opportunity for indoor vertical farming.Its goal is to build a network of indoor vertical farms and grow the value of its business by operating profitable Farms.Its options for an exit strategy might include:– Selling the network of Farms to a strategic investor or a financial investor.– An IPO.– Merging with or acquiring other indoor vertical farming operations and paying investors a dividend from profits.
