"The Sage Brook Apartment Complex is strategically located in an infill location, just three miles from the upscale Cherry Creek neighborhood, and in the center of the region's three largest employment areas with close proximity to Downtown Denver, the Denver Tech Corridor, and the Fitzsimons Innovation Campus," added Norman A.
