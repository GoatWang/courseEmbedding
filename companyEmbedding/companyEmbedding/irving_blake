Blake IrvingYodel AnecdotalFormer Yahoo and Microsoft executive Blake Irving has been named CEO of controversial web hosting company Go Daddy.
Most recently, Irving led products for Yahoo. He left in April, when Scott Thompson was CEO. Thompson fired 2,000 people, many of whom worked in Irving's division. 
Go Daddy was a private, controversial company for a long time. Its former CEO videotaped himself killing an elephant. It supported SOPA, the bill that everyone on the Internet hated. And then there's those Super Bowl ads featuring Danica Patrick and top heavy ladies.
Go Daddy advertising!That's probably changing now. Not just because of Irving. Go Daddy was sold for $2 billion to an investment group last year. That investment group will either want to take Go Daddy public or sell it for more than $2 billion to someone else.
We're scheduled to talk to Irving about his new role, which seems like a big departure from running products at Yahoo. We'll have more on that later.
In the meanwhile, here's the release:
GO DADDY APPOINTS BLAKE IRVING AS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICERTechnology Veteran Brings Product Development Focus to Go Daddy SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (Dec. 11, 2012) – Go Daddy, the world’s largest provider of Web hosting, domain name registrations and new SSL Certificates, today announced Blake Irving, formerly a long time Microsoft executive and Chief Product Officer of Yahoo! Incorporated (“Yahoo”), will assume the role of Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), effective January 7, 2013.  Irving will succeed Scott Wagner, a Member of KKR who has been serving as interim CEO since July. “Go Daddy, the industry leader of Web hosting solutions for small and medium businesses, is poised for a promising future,” said Go Daddy Executive Chairman and Founder Bob Parsons. “Blake Irving's deep technology experience and his history of developing new cutting-edge products and leading large global teams make him an enormously compelling choice to drive Go Daddy to the next level of its domestic and global growth.  Go Daddy has made great strides with Scott Wagner as CEO, and we look forward to building on that in the future.” Go Daddy has recently been expanding its market-leading products to support its nearly 11 million customers, mostly small business customers both domestically and internationally.  This summer, Go Daddy acquired Outright.com, a cloud-based financial management application and the company also formed a partnership with DudaMobile to launch mobile Website Builder, a service that automates the integration of Web and mobile sites to save businesses time and expand their customer reach. “I’m honored for the opportunity to lead such a talented team and to be a part of such an innovative company,” Blake Irving said. “Go Daddy is and will continue to be the hub where businesses can come to life, grow and prosper. We strive to be the global resource that fuels success for countless entrepreneurs and innovators around the world. As a long time Go Daddy customer, I have seen firsthand an organization that is committed to its customers 24 hours a day and seven days a week and yet there still remains much more we can do to enhance the customer experience. This is a fantastic opportunity, and I can’t wait to hit the ground running in January.” "Go Daddy is fortunate to have Blake Irving join the team for the next chapter in his long time career as an innovator," said Scott Wagner, Go Daddy's Interim CEO. "I’m thrilled for Blake and I am thrilled for Go Daddy. We have good momentum on product and our international growth and having someone with Blake’s talent and character lead the company will only accelerate it.” About Blake IrvingBlake Irving has been appointed Chief Executive Officer of Go Daddy, effective January 7, 2013, and will also join the Go Daddy Board of Directors. Irving most recently served as Chief Product Officer at Yahoo! Incorporated, where he developed and rolled out the unified product vision and strategy – growing the company to nearly one billion active PC and mobile users.  Prior to Yahoo, he spent 15 years at Microsoft, serving in various senior roles, most recently as Corporate Vice President of the Windows Live Platform.  While at Microsoft, Irving was responsible for creating and leading a global development and operations organization of more than 4,000 employees in the creation and operation of Microsoft’s global online services, launching several new products, including MSN Messenger and growing Hotmail from 7 million to 290 million users.  Mr. Irving currently serves on the Board of GolfLogix, a Scottsdale, Ariz.-based mobile Web company.  He has also served as a professor at Pepperdine University.  He is a graduate of San Diego State and received an MBA degree from Pepperdine University.   To find out more about how to get online easily and affordably, visit www.GoDaddy.com.

Early life[edit]
Blake Irving was born on August 8, 1959, to James Scott Irving and Patricia Ann Irving in Ohio.[citation needed] Irving’s parents had met in the Los Angeles, California area. Both were involved in the jazz music scene while Jim attended school at UCLA. Patty worked at Rand Corporation and put Jim through law school. As a child, Irving's father was in the FBI and consequently moved the family around the country. [1] Irving lived with his brother, Scott, and his sisters, Lisa and Lori.[citation needed]
Education[edit]
Blake continued to play drums and create art through High School in Southern California, playing in high school bands, jazz quartets, big bands, college bands [2] and competing in Percussive Arts Society (PAS) competitions in jazz and rudimental drumming. Blake also privately taught music lessons, as well as wrote music for high school drum lines. Following his parents’ path of “music as avocation,” in 1977 Blake attended Cal State Northridge as a business major. He quickly changed to art with a focus on typography and continued to play in jazz bands. He is a graduate of San Diego State University and received an MBA degree from Pepperdine University. [3]
Career[edit]
Xerox[edit]
Irving started his professional career at Xerox. In 1980 during his Junior year, he was asked to interview and took employment at Xerox Corporation where they had formed an early digital typography group called “The Font Center” as a Digital Typographer. Irving was a part of the team in the early PARC days of WYSIWIG,[4] where he was designing early display and printer fonts. During his time at Xerox he was involved in numerous products and services including: typography, communications on the personal computer, subscription services and back end online advertising. Within Xerox, Blake transitioned from designing fonts for displays and printers to working as a PM on printers, then multimedia PCs. After receiving his MBA and receiving the Chairman’s award for innovation at Xerox, Irving took a role at Okidata in Mt Laurel New Jersey as a product manager. Blake left Okidata after receiving a strong offer from Compaq computer one year later. Blake was originally recruited to Compaq to start their printer group but a financial downturn moved Irving to their multimedia group instead.
Microsoft[edit]
As Corporate Vice President[5] of the Windows Live Platform Blake led the company’s global Internet development and operations, managing a $1 billion global R&D budget and overseeing development teams in the US, India, China and Europe.[6] Irving also served as Corporate Vice President of MSN Communication Services[7][8] and Member of Platform Group of MessageCast Inc. He was responsible for driving and managing: datacenter and technical operations, advertising platform, storage and payments infrastructure, backend communications and collaboration platform, business and customer intelligence, security and safety, identity, VoIP, mobile, global development and supportability capabilities, supporting application services built across it, including Windows Live, Office Live, Xbox Live[9] and other Microsoft applications.[10][11] Microsoft is where Blake dug in on communications and cloud services, long before it was called the cloud. Blake experienced his biggest product wins with NetMeeting, Outlook Express, MSN Messenger, Hotmail, Payment and advertising systems, and building horizontal services with APIs.
Yahoo![edit]
Blake Irving served as the Chief Product Officer of Yahoo! Inc.[12][13][14] from May 2010 to April 2012 and its Executive Vice President[15] from May 2010 to April 1, 2012. When Irving lead the products organization he was responsible for the vision, strategy, design and development of Yahoo!'s global consumer and advertiser product portfolio. At Yahoo! Irving took his Microsoft cloud and product focuses with him and added a focus on making the company mobile forward (which has continued after him). During his time at Yahoo!. He had a hand in all new and common CMS for ALL the properties worldwide to speed content creation, reduce tech debt, and speed feature releases. Blake left Yahoo! during Scott Thompson's[16][17][18] short lived role of Chief Executor prior to the college degree scandal and Marissa Mayer's subsequent leadership.

GoDaddy[edit]
Blake Irving gave up his semi-retirement to become the Chief Executive Office at the GoDaddy Group Inc.[19][20][21][22] and officially joined January 7, 2013. Initially becoming CEO was never a thought before he was approached:
“I didn’t really know what they had,” he said. “I thought they were basically a domains business. But this is the best front door for small business that there is on the Internet today. I got more and more interested and realized this was exactly what I wanted,” said Irving.[23][dead link]
Under Blake’s leadership, the company has ditched the sexually provocative commercials.[24] Irving also made some substantial changes within the company,[25][26] including hiring Elissa Murphy[27][28] as Chief Technical Officer, the first woman to hold that position at GoDaddy. Irving and Murphy created the GoDaddy Women in Technology network, a professional development group. Irving instilled growth into the company by acquiring, in alphabetical order: Afternic, Locu, MDot, Media Temple, Mad Mimi, Ronin and more. Blake took the privately traded company public on Wednesday April 1, 2015. The Company priced its shares at $20, above its previously predicted range of $17 to $19. Under Irving the stock commenced trading on the NYSE at $6.15 a share on and closed at the same price. Blake is known for being a fun CEO; he is spotted around the office rocking GoDaddy colored kicks, shorts, and a tee shirt. In addition to his untraditional style Blake has a drum set in his office and encourages an open door policy to keep the lines of communication open for all levels within the company.
Movements[edit]
Women in Technology[edit]
Blake was an executive producer of CODE: Debugging the Gender Gap,[29][30][31] a documentary that — through interviews, animation and clever flashpoints in popular culture — examines the reasons why more girls and people of color don’t seek opportunities in computer science. The documentary explores how cultural mindsets, stereotypes, educational hurdles and sexism all play roles in this national crisis.
In 2015,[32] Blake Irving took the stage at Grace Hopper as a keynote speaker where he released GoDaddy’s gender data on stage. Blake’s commitment to understanding the gender gap resulted in positive remarks from audience members in person and via Twitter.[33]
Net Neutrality[edit]
Blake Irving believes that the internet is the greatest force for economic and social change.[34][35] Irving believes that this positive force can connect people to other people, ideas and marketplaces like never before. In 2014, the FCC made a decision to alter the way the internet operates by permitting individually negotiated data rates for websites, thus creating fast and slow lanes for internet traffic. In response to this, Irving sent an sent an open letter[36][37] to the FCC Chairman, Thomas Wheeler. Irving is a supporter for a free and open internet and believes that Net Neutrality is critical for the future of innovation and ideas, the health of small business in the US, and the health of the U.S. economy as a whole.

GoDaddy Doubles Down On Product With A New CEO: Ex-Yahoo Product Chief Blake Irving

GoDaddy, the web-domain registration and hosting company with some 11 million users and some 50 million+ domain registrations under its management, is today announcing a new CEO, Blake Irving. Irving’s most recent, high-profile role prior to this had been as chief product officer at Yahoo, but he left in April 2012 — before the reign of Marissa Mayer and around the time that about 2,000 product people were laid off from the company, largely from his division. He will formally take up the role of CEO at GoDaddy on January 7, 2013.
Before GoDaddy, Irving had been at Microsoft, where he held a number of roles over the course of 15 years, including corporate VP of Windows Live, the company’s online services portfolio that includes Hotmail and MSN Messenger.
GoDaddy itself has been through some major changes of its own and has been without a permanent CEO for some time. Prior to Irving’s appointment, Scott Wagner, of GoDaddy shareholder/part owner KKR, has been serving as interim CEO since July 2012. KKR, along with an investor group that included Silver Lake Partners and Technology Crossover Ventures, became the owners of GoDaddy in 2011 for $2.25 billion.
GoDaddy, once slated to go public as far back as 2006, has had its ups and downs as a company: from being one of the biggest players in domain registration and management services, to controversial stories about its founder (and remaining executive chairman Bob Parsons), to major site outages.
More recently, it has been a  is slowly reinventing itself to focus more on enhanced services, and products, which  it can offer to its customers — mainly small and medium enterprises — on top of basic domain registration and hosting services, as a way of creating new revenue streams. This is where Irving’s experience both at Yahoo and Microsoft (where he would have developed some nous about small and medium business customers as well) will come in handy.
The shift to products and services has taken GoDaddy in some different directions. One of them has been into the area of mobile, helping companies optimize their sites for wireless devices, and run mobile commerce operations through those sites.
That strategy shift has also seen GoDaddy make its first acquisition earlier this year, of financial services company Outright. And we have heard there will be more acquisitions on the cards in the future.
Release below.

GO DADDY APPOINTS BLAKE IRVING AS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER
Technology Veteran Brings Product Development Focus to Go Daddy
SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (Dec. 11, 2012) – Go Daddy, the world’s largest provider of Web hosting, domain name registrations and new SSL Certificates, today announced Blake Irving, formerly a long time Microsoft executive and Chief Product Officer of Yahoo! Incorporated (“Yahoo”), will assume the role of Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), effective January 7, 2013.  Irving will succeed Scott Wagner, a Member of KKR who has been serving as interim CEO since July.
“Go Daddy, the industry leader of Web hosting solutions for small and medium businesses, is poised for a promising future,” said Go Daddy Executive Chairman and Founder Bob Parsons. “Blake Irving’s deep technology experience and his history of developing new cutting-edge products and leading large global teams make him an enormously compelling choice to drive Go Daddy to the next level of its domestic and global growth.  Go Daddy has made great strides with Scott Wagner as CEO, and we look forward to building on that in the future.”
Go Daddy has recently been expanding its market-leading products to support its nearly 11 million customers, mostly small business customers both domestically and internationally.  This summer, Go Daddy acquired Outright.com, a cloud-based financial management application and the company also formed a partnership with DudaMobile to launch mobile Website Builder, a service that automates the integration of Web and mobile sites to save businesses time and expand their customer reach.
“I’m honored for the opportunity to lead such a talented team and to be a part of such an innovative company,” Blake Irving said. “Go Daddy is and will continue to be the hub where businesses can come to life, grow and prosper. We strive to be the global resource that fuels success for countless entrepreneurs and innovators around the world. As a long time Go Daddy customer, I have seen firsthand an organization that is committed to its customers 24 hours a day and seven days a week and yet there still remains much more we can do to enhance the customer experience. This is a fantastic opportunity, and I can’t wait to hit the ground running in January.”
“Go Daddy is fortunate to have Blake Irving join the team for the next chapter in his long time career as an innovator,” said Scott Wagner, Go Daddy’s Interim CEO. “I’m thrilled for Blake and I am thrilled for Go Daddy. We have good momentum on product and our international growth and having someone with Blake’s talent and character lead the company will only accelerate it.”
About Blake Irving
Blake Irving has been appointed Chief Executive Officer of Go Daddy, effective January 7, 2013, and will also join the Go Daddy Board of Directors.
Irving most recently served as Chief Product Officer at Yahoo! Incorporated, where he developed and rolled out the unified product vision and strategy – growing the company to nearly one billion active PC and mobile users.  Prior to Yahoo, he spent 15 years at Microsoft, serving in various senior roles, most recently as Corporate Vice President of the Windows Live Platform.  While at Microsoft, Irving was responsible for creating and leading a global development and operations organization of more than 4,000 employees in the creation and operation of Microsoft’s global online services, launching several new products, including MSN Messenger and growing Hotmail from 7 million to 290 million users.
Mr. Irving currently serves on the Board of GolfLogix, a Scottsdale, Ariz.-based mobile Web company.  He has also served as a professor at Pepperdine University.  He is a graduate of San Diego State and received an MBA degree from Pepperdine University.

Early life[edit]
Blake Irving was born on August 8, 1959, to James Scott Irving and Patricia Ann Irving in Ohio.[citation needed] Irving’s parents had met in the Los Angeles, California area. Both were involved in the jazz music scene while Jim attended school at UCLA. Patty worked at Rand Corporation and put Jim through law school. As a child, Irving's father was in the FBI and consequently moved the family around the country. [1] Irving lived with his brother, Scott, and his sisters, Lisa and Lori.[citation needed]
Education[edit]
Blake continued to play drums and create art through High School in Southern California, playing in high school bands, jazz quartets, big bands, college bands [2] and competing in Percussive Arts Society (PAS) competitions in jazz and rudimental drumming. Blake also privately taught music lessons, as well as wrote music for high school drum lines. Following his parents’ path of “music as avocation,” in 1977 Blake attended Cal State Northridge as a business major. He quickly changed to art with a focus on typography and continued to play in jazz bands. He is a graduate of San Diego State University and received an MBA degree from Pepperdine University. [3]
Career[edit]
Xerox[edit]
Irving started his professional career at Xerox. In 1980 during his Junior year, he was asked to interview and took employment at Xerox Corporation where they had formed an early digital typography group called “The Font Center” as a Digital Typographer. Irving was a part of the team in the early PARC days of WYSIWIG,[4] where he was designing early display and printer fonts. During his time at Xerox he was involved in numerous products and services including: typography, communications on the personal computer, subscription services and back end online advertising. Within Xerox, Blake transitioned from designing fonts for displays and printers to working as a PM on printers, then multimedia PCs. After receiving his MBA and receiving the Chairman’s award for innovation at Xerox, Irving took a role at Okidata in Mt Laurel New Jersey as a product manager. Blake left Okidata after receiving a strong offer from Compaq computer one year later. Blake was originally recruited to Compaq to start their printer group but a financial downturn moved Irving to their multimedia group instead.
Microsoft[edit]
As Corporate Vice President[5] of the Windows Live Platform Blake led the company’s global Internet development and operations, managing a $1 billion global R&D budget and overseeing development teams in the US, India, China and Europe.[6] Irving also served as Corporate Vice President of MSN Communication Services[7][8] and Member of Platform Group of MessageCast Inc. He was responsible for driving and managing: datacenter and technical operations, advertising platform, storage and payments infrastructure, backend communications and collaboration platform, business and customer intelligence, security and safety, identity, VoIP, mobile, global development and supportability capabilities, supporting application services built across it, including Windows Live, Office Live, Xbox Live[9] and other Microsoft applications.[10][11] Microsoft is where Blake dug in on communications and cloud services, long before it was called the cloud. Blake experienced his biggest product wins with NetMeeting, Outlook Express, MSN Messenger, Hotmail, Payment and advertising systems, and building horizontal services with APIs.
Yahoo![edit]
Blake Irving served as the Chief Product Officer of Yahoo! Inc.[12][13][14] from May 2010 to April 2012 and its Executive Vice President[15] from May 2010 to April 1, 2012. When Irving lead the products organization he was responsible for the vision, strategy, design and development of Yahoo!'s global consumer and advertiser product portfolio. At Yahoo! Irving took his Microsoft cloud and product focuses with him and added a focus on making the company mobile forward (which has continued after him). During his time at Yahoo!. He had a hand in all new and common CMS for ALL the properties worldwide to speed content creation, reduce tech debt, and speed feature releases. Blake left Yahoo! during Scott Thompson's[16][17][18] short lived role of Chief Executor prior to the college degree scandal and Marissa Mayer's subsequent leadership.

GoDaddy[edit]
Blake Irving gave up his semi-retirement to become the Chief Executive Office at the GoDaddy Group Inc.[19][20][21][22] and officially joined January 7, 2013. Initially becoming CEO was never a thought before he was approached:
“I didn’t really know what they had,” he said. “I thought they were basically a domains business. But this is the best front door for small business that there is on the Internet today. I got more and more interested and realized this was exactly what I wanted,” said Irving.[23][dead link]
Under Blake’s leadership, the company has ditched the sexually provocative commercials.[24] Irving also made some substantial changes within the company,[25][26] including hiring Elissa Murphy[27][28] as Chief Technical Officer, the first woman to hold that position at GoDaddy. Irving and Murphy created the GoDaddy Women in Technology network, a professional development group. Irving instilled growth into the company by acquiring, in alphabetical order: Afternic, Locu, MDot, Media Temple, Mad Mimi, Ronin and more. Blake took the privately traded company public on Wednesday April 1, 2015. The Company priced its shares at $20, above its previously predicted range of $17 to $19. Under Irving the stock commenced trading on the NYSE at $6.15 a share on and closed at the same price. Blake is known for being a fun CEO; he is spotted around the office rocking GoDaddy colored kicks, shorts, and a tee shirt. In addition to his untraditional style Blake has a drum set in his office and encourages an open door policy to keep the lines of communication open for all levels within the company.
Movements[edit]
Women in Technology[edit]
Blake was an executive producer of CODE: Debugging the Gender Gap,[29][30][31] a documentary that — through interviews, animation and clever flashpoints in popular culture — examines the reasons why more girls and people of color don’t seek opportunities in computer science. The documentary explores how cultural mindsets, stereotypes, educational hurdles and sexism all play roles in this national crisis.
In 2015,[32] Blake Irving took the stage at Grace Hopper as a keynote speaker where he released GoDaddy’s gender data on stage. Blake’s commitment to understanding the gender gap resulted in positive remarks from audience members in person and via Twitter.[33]
Net Neutrality[edit]
Blake Irving believes that the internet is the greatest force for economic and social change.[34][35] Irving believes that this positive force can connect people to other people, ideas and marketplaces like never before. In 2014, the FCC made a decision to alter the way the internet operates by permitting individually negotiated data rates for websites, thus creating fast and slow lanes for internet traffic. In response to this, Irving sent an sent an open letter[36][37] to the FCC Chairman, Thomas Wheeler. Irving is a supporter for a free and open internet and believes that Net Neutrality is critical for the future of innovation and ideas, the health of small business in the US, and the health of the U.S. economy as a whole.

Early life[edit]
Blake Irving was born on August 8, 1959, to James Scott Irving and Patricia Ann Irving in Ohio.[citation needed] Irving’s parents had met in the Los Angeles, California area. Both were involved in the jazz music scene while Jim attended school at UCLA. Patty worked at Rand Corporation and put Jim through law school. As a child, Irving's father was in the FBI and consequently moved the family around the country. [1] Irving lived with his brother, Scott, and his sisters, Lisa and Lori.[citation needed]
Education[edit]
Blake continued to play drums and create art through High School in Southern California, playing in high school bands, jazz quartets, big bands, college bands [2] and competing in Percussive Arts Society (PAS) competitions in jazz and rudimental drumming. Blake also privately taught music lessons, as well as wrote music for high school drum lines. Following his parents’ path of “music as avocation,” in 1977 Blake attended Cal State Northridge as a business major. He quickly changed to art with a focus on typography and continued to play in jazz bands. He is a graduate of San Diego State University and received an MBA degree from Pepperdine University. [3]
Career[edit]
Xerox[edit]
Irving started his professional career at Xerox. In 1980 during his Junior year, he was asked to interview and took employment at Xerox Corporation where they had formed an early digital typography group called “The Font Center” as a Digital Typographer. Irving was a part of the team in the early PARC days of WYSIWIG,[4] where he was designing early display and printer fonts. During his time at Xerox he was involved in numerous products and services including: typography, communications on the personal computer, subscription services and back end online advertising. Within Xerox, Blake transitioned from designing fonts for displays and printers to working as a PM on printers, then multimedia PCs. After receiving his MBA and receiving the Chairman’s award for innovation at Xerox, Irving took a role at Okidata in Mt Laurel New Jersey as a product manager. Blake left Okidata after receiving a strong offer from Compaq computer one year later. Blake was originally recruited to Compaq to start their printer group but a financial downturn moved Irving to their multimedia group instead.
Microsoft[edit]
As Corporate Vice President[5] of the Windows Live Platform Blake led the company’s global Internet development and operations, managing a $1 billion global R&D budget and overseeing development teams in the US, India, China and Europe.[6] Irving also served as Corporate Vice President of MSN Communication Services[7][8] and Member of Platform Group of MessageCast Inc. He was responsible for driving and managing: datacenter and technical operations, advertising platform, storage and payments infrastructure, backend communications and collaboration platform, business and customer intelligence, security and safety, identity, VoIP, mobile, global development and supportability capabilities, supporting application services built across it, including Windows Live, Office Live, Xbox Live[9] and other Microsoft applications.[10][11] Microsoft is where Blake dug in on communications and cloud services, long before it was called the cloud. Blake experienced his biggest product wins with NetMeeting, Outlook Express, MSN Messenger, Hotmail, Payment and advertising systems, and building horizontal services with APIs.
Yahoo![edit]
Blake Irving served as the Chief Product Officer of Yahoo! Inc.[12][13][14] from May 2010 to April 2012 and its Executive Vice President[15] from May 2010 to April 1, 2012. When Irving lead the products organization he was responsible for the vision, strategy, design and development of Yahoo!'s global consumer and advertiser product portfolio. At Yahoo! Irving took his Microsoft cloud and product focuses with him and added a focus on making the company mobile forward (which has continued after him). During his time at Yahoo!. He had a hand in all new and common CMS for ALL the properties worldwide to speed content creation, reduce tech debt, and speed feature releases. Blake left Yahoo! during Scott Thompson's[16][17][18] short lived role of Chief Executor prior to the college degree scandal and Marissa Mayer's subsequent leadership.

GoDaddy[edit]
Blake Irving gave up his semi-retirement to become the Chief Executive Office at the GoDaddy Group Inc.[19][20][21][22] and officially joined January 7, 2013. Initially becoming CEO was never a thought before he was approached:
“I didn’t really know what they had,” he said. “I thought they were basically a domains business. But this is the best front door for small business that there is on the Internet today. I got more and more interested and realized this was exactly what I wanted,” said Irving.[23][dead link]
Under Blake’s leadership, the company has ditched the sexually provocative commercials.[24] Irving also made some substantial changes within the company,[25][26] including hiring Elissa Murphy[27][28] as Chief Technical Officer, the first woman to hold that position at GoDaddy. Irving and Murphy created the GoDaddy Women in Technology network, a professional development group. Irving instilled growth into the company by acquiring, in alphabetical order: Afternic, Locu, MDot, Media Temple, Mad Mimi, Ronin and more. Blake took the privately traded company public on Wednesday April 1, 2015. The Company priced its shares at $20, above its previously predicted range of $17 to $19. Under Irving the stock commenced trading on the NYSE at $6.15 a share on and closed at the same price. Blake is known for being a fun CEO; he is spotted around the office rocking GoDaddy colored kicks, shorts, and a tee shirt. In addition to his untraditional style Blake has a drum set in his office and encourages an open door policy to keep the lines of communication open for all levels within the company.
Movements[edit]
Women in Technology[edit]
Blake was an executive producer of CODE: Debugging the Gender Gap,[29][30][31] a documentary that — through interviews, animation and clever flashpoints in popular culture — examines the reasons why more girls and people of color don’t seek opportunities in computer science. The documentary explores how cultural mindsets, stereotypes, educational hurdles and sexism all play roles in this national crisis.
In 2015,[32] Blake Irving took the stage at Grace Hopper as a keynote speaker where he released GoDaddy’s gender data on stage. Blake’s commitment to understanding the gender gap resulted in positive remarks from audience members in person and via Twitter.[33]
Net Neutrality[edit]
Blake Irving believes that the internet is the greatest force for economic and social change.[34][35] Irving believes that this positive force can connect people to other people, ideas and marketplaces like never before. In 2014, the FCC made a decision to alter the way the internet operates by permitting individually negotiated data rates for websites, thus creating fast and slow lanes for internet traffic. In response to this, Irving sent an sent an open letter[36][37] to the FCC Chairman, Thomas Wheeler. Irving is a supporter for a free and open internet and believes that Net Neutrality is critical for the future of innovation and ideas, the health of small business in the US, and the health of the U.S. economy as a whole.

Blake Irving, Yahoo chief product officer, quits

Yahoo's chief product officer has resigned from the Sunnyvale Internet giant, raising new questions about the future of the embattled company's applications and services.
Blake Irving, who joined Yahoo in 2010 after a long career at Microsoft, leaves amid a major restructuring effort that led 2,000 employees to be laid off starting this week. Through a spokeswoman, Irving declined to comment on his departure.
But Irving's departure, which was first reported by technology website All Things D, represents another significant loss to a company that has seen top executives leave in droves. This week's layoffs are said to have disproportionately affected the products division that Irving oversaw.

"These products seem to be being eradicated, disassembled, or possibly sold off," said Rebecca Lieb, an analyst with the Altimeter Group. "Why would you stay on to run something that isn't there, or is going to be greatly diminished or eviscerated? Nobody wants to run the horse-and-buggy division."
Irving was teaching business at Pepperdine University in Malibu when then-CEO Carol Bartz recruited him to oversee Yahoo's diverse range of products, which include some of the Web's most popular sites for e-mail, news, sports and finance. Since then he has worked to streamline Yahoo's product strategy. 
Irving served as the company's public face last fall, after Bartz's ouster, as the company unveiled new apps at its November "Product Runway" event. Among the apps Irving showcased were Livestand, an iPad magazine designed to compete with Flipboard, and the tablet version of Into Now, a companion app for watching television. Both have struggled to gain traction.
Now, future of those products appears cloudy. Yahoo CEO Scott Thompson, who was appointed in January, has called an all-hands meeting for Tuesday to discuss Yahoo's next steps. 
Although the company is still profitable, it has posted revenue declines for 12 consecutive quarters. Its core advertising business has struggled to rival against competing ad platforms developed by Google and Facebook.

Early life[edit]
Blake Irving was born on August 8, 1959, to James Scott Irving and Patricia Ann Irving in Ohio.[citation needed] Irving’s parents had met in the Los Angeles, California area. Both were involved in the jazz music scene while Jim attended school at UCLA. Patty worked at Rand Corporation and put Jim through law school. As a child, Irving's father was in the FBI and consequently moved the family around the country. [1] Irving lived with his brother, Scott, and his sisters, Lisa and Lori.[citation needed]
Education[edit]
Blake continued to play drums and create art through High School in Southern California, playing in high school bands, jazz quartets, big bands, college bands [2] and competing in Percussive Arts Society (PAS) competitions in jazz and rudimental drumming. Blake also privately taught music lessons, as well as wrote music for high school drum lines. Following his parents’ path of “music as avocation,” in 1977 Blake attended Cal State Northridge as a business major. He quickly changed to art with a focus on typography and continued to play in jazz bands. He is a graduate of San Diego State University and received an MBA degree from Pepperdine University. [3]
Career[edit]
Xerox[edit]
Irving started his professional career at Xerox. In 1980 during his Junior year, he was asked to interview and took employment at Xerox Corporation where they had formed an early digital typography group called “The Font Center” as a Digital Typographer. Irving was a part of the team in the early PARC days of WYSIWIG,[4] where he was designing early display and printer fonts. During his time at Xerox he was involved in numerous products and services including: typography, communications on the personal computer, subscription services and back end online advertising. Within Xerox, Blake transitioned from designing fonts for displays and printers to working as a PM on printers, then multimedia PCs. After receiving his MBA and receiving the Chairman’s award for innovation at Xerox, Irving took a role at Okidata in Mt Laurel New Jersey as a product manager. Blake left Okidata after receiving a strong offer from Compaq computer one year later. Blake was originally recruited to Compaq to start their printer group but a financial downturn moved Irving to their multimedia group instead.
Microsoft[edit]
As Corporate Vice President[5] of the Windows Live Platform Blake led the company’s global Internet development and operations, managing a $1 billion global R&D budget and overseeing development teams in the US, India, China and Europe.[6] Irving also served as Corporate Vice President of MSN Communication Services[7][8] and Member of Platform Group of MessageCast Inc. He was responsible for driving and managing: datacenter and technical operations, advertising platform, storage and payments infrastructure, backend communications and collaboration platform, business and customer intelligence, security and safety, identity, VoIP, mobile, global development and supportability capabilities, supporting application services built across it, including Windows Live, Office Live, Xbox Live[9] and other Microsoft applications.[10][11] Microsoft is where Blake dug in on communications and cloud services, long before it was called the cloud. Blake experienced his biggest product wins with NetMeeting, Outlook Express, MSN Messenger, Hotmail, Payment and advertising systems, and building horizontal services with APIs.
Yahoo![edit]
Blake Irving served as the Chief Product Officer of Yahoo! Inc.[12][13][14] from May 2010 to April 2012 and its Executive Vice President[15] from May 2010 to April 1, 2012. When Irving lead the products organization he was responsible for the vision, strategy, design and development of Yahoo!'s global consumer and advertiser product portfolio. At Yahoo! Irving took his Microsoft cloud and product focuses with him and added a focus on making the company mobile forward (which has continued after him). During his time at Yahoo!. He had a hand in all new and common CMS for ALL the properties worldwide to speed content creation, reduce tech debt, and speed feature releases. Blake left Yahoo! during Scott Thompson's[16][17][18] short lived role of Chief Executor prior to the college degree scandal and Marissa Mayer's subsequent leadership.

GoDaddy[edit]
Blake Irving gave up his semi-retirement to become the Chief Executive Office at the GoDaddy Group Inc.[19][20][21][22] and officially joined January 7, 2013. Initially becoming CEO was never a thought before he was approached:
“I didn’t really know what they had,” he said. “I thought they were basically a domains business. But this is the best front door for small business that there is on the Internet today. I got more and more interested and realized this was exactly what I wanted,” said Irving.[23][dead link]
Under Blake’s leadership, the company has ditched the sexually provocative commercials.[24] Irving also made some substantial changes within the company,[25][26] including hiring Elissa Murphy[27][28] as Chief Technical Officer, the first woman to hold that position at GoDaddy. Irving and Murphy created the GoDaddy Women in Technology network, a professional development group. Irving instilled growth into the company by acquiring, in alphabetical order: Afternic, Locu, MDot, Media Temple, Mad Mimi, Ronin and more. Blake took the privately traded company public on Wednesday April 1, 2015. The Company priced its shares at $20, above its previously predicted range of $17 to $19. Under Irving the stock commenced trading on the NYSE at $6.15 a share on and closed at the same price. Blake is known for being a fun CEO; he is spotted around the office rocking GoDaddy colored kicks, shorts, and a tee shirt. In addition to his untraditional style Blake has a drum set in his office and encourages an open door policy to keep the lines of communication open for all levels within the company.
Movements[edit]
Women in Technology[edit]
Blake was an executive producer of CODE: Debugging the Gender Gap,[29][30][31] a documentary that — through interviews, animation and clever flashpoints in popular culture — examines the reasons why more girls and people of color don’t seek opportunities in computer science. The documentary explores how cultural mindsets, stereotypes, educational hurdles and sexism all play roles in this national crisis.
In 2015,[32] Blake Irving took the stage at Grace Hopper as a keynote speaker where he released GoDaddy’s gender data on stage. Blake’s commitment to understanding the gender gap resulted in positive remarks from audience members in person and via Twitter.[33]
Net Neutrality[edit]
Blake Irving believes that the internet is the greatest force for economic and social change.[34][35] Irving believes that this positive force can connect people to other people, ideas and marketplaces like never before. In 2014, the FCC made a decision to alter the way the internet operates by permitting individually negotiated data rates for websites, thus creating fast and slow lanes for internet traffic. In response to this, Irving sent an sent an open letter[36][37] to the FCC Chairman, Thomas Wheeler. Irving is a supporter for a free and open internet and believes that Net Neutrality is critical for the future of innovation and ideas, the health of small business in the US, and the health of the U.S. economy as a whole.

Yahoo Confirms Hiring of Former Microsoft Exec Blake Irving as Chief Product Officer


April 19, 2010 at 6:15 am PT

Tweet  
  Share

 Print
 



Yahoo said it has hired former Microsoft exec Blake Irving (pictured here) as its chief product officer.
Reporting directly to CEO Carol Bartz, Yahoo (YHOO) said in a statement, Irving will “lead the company’s products organization, which is responsible for the vision, strategy, design and development of Yahoo!’s global consumer and advertiser product portfolio.”
In other words, the exec many think the company desperately needs to spur innovation.
Irving replaces Ari Balogh, who announced last week he is leaving the company as of June 3.
Balogh was also CTO, but Yahoo did not say who would get that title.
In related news, Prabhakar Raghavan, head of Yahoo Labs as chief scientist, will now report directly to Bartz.
The Yahoo announcement confirms a post BoomTown wrote last week about the company’s effort to hire Irving, a longtime Microsoft (MSFT) exec whose last job there was corporate VP of its Windows Live Platform group.
He left the software giant several years ago to spend time with his family and had been teaching at Pepperdine University.
Irving had been at Microsoft for 15 years, always commuting to its Redmond, Wash., headquarters.
According to his Facebook page, Irving now lives in laid-back San Luis Obispo, midway between Silicon Valley and Los Angeles.
Sources said after time off, Irving had recently become eager to re-engage in the Internet sector.
Yahoo has long wanted to hire Irving, many said. And in nabbing him, the timing is fortuitous, as the company is in the midst of launching its massive search and online advertising partnership with Microsoft.
The hiring also stems the tide of Yahoo’s exec exodus. Balogh’s parting is one of many among top Yahoo execs recently. Ad sales head Joanne Bradford departed the company to join Demand Media, while longtime tech exec Ash Patel said he would not return from a sabbatical he took last year.
Here’s Irving’s post on his own hire on Yahoo’s Yodel Anecdotal blog:
Yodeling Hello to Yahoo!
As the newest Yahoo! employee, at the risk of being highly corny, I’m delighted to yodel my first purple-hued shout-out to the 600 million people and tens of thousands of advertisers and publishers who enjoy Yahoo!’s products every day.
Some of you might ask why anyone would say goodbye to surfing and cycling the Central Coast of California or travelling the globe with their family to take on the job of leading products and technology at Yahoo! My answer’s pretty easy–meet just some of the brilliant people at Yahoo! that want to change the world, and then scan the amazing list of leading products around the globe these people have delivered at scale. When I think about what this company has meant to anyone who has used the Internet, worked in the Internet industry, or wanted to reach people across the world, there is simply none better.
From wildly popular services like Yahoo! Mail, Yahoo! Messenger, Flickr and Yahoo!’s mobile sites and apps, to Yahoo!’s best-in-class content properties like Yahoo! News, Yahoo! Finance and Yahoo! Sports, to many, many other great products across the world, Yahoo!’s product portfolio continues to be the envy of the industry.  Those incredible services and their respective audiences bring tremendous value for advertisers, which is why Yahoo! serves up 10 billion ads across its network every day and is the #1 publisher of online display advertising. How can anyone not want to be a part of that?
And that’s just what consumers and advertisers see from the outside. Inside Yahoo!, there’s technological and scientific brilliance everywhere you look. With 500 patents, one of the world’s largest cloud computing infrastructures, and top scientific talent across computer science, machine learning, economics and social sciences, I’m awed at the caliber of people I’m going to be working with. The intellectual horsepower doesn’t stop there–I’m looking forward to working with some of the smartest and best-in-class talent around the world in marketing, advertising sales, partnerships, programming, service engineering and operations. The commitment Yahoos have shown over the years to delivering the best experience to both consumers and advertisers is one of the key things that attracted me here. We’re in the business of delivering bespoke experiences to our consumers, partners and advertisers and I’m looking forward to working with all of you to build on that reality.
This week marks an exciting new journey for me personally, and I’m thrilled to be sharing my experiences and background with the world class people at Yahoo! We have big opportunities, as well as big challenges ahead of us, and I’m getting ready to dive in and work with this great team to make Yahoo! even more central to daily online life than it has been over the past decade and a half.
My first day in the office will be May 17th and I can’t wait to get started. Stay tuned for more as I get settled and dig in with my new team.
‘Nuff said.
–By Blake Irving, Future Chief Product Officer, Yahoo!
And here’s the official press release:
Blake Irving Joins Yahoo! as Chief Product Officer
Chief Scientist Position, Held by Prabhakar Raghavan, Elevated to Report to CEO Bartz
Sunnyvale, California–April 19, 2010–Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ: YHOO) today announced the appointment of Blake Irving as Chief Product Officer. In related news, Prabhakar Raghavan will continue to lead innovation efforts at Yahoo! Labs as Chief Scientist. Both Irving and Raghavan will report directly to Carol Bartz, CEO. This new leadership will focus on speeding key inputs and decision making into product strategy and direction.
Ari Balogh, current head of products and technology, will be leaving the company on June 3 for personal reasons and will work closely with Irving to ensure a smooth transition. Irving will assume the position on May 17.
“Blake brings to Yahoo! genuine large scale Internet expertise from a mature company known for world-class technology. In addition, Prabhakar has invaluable technological insights and expertise that I look forward to having my executive team hear more directly,” said Bartz. “With leaders like Blake and Prabhakar, I am confident that we will increase technological innovation and deliver against our vision to be the center of people’s online lives.”
“Yahoo! has an impressive product and technology portfolio that has provided unparalleled value to its customers at scale,” said Irving. “I look forward to working with the team to bring forward more unique and highly personal experiences to Yahoo! consumers, deliver on the company’s promise of Science, Art and Scale to Yahoo! advertisers, and develop the amazing talent at the company so we may continue to deliver more and faster innovations to the market.”
As Chief Product Officer, Irving will lead the company’s products organization, which is responsible for the vision, strategy, design and development of Yahoo!’s global consumer and advertiser product portfolio.
Irving was most recently a professor at Pepperdine University’s Graziadio School of Business and Management in Malibu, California. In his prior role as corporate vice president of the Windows Live Platform group, Irving led a team of 4,000 to build and operate Microsoft’s Internet-scale services platform, advertiser and developer ecosystem. Irving also held a variety of development and general management positions at Microsoft.
Before joining Microsoft, Irving held development and product marketing management positions at Xerox Corp., Oki Electric Industry Co. Ltd. and Compaq Computer Corp. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree from San Diego State University and a Master’s degree in business administration from Pepperdine University.
Raghavan joined Yahoo! in 2005, and serves as Chief Scientist and head of Yahoo! Labs. Raghavan’s research priorities include text and web mining, and algorithm design. Prior to joining Yahoo!, Raghavan was the chief technology officer at Verity and held a number of technical and managerial positions at IBM Research. He is a consulting professor of Computer Science at Stanford University and former editor-in-chief of the Journal of the Association of Computing Machinery. He has co-authored two textbooks on randomized algorithms and information retrieval. Raghavan received his PhD from Berkeley and is a member of the National Academy of Engineering, as well as a fellow of the ACM and of the IEEE.

GoDaddy CEO Blake Irving Is More Than Just a 'Product Guy' | Fortune.comTechSearchSearchTeslaTesla Model 3: Everything You Need to KnowTelecommunicationsSprint Seeks Merger with Charter Communications: ReportCOMPARECARDSSPONSOREDFoxconnEnvironmental Regulations Would Be Waived For Planned Foxconn PlantDGital Mediafortune unfilteredGoDaddy CEO Blake Irving Is More Than Just a ‘Product Guy’Jasper SchererAug 08, 2016Blake Irving, CEO of the web hosting company GoDaddy (gddy), is a self-professed "product guy." He spent his 15-year career at Microsoft (msft) in a range of engineering and product management roles, then ran the product team at Yahoo before taking the top post at GoDaddy.But that’s only part of the picture. Irving is also a band geek, cyclist, and skater. He began taking drumming lessons at age 7 after his family moved to California,  playing into his 20s before realizing music was a tough way to make a steady living.After Microsoft, Irving took his family on a one-year trip around the world. During a stop in Hong Kong, he accompanied his kids to a skatepark, where word quickly got out that the guy who launched MSN Messenger was in attendance. At the time, the IM service held a 90% share of messaging outside the United States, according to Irving."I had kids walking up to me having me sign skateboards,” Irving told Aaron Task on this week's episode of Fortune Unfiltered. “And my kids are looking at me like, 'What the hell's that about? This is my dad, he's kind of a doofus.'"Listen to the whole conversation here:GoDaddy hired Irving as CEO in December 2012. He agreed to the gig after reviewing a document with some of GoDaddy's company data; the numbers blew him away.“The customers were incredibly loyal, their brand recognition was very high, they had grown at an incredibly rapid rate,” Irving said. “I believed that the company could be a powerful platform for people like me that were trying to take an idea and turn it into something powerful.”The only problem was that GoDaddy had built ultra-high brand recognition behind an advertising strategy seen by some as provocative and salacious. Irving said the ads had alienated potential customers, like women who owned small businesses.“What I wanted to do was make sure that we did a great job representing women in the way that they deserve to be represented as small business owners,” Irving said.It’s also personal for Irving, who lost his sister Lori when she was in her 30s. She was a leading expert on eating disorders and the media’s effect on women’s body image, Irving said.“My promise to her was, I was going to do everything I could in my power, in my technology area, my chosen field, to do as much as I could to forward her work,” he said. “It just turns out that GoDaddy was a place where I could do a lot of that.”After Irving took over, the company began a campaign of ads that, as Irving describes it, didn't use women "as an object so much as it did use them as somebody who represents a vast population of Americans.""They're powerful businesspeople that work their tails off to be successful," Irving said. "It's just the way that they should be portrayed."Customer ServiceSite MapPrivacy PolicyAdvertisingAd ChoicesTerms of UseYour California Privacy RightsCareers© 2017 Time Inc.

Early life[edit]
Blake Irving was born on August 8, 1959, to James Scott Irving and Patricia Ann Irving in Ohio.[citation needed] Irving’s parents had met in the Los Angeles, California area. Both were involved in the jazz music scene while Jim attended school at UCLA. Patty worked at Rand Corporation and put Jim through law school. As a child, Irving's father was in the FBI and consequently moved the family around the country. [1] Irving lived with his brother, Scott, and his sisters, Lisa and Lori.[citation needed]
Education[edit]
Blake continued to play drums and create art through High School in Southern California, playing in high school bands, jazz quartets, big bands, college bands [2] and competing in Percussive Arts Society (PAS) competitions in jazz and rudimental drumming. Blake also privately taught music lessons, as well as wrote music for high school drum lines. Following his parents’ path of “music as avocation,” in 1977 Blake attended Cal State Northridge as a business major. He quickly changed to art with a focus on typography and continued to play in jazz bands. He is a graduate of San Diego State University and received an MBA degree from Pepperdine University. [3]
Career[edit]
Xerox[edit]
Irving started his professional career at Xerox. In 1980 during his Junior year, he was asked to interview and took employment at Xerox Corporation where they had formed an early digital typography group called “The Font Center” as a Digital Typographer. Irving was a part of the team in the early PARC days of WYSIWIG,[4] where he was designing early display and printer fonts. During his time at Xerox he was involved in numerous products and services including: typography, communications on the personal computer, subscription services and back end online advertising. Within Xerox, Blake transitioned from designing fonts for displays and printers to working as a PM on printers, then multimedia PCs. After receiving his MBA and receiving the Chairman’s award for innovation at Xerox, Irving took a role at Okidata in Mt Laurel New Jersey as a product manager. Blake left Okidata after receiving a strong offer from Compaq computer one year later. Blake was originally recruited to Compaq to start their printer group but a financial downturn moved Irving to their multimedia group instead.
Microsoft[edit]
As Corporate Vice President[5] of the Windows Live Platform Blake led the company’s global Internet development and operations, managing a $1 billion global R&D budget and overseeing development teams in the US, India, China and Europe.[6] Irving also served as Corporate Vice President of MSN Communication Services[7][8] and Member of Platform Group of MessageCast Inc. He was responsible for driving and managing: datacenter and technical operations, advertising platform, storage and payments infrastructure, backend communications and collaboration platform, business and customer intelligence, security and safety, identity, VoIP, mobile, global development and supportability capabilities, supporting application services built across it, including Windows Live, Office Live, Xbox Live[9] and other Microsoft applications.[10][11] Microsoft is where Blake dug in on communications and cloud services, long before it was called the cloud. Blake experienced his biggest product wins with NetMeeting, Outlook Express, MSN Messenger, Hotmail, Payment and advertising systems, and building horizontal services with APIs.
Yahoo![edit]
Blake Irving served as the Chief Product Officer of Yahoo! Inc.[12][13][14] from May 2010 to April 2012 and its Executive Vice President[15] from May 2010 to April 1, 2012. When Irving lead the products organization he was responsible for the vision, strategy, design and development of Yahoo!'s global consumer and advertiser product portfolio. At Yahoo!

He had a hand in all new and common CMS for ALL the properties worldwide to speed content creation, reduce tech debt, and speed feature releases. Blake left Yahoo! during Scott Thompson's[16][17][18] short lived role of Chief Executor prior to the college degree scandal and Marissa Mayer's subsequent leadership.

GoDaddy[edit]
Blake Irving gave up his semi-retirement to become the Chief Executive Office at the GoDaddy Group Inc.[19][20][21][22] and officially joined January 7, 2013. Initially becoming CEO was never a thought before he was approached:
“I didn’t really know what they had,” he said. “I thought they were basically a domains business. But this is the best front door for small business that there is on the Internet today. I got more and more interested and realized this was exactly what I wanted,” said Irving.[23][dead link]
Under Blake’s leadership, the company has ditched the sexually provocative commercials.[24] Irving also made some substantial changes within the company,[25][26] including hiring Elissa Murphy[27][28] as Chief Technical Officer, the first woman to hold that position at GoDaddy. Irving and Murphy created the GoDaddy Women in Technology network, a professional development group. Irving instilled growth into the company by acquiring, in alphabetical order: Afternic, Locu, MDot, Media Temple, Mad Mimi, Ronin and more. Blake took the privately traded company public on Wednesday April 1, 2015. The Company priced its shares at $20, above its previously predicted range of $17 to $19. Under Irving the stock commenced trading on the NYSE at $6.15 a share on and closed at the same price. Blake is known for being a fun CEO; he is spotted around the office rocking GoDaddy colored kicks, shorts, and a tee shirt. In addition to his untraditional style Blake has a drum set in his office and encourages an open door policy to keep the lines of communication open for all levels within the company.
Movements[edit]
Women in Technology[edit]
Blake was an executive producer of CODE: Debugging the Gender Gap,[29][30][31] a documentary that — through interviews, animation and clever flashpoints in popular culture — examines the reasons why more girls and people of color don’t seek opportunities in computer science. The documentary explores how cultural mindsets, stereotypes, educational hurdles and sexism all play roles in this national crisis.
In 2015,[32] Blake Irving took the stage at Grace Hopper as a keynote speaker where he released GoDaddy’s gender data on stage. Blake’s commitment to understanding the gender gap resulted in positive remarks from audience members in person and via Twitter.[33]
Net Neutrality[edit]
Blake Irving believes that the internet is the greatest force for economic and social change.[34][35] Irving believes that this positive force can connect people to other people, ideas and marketplaces like never before. In 2014, the FCC made a decision to alter the way the internet operates by permitting individually negotiated data rates for websites, thus creating fast and slow lanes for internet traffic. In response to this, Irving sent an sent an open letter[36][37] to the FCC Chairman, Thomas Wheeler. Irving is a supporter for a free and open internet and believes that Net Neutrality is critical for the future of innovation and ideas, the health of small business in the US, and the health of the U.S. economy as a whole.

Early life[edit]
Blake Irving was born on August 8, 1959, to James Scott Irving and Patricia Ann Irving in Ohio.[citation needed] Irving’s parents had met in the Los Angeles, California area. Both were involved in the jazz music scene while Jim attended school at UCLA. Patty worked at Rand Corporation and put Jim through law school. As a child, Irving's father was in the FBI and consequently moved the family around the country. [1] Irving lived with his brother, Scott, and his sisters, Lisa and Lori.[citation needed]
Education[edit]
Blake continued to play drums and create art through High School in Southern California, playing in high school bands, jazz quartets, big bands, college bands [2] and competing in Percussive Arts Society (PAS) competitions in jazz and rudimental drumming. Blake also privately taught music lessons, as well as wrote music for high school drum lines. Following his parents’ path of “music as avocation,” in 1977 Blake attended Cal State Northridge as a business major. He quickly changed to art with a focus on typography and continued to play in jazz bands. He is a graduate of San Diego State University and received an MBA degree from Pepperdine University. [3]
Career[edit]
Xerox[edit]
Irving started his professional career at Xerox. In 1980 during his Junior year, he was asked to interview and took employment at Xerox Corporation where they had formed an early digital typography group called “The Font Center” as a Digital Typographer. Irving was a part of the team in the early PARC days of WYSIWIG,[4] where he was designing early display and printer fonts. During his time at Xerox he was involved in numerous products and services including: typography, communications on the personal computer, subscription services and back end online advertising. Within Xerox, Blake transitioned from designing fonts for displays and printers to working as a PM on printers, then multimedia PCs. After receiving his MBA and receiving the Chairman’s award for innovation at Xerox, Irving took a role at Okidata in Mt Laurel New Jersey as a product manager. Blake left Okidata after receiving a strong offer from Compaq computer one year later. Blake was originally recruited to Compaq to start their printer group but a financial downturn moved Irving to their multimedia group instead.
Microsoft[edit]
As Corporate Vice President[5] of the Windows Live Platform Blake led the company’s global Internet development and operations, managing a $1 billion global R&D budget and overseeing development teams in the US, India, China and Europe.[6] Irving also served as Corporate Vice President of MSN Communication Services[7][8] and Member of Platform Group of MessageCast Inc. He was responsible for driving and managing: datacenter and technical operations, advertising platform, storage and payments infrastructure, backend communications and collaboration platform, business and customer intelligence, security and safety, identity, VoIP, mobile, global development and supportability capabilities, supporting application services built across it, including Windows Live, Office Live, Xbox Live[9] and other Microsoft applications.[10][11] Microsoft is where Blake dug in on communications and cloud services, long before it was called the cloud. Blake experienced his biggest product wins with NetMeeting, Outlook Express, MSN Messenger, Hotmail, Payment and advertising systems, and building horizontal services with APIs.
Yahoo![edit]
Blake Irving served as the Chief Product Officer of Yahoo! Inc.[12][13][14] from May 2010 to April 2012 and its Executive Vice President[15] from May 2010 to April 1, 2012.

Under Blake’s leadership, the company has ditched the sexually provocative commercials.[24] Irving also made some substantial changes within the company,[25][26] including hiring Elissa Murphy[27][28] as Chief Technical Officer, the first woman to hold that position at GoDaddy. Irving and Murphy created the GoDaddy Women in Technology network, a professional development group. Irving instilled growth into the company by acquiring, in alphabetical order: Afternic, Locu, MDot, Media Temple, Mad Mimi, Ronin and more. Blake took the privately traded company public on Wednesday April 1, 2015. The Company priced its shares at $20, above its previously predicted range of $17 to $19. Under Irving the stock commenced trading on the NYSE at $6.15 a share on and closed at the same price. Blake is known for being a fun CEO; he is spotted around the office rocking GoDaddy colored kicks, shorts, and a tee shirt. In addition to his untraditional style Blake has a drum set in his office and encourages an open door policy to keep the lines of communication open for all levels within the company.
Movements[edit]
Women in Technology[edit]
Blake was an executive producer of CODE: Debugging the Gender Gap,[29][30][31] a documentary that — through interviews, animation and clever flashpoints in popular culture — examines the reasons why more girls and people of color don’t seek opportunities in computer science. The documentary explores how cultural mindsets, stereotypes, educational hurdles and sexism all play roles in this national crisis.
In 2015,[32] Blake Irving took the stage at Grace Hopper as a keynote speaker where he released GoDaddy’s gender data on stage. Blake’s commitment to understanding the gender gap resulted in positive remarks from audience members in person and via Twitter.[33]
Net Neutrality[edit]
Blake Irving believes that the internet is the greatest force for economic and social change.[34][35] Irving believes that this positive force can connect people to other people, ideas and marketplaces like never before. In 2014, the FCC made a decision to alter the way the internet operates by permitting individually negotiated data rates for websites, thus creating fast and slow lanes for internet traffic. In response to this, Irving sent an sent an open letter[36][37] to the FCC Chairman, Thomas Wheeler. Irving is a supporter for a free and open internet and believes that Net Neutrality is critical for the future of innovation and ideas, the health of small business in the US, and the health of the U.S. economy as a whole.

Early life[edit]
Blake Irving was born on August 8, 1959, to James Scott Irving and Patricia Ann Irving in Ohio.[citation needed] Irving’s parents had met in the Los Angeles, California area. Both were involved in the jazz music scene while Jim attended school at UCLA. Patty worked at Rand Corporation and put Jim through law school. As a child, Irving's father was in the FBI and consequently moved the family around the country. [1] Irving lived with his brother, Scott, and his sisters, Lisa and Lori.[citation needed]
Education[edit]
Blake continued to play drums and create art through High School in Southern California, playing in high school bands, jazz quartets, big bands, college bands [2] and competing in Percussive Arts Society (PAS) competitions in jazz and rudimental drumming. Blake also privately taught music lessons, as well as wrote music for high school drum lines. Following his parents’ path of “music as avocation,” in 1977 Blake attended Cal State Northridge as a business major. He quickly changed to art with a focus on typography and continued to play in jazz bands. He is a graduate of San Diego State University and received an MBA degree from Pepperdine University. [3]
Career[edit]
Xerox[edit]
Irving started his professional career at Xerox. In 1980 during his Junior year, he was asked to interview and took employment at Xerox Corporation where they had formed an early digital typography group called “The Font Center” as a Digital Typographer. Irving was a part of the team in the early PARC days of WYSIWIG,[4] where he was designing early display and printer fonts. During his time at Xerox he was involved in numerous products and services including: typography, communications on the personal computer, subscription services and back end online advertising. Within Xerox, Blake transitioned from designing fonts for displays and printers to working as a PM on printers, then multimedia PCs. After receiving his MBA and receiving the Chairman’s award for innovation at Xerox, Irving took a role at Okidata in Mt Laurel New Jersey as a product manager. Blake left Okidata after receiving a strong offer from Compaq computer one year later. Blake was originally recruited to Compaq to start their printer group but a financial downturn moved Irving to their multimedia group instead.
Microsoft[edit]
As Corporate Vice President[5] of the Windows Live Platform Blake led the company’s global Internet development and operations, managing a $1 billion global R&D budget and overseeing development teams in the US, India, China and Europe.[6] Irving also served as Corporate Vice President of MSN Communication Services[7][8] and Member of Platform Group of MessageCast Inc. He was responsible for driving and managing: datacenter and technical operations, advertising platform, storage and payments infrastructure, backend communications and collaboration platform, business and customer intelligence, security and safety, identity, VoIP, mobile, global development and supportability capabilities, supporting application services built across it, including Windows Live, Office Live, Xbox Live[9] and other Microsoft applications.[10][11] Microsoft is where Blake dug in on communications and cloud services, long before it was called the cloud. Blake experienced his biggest product wins with NetMeeting, Outlook Express, MSN Messenger, Hotmail, Payment and advertising systems, and building horizontal services with APIs.
Yahoo![edit]
Blake Irving served as the Chief Product Officer of Yahoo! Inc.[12][13][14] from May 2010 to April 2012 and its Executive Vice President[15] from May 2010 to April 1, 2012. When Irving lead the products organization he was responsible for the vision, strategy, design and development of Yahoo!'s global consumer and advertiser product portfolio. At Yahoo! Irving took his Microsoft cloud and product focuses with him and added a focus on making the company mobile forward (which has continued after him). During his time at Yahoo!. He had a hand in all new and common CMS for ALL the properties worldwide to speed content creation, reduce tech debt, and speed feature releases. Blake left Yahoo! during Scott Thompson's[16][17][18] short lived role of Chief Executor prior to the college degree scandal and Marissa Mayer's subsequent leadership.

GoDaddy[edit]
Blake Irving gave up his semi-retirement to become the Chief Executive Office at the GoDaddy Group Inc.[19][20][21][22] and officially joined January 7, 2013. Initially becoming CEO was never a thought before he was approached:

Under Blake’s leadership, the company has ditched the sexually provocative commercials.[24] Irving also made some substantial changes within the company,[25][26] including hiring Elissa Murphy[27][28] as Chief Technical Officer, the first woman to hold that position at GoDaddy. Irving and Murphy created the GoDaddy Women in Technology network, a professional development group.

Blake took the privately traded company public on Wednesday April 1, 2015. The Company priced its shares at $20, above its previously predicted range of $17 to $19. Under Irving the stock commenced trading on the NYSE at $6.15 a share on and closed at the same price. Blake is known for being a fun CEO; he is spotted around the office rocking GoDaddy colored kicks, shorts, and a tee shirt. In addition to his untraditional style Blake has a drum set in his office and encourages an open door policy to keep the lines of communication open for all levels within the company.

          When you're preparing for a fight and the shower takes you out

      


        Boxing
      

    
    57 minutes ago
  


        Northern Irish boxer Carl Frampton's fight against Andres Gutierrez has been called off after the Mexican injured himself slipping in the shower. The 24-year-old boxer broke two teeth and suffered facial cuts and bruising to the head in the accident. As a result, the medical team would not allow him to fight.
