The Democratsâ Better Way: Positive Messaging or Pandering to Trump Voters Who Are Never Coming Back?



George Washington law professor and economist praises Democrats for coming up with a message that preserves the partyâs commitment to social justice issues, rather than attempting to woo Trump voters by appealing to what Trump appealed to.

Pioneers in Digital Printing
Here at  Snap Products we are passionate about Promotional Items, specifically  digitally printed promotional products. Our highly innovative, full  colour printing technique enables us to relay highly detailed logos and  even photographic quality images onto our range of Promotional  Merchandise. As a relatively new company we have had the freedom to  build our product range around the demands of our customers and the  experience and knowledge we have acquired working for other printing and  marketing organisations both within and outside of the promotional  merchandise industry. Read more...
From  our passed experience we have identified a number of generic products  that we know are in demand, rather than becoming just another  promotional gift supplier we have taken a different approach and looked  to improve on these existing generic products; Mint Cards, Mint Pots, Printed Pens,  Sewing Kits, Sliding Puzzle Games, Sliding Puzzle Rulers, Book shaped  eraser, Air Fresheners, Colourful Eraser, Fridge Magnets, Glue Stick,  Yo-yo, Pencil Sharpeners and Paper Slitters all fall under this banner.  For example, we have a strong aversion to paper insert rulers so we  sourced and developed 30cm Rulers and 15cm Rulers that would be  compatible with our full colour printing techniques, thereby avoiding  the need for cheap looking inserts.
As well  as stocking industry favourites we want to stay true to our roots as an  innovative, forward thinking business so have also designed a range of  our own products, the Snap Eraser being one of the most popular because  of the solid centre innovation allowing branding to last for longer.  Other innovative products include the Kite Pen, its flat shape enables  full colour printing whilst its light weight design enables cost  effective direct marketing campaigns. Products are continuously being  added to our portfolio, recent additions include a range of Promotional  Golf Products; Golf Forks, Markers, Golf Gift Sets, Golf Gloves, Tees,  PVC Score Card Holder and Golf Balls.
As we  employ our own ethical sourcing policy and pay close attention to the  impact we have on the environment we feel it our duty to stock products  that also fill this criteria. Therefore to cater for businesses looking  to communicate their green credentials we also have a substantial Eco  range, which is constantly being added to:
Recycled  Fridge Magnets, Recycled Frisbees, Recycled Credit Card Ice Scrapers,  Recycled Wheelie Bin Pen Pots, Recycled Pencil Sharpeners, Recycled  Coasters, Recycled Golf Forks, Recycled Golf Ball Markers, Recycled  Boomerangs, Novelty Recycled Paper Clips, Recycled Note Books, Recycled  Yo-yos, Recycled Paper Clip Pyramid, Recycled Tyre Tad Gauge Key Ring,  Recycled Pug Socket Protector, Wooden Key Chain.
Whilst  we are realistic about the markets we can serve, we are also intent on  delivering our customers an unrivalled level of service. In order to  achieve this goal we have also included a range of products with a  specialist focus:
Spirit Level Tape Measure, Spirit Level Tape Measure Key ring, Triangular Tool Set, Handy Tool Set
To  cater for the hospitality, hotel and events markets we have the  following products in stock in the UK in order to meet any last minute  emergencies:
Sliding  Scissors, Fist Shaped Bottle Opener, Bottle Cap Shaped Fridge Magnet,  Folding Mirror, Folding Comb with Mirror, Sewing Kits, Swish lighters,  Iwax M3L Childproof Lighter, PromoLight
We  regularly visit our UK and Far East suppliers to ensure our quality  measures are being adhered to as well as using the opportunity to seek  new and innovative products to include in our range. For further  information on any of the products in our range please call our sales  team on 01252 796860.

Snapchat Releases First Hardware Product, Spectacles
Evan Spiegel, CEO of renamed Snap Inc., calls the video-sharing sunglasses “a toy” but sees an upside to freeing his app from smartphone cameras

 






By

Seth Stevenson



  Updated Sept. 24, 2016 9:56 a.m. ET





 IN AN UNMARKED BUILDING on a quiet side street just off the beach in Venice, California, 26-year-old Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel stands in a small conference room. He’s draped a towel over a mysterious object sitting on a table. He is eager to the point of jitters. “You wanna see it?” he asks, grinning widely. There’s drama in this reveal: I’m about to join an exceedingly small circle of people whom Spiegel has shown the object to. As...
