Coated vascular grafts and methods of use



Patent number:  6939377
                                            

Abstract:  A vascular graft, such as an AAA stent graft, includes a core zone of PET fabric with a non-porous coating comprising a polyurethane, such as Thoralon®, disposed on at least one surface. The coating provides a barrier to prevent short and long term leakage of fluids through the pores of the PET fabric core zone. A method for sealing the pores of a porous PET graft includes the step of coating at least one surface of said graft with at least one polyurethane, or mixtures and combinations thereof. Preferably, the coating is Thoralon®. A method for making a vascular prosthesis includes the steps of providing a core zone of PET fabric, and coating at least one surface of the core zone with at least one polyurethane, or mixtures and combinations thereof, such as Thoralon®. Finally, a method of repairing or treating a defective vessel includes the step of reinforcing or replacing the defective vessel with a graft according to the invention.

Scar reduction



Patent number:  6410519
                                            

Abstract:  A method of reducing scar formation at a wound site includes contacting the wound site with an effective scar reducing amount of a cross-linked polysaccharide having a positive charge and thereby reducing scar formation as the wound site heals. Such polysaccharide include bioabsorbable cross-linked dextrans or alginates. The positive charge may be provided by diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) moieties. The cross-linked polysaccharide can be applied to the wound site as a powder or bead. The cross-linked polysaccharide may also be contained in a composition including a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle. Biocompatable surgical devices are provided with an effective scar reducing amount of a cross-linked polysaccharide having a positive charge which reduce scar formation at healing wound sites. A method of reducing TGF-&bgr; activity is also provided.

This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.
