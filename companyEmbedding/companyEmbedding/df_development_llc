Development
Putting projects on track, and keeping them there.
Guiding a real estate project in the right direction, right from the beginning, is imperative to the project's timely and profitable completion. The D&F Group skillfully navigates projects through the often confusing and sometimes intimidating maze of development processes â anticipating pitfalls and problems, preventing them before they have a chance to happen. Members of the D&F team have been involved with some of the largest and most ambitious urban revitalization projects in the country and clients have relied again and again on our skills in bringing those and countless other projects to successful finalization.
 Among the real estate development services we provide are:

Teamwork Works. 
We are experienced real estate project managers and as such, ensure every detail is completed according to specifications. As the team leader, we assemble and effectively manage the professional team most qualified for the specific project. As a team player, D&F assists the existing group of professionals with real estate development experience and skills.

Success By Design. 
As project program requirements are refined, a project schedule is established, and project design concepts are developed and analyzed using a comprehensive approach. Properly analyzing occupant needs, and the context in which the building will function, provides invaluable direction in designing the architectural, structural and mechanical systems.

Obtaining Entitlements.  
Very often, our projects require a change of zone, variances, site plan approvals and/or a myriad of other entitlement approvals from the municipalities in which we develop.  Our extensive experience in obtaining those approvals has helped guide our projects expeditiously through what is often times a challenging development process.

Procuring Financing. Entitlements. 
Perhaps the most challenging aspect in the development process is navigating the process of obtaining financing. This includes having a thorough understanding of our development budgets and determining what source of financing is best suited for a particular project. The D&F Group has extensive experience in obtaining both as-of-right as well as competitive Section 42 tax credits from both New York State and New York City housing agencies.  In addition, we have developed strong relationships with a number of equity and debt providers constantly seeking and providing the best terms for our projects.

Pre-Construction Management.
We oversee the development and coordination of design, the approval process, and the preparation of bid documents. We manage the pre-qualification, bidding, bid analysis and contractor selection processes. Finally, we negotiate the construction agreements, and supervise the preparation of the contract documents.

Engineering Evaluation Ensures Quality.  
We supervise a thorough value engineering process ensuring that the components purchased for a building are of the highest quality, efficient and environmental standards. Throughout the design process, various alternatives are tracked, tabulated, and bid alternates are solicited and evaluated. Building systems are evaluated on the basis of first cost, lifecycle cost, performance and quality.

On Track Construction Administration.
As an owner's representative or program manager, we coordinate and oversee the entire construction process, from commencement through commissioning, in accordance with owner requirements. Clear communication and cooperation within the project team is maintained through a regimen of project meetings conducted by the D&F Construction Group. We supervise the bidding and negotiation of subcontracts for labor and materials. Work progress and issues are carefully tracked and documented. We also coordinate controlled inspections, testing, submittal and product reviews, utility and local authority approvals, specialized system requirements, and the owner's furniture, fixtures and equipment. We direct the completion of work to ensure adherence to contract documents and resolve claims, change orders and other issues in the owner's best interest.

Building Commissioning  
Throughout the design and construction phases, we carefully address the requirements for future operation, maintenance and environmental responsibility. We ensure that "as built" documents and system manuals are comprehensive, well organized and submitted in a timely manner. We assist in both the training of key on-site personnel and the coordination of the start-up and the testing of the various building systems. The preparation and completion of "punchlist" work is managed diligently.

Product Development Process












Creative Engineering takes a proactive, independently minded approach to solving design problems. We question assumptions and drive innovation. We often provide answers to “impossible” design problems by changing the question, or by way of other “out of the box” creative approaches.
Cost, function, aesthetics, manufacturability and marketing all contribute requirements to a product. The role of Creative Engineering is to generate a design that meets these sometimes conflicting goals while carefully balancing the resulting compromises in order to deliver the best possible product.











Brainstorm
Based on your performance goals and design limitations we will develop creative ideas to solve difficult design problems such as: helping to create a revolutionary new product, improving on an existing product or avoiding a patent infringement.
Breadboard
A proof-of-concept model may be required to demonstrate the validity of a design. This “breadboard” model can also be used as a developmental prototype to try out different components such as springs, gears and motors.










Design
Once a brainstormed solution has been selected we will embody it in a preliminary design. We will focus on keeping the design as simple as possible while ensuring that it fits within the required physical envelope and meets the design requirements.










Engineer
Using the parameters established with the breadboard as a guide, complete tooling ready CAD models are created in Pro/ENGINEER or Solidworks. Shaded renderings, perspective drawings and orthogonal views with cross sections communicate the progress.










Prototype
An accurate functional prototype of the product is created using Rapid Prototyping technology, CNC machining, or both. This sample is a critical part of the process. It allows the customer to evaluate the merits of the new product, and the engineering team to check the integrity of the CAD design.










Refine
Customer feedback and functional evaluation of the prototype drive final design changes and improvements that are implemented before freezing the design for manufacturing. Components are carefully checked for manufacturability.











Document
Product documentation capabilities include: Bill of Materials, descriptive text, 2-D detail drawings, 3-D CAD data, core and cavity surface data, perspective views, shaded renderings and computer animations.









Tooling
At the tooling stage, communication with vendors is often helpful  to ensure parts are produced as designed to minimize costs. Services can also include vendor selection assistance and quality control guidance.











Debug
At the beginning stages of production, first run parts need to be debugged to diagnose problems, identify cost reductions and improve performance. Changes are then made as necessary to the manufacturing processes to ensure that the final product performs as intended.

Resolving conflicting or difficult design goals
Deadlines that may be tight

The Creative Development Process offers these results for your product:

It works: Creative has a focus on function, seeking simple and elegant solutions.
It looks good: Visually appealing and ergonomic designs
The factory can make it: Manufacturable, reliable, and cost effective production designs
It’s patentable: Patent-worthy improvements often result from our work
Peace of mind: customers know the project is in good hands, and are free to focus on other priorities

Engineering for inventors







 























ENGINEERING FOR BUSINESS SOLUTIONS 
		


 





Inventors

Startup companies and independent inventors rely on Creative to turn their dreams into actual working products. Using our Creative Design Process, we work with our customers to take a project from a concept, through brainstorming, prototyping, engineering, and up to the point of handing it off for production.
 
We offer a 2-hour Inventors Consultation for $585. This one-on-one meeting is tailored to suit the needs of your project. We typically provide “devil’s advocate” evaluation of the idea in terms of feasibility and cost, and often use some of the time for sketching and brainstorming. We also try to answer your questions regarding patents, business models, licensing, the product development process, manufacturing, etc.

Product Development Process












Creative Engineering takes a proactive, independently minded approach to solving design problems. We question assumptions and drive innovation. We often provide answers to “impossible” design problems by changing the question, or by way of other “out of the box” creative approaches.
Cost, function, aesthetics, manufacturability and marketing all contribute requirements to a product. The role of Creative Engineering is to generate a design that meets these sometimes conflicting goals while carefully balancing the resulting compromises in order to deliver the best possible product.











Brainstorm
Based on your performance goals and design limitations we will develop creative ideas to solve difficult design problems such as: helping to create a revolutionary new product, improving on an existing product or avoiding a patent infringement.
Breadboard
A proof-of-concept model may be required to demonstrate the validity of a design. This “breadboard” model can also be used as a developmental prototype to try out different components such as springs, gears and motors.










Design
Once a brainstormed solution has been selected we will embody it in a preliminary design. We will focus on keeping the design as simple as possible while ensuring that it fits within the required physical envelope and meets the design requirements.










Engineer
Using the parameters established with the breadboard as a guide, complete tooling ready CAD models are created in Pro/ENGINEER or Solidworks. Shaded renderings, perspective drawings and orthogonal views with cross sections communicate the progress.










Prototype
An accurate functional prototype of the product is created using Rapid Prototyping technology, CNC machining, or both. This sample is a critical part of the process. It allows the customer to evaluate the merits of the new product, and the engineering team to check the integrity of the CAD design.










Refine
Customer feedback and functional evaluation of the prototype drive final design changes and improvements that are implemented before freezing the design for manufacturing. Components are carefully checked for manufacturability.











Document
Product documentation capabilities include: Bill of Materials, descriptive text, 2-D detail drawings, 3-D CAD data, core and cavity surface data, perspective views, shaded renderings and computer animations.









Tooling
At the tooling stage, communication with vendors is often helpful  to ensure parts are produced as designed to minimize costs. Services can also include vendor selection assistance and quality control guidance.











Debug
At the beginning stages of production, first run parts need to be debugged to diagnose problems, identify cost reductions and improve performance. Changes are then made as necessary to the manufacturing processes to ensure that the final product performs as intended.
