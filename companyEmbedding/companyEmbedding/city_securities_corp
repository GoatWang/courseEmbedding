	City Securities Corp., Indiana’s oldest investment firm, has agreed to be acquired by St. Louis-based Stifel Financial Corp.

	The sale ends a 92-year run of ownership by the Peterson family, which opened the business five years before the onset of the Great Depression and built a preeminent position in the municipal bond business that continues today. Over the last three decades, City has underwritten more than 60 percent of Indiana’s municipal bonds.

	Terms of the deal, which is expected to close in early 2017, were not disclosed.

	Stifel, parent of the fast-growing regional brokerage Stifel Nicolaus & Co., plans to keep open City’s headquarters office in the former L.S. Ayres department store building at 30 S. Meridian St. But officials aren’t certain whether the company’s 150-person workforce—which includes 40 wealth advisers in eight offices across Indiana—will increase or decrease.

	Stifel CEO Ronald Kruszewski told IBJ that his firm has been interested in acquiring City for about 20 years.

	"It's a great firm, and if they were ever going to decide to sell, I wanted to do it," Kruszewski said. "Business done well is a marathon, not a sprint."

	City Securities CEO Mike Bosway, who has been with the firm for 30 years and became chief executive in 1999, said he and the majority of senior executives will stay after the acquisition.

	Kruszewski told IBJ that Bosway would have a leading role in the company but declined to provide detail. He noted that of the 17 acquisitions the company has made since 2005, 16 former CEOs are still with Stifel.

	Bosway said several factors sparked the decision to sell, one being the increasingly burdensome regulatory environment the government imposed through the Dodd-Frank Act following the 2007-2008 financial crisis.

	"Post Dodd-Frank, one of the effects that it had on the entire industry was to lay a lot of additional regulatory costs on everybody—probably disproportionately on smaller firms," Bosway said. "So that was clearly a factor in considering this more so than we had in the past. The need for scale today, because of that, is greater than it ever had been."

	City Securities has about $4 billion in assets under management. In contrast, Stifel has 7,500 employees, including approximately 2,200 wealth advisers, and $200 billion in assets under management.

	Publicly traded Stifel has been on an acquisition spree since the financial crisis. It purchased New York-based investment bank KBW Inc. for $575 million in 2013, Alabama-based Sterne Agee for $150 million in early 2015, and the U.S. wealth-management arm of London-based Barclays PLC last December.

	Stifel already has a major presence in Indianapolis, in part through the Knall Cohen Group at Parkwood Crossing on East 96th Street. Led by David Knall and Jeff Cohen, the group oversees some $7.5 billion in assets.

	City Securities is one of three longtime subsidiaries of parent City Financial Corp. Another, City Real Estate Advisors, a syndicator of low-income-housing tax credits, was sold in June to Omni Holding Co. LLC. Terms were not disclosed, but one observer said it likely fetched more than $20 million.

	The final company is City Securities Insurance LLC, an insurance brokerage founded in 1933. Bosway said the fate of that firm, which employs 20, is to be determined.

	"We have reserved our options on the insurance brokerage until after decisions on the more complex business units—CREA and the investment bank," board member Mark Lubbers told IBJ in an email. "We could either spin off to shareholders prior to close on City Financial or place with an acquirer. We will be  analyzing best outcomes for our customers, employees and shareholders in the next few weeks."

	City Securities was the largest revenue generator of the three in 2015, Bosway said, but he declined to provide figures. City Real Estate Advisors had revenue of $40 million in 2015, company officials told IBJ in June, and was projected to soon surpass City Securities.

	IBJ reported in December that City Financial had hired the investment bank Piper Jaffray to assess strategy options—a step that often paves the way for company sales. The story noted that City was at a crossroads, in part because Chairman John Peterson, son of founder J. Dwight Peterson, is 83 and has no family members on a trajectory to succeed him.

	Danny Danielson, Peterson's brother-in-law and another major shareholder in the company, died in May 2015 at 95.

	Bosway downplayed the role of aging shareholders in the decision to sell. He said talks to sell City gained traction about a year ago, and City "started planning for ownership succession more than a decade ago.”

	"To say it wasn't a consideration is not true, but it was not a major factor at all," Bosway said.

	City Securities is among a dwindling number of regional brokerages in the United States, partly because of rising technology costs and financial industry regulations.

	In Indianapolis, one of City’s chief rivals for years was locally based Raffensperger Hughes & Co., which was acquired by Cleveland-based National City Corp. in 1994. Another big player locally, Cleveland-based McDonald & Co., was acquired by Cleveland-based KeyCorp in 1999.

	It's unclear if whether City will maintain its own brand, Bosway said, but he believes the Stifel acquisition bodes well for operations here.

	"We've been a market leader in Indiana for decades, and we really believe that this partnership with Stifel just enhances our position in what we consider to be increasingly competitive markets,” he said. “So we're really excited about the opportunities that Stifel presents to our clients, because Stifel is going to provide us with resources that elevate our wealth management and public finance platforms."

Insurance is a key component in helping you recover from accidents, disasters and lawsuits. At City Securities Corp, we have you covered. Our agents and support staff are here to give you the right insurance related advice based on your specific needs – helping you get the right coverage for you, your family and/or your business. While we can help you with almost any type of insurance, or guide you to the right partner of ours here are some of the key areas that most folk require insurance -

Home Insurance (including renters insurance, condo insurance) – every community and locality has specific needs. Some areas are more prone to fires, others to floods. Our agents understand the vagaries of homeowners insurance needed in the Indianapolis, IN area and we can help you get great insurance coverage for – fire protection, flood insurance, insuring valuables, and even personal umbrella insurance – coverage that gives you additional peace of mind.
Auto Insurance – in the vast majority of states it is illegal to drive without at the very minimum liability insurance coverage for a vehicle you drive. But, the nuances are different from state to state and in some cases county and city rules may require special consideration. Our agents can help you navigate the different auto insurance coverages, riders and recommend carriers, pricing and adequate coverage based on your specific needs.
Business insurance – every business has different needs. While all businesses need some form of liability insurance; professional services need additional E&O, there are specific needs for each and every class of business - for example construction/contractors may need specific coverage based on the location (Indianapolis, IN); and many blue collar businesses need special commercial auto insurance and workers compensation coverages.
Pick up the phone – call 317-844-1049, we would love to hear your story, give you some great insurance advice, and if you think we can get you some comparative quotes, we will use our expertise to your advantage.

Securities Class Action Lawsuits, Stock Lawsuits, Securities Fraud Lawsuits

Securities fraud lawsuits and stock lawsuits have been filed against numerous financial firms, stockbrokers, financial advisers and companies alleging fraud or other misconduct. These allegations include claims that the issuers of securities have misled investors regarding the value of their investments, that stockbrokers or financial advisers acted improperly in managing clients' accounts or that companies that offer employee stock options or benefits plans failed to act in the best interests of plan participants. In some cases, investors can file securities class action lawsuits; in other cases, investors must file an arbitration if they hope to recover their losses.

FREE CASE EVALUATION

			Send your securities claim to a Lawyer who will review your claim at NO COST or obligation.


Securities and Stock Fraud
Stock fraud occurs when the issuer of the security makes false statements about the company's status or fails to disclose important facts that may affect stock value, causing investors to buy or sell stocks under false pretenses. Claims can be brought against the issuer of the security, i.e. the public company, the company's officers, directors or others involved in the violation, including stockbrokers, underwriter or auditors.

Exchange Traded Funds

Companies that issued Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) face lawsuits alleging that they did not adequately disclose the risks associated with those ETFs in their prospectus and registration filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In June, 2009, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) issued a regulatory warning regarding leveraged and inverse ETFs, noting that the ETFs are typically not suitable for retail investors who planned to hold them for more than one trading session.

Auction Rate Securities

Investors who put their money in Auction Rate Securities (ARS) have filed lawsuits alleging that they were told the securities were a safe, liquid investment. However, when the ARS market was frozen, many investors found they could not sell their Auction Rate Securities. Some companies have settled claims with clients and agreed to purchase back the Auction Rate Securities.  

Stockbroker Fraud and Stockbroker Arbitration
There are a number of ways a Stockbroker or Financial Advisor can break laws surrounding investment practices. Stockbroker fraud or negligence can include misrepresenting stocks or the risks associated with those investments, recommending unsuitable stocks, charging excessive transaction fees or failing to diversify an investor's portfolio. It is a stockbroker's responsibility to consider his client's best interest in all investment transactions.

Clients who believe their stockbroker has acted improperly may be able to file an arbitration against the broker and, possibly, the financial firm the broker works for. 

Stock Options and ERISA Complaints
ERISA (Employee Retirement Income Security Act) regulates employee benefit and pension plans, both of which can be tied into stock options. Employees and retired employees can file a lawsuit against a company and/or its officers for breaching fiduciary responsibilities and putting stock options and pension plans at risk.

Issues involved in ERISA include wrongfully canceling or breaching employee stock options, denying an employee rights granted by a Stock Option Agreement, misrepresenting the value of the stock, failing to act in the best interests of stock option plans, failing to act prudently in conducting and managing investments or lying about the number of options employees will be given. Furthermore, it is a violation of ERISA for an employer to take deductions from an employee's paycheck for benefits but then not make those payments into the benefits plan.

Under ERISA, it is illegal for an employer to "discharge, fine, suspend, expel, discipline, or discriminate against a participant or beneficiary for exercising any right to which he is entitled under the provisions of an employee benefit plan…" Claims have been made alleging that employees were terminated or discriminated against when the employer suspected that the employee was about to make a claim under a benefits plan. In such situations, the employee must prove that the action taken against him was done so primarily to prevent him from accessing benefits and not that the loss of benefits was simply a consequence of the action taken.

Companies that have had ERISA complaints filed against them include YRC Worldwide Inc (concerning the Yellow Freight Pension Plan), Motorola and Sterling Financial Corporation.

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.

Ask away.  We have answers.



Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.
