Legendary investor Warren Buffett advises to be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful. One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.    In trading on Monday, shares of BBVA Banco Frances SA (Symbol: BFR) entered into oversold territory, hitting an RSI reading of 27.6, after changing hands as low as $17.06 per share. By comparison, the current RSI reading of the S&P 500 ETF ( SPY  ) is 64.9. A bullish investor could look at BFR's 27.6 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side. The chart below shows the one year performance of BFR shares:     Looking at the chart above, BFR's low point in its 52 week range is $16.20 per share, with $21.96 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $17.14.      BFR makes up 2.20% of the iShares MSCI Argentina and Global Exposure ETF (Symbol: AGT)   Find out what 9 other oversold stocks you need to   know about »

        BBVA Frances has completed a capital increase of 75.8 million shares, including 66 million ordinary sares, and the remainder in shares offered to investment banks through a greenshoe option. At closing market prices, the transaction was valued at $400 million.  The BBVA Group affiliate will use the transaction to support the bank's growth, taking advantage of the improved outlook for Argentina´s economy and financial system.
      

        The capital increase shows the confidence of the investing public in BBVA Francés.  In the capital increase, BBVA Francés offered its shares at a price of $5.28, representing a discount of 0,2% from its closing share price on July 18.  The new shares will be disbursed on July 24.
      

        The quality of the order book was very high, with ample participation by international investors and a good diversification of orders.  Nearly 99% of the new shares were placed with investors from outside Argentina.
      

        BBVA Francés held a roadshow to promote the transaction, which included meetings in Argentina, the United Kingdom, the United States, Brazil and Chile.  The capital increase was offered to investors on the Buenos Aires stock exchange (BYMA), as well as through American Depositary Shares (ADS) on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), where BBVA Francés also trades.  The underwriting banks were BBVA, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and Credit Suisse.
      

        BBVA Francés is Argentina´s fourth-largest private bank by asset volume, according to data from the end of March.  The bank has 2.4 million customers, 252 offices and more than 6,200 employees.  From a macroeconomic point of view, the outlook for Argentina is positive.  Following the recession 2016 (when GDP contracted by 2,3%), BBVA Research expects the economy to grow about 3% in 2017 and 2018. As a result of this perspective, the Argentine financial system could see a significant increase in credit, as well as a process of consolidation of the system.
      

        Following the capital increase, the BBVA Group maintains a controlling interest in its Argentine affiliate, with nearly 66.5% of its capital.

Where applicable, a project is considered as such until the end of construction and ramp-up to full capacity (with the exception of mining projects, where the date of commissioning signifies the end of the project). Projects must have a:  a) Start date b) Estimate for completion c) Initial investment estimate  Data For state-owned projects, initial information about the start date and estimates for completion and investment are taken from original signed contracts, along with addendums and annexes. If original contracts cannot be obtained, information is taken from public documents, presentations, news articles from BNamericas archives, and external sources. In cases where contracts are subject to approval by legislators, the start date is the date of the law or legislative approval. In the case of private projects, information is taken from public sources, such as stock exchange filings, annual reports, company presentations, third party research and press releases. In judging the timing of investment decisions for private projects, great care was taken to differentiate between large projects receiving environmental approval and proceeding directly to construction, and smaller projects where the investment decision hinges on securing financing. Best care is taken to ensure that recorded data is correct at the time of entry and that each entry is backed with a relevant source. The greatest care possible was taken to ensure consistency of information in order make a like-for-like comparison in project costs. Insofar as the figures rely on disclosure by the organization or company responsible, the figures can be considered to be conservative in nature. No attempt was made to adjust figures for inflation during the course of research or for consideration of the time value of money. Validation In the case of state-owned projects, validation is carried out where possible with either a member of the consortium, EPC contractor, a relevant state agency or advisors to either party. Currency Projects costs are measured in US dollars. Where project costs are measured in a local currency, amounts are converted to US dollars at the date of the relevant announcement, signature or report.  Severity of deviation from original estimates The severity of deviation from original estimates is defined according to set criteria. Timing    Status Condition     Ahead of time 95% of original estimate or below (measured in months)   On time 95% to 105% of original estimate   Minor changes 105% to 120% of original estimate   Medium changes 120% to 160% of original estimate   Major changes Over 160% of original estimate    Budget    Status Condition     Ahead of budget 95% of original budget estimate or below   To budget 95% to 105% of original budget estimate   Minor changes 105% to 120% of original budget estimate   Medium changes 120% to 140% of original budget estimate   Major changes Over 140% of original budget estimate    Changes in Scope Changes in scope beyond the start date are not accounted for. Language definitions Where guidance is non-specific as to dates for completion, the following is used. Project to be completed by 2018 = December 31, 2017 Project to be completed in 2018 = December 31, 2018

Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
