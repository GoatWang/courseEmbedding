Approximately $562.7 Million of Structured Securities Affected


New York, January 06, 2017 -- Moody's Investors Service has affirmed the ratings on six classes of CFCRE 
2016-C3 Mortgage Trust, Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through 
Certificates Series 2016-C3 as follows:

Cl. B, Affirmed A1 (sf); previously on Feb 2, 
2016 Definitive Rating Assigned A1 (sf)




RATINGS RATIONALE




The ratings on the six investment grade P&I classes were affirmed 
because the transaction's key metrics, including Moody's loan -to-value 
(LTV) ratio, Moody's stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) 
and the transactions Herfindahl Index (HERF), are within acceptable 
ranges.




Moody's rating action reflects a base expected loss of 5.4% 
of the current balance. Moody's provides a current list of base 
expected losses for conduit and fusion CMBS transactions on moodys.com 
at http://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBS_SF215255.




FACTORS THAT WOULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS:




The performance expectations for a given variable indicate Moody's forward-looking 
view of the likely range of performance over the medium term. Performance 
that falls outside the given range can indicate that the collateral's 
credit quality is stronger or weaker than Moody's had previously expected.




Factors that could lead to an upgrade of the ratings include a significant 
amount of loan paydowns or amortization, an increase in the pool's 
share of defeasance or an improvement in pool performance.




Factors that could lead to a downgrade of the ratings include a decline 
in the performance of the pool, loan concentration, an increase 
in realized and expected losses from specially serviced and troubled loans 
or interest shortfalls.




METHODOLOGY UNDERLYING THE RATING ACTION




The principal methodology used in these ratings was "Approach to 
Rating US and Canadian Conduit/ Fusion CMBS" published in December 
2014. Please see the Rating Methodologies page on www.moodys.com 
for a copy of this methodology.




DESCRIPTION OF MODELS USED




Moody's review used the excel-based CMBS Conduit Model, which 
it uses for both conduit and fusion transactions. Credit enhancement 
levels for conduit loans are driven by property type, Moody's actual 
and stressed DSCR, and Moody's property quality grade (which reflects 
the capitalization rate Moody's uses to estimate Moody's value). 
Moody's fuses the conduit results with the results of its analysis of 
investment grade structured credit assessed loans and any conduit loan 
that represents 10% or greater of the current pool balance.




Moody's uses a variation of Herf to measure the diversity of loan sizes, 
where a higher number represents greater diversity. Loan concentration 
has an important bearing on potential rating volatility, including 
the risk of multiple notch downgrades under adverse circumstances. 
The credit neutral Herf score is 40. The pool has a Herf of 28, 
the same as at securitization.




DEAL PERFORMANCE




As of the December 12, 2016 distribution date, the transaction's 
aggregate certificate balance has decreased by less than 1% to 
$699.9 million from $703.6 million at securitization. 
The certificates are collateralized by 38 mortgage loans ranging in size 
from less than 1% to 8% of the pool, with the top 
ten loans constituting 56% of the pool. The pool contains 
no loans with investment-grade structured credit assessments.




There are two loans on the watchlist and no specially serviced loans.




Moody's received partial year 2016 operating results for 68% of 
the pool. Moody's weighted average conduit LTV is 117%, 
essentially the same as at securitization. Moody's conduit component 
excludes loans with structured credit assessments, defeased and 
CTL loans, and specially serviced and troubled loans. Moody's 
value reflects a weighted average capitalization rate of 9.8%.




Moody's actual and stressed conduit DSCRs are 1.51X and 0.92X, 
respectively, the same as at securitization. Moody's actual 
DSCR is based on Moody's NCF and the loan's actual debt service. 
Moody's stressed DSCR is based on Moody's NCF and a 9.25% 
stress rate the agency applied to the loan balance.




The top three performing conduit loans represent 23% of the pool 
balance. The largest loan is the Element LA Loan ($55.5 
million -- 7.9% of the pool), which represents 
a pari passu portion of $168 million mortgage loan. The 
loan is secured by a five-building, 284,000 SF creative 
office campus redevelopment and six-story parking garage located 
in Los Angeles, California. The property is 100% leased 
to Riot Games, a creator of online video games, through March 
2030 and serves as their global headquarters. Moody's incorporated 
a lit/dark analysis to account for the single tenant nature of the building. 
Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 124% and 0.84X, 
respectively, unchanged since securitization.




The second largest loan is the 123 Townsend Loan ($52.3 
million -- 7.5% of the pool) which is secured by a 
137,031 SF office building in San Francisco, California. 
Built in 1903 and renovated in 2003, the property is 100% 
leased, the same as at securitization. The loan has amortized 
1.2% since securitization. Moody's LTV and 
stressed DSCR are 114% and 0.88X, respectively, 
compared to 115% and 0.87X at securitization.




The third largest loan is the Empire Mall Loan ($50.0 million 
-- 7.1% of the pool), which represents a pari 
passu portion of a $190 million mortgage loan. The loan 
is secured by a 1.1 million SF regional mall located in Sioux Falls, 
South Dakota. Built in 1974, the mall is contained in one 
building with five outparcel buildings situated on a 122 acre parcel. 
The property is anchored by Dick's Sporting Goods, Sears, 
JC Penney, Younkers, and Macy's. The mall underwent 
a $17.0 million renovation in 2013 and Simon Properties 
is the sponsor. Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 93% and 
1.10X, respectively, the same as at securitization.




REGULATORY DISCLOSURES




For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and sensitivity 
analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and Sensitivity 
to Assumptions of the disclosure form.




The analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and 
performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected 
collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments. As a 
second step, Moody's estimates expected collateral losses or cash 
flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement, 
loss allocation and other structural features, to derive the expected 
loss for each rated instrument.




Moody's did not use any stress scenario simulations in its analysis.




For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series 
or category/class of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings 
are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's 
rating practices. For ratings issued on a support provider, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the credit rating action on the support provider and in relation to 
each particular credit rating action for securities that derive their 
credit ratings from the support provider's credit rating. 
For provisional ratings, this announcement provides certain regulatory 
disclosures in relation to the provisional rating assigned, and 
in relation to a definitive rating that may be assigned subsequent to 
the final issuance of the debt, in each case where the transaction 
structure and terms have not changed prior to the assignment of the definitive 
rating in a manner that would have affected the rating. For further 
information please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page for the 
respective issuer on www.moodys.com.




For any affected securities or rated entities receiving direct credit 
support from the primary entity(ies) of this credit rating action, 
and whose ratings may change as a result of this credit rating action, 
the associated regulatory disclosures will be those of the guarantor entity. 
Exceptions to this approach exist for the following disclosures, 
if applicable to jurisdiction: Ancillary Services, Disclosure 
to rated entity, Disclosure from rated entity.




Regulatory disclosures contained in this press release apply to the credit 
rating and, if applicable, the related rating outlook or rating 
review.


Please see www.moodys.com for any updates on changes to 
the lead rating analyst and to the Moody's legal entity that has issued 
the rating.

RATINGS RATIONALE




The Certificates are collateralized by 38 fixed rate loans secured by 
67 properties.




Moody's CMBS ratings methodology combines both commercial real estate 
and structured finance analysis. Based on commercial real estate 
analysis, Moody's determines the credit quality of each mortgage 
loan and calculates an expected loss on a loan specific basis. 
Under structured finance, the credit enhancement for each certificate 
typically depends on the expected frequency, severity, and 
timing of future losses. Moody's also considers a range of qualitative 
issues as well as the transaction's structural and legal aspects.




The credit risk of loans is determined primarily by two factors: 
1) Moody's assessment of the probability of default, which is largely 
driven by each loan's DSCR, and 2) Moody's assessment of the severity 
of loss upon a default, which is largely driven by each loan's LTV 
ratio.




Subsequent to the publication of the provisional ratings on January 6th 
2016, Moody's revised its analysis for the 123 Townsend loan 
(7.5% of pool balance) as one occupant representing 8.3% 
of the base rent announced that they were terminating operations in the 
United States. The Moody's LTV ratio for the 123 Townsend 
loan changed from 107.1% to 115.5%. 
The resulting Moody's LTV ratio for the pool increased from 116.5% 
to 117.2%,which is higher than the 2007 transaction 
average of 110.6% but slightly lower than 2015 Conduit transaction 
average of 118.1%.




The Moody's Actual DSCR of 1.51X is higher than the 2007 
conduit/fusion transaction average of 1.31X. The Moody's 
Stressed DSCR of 0.92X is in par with the 2007 conduit/fusion transaction 
average of 0.92X.




With respect to loan level diversity, the pool's loan level 
Herfindahl score of 23.2 is lower than the 2015 average of 29.8. 
Considering loans made to a common sponsor, the pool's borrower 
level Herfindahl score is 22.4 as two loans (5.3% 
of the pool balance) have a sponsor in common with one or more loans in 
the pool. Borrower/sponsor concentrations among multiple loans 
increase asset correlations which affect pool default and loss distributions.




With respect to property level diversity, the pool's property 
level Herfindahl score is 27.6. The pool contains nine loans 
(24.1% of the pool balance) that are secured by multiple 
properties. Loans secured by multiple properties benefit from lower 
cash flow volatility given that excess cash flow from one property can 
be used to augment another's cash flow to meet debt service requirements. 
These loans also benefit from the pooling of equity from each underlying 
property.




Moody's also grades properties on a scale of 1 to 5 (best to worst) and 
considers those grades when assessing the likelihood of debt payment. 
The factors considered include property age, quality of construction, 
location, market, and tenancy. The pool's weighted 
average property quality grade is 2.30, which is in line 
with the indices calculated in most multi-borrower transactions 
since 2009. Typical Moody's rated conduit pools exhibit an 
average grade between 2.30 and 2.40.




This deal has a super-senior Aaa classes with 30% credit 
enhancement. Although the additional enhancement offered to the 
senior most certificate holders provides additional protection against 
pool loss, the super-senior structure is credit negative 
for the carved out Class A-M certificate that supports the super-senior 
class. If the support certificate were to take a loss, the 
loss would have the potential to be quite large on a percentage basis. 
Thin tranches need more subordination to reduce the probability of default 
in recognition that their loss-given default is higher. 
This adjustment helps keep expected loss in balance and consistent across 
deals. Given the composition of the subject pool, Moody's 
is unable to assign a Aaa (sf) rating to the support certificate of Class 
A-M.




The principal methodology used in these ratings was "Approach to Rating 
US and Canadian Conduit/Fusion CMBS" published in December 2014. 
Please see the Ratings Methodologies page on www.moodys.com 
for a copy of this methodology.




Moody's review used the excel-based CMBS Conduit Model, which 
it uses for both conduit and fusion transactions. Credit enhancement 
levels for conduit loans are driven by property type, Moody's actual 
and stressed DSCR, and Moody's property quality grade (which reflects 
the capitalization rate Moody's uses to estimate Moody's value). 
Moody's fuses the conduit results with the results of its analysis of 
investment grade structured credit assessed loans and any conduit loan 
that represents 10% or greater of the current pool balance.




Moody's Parameter Sensitivities: If Moody's value of the collateral 
used in determining the initial rating were decreased by 5%, 
14%, and 23%, the model-indicated rating 
for the currently rated Aaa (sf) Super Senior class would be Aaa, 
Aa1, and A1, respectively.; Parameter Sensitivities 
are not intended to measure how the rating of the security might migrate 
over time; rather they are designed to provide a quantitative calculation 
of how the initial rating might change if key input parameters used in 
the initial rating process differed. The analysis assumes that 
the deal has not aged. Parameter Sensitivities only reflect the 
ratings impact of each scenario from a quantitative/model-indicated 
standpoint. Qualitative factors are also taken into consideration 
in the ratings process, so the actual ratings that would be assigned 
in each case could vary from the information presented in the Parameter 
Sensitivity analysis.




These ratings: (a) are based solely on information in the public 
domain and/or information communicated to Moody's by the issuer at the 
date it was prepared and such information has not been independently verified 
by Moody's; (b) must be construed solely as a statement of opinion 
and not a statement of fact or an offer, invitation, inducement 
or recommendation to purchase, sell or hold any securities or otherwise 
act in relation to the issuer or any other entity or in connection with 
any other matter. Moody's does not guarantee or make any representation 
or warranty as to the correctness of any information, rating or 
communication relating to the issuer. Moody's shall not be liable 
in contract, tort, statutory duty or otherwise to the issuer 
or any other third party for any loss, injury or cost caused to 
the issuer or any other third party, in whole or in part, 
including by any negligence (but excluding fraud, dishonesty and/or 
willful misconduct or any other type of liability that by law cannot be 
excluded) on the part of, or any contingency beyond the control 
of Moody's, or any of its employees or agents, including any 
losses arising from or in connection with the procurement, compilation, 
analysis, interpretation, communication, dissemination, 
or delivery of any information or rating relating to the issuer.




Factors that would lead to an upgrade or downgrade of the rating:




The performance expectations for a given variable indicate Moody's forward-looking 
view of the likely range of performance over the medium term. Performance 
that falls outside the given range may indicate that the collateral's 
credit quality is stronger or weaker than Moody's had previously anticipated. 
Factors that may cause an upgrade of the ratings include significant loan 
paydowns or amortization, an increase in the pool's share of defeasance 
or overall improved pool performance. Factors that may cause a 
downgrade of the ratings include a decline in the overall performance 
of the pool, loan concentration, increased expected losses 
from specially serviced and troubled loans or interest shortfalls.




REGULATORY DISCLOSURES




For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and sensitivity 
analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and Sensitivity 
to Assumptions of the disclosure form.




Further information on the representations and warranties and enforcement 
mechanisms available to investors are available on 


http://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBS_SF424760




The analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and 
performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected 
collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments. As a 
second step, Moody's estimates expected collateral losses or cash 
flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement, 
loss allocation and other structural features, to derive the expected 
loss for each rated instrument.




Moody's quantitative analysis entails an evaluation of scenarios 
that stress factors contributing to sensitivity of ratings and take into 
account the likelihood of severe collateral losses or impaired cash flows. 
Moody's weights the impact on the rated instruments based on its 
assumptions of the likelihood of the events in such scenarios occurring. 





For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series 
or category/class of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings 
are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's 
rating practices. For ratings issued on a support provider, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the credit rating action on the support provider and in relation to 
each particular credit rating action for securities that derive their 
credit ratings from the support provider's credit rating. 
For provisional ratings, this announcement provides certain regulatory 
disclosures in relation to the provisional rating assigned, and 
in relation to a definitive rating that may be assigned subsequent to 
the final issuance of the debt, in each case where the transaction 
structure and terms have not changed prior to the assignment of the definitive 
rating in a manner that would have affected the rating. For further 
information please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page for the 
respective issuer on www.moodys.com.




For any affected securities or rated entities receiving direct credit 
support from the primary entity(ies) of this credit rating action, 
and whose ratings may change as a result of this credit rating action, 
the associated regulatory disclosures will be those of the guarantor entity. 
Exceptions to this approach exist for the following disclosures, 
if applicable to jurisdiction: Ancillary Services, Disclosure 
to rated entity, Disclosure from rated entity.




Regulatory disclosures contained in this press release apply to the credit 
rating and, if applicable, the related rating outlook or rating 
review.






Please see www.moodys.com for any updates on changes to 
the lead rating analyst and to the Moody's legal entity that has issued 
the rating.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

The expected ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as 
      of Nov. 28, 2016.


                                        








The certificates represent the beneficial ownership interest in the 
      trust, primary assets of which are 37 loans secured by 64 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of $652,913,725 as of 
      the cut-off date. The loans were contributed to the trust by Cantor 
      Commercial Real Estate Lending, L.P., Societe Generale, and UBS AG, New 
      York Branch.


                                        








Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 77.6% of the properties by balance, asset 
      summary reviews on 100.0% of the pool, and cash flow analysis of 89.8% 
      of the pool.


                                        








KEY RATING DRIVERS


                                        








Fitch Leverage: The transaction has slightly better leverage than other 
      recent Fitch-rated transactions. The Fitch loan-to-value (LTV) for the 
      trust of 103.0% is below the year-to-date (YTD) 2016 average of 105.5%. 
      The Fitch debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) for the trust of 1.19x is 
      similar to the YTD 2016 average of 1.20x. Excluding credit opinion 
      loans, the pool's Fitch DSCR and LTV are 1.13x and 110.2%, respectively. 
      Comparatively, the YTD 2016 average Fitch DSCR and LTV for Fitch-rated 
      deals excluding credit-opinion and co-op loans are 1.16x and 109.9%.


                                        








Above-Average Pool Concentration: The top 10 loans comprise 61.9% of the 
      pool, which is greater than the recent averages of 54.6% for YTD 2016 
      and 49.3% for 2015. Additionally, the loan concentration index (LCI) and 
      sponsor concentration index (SCI) are 488 and 548, respectively, greater 
      than the respective YTD 2016 averages of 421 and 494.


                                        








Investment-Grade Credit-Opinion Loans: Two loans in the pool, Hilton 
      Hawaiian Village (8.7% of pool) and Potomac Mills (6.2% of pool), have 
      investment-grade credit opinions. Hilton Hawaiian Village has an 
      investment-grade credit opinion of 'BBB-sf*' on a stand-alone basis. 
      Potomac Mills has an investment-grade credit opinion of 'BBBsf*' on a 
      stand-alone basis. The two loans have a weighted average Fitch DSCR and 
      LTV of 1.56x and 62.0%, respectively. The proportion of credit-opinion 
      loans in this pool of 14.9% is well above the YTD 2016 average of 7.7%.


                                        








Limited Amortization: Based on the scheduled balance at maturity, the 
      pool will pay down by only 7.8%, which is below the YTD 2016 average of 
      10.5%. Twelve loans, representing 50.5% of the pool, are full-term 
      interest only, and nine loans, representing 15.6% of the pool, are 
      partial interest only. The remainder of the pool is made up of 16 
      balloon loans, representing 33.9% of the pool, with loan terms of five 
      to 10 years.


                                        








RATING SENSITIVITIES


                                        








For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 17.7% below the 
      most recent year's net operating income (NOI; for properties for which a 
      full-year NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing 
      during this period). Unanticipated further declines in property-level 
      NCF could result in higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted 
      loans and in potential rating actions on the certificates.


                                        








Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to CFCRE 2016-C7 
      certificates and found that the transaction displays average sensitivity 
      to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF declined a 
      further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 'AAAsf' 
      certificates to 'Asf' could occur. In a more severe scenario, in which 
      NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 
      'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB+sf' could occur. The presale report 
      includes a detailed explanation of additional stresses and sensitivities 
      on page 12.

      retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. 
      All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in 
      making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on 
      factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from 
      other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable 
      investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance 
      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of 
      that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources 
      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third-party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.


                                        








The information in this report is provided "as is" without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of 
      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or 
      the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative 
      efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may 
      be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to 
      print subscribers.
