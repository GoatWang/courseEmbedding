Exchange-Traded Funds

                Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) provide an efficient and simple way to invest in worldwide markets. ETFs offer investors the opportunity to buy and sell an entire basket of securities with a single transaction throughout the trading day. ETFs combine the characteristics of a mutual fund with the convenience and trading flexibility of stocks. ETFs offer investors the potential advantages of low operating costs and improved tax efficiency over traditional, actively-managed mutual funds.

How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve 
              
              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

   The First Estimate for Q2 Real GDP Growth is 2.6% at an Annual Rate



Posted Under: Data Watch • GDP


 Implications:  Nothing in today's GDP report, which includes our first look at economic growth in the second quarter as well as quarterly revisions dating back to 2014, alters our view that the economy remains a Plow Horse.  Real GDP grew at a 2.6% annual rate in the second quarter of the year, not much different from the average growth rate of 2.1% dating back to the start of the economic recovery in mid-2009.  The best news in today's report was that for the second straight quarter, we had an increase in each major part of business investment – investment in equipment, commercial construction, and intellectual property.  That change signals greater business optimism about the future and, if it's sustained, will translate into faster measured productivity growth and economic growth in the next few years.  We like to follow "core" real GDP, which excludes inventories, international trade, and government purchases, none of which can generate long-term economic growth.  Core real GDP grew at a solid 2.7% annual pace in Q2, and that includes a drop in home building at a 6.8% rate that's likely to reverse in the quarters to come, given strong fundamentals in that sector.  In the past year, core GDP is up 2.8%.  In terms of the Federal Reserve, nothing in today's report should alter the likely path of monetary policy over the next year or so.  Nominal GDP (real GDP growth plus inflation) rose at a 3.6% annual rate in Q2, is up 3.7% in the past year, and up at a 3.1% annual rate in the past two years.  All of these figures suggest short-term interest rates should be higher than the roughly 1% where they are today.  Look for the Fed to stay on the path to raising rates again by December and initiating reductions to the size of the balance sheet at the next meeting in late September.  Although investors have their doubts about another rate hike later this year, we think those doubts will recede in the next couple of months.  Slow inventory investment has been holding back the economy in the first half of 2017.  We expect inventories to grow in the second half and for real GDP to grow faster as well.  It's early, but right now we're penciling in a real GDP growth rate of 3%+ in the second half.

   New Orders for Durable Goods Rose 6.5% in June



Posted Under: Data Watch • Durable Goods


 Implications:  Durable goods orders grew at the fastest pace in nearly three years in June, as Boeing had a surge in orders for new commercial aircraft.  Still, take out orders from the consistently volatile transportation sector, and orders rose 0.2% in June.  That was below what the consensus was expecting but upward revisions to May, when added to the June gain, shows ex-transportation orders up 0.5%.  In the past year, orders ex-transportation are up 6.8%, the largest gain since 2012.  The best news in today's report was for shipments of non-defense capital goods ex-aircraft, or "core" shipments.  These rose 0.2% in June and revised upward for May.  As a result, these orders were up at a 4.2% annual rate in Q2 versus the Q1 average, representing the third consecutive quarter of healthy growth following near constant declines from late 2014 to late 2016.  In part, this reflects the fact that energy prices have been more stable since the huge decline in late 2014.  However, it also likely reflects the willingness of businesses to invest more aggressively for efficiency purposes as the labor market gets tighter.  It looks like companies may be tired of waiting for Washington to make progress on tax reform and other issues, and starting to commit to significant longer-term decisions.  In employment news this morning, initial jobless claims rose 10,000 last week to 244,000, which is also the four-week moving average.  Meanwhile continuing claims declined 13,000 to 1.96 million.  It's still early – we will update our models next week as we get more claims data plus the ADP report – but plugging today's figures into our models suggests payrolls are up about 175,000 in July.

   The Road to Normal Starts in September



Posted Under: Government • Fed Reserve • Interest Rates


 The Federal Reserve made no changes to interest rates today and made almost no changes to the text of its statement.  However, the wording changes it did make strongly support our view the Fed will announce the start of balance sheet reductions at the end of its next meeting on September 20.
First, the Fed qualified its reference to maintaining its current policy of rolling over principal payments by saying this was the policy only for the "time being."  
Second, at the last meeting in June, the Fed said renormalization would start "this year."  Now it says "relatively soon," the same language Fed Chief Yellen used at the press conference (but not the Fed's official statement) back in June.   
Third, back in June the Fed said it "currently" expected to start renormalizing the balance sheet.  That left the Fed wiggle room to change its own expectation, as if it anticipated the possibility of making a change to its timing.  Now, by removing "currently," the Fed is essentially saying the likelihood of changing its mind is much lower.
Put it all together and it looks like an announcement about renormalization is very likely to happen at the next meeting.  Moreover, there were no dissents at all from today's statement, unlike in June, when Minneapolis President Neel Kashkari made a dovish dissent.      
We expect the Fed's September announcement about renormalization to follow the path suggested in June.   For the first three months (presumably, October – December) the Fed will reduce its balance sheet by $10 billion per month ($6 billion in Treasury securities, $4 billion in mortgage-related securities).  Then, every three months, the amount of monthly balance sheet reduction will rise by $10 billion (with the same 60/40 proportion between Treasury securities and mortgage-related securities).  That escalation will continue until the Fed is cutting its balance sheet by $50 billion per month (presumably in the last quarter of 2018).  
Meanwhile, the Fed softened language surrounding inflation expectations, but made it clear they still anticipate inflation moving towards their 2% inflation target over the medium term. Given the continued improvements in the labor market and consistent – if modest - inflation, we still anticipate the Fed will raise rates once more in 2017. That may change as markets react to the balance sheet normalization process and additional economic data, but, unlike many in the market, we place the odds of a December rate hike at well over 50%.
While others fret about renormalization and rising rates damaging the economy or financial markets, investors should remain bullish.  Look for faster economic growth and a continuation of the bull market in equities in the years ahead.

 Implications:  The trend in new home sales remains upward.  Sales rose 0.8% in June and are up a healthy 9.1% from a year ago.  Although the inventory of unsold new homes rose 3,000 in June, that's not a sign of overbuilding or a reason to be concerned.  The months' supply of new homes – how long it would take to sell all the homes in inventory – is 5.4 months.  By contrast, the average over the past decade is 6.7 months, the average over the past 20 years is 5.6 months.  Moreover, 76% of the current inventory is made up of homes where construction either hasn't started yet or is still underway, meaning these aren't completed homes sitting unsold that will create a headwind for future construction. There are a few key reasons for our positive outlook on housing.  First, job gains continue, which should put continued upward pressure on wage growth.  Second, credit standards in the mortgage market are thawing.  Third, the homeownership rate remains depressed as a larger share of the population is renting, leaving plenty of potential buyers as economic conditions continue to improve.  Look for the upward trend in new home sales to continue in the next few years, which means more room for construction and inventories as well.  On the home price front, the national Case-Shiller index increased 0.2% in May and is up 5.6% in the past year.  That's an acceleration from the 5.0% gain in the year ending in May 2016.  Meanwhile, the FHFA index, which measures prices for homes financed with conforming mortgages, increased 0.4% in May and is up 6.9% in the past year, an acceleration from the 5.9% price gain in the year ending in May 2016.  Faster price gains and more rapid acceleration in the FHFA index are likely due to stricter limits on building middle- and lower-end housing.  Regulations add to the fixed cost of housing, which are easier to absorb on higher priced homes.  On the manufacturing front, the Richmond Fed index, which measures mid-Atlantic factory sentiment, increased to +14 in July from +11 in June.  The +14 for July is the highest for any July since the late 1990s and signals continued health in manufacturing.

   Existing Home Sales Declined 1.8% in June



Posted Under: Data Watch • Home Sales • Housing


 Implications:  Existing home sales took a breather in June, giving up ground as median prices reached a new record high for the second consecutive month.  Sales of previously-owned homes fell 1.8% in June to a 5.52 million annual rate, but are still up 0.7% from a year ago.  Going forward, it is important to remember that home sales are volatile from month to month, but we expect the general upward trend of the past several years to keep going.  That being said, tight supply and rising prices remain headwinds.  Inventories have now fallen on a year-over-year basis for 25 consecutive months and are down 7.1% from a year ago.  Inventories are now the lowest for any June since at least the late 1990s.  This has also affected the months' supply of existing homes – how long it would take to sell the current inventory at the most recent sales pace – which was 4.3 months in June, down from 4.6 months a year ago.  According to the NAR, anything less than 5.0 months is considered tight supply, a benchmark which hasn't been exceeded since November 2015.  The good news is that demand for existing homes in June was so strong that 54% of listings were on the market for less than a month.  Higher demand and a shift in the "mix" of homes sold toward more expensive properties has also driven up median prices, which have now risen for 64 consecutive months on a year-over-year basis, and reached a new record high in June.  The strongest growth in sales over the past year is heavily skewed towards the most expensive homes, signaling that supply constraints may be disproportionately hitting the lower end of the market.  Tough regulations on land use raise the fixed costs of housing, tilting development toward higher-end homes.  The NAR suggests that strong demand could also be pushing some properties into higher brackets as multiple offers boost final sales prices.  Although some analysts may be concerned about the impact of higher mortgage rates, it's important to recognize that rates are still low by historical standards, incomes are growing, and the appetite for homeownership is eventually going to move higher again.

   Moderate Growth for Q2






Since the start of the economic recovery in mid-2009, real GDP has grown at an average annual rate of 2.1%.  The second quarter of this year doesn't look much different.  Our calculations suggest real GDP grew at a 2.5% annual rate in Q2, exactly the same as the consensus forecast.
That's an acceleration from the 1.4% pace in Q1 and we expect better growth ahead. But consistently better growth is going to take more than lots of talk from Washington, DC.  Instead, it's going to take some concrete steps, like less regulation, lower tax rates, less spending, and a more free-market approach to health care.        
Here's how we get to 2.5% for Q2.
Consumption:  Automakers reported car and light truck sales dropped at a 12.3% annual rate in Q2.  "Real" (inflation-adjusted) retail sales outside the auto sector grew at a 1.2% rate, but growth in services was strong, in part due to a rebound in (seasonally-adjusted) utility output after unusually mild weather in January and February.  Our models suggest  real personal consumption of goods and services, combined, grew at a 2.9% annual rate in Q2, contributing 2.0 points to the real GDP growth rate (2.9 times the consumption share of GDP, which is 69%, equals 2.0).
Business Investment:  After clicking on all cylinders in Q1, business investment grew more modestly in Q2.  Investment in business equipment and intellectual property both grew at about a 4% rate, but commercial construction fell at about a 7% pace.  Combined, it looks like they grew at a 1.7% rate, which should add 0.2 points to the real GDP growth.  (1.7 times the 13% business investment share of GDP equals 0.2).
Home Building:  While boosting utilities in Q2, the return to more normal weather patterns dampened home construction.  Home building looks like it grew in Q2, but at a 2.5% annualized pace rather than the 12.9% pace in Q1.  The trend is somewhere between the two and we expect continued growth in this sector even if mortgage rates rise, as more jobs and faster wage growth will lead to more demand for housing.  In the meantime, a 2.5% growth rate will add 0.1 points to the real GDP growth rate.  (2.5 times the home building share of GDP, which is 4%, equals 0.1).
Government:  Both military spending and public construction projects look close to trend in Q2.  On net, we're estimating that real government purchases were up at a 1.4% annual rate in Q2, which would add 0.2 points to the real GDP growth rate.  (1.4 times the government purchase share of GDP, which is 17%, equals 0.2).
Trade:  At this point, we only have trade data through May.  Based on what we've seen so far, it looks like net exports should subtract 0.3 points from the real GDP growth rate in Q2.   
Inventories:  We have even less information on inventories than we do on trade, but what we have so far suggests companies are stocking shelves and showrooms at a slightly faster pace in Q2 than they were in Q1, which should add 0.3 points to the real GDP growth rate.
Keep in mind that there are reports on durable goods as well as international trade and inventories the day before the GDP release and those figures could change our forecast as well.  But, for the time being, you can put it all together, and get an estimate of 2.5% for Q2.  
No one should be excited or dismayed by this report.  It is the epitome of the Plow Horse pace of growth we've had for the past eight years.   Hopefully, Washington will now get its act together and make this one of the last Plow Horse reports we have to see.

   Housing Starts Increased 8.3% in June



Posted Under: Data Watch • Home Starts • Housing


 Implications:  After falling for three consecutive months, housing starts rebounded strongly in June, beating the consensus to post their largest monthly gain of the year.  Even though both single-family and multi-unit starts were responsible for the gain in June's headline number, in the past year single-family starts are up 10.3% while multi-unit starts are down 12.9%.  The "mix" of construction has been generally shifting toward single-family building and this is a good sign for the overall economy.  When the housing recovery started, multi-family construction led the way. But the share of all housing starts that are multi-family appears to have peaked in 2015, when 35.7% of all starts were multi-family, the largest since the mid-1980s, when the last wave of Baby Boomers was growing up and moving to cities. In June, the multi-family share of starts was 30.1%.  The shift toward single-family is a positive sign for the economy because, on average, each single-family home contributes to GDP about twice the amount of a multi-family unit.  Based on population growth and "scrappage," housing starts should eventually rise to about 1.5 million units per year. In other words, much of the recovery in home building is still ahead of us.  Another bright spot in today's report was that housing completions rose 5.2% in June and are now up 8.1% in the past year.  Further, building permits for new structures posted their biggest one month jump since 2015 in June.  Expect housing starts to continue to gain steam in the months ahead as more unfinished projects are completed and builders move onto new ones.  In other recent housing news, the NAHB index, which measures sentiment among home builders fell to a still elevated 64 in July from 67 in June.  Expect further strength in the housing sector in the year ahead as more jobs, faster wage growth, and, for at least the time being, optimism about more market-friendly policies from the Trump Administration, continue to encourage both prospective home buyers and builders.  On the factory front, the Empire State index, a measure of manufacturing sentiment in New York, fell to a still healthy 9.8 in July from 19.8 in June. Finally, on inflation, import prices fell 0.2% in June but are up 1.5% from a year ago.  Export prices also fell 0.2% in June, but have increased 0.6% in the past year.  Both figures are a stark contrast to the negative direction of prices in the year ending in June 2016.

First Trust Announces Completion Of First Trust Dividend And Income Fund's Merger Into First Trust High Income ETF, An Actively-Managed Exchange-Traded Fund






Business Wire




Oct 24, 2016 9:29 AM EDT













 




























































  First Trust Advisors L.P. ("FTA") announced today that the merger of First Trust Dividend and Income Fund (NYSE: FAV), a closed-end fund managed by FTA, with and into First Trust High Income ETF (Nasdaq: FTHI), an actively-managed exchange-traded fund and series of First Trust Exchange-Traded Fund VI (the "Trust"), was completed prior to the open of the New York Stock Exchange on October 24, 2016.  As previously announced, the shareholders of FAV approved the fund's merger with and into FTHI at a Joint Special Meeting of Shareholders on October 3, 2016. At the same meeting, shareholders of FTHI approved the issuance of FTHI shares in connection with the merger. The merger was approved by the Board of Trustees of each of FAV and the Trust on March 18, 2016.  In the merger, the assets of FAV were transferred to, and the liabilities of FAV were assumed by, FTHI. The shareholders of FAV received shares of FTHI with a value equal to the aggregate net asset value of the FAV shares held by them.  FTHI is an actively-managed ETF that seeks to provide current income, with a secondary investment objective of capital appreciation. FTHI pursues these investment objectives by combining a stock portfolio with an index option strategy. FTHI invests primarily in U.S. equity securities of all market capitalizations, favoring high dividend-paying common stocks. FTHI also utilizes an options strategy in which it writes (sells) U.S. exchange-traded covered call options on the S&P 500 Index seeking to generate additional cash flow in the form of premiums on the options that may be distributed to shareholders on a monthly basis.  First Trust Advisors L.P., along with its affiliate, First Trust Portfolios L.P., are privately-held companies which provide a variety of investment services, including asset management and financial advisory services, with collective assets under management or supervision of approximately $98 billion as of September 30, 2016 through unit investment trusts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, mutual funds and separate managed accounts.

First Trust Files Prospectus for FT 6766 Medical Cannabis Portfolio Series
Illinois-based fund manager First Trust, which manages over $100 billion in aggregate across a range of retail and institutional investment products, has filed a S-6 prospectus for a medical cannabis unit investment trust (UIT), FT 6766, which consists of a single portfolio known as Medical Cannabis Portfolio Series. A UIT is a pooled investment vehicle with a defined lifespan that is invested in a fixed portfolio of securities.
While Horizons ETF Managers was the first fund manager to launch a cannabis portfolio with its Horizons Medical Marijuana Life Sciences ETF  (TSX: HMMJ) (OTC: HMLSF), which now has C$115mm in net assets, FT 6766 could become the first U.S. listed cannabis fund. First Trust is intending to price it at the same initial price that Horizons ETF used, $10.00, and it will have a maximum sales charge of 2.75%. The Bank of New York Mellon will serve as Trustee.
The prospectus describes the objective as “above-average capital appreciation”. Stocks will be selected from the Indxx Cannabis Index, which is not yet listed on the provider’s website. Its team of analysts will “thoroughly evaluate each company for inclusion in the portfolio based upon each company’s association with the medical aspects of cannabis as well as their analysis of other screens for liquidity constraints.” Importantly, the Trust has “mandatory termination date” of June 28, 2019.
Editor’s note: Subsequent to publication, First Trust filed an amended prospectus that no longer included Bank of New York Mellon as Trustee

As a result of several factors which may include changing interest rates, refundings, and sales or defaults on the underlying securities, there is no guarantee that distributions will either remain at current levels or increase over time. Estimated current return is determined by dividing a Trusts estimated net annual interest income per unit by the public offering price per unit. Estimated long-term return is a measure of the estimated return over the estimated life of a Trust. Unlike estimated current return, estimated long-term return reflects maturities, estimated principal prepayments, Trust charges and expenses, and discounts and premiums of securities in a Trust. Returns and prices will fluctuate. Consult a prospectus for a more complete description of the estimated net income, estimated current return and estimated long-term return calculations.





This product information does not constitute an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy securities in any state to any person to whom it is not lawful to make such an offer.  Sales of any of these securities must include prospectus delivery and the services of a retail broker/dealer duly licensed in the appropriate states.
