Investar Holding Corporation Key Developments

Investar Holding Corporation Announces Unaudited Consolidated Earnings Results for the Second Quarter and Six Months Ended June 30, 2017
Jul 26 17
Investar Holding Corporation announced unaudited consolidated earnings results for the second quarter and six months ended June 30, 2017. For the quarter, the company reported net income of $1.9 million, or $0.22 per diluted share compared to $1.9 million, or $0.26 per diluted share for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, and $2.0 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. Net interest income totaled $9.3 million, an increase of $0.4 million, or 5.0%, compared to the first quarter of 2017, and an increase of $0.6 million, or 7.4%, compared to the second quarter of 2016. The increase in net interest income is mainly a result of continued growth of the Company’s loan portfolio, with an increase in net interest income of $0.9 million due to an increase in volume offset by a $0.3 million decrease related to an increase in the cost of funds compared to the second quarter of 2016. The company reported both basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.22, a decrease of $0.06 compared to basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.28 for the three months ended June 30, 2016. The decrease in both basic and diluted earnings per share is directly attributable to the company’s issuance of approximately 1.6 million common shares as part of a public offering on March 22, 2017. Total interest income was $11.844 million against $10.719 million reported last year. Income before income tax expense was $2.800 million against $3.010 million reported last year. Book value per common share at the end of the period was $17.11 against $15.63 reported a year ago. Tangible book value per share at the end of the period was $16.74 against $15.18 reported a year ago. Return on average assets was 5.15% against 0.74% and return on average equity was 5.15% against 7.18% reported last year.

For the six months, the company reported net income of $3,787,000 or $0.47 per diluted share compared to net income available to common shareholders of $3,995,000 or $0.55 per diluted share reported in the same period last year. Total interest income was $22.937 million against $21.097 million reported last year. Net interest income was $18.162 million against $17.205 million reported last year. Income before income tax expense was $5.511 million against $6.006 million reported last year.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.
