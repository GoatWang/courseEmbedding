Build America Bonds Income Trust (BABS0037)
	
		





Objective
		  	
		
		Build America Bonds are new taxable municipal bonds created from the $787 billion stimulus package passed in 2009 by Congress. The purpose of the bonds is to build and repair America's roads, bridges, transit and rail systems, schools, ports and inland waterways, and other infrastructure, while stimulating the U.S. economy and job growth. Van Kampen Unit Trusts provide investors with convenient access to a diversified portfolio of taxable municipal bonds with a low minimum investment, consistent monthly income, daily liquidity and transparency.




Investment objective The trust seeks to provide a high level of current income and to preserve capital. The trust invests in a portfolio of long-term taxable municipal bonds, primarily consisting of "Build America Bonds". As of the date of deposit, the trust will invest at least 80% of its assets in Build America Bonds, and may include other taxable municipal bonds for purposes of diversification.

1Estimated current return (ECR) is based on the estimated annual income as a percentage of the current price of the units. Estimated long-term return (ELTR) is calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values, yields (which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirement of all the bonds in the trust and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with each trust unit. There can be no assurance that either the estimated current return or ELTR will be realized in the future and an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
2The ELTR life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's portfolio determined for the purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return.
3Estimated Annual Income Per Unit is as of close the most recent business day and is based on the estimated cash flows per unit. This amount will vary with changes in expenses, interest rates and the maturity, call or sale of bonds.
4Estimated Daily Rate of Accrual represents the annual interest from the securities within the portfolio divided by the number of days on which interest is calculated annually.
5Represents the principal amount of the underlying bonds per unit. Bonds may be sold to meet redemptions, to pay expenses, and in other limited circumstances. The sale of bonds will affect the principal amount of bonds included in the trust and as a result the principal amount of bonds per unit. There can be no assurance that a unitholder will receive this par value per unit in the future.


For Fixed-Income trusts, "S.F." indicates a sinking fund is established with respect to an issue of bonds.The trust portfolio is provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the individual securities shown above.



 Important Information About Benchmarks





About risk



There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust.An investment in the trust should be made with an understanding of the risks associated therewith, such as the inability of the issuer or an insurer to pay the principal of or interest on a bond when due, volatile interest rates, early call provisions and changes to the tax status of the bonds. As interest rates rise, bond prices fall.Investments in this trust may be subject to interest rate risk. If interest rates rise, the value of the bonds in a trust may decline and if interest rates decline the value of the bonds may increase. Also, the longer the period to maturity, the greater the sensitivity to interest rate changes tends to be.In particular, should a Build America Bond's issuer fail to continue to meet the applicable requirements imposed on the bonds as provided by the American Recovery & Reinvestment Act of 2009, it is possible that such issuer may not receive federal cash subsidy payments, impairing the issuer's ability to make scheduled interest payments.The trust may concentrate in bonds of a particular type of issuer. This makes the trust less diversified and subject to a greater risk than a more diversified portfolio.

1The S&P and Moody's ratings apply to the bonds held by the trust, and not the trust itself.   A Standard & Poor's credit rating is a current opinion of the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific debt obligation. This opinion of creditworthiness may take into consideration the creditworthiness of guarantors, insurers or other forms of credit enhancement on the obligation.  Moody's municipal ratings are opinions of the investment quality of the issues and issues in the US municipal and tax-exempt markets. As such, these ratings incorporate Moody's assessment of the default probability and loss severity of these issuers and issues.


1Estimated current return (ECR) is based on the estimated annual income as a percentage of the current price of the units. Estimated long-term return (ELTR) is calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values, yields (which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirement of all the bonds in the trust and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with each trust unit. There can be no assurance that either the estimated current return or ELTR will be realized in the future and an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
2The ELTR life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's portfolio determined for the purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return.
3Estimated Annual Income Per Unit is as of close the most recent business day and is based on the estimated cash flows per unit. This amount will vary with changes in expenses, interest rates and the maturity, call or sale of bonds.
4Estimated Daily Rate of Accrual represents the annual interest from the securities within the portfolio divided by the number of days on which interest is calculated annually.
5Represents the principal amount of the underlying bonds per unit. Bonds may be sold to meet redemptions, to pay expenses, and in other limited circumstances. The sale of bonds will affect the principal amount of bonds included in the trust and as a result the principal amount of bonds per unit. There can be no assurance that a unitholder will receive this par value per unit in the future.

About risk



There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust.An investment in the trust should be made with an understanding of the risks associated therewith, such as the inability of the issuer or an insurer to pay the principal of or interest on a bond when due, volatile interest rates, early call provisions and changes to the tax status of the bonds. As interest rates rise, bond prices fall.Investments in this trust may be subject to interest rate risk. If interest rates rise, the value of the bonds in a trust may decline and if interest rates decline the value of the bonds may increase. Also, the longer the period to maturity, the greater the sensitivity to interest rate changes tends to be.In particular, should a Build America Bond's issuer fail to continue to meet the applicable requirements imposed on the bonds as provided by the American Recovery & Reinvestment Act of 2009, it is possible that such issuer may not receive federal cash subsidy payments, impairing the issuer's ability to make scheduled interest payments.The trust may concentrate in bonds of a particular type of issuer. This makes the trust less diversified and subject to a greater risk than a more diversified portfolio.

For individual series that have terminated, performance data quoted is from the deposit date through the termination date.Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate and units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
Returns are cumulative total returns (not annualized) unless labeled as average annual total returns. All returns reflect trust expenses as incurred and assume reinvestment of income and principal distributions, except for trusts that do not offer the option of reinvesting distributions into additional trust units. Please see the related trust prospectus for additional information. Returns do not reflect taxes.
A trust's performance, especially for short time periods, should not be the sole factor in making your investment decision. Please keep in mind that high, double-digit returns are highly unusual and cannot be sustained. Investors should also be aware that these returns were primarily achieved during favorable market conditions.
Returns With Sales Charge reflect the maximum sales charge that would be payable by an investor upon sale or redemption of units at the end of the applicable period(s). The sales charge includes any initial or deferred sales charges other than creation and development fee. These returns do not reflect any creation and development fee prior to collection (generally the close of the initial offering period). Any creation and development fee is reflected in the returns as of the time of payment. by a trust. These returns reflect any contingent deferred sales charges only if the charges would be payable upon a unit sale or redemption at or prior to the end of the applicable performance period(s). Certain trusts are no longer offered for sale to the public and, as a result, do not publish an offer price or have a sales charge. In these cases, returns will not reflect a sales charge if a trust was not actually offered for sale to the public on the first day of the applicable period because units of the trust could not have been purchased by an investor at that time. These returns will show 'N/A' for With Sales Charge data
Returns Without Sales Charge do not reflect any sales charge and do not reflect any creation and development fee prior to collection (generally the close of the initial offering period). Any creation and development fee is reflected in the returns as of the time of payment by a trust.

There can be no assurance that either the estimated current return or ELTR will be realized in the future and an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
2The ELTR life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's portfolio determined for the purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return.
3Estimated Annual Income Per Unit is as of close the most recent business day and is based on the estimated cash flows per unit. This amount will vary with changes in expenses, interest rates and the maturity, call or sale of bonds.
4Estimated Daily Rate of Accrual represents the annual interest from the securities within the portfolio divided by the number of days on which interest is calculated annually.
5Represents the principal amount of the underlying bonds per unit. Bonds may be sold to meet redemptions, to pay expenses, and in other limited circumstances. The sale of bonds will affect the principal amount of bonds included in the trust and as a result the principal amount of bonds per unit. There can be no assurance that a unitholder will receive this par value per unit in the future.


 Important Information About Benchmarks





About risk



There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust.An investment in the trust should be made with an understanding of the risks associated therewith, such as the inability of the issuer or an insurer to pay the principal of or interest on a bond when due, volatile interest rates, early call provisions and changes to the tax status of the bonds. As interest rates rise, bond prices fall.Investments in this trust may be subject to interest rate risk. If interest rates rise, the value of the bonds in a trust may decline and if interest rates decline the value of the bonds may increase. Also, the longer the period to maturity, the greater the sensitivity to interest rate changes tends to be.In particular, should a Build America Bond's issuer fail to continue to meet the applicable requirements imposed on the bonds as provided by the American Recovery & Reinvestment Act of 2009, it is possible that such issuer may not receive federal cash subsidy payments, impairing the issuer's ability to make scheduled interest payments.The trust may concentrate in bonds of a particular type of issuer. This makes the trust less diversified and subject to a greater risk than a more diversified portfolio.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors of Van Kampen Funds Inc. and the Unitholders of Van   
Kampen Focus Portfolios, Series 390 (Central Equity Trust, Diversified Income   
Series 10):                                                                     
We have audited the accompanying statement of condition (including the    
analysis of net assets) and the related portfolio schedule of Central Equity    
Trust, Diversified Income Series 10 (included in Van Kampen Focus Portfolios,   
Series 390) as of May 31, 2006 and the related statements of operations and     
changes in net assets for the period from June 4, 2003 (Initial Date of Deposit)
through May 31, 2004 and the years ended May 31, 2005 and 2006. These statements
are the responsibility of the Trustee and the Sponsor. Our responsibility is to 
express an opinion on such statements based on our audits.                      
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public    
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the 
financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Trust is not        
required to have, nor were we engaged to perform an audit of its internal       
control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal 
control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that 
are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an  
opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over financial     
reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes      
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in  
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and          
significant estimates made by the Trustee and Sponsor, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation  
of securities owned at May 31, 2006 by correspondence with the Trustee. We      
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.             
   In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Central Equity Trust,          
Diversified Income Series 10 (included in Van Kampen Focus Portfolios, Series   
390) as of May 31, 2006 and the results of operations and changes in net assets 
for the period from June 4, 2003 (Initial Date of Deposit) through May 31, 2004 
and the years ended May 31, 2005 and 2006, in conformity with accounting        
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

 VAN KAMPEN FOCUS PORTFOLIOS, SERIES 390
 Notes to Financial Statements
 May 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES                             
Security Valuation - Securities are valued as described in Prospectus Part
II.                                                                             

  Security Cost - The cost of the Securities is determined based on the actual
price paid by the Trust on the various dates of deposit.                        

  Unit Valuation - The redemption price per Unit is the pro rata share of each
Unit based upon (1) the cash on hand in the Trust or monies in the process of   
being collected, (2) the Securities in the Trust based on the value as described
in Note 1 and (3) accumulated dividends thereon, less accrued expenses of the   
Trust, if any.                                                                  

Federal Income Taxes - Unitholders are considered to be the owner of a pro
rata portion of the related Trust and, accordingly, no provisions have been made
for Federal income taxes.                                                       

Other - The financial statements are presented on the accrual basis of    
accounting. Any realized gains or losses from securities transactions are       
reported on an identified cost basis.                                           

NOTE 2 - PORTFOLIO                                                              
Unrealized Appreciation and Depreciation - An analysis of net unrealized  
appreciation (depreciation) at May 31, 2006 is as follows:                      

Unrealized Appreciation       $    19,821,843                             
Unrealized Depreciation            (2,454,000)

NOTE 3- OTHER                                                                   
Marketability - Although it is not obligated to do so, the Underwriter    
intends to maintain a market for Units and to continuously offer to purchase    
Units at prices, subject to change at any time, based upon the value of the     
Securities in the portfolio of the Trust valued as described in Note 1, plus    
accumulated dividends to the date of settlement. If the supply of Units exceeds 
demand, or for other business reasons, the Underwriter may discontinue purchases
of Units at such prices. In the event that a market is not maintained for the   
Units, a Unitholder desiring to dispose of his Units may be able to do so only  
by tendering such units to the Trustee for redemption at the redemption price.  

   Cost to Investors - The cost to original investors was based on adding to the
underlying value of the Securities per Unit on the date of an investor's        
purchase, plus an amount equal to the maximum sales charge of 4.50% of the      
public offering price which is equivalent to 4.712% of the aggregate underlying 
value of the Securities. On each June 4, commencing June 4, 2004, the secondary 
market sales charge will decrease by .5 of 1% to a minimum sales charge of 2.3%.

Compensation of Sponsor and Supervisor - The Supervisor receives a fee for
providing portfolio supervisory services for the Trust ($.0025 per Unit, not to 
exceed the aggregate cost of the Supervisor for providing such services to all  
applicable Trusts). The Sponsor receives and annual fee for performing          
bookkeeping and administrative services for the Trust. Both fees may be adjusted
for increases under the category "All Services Less Rent of Shelter" in the     
Consumer Price Index.                                                           

NOTE 4 - REDEMPTION OF UNITS                                                    
   During the period from June 4, 2003 (Initial Date of Deposit) through May 31,
2004 and the years ended May 31, 2005 and 2006, 269,026 Units, 459,189 Units and
585,885 Units, respectively, were presented for redemption.

THE TRUST 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The Trust was created under the laws of the State of New York pursuant to a
Trust Indenture and Trust Agreement (the "Trust Agreement"), dated the date of  
this prospectus (the "Initial Date of Deposit"), among Van Kampen Funds Inc., as
Sponsor, Van Kampen Asset Management, as Supervisor, and The Bank of New York,  
as Trustee and, in certain cases, as Evaluator, or their predecessors. Effective
April 23, 2001 American Portfolio Evaluation Services, a division of Van Kampen 
Investment Advisory Corp., resigned as Evaluator and The Bank of New York was   
appointed successor Evaluator.                                                  

   The Trust offers the opportunity to purchase Units representing proportionate
interests in a portfolio of equity securities. The Trust may be an appropriate  
medium for investors who desire to participate in a portfolio of common stocks  
with greater diversification than they might be able to acquire individually.   

On the Initial Date of Deposit, the Sponsor deposited delivery statements 
relating to contracts for the purchase of the Securities and an irrevocable     
letter of credit in the amount required for these purchases with the Trustee. In
exchange for these contracts the Trustee delivered to the Sponsor documentation 
evidencing the ownership of Units of the Trust. Unless otherwise terminated as  
provided in the Trust Agreement, the Trust will terminate on the Mandatory      
Termination Date and any remaining Securities will be liquidated or distributed 
by the Trustee within a reasonable time. As used in this prospectus the term    
"Securities" means the securities (including contracts to purchase these        
securities) listed in the "Portfolio" in Part One and any additional securities 
deposited into the Trust.                                                       

Additional Units may be issued at any time by depositing in the Trust (i) 
additional Securities, (ii) contracts to purchase Securities together with cash 
or irrevocable letters of credit or (iii) cash (or a letter of credit or the    
equivalent) with instructions to purchase additional Securities. As additional  
Units are issued by the Trust, the aggregate value of the Securities will be    
increased and the fractional undivided interest represented by each Unit will be
decreased. The Sponsor may continue to make additional deposits into the Trust  
following the Initial Date of Deposit, provided that the additional deposits    
will be in amounts which will maintain, as nearly as practicable, the same      
percentage relationship among the number of shares of each Security in the      
Trust's portfolio as existed immediately prior to the subsequent deposit.       
Investors may experience a dilution of their investments and a reduction in     
their anticipated income because of fluctuations in the prices of the Securities
between the time of the deposit and the purchase of the Securities and because  
the Trust will pay the associated brokerage or acquisition fees.                

   Each Unit initially offered represents an undivided interest in the Trust. To
the extent that any Units are redeemed by the Trustee or additional Units are   
issued as a result of additional Securities being deposited by the Sponsor, the 
fractional undivided interest in the Trust represented by each unredeemed Unit  
will increase or decrease accordingly, although the actual interest in the Trust
will remain unchanged. Units will remain outstanding until redeemed upon tender 
to the Trustee by Unitholders, which may include the Sponsor, or until the      
termination of the Trust Agreement.                                             

The Trust consists of (a) the Securities (including contracts for the     
purchase thereof) listed under the "Portfolio" in Part One as may continue to be
held from time to time in the Trust, (b) any additional Securities acquired and 
held by the Trust pursuant to the provisions of the Trust Agreement and (c) any 
cash held in the related Income and Capital Accounts. Neither the Sponsor nor   
the Trustee shall be liable in any way for any failure in any of the Securities.

OBJECTIVES AND SECURITIES SELECTION 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The objective of the Trust is to provide capital appreciation and dividend
income. The Trust seeks to achieve its objective by investing in a portfolio of 
stocks of companies which may include United States domestic electric utilities,
natural gas utilities, water utilities, telecommunications companies, real      
estate investment trusts, technology companies, health care companies, consumer 
products companies, consumer cyclicals companies, consumer staples companies,   
energy companies, industrials companies or financial services companies. The    
portfolio consists of securities selected by research analysts at Edward D.     
Jones & Co., L.P. (the "Underwriter") and approved by the Sponsor. In selecting 
the Securities, the following factors, among others, were considered: dividend  
yield, geographic diversification, earnings growth rates, regulatory climate and
stock valuation. At the time the Securities were selected, the Underwriter's    
research analysts were currently covering all the issuers of the Securities and 
had published favorable recommendations for each of them. There can be no       
assurance that such coverage will continue for any issuer during the life of the
Trust or that the report on any such issuer will continue to be favorable. A    
downgrade in an analyst's recommendation for an issuer, or the termination of   
such coverage, could negatively affect the performance of the Trust.            

You should note that the selection criteria were applied to the Securities
for inclusion in the Trust as of the Initial Date of Deposit. After this date,  
the Securities may no longer meet the selection criteria. Should a Security no  
longer meet the selection criteria, we will generally not remove the Security   
from the portfolio. In offering the Units to the public, neither the Sponsor nor
any broker-dealers are recommending any of the individual Securities but rather 
the entire pool of Securities, taken as a whole, which are represented by the   
Units.                                                                          

 Telecommunications. The emergence of a global, networked economy appears to
be changing the face of the telecommunications industry. Telecommunications     
companies provide local, long distance and wireless telephone, as well as cable 
television and internet, services and information systems, manufacture          
telecommunications products, and operate voice, data and telecommunications     
networks. As the technology driving this industry group continues to develop and
evolve, telecommunications companies could continue to grow in both customer    
base and services offered.                                                      

  Financial Services. The Trust may invest significantly in financial services
companies. Many banks, insurance companies and other financial services         
companies have recently made changes in the products they offer. The financial  
services industry has experienced a high level of consolidations, mergers and   
acquisitions as well as other regulatory issues. This industry group may be     
appealing for reasons such as deregulation of the banking industry and          
accelerated earnings growth. These factors can potentially provide advantages to
those investing in this industry group.                                         

Utilities. The environment of the electric, natural gas and water utility 
industry appears to be adapting to include recent changes in regulatory         
requirements as well as technological changes. In the past, this industry was   
fraught with government mandated monopolies. Today, many states are deregulating
their utilities which may result in lowering some of the barriers to            
competition. Additionally, utility companies appear to be expanding their       
services and offerings to include other retail services not traditionally       
offered. The growth and expansion occurring could potentially continue as the   
utility industry proceeds through these transformations.                        

  Real Estate Investment Trusts. A real estate investment trust, or REIT, is a
company that buys, develops, finances and/or manages income-producing real      
estate such as apartments, shopping centers, offices and warehouses. A REIT can 
be a good way to invest in commercial real estate. Compared to traditional      
direct investments in real estate, which may be difficult to sell and value,    
REITs are traded on major stock exchanges making them highly liquid. REIT       
investors also gain the advantage of skilled management since REIT management   
teams tend to be experts within their specific property or geographic niches.   
Many believe that the attractive features of property ownership and stock       
ownership are combined in this investment vehicle. REITs can provide investors  
with current income, as they are currently required to distribute 90% of taxable
income annually, and can have the potential for attractive returns. They have   
historically had low relative volatility and may provide inflation protection.  

Consumer Staples. Consumer staples is a relatively mature industry, with  
growth in line with population growth. Recent waves of consolidation in the     
industry have reduced the number of competitors, which has enabled product price
increases in some sectors. Additionally, product innovation has proven key to   
growth and should lead to above-industry growth rates for successful companies. 
The industry is characterized primarily by stable, high-profit margin companies,
several of which pay attractive dividends.                                      

Industrials. The industrials industry includes capital goods, commercial  
services and transportation companies. Generally, growth prospects for the      
industry are tied to economic factors such as consumer and business spending,   
U.S. Gross Domestic Product and exports to foreign nations. The increasingly    
global economy should increase the demand for industrial products made by U.S.  
firms. Within capital goods, defense and electronics are some of the fastest    
growing areas, given the political support for higher government spending on    
defense initiatives. Many industrials companies are well-established and have   
demonstrated a track record of paying dividends and increasing the amount of    
dividends paid over time.                                                       

   Health Care. An aging population, new drug development and product innovation
should drive growth for this industry. Additionally, foreign demand for health  
care, particularly from developing nations, continues to increase. The industry 
has historically grown at a rate faster than the overall economy and that trend 
should continue. Research and development spending, supported by strong demand, 
should lead to new products. Health care companies have traditionally paid part 
of earnings as dividends, which is expected to continue. Given the growth       
prospects for the industry, dividend growth should be meaningful as well.       

  Energy. As the world economy grows, energy use is also expected to rise. The
companies that produce oil and natural gas are finding and developing new       
sources worldwide to satisfy this growing need. Oil companies also refine crude 
oil into useful products such as gasoline and jet fuel, as well as provide the  
raw materials for a wide variety of plastics. Investors benefit from the        
diversity of their businesses, their global reach, and their ability to find    
attractive opportunities in the changing energy marketplace.                    

Technology. The Trust may invest in technology companies. Technology      
companies generally include companies involved in the development, design,      
manufacture and sale of computers, computer related equipment, computer         
networks, communications systems, telecommunications products, electronic       
products, and other related products, systems and services. Technology is a     
cyclical industry, driven by corporate and consumer spending on technology      
products, services and software. New technologies have the potential to increase
productivity and enable new applications. Stable spending on traditional        
technology platforms such as personal computers, plus spending on new           
technologies, should enable the industry to grow faster than the economy.       
Several technology companies are generating substantial excess cash, which they 
have used to begin paying dividends. These companies have the potential to      
increase their dividends on a regular basis.                                    

Consumer Cyclicals. The Trust may invest in companies that manufacture or 
sell products or services, the demand for which is easily influenced by general 
economic conditions. Industries within this segment include advertising,        
airlines, auto parts, auto manufacturing, broadcasting, casinos, clothing and   
fabrics, consumer electronics, entertainment, footwear, furnishings and         
appliances, home construction, lodging, publishing, recreational products and   
services, restaurants, apparel retailers, broadline retailers, drug-based       
retailers, specialty retailers, tires and toys. These companies would be        
expected to perform well during an improving economy but may lag during a       
declining economy. Industries within this group that may hold potential for     
above-average growth include niche retailing, entertainment and media. Many     
companies within this sector are becoming more dividends-focused, and may       
increase their dividends going forward.                                         

Consumer Products. Consumer products is a relatively mature industry, with
growth in-line with population growth. Recent waves of consolidation in the     
industry have reduced the number of competitors, which has enabled product price
increases in some sectors. Additionally, product innovation has proven key to   
growth and should lead to above-industry growth rates for successful companies. 
The industry is characterized primarily by stable, high-profit margin companies,
several of which pay attractive dividends.                                      

  Underwriter Activities. The Underwriter may recommend or effect transactions
in the Securities in its day to day brokerage activities. This may have an      
adverse effect on the prices of the Securities. This also may have an impact on 
the price the Trust pays for the Securities and the price received upon Unit    
redemptions or Trust termination.                                               

The Underwriter, in its day to day activities, may act as a broker, agent,
principal or market maker in connection with the purchase and sale of equity    
securities, including the Securities. The Underwriter may also provide          
investment banking services to the issuers of, or issue reports and make        
recommendations on, the Securities. For any of these brokerage, market-making or
investment banking activities, the Underwriter may receive additional           
compensation. The Underwriter may also receive compensation based on commissions
generated by sales of Units in addition to its concession or agency commission.

RISK FACTORS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  All investments involve risk. This section describes the main risks that can
impact the value of the securities in your Trust. You should understand these   
risks before you invest. If the value of the securities falls, the value of your
Units will also fall. We cannot guarantee that your Trust will achieve its      
objective or that your investment return will be positive over any period.      

   Market Risk. Market risk is the risk that the value of the securities in your
Trust will fluctuate. This could cause the value of your Units to fall below    
your original purchase price. Market value fluctuates in response to various    
factors. These can include changes in interest rates, inflation, the financial  
condition of a security's issuer, perceptions of the issuer, or ratings on a    
security of the issuer. Even though your Trust is supervised, you should        
remember that we do not manage your Trust. Your Trust will not sell a security  
solely because the market value falls as is possible in a managed fund.         

  Dividend Payment Risk. Dividend payment risk is the risk that an issuer of a
security is unwilling or unable to pay income on a security. Stocks represent   
ownership interests in the issuers and are not obligations of the issuers.      
Common stockholders have a right to receive dividends only after the company has
provided for payment of its creditors, bondholders and preferred stockholders.  
Common stocks do not assure dividend payments. Dividends are paid only when     
declared by an issuer's board of directors, and the amount of any dividend may  
vary over time.                                                                 

Financial Services Companies. The Trust invests significantly in banks,   
insurance companies and other financial services companies. Banks and their     
holding companies are especially subject to the adverse effects of economic     
recession, volatile interest rates, portfolio concentrations in geographic      
markets and in commercial and residential real estate loans, and competition    
from new entrants in their fields of business. In addition, banks and their     
holding companies are extensively regulated at both the federal and state level 
and may be adversely affected by increased regulations.                         

  Banks will face increased competition from nontraditional lending sources as
regulatory changes, such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley financial services overhaul  
legislation, permit new entrants to offer various financial products.           
Technological advances such as the Internet allow these nontraditional lending  
sources to cut overhead and permit the more efficient use of customer data.     
Banks are already facing tremendous pressure from mutual funds, brokerage firms 
and other financial service providers in the competition to furnish services    
that were traditionally offered by banks.                                       

Companies engaged in investment management and brokerage activities are   
subject to volatility in their earnings and share prices that often exceeds the 
volatility of the equity market in general. Adverse changes in the direction of 
the stock market, investor confidence, the financial health of customers, equity
transaction volume, the level and direction of interest rates and the outlook of
emerging markets could adversely affect the financial stability, as well as the 
stock prices, of these companies. Additionally, competitive pressures, including
increased competition with new and existing competitors, the ongoing            
commoditization of traditional businesses and the need for increased capital    
expenditures on new technology could adversely impact the profit margins of     
companies in the investment management and brokerage industries. Companies      
involved in investment management and brokerage activities are also subject to  
extensive regulation by government agencies and self-regulatory organizations,  
and changes in laws, regulations or rules, or in the interpretation of such     
laws, regulations and rules, could adversely affect the stock prices of such    
companies.                                                                      

   Companies involved in the insurance, reinsurance and risk management industry
underwrite, sell or distribute property, casualty and business insurance. Many  
factors affect insurance, reinsurance and risk management company profits,      
including interest rate movements, the imposition of premium rate caps, a       
misapprehension of the risks involved in given underwritings, competition and   
pressure to compete globally, weather catastrophes or other natural or man-made 
disasters and the effects of client mergers. Already extensively regulated,     
insurance companies' profits may be adversely affected by increased government  
regulation or tax law changes.                                                  

Utility Companies. Many utility companies, especially electric and gas and
other energy related utility companies, are subject to various uncertainties,   
including:                                                                      

o    risks of increases in fuel and other operating costs;            

    o    restrictions on operations and increased costs and delays as a result
of environmental, nuclear safety and other regulations;     

  o    regulatory restrictions on the ability to pass increasing wholesale
costs along to the retail and business customer;            

o    coping with the general effects of energy conservation;          

    o    technological innovations which may render existing plants, equipment
or products obsolete;                                       

o    the effects of local weather, maturing markets and difficulty in 
 expanding to new markets due to regulatory and other factors;

o    the potential impact of natural or man-made disasters;           

 o    difficulty obtaining adequate returns on invested capital, even if
       frequent rate increases are approved by public service commissions;

o    the high cost of obtaining financing during periods of inflation;

o    difficulties of the capital markets in absorbing utility debt and
equity securities; and                                      

o    increased competition.                                           

Any of these factors, or a combination of these factors, could affect the 
supply of or demand for energy, such as electricity or natural gas, or water, or
the ability of the issuers to pay for such energy or water which could adversely
affect the profitability of the issuers of the Securities and the performance of
the Trust.                                                                      

Utility companies are subject to extensive regulation at the federal and  
state levels in the United States. At the federal level, the Federal Energy     
Regulatory Commission (the "FERC"), the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC"),   
the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), and the Nuclear Regulatory  
Commission (the "NRC") have authority to oversee electric and combination       
electric and gas utilities. The value of utility company stocks may decline     
because governmental regulation affecting the utilities industry can change.    
This regulation may prevent or delay the utility company from passing along cost
increases to its customers, which could hinder the utility company's ability to 
meet its obligations to its suppliers and could lead to the taking of measures, 
including the acceleration of obligations or the institution of involuntary     
bankruptcy proceedings, by its creditors against such utility company. In 2001, 
two California public utilities were threatened with such action by their       
wholesale suppliers, and one of these utilities filed a voluntary petition for  
relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code of 1978. Furthermore,       
regulatory authorities, which may be subject to political and other pressures,  
may not grant future rate increases, or may impose accounting or operational    
policies, any of which could adversely affect a company's profitability and its 
stock price. In late 2001, a trader and marketer of utilities, commodities and  
financial and risk management services filed a voluntary petition for relief    
under Chapter 11 as a result of being negatively impacted by several of these   
and other factors. Mergers in the utility industry may require approval from    
several federal and state regulatory agencies, including FERC, the FTC, and the 
SEC. These regulatory authorities could, as a matter of policy, reverse the     
trend toward deregulation and make consolidation more difficult, or cause delay 
in the merger process, any of which could cause the prices of these stocks to   
fall.                                                                           

   Real Estate Investment Trusts. Many factors can have an adverse impact on the
performance of a particular REIT, including its cash available for distribution,
the credit quality of a particular REIT or the real estate industry generally.  
The success of REITs depends on various factors, including occupancy and rent   
levels, appreciation of the underlying property and the ability to raise rents  
on those properties. Economic recession, overbuilding, tax law changes, higher  
interest rates or excessive speculation can all negatively impact REITs and     
their future earnings and share prices.                                         

Risks associated with the direct ownership of real estate include, among  
other factors,                                                                  

o    general U.S. and global as well as local economic conditions;    

o    decline in real estate values;                                   

o    the financial health of tenants;                                 

o    overbuilding and increased competition for tenants;              

o    oversupply of properties for sale;                               

o    changing demographics;                                           

 o    changes in interest rates, tax rates and other operating expenses;

o    changes in government regulations;                               

o    changes in zoning laws;                                          

   o    the ability of the owner to provide adequate management, maintenance
and insurance;                                              

 o    faulty construction and the ongoing need for capital improvements;

o    the cost of complying with the Americans with Disabilities Act;  

    o    regulatory and judicial requirements, including relating to liability
for environmental hazards;                                  

o    natural or man-made disasters;                                   

o    changes in the perception of prospective tenants of the safety,  
convenience and attractiveness of the properties;           

o    changes in neighborhood values and buyer demand; and             

o    the unavailability of construction financing or mortgage loans at
rates acceptable to developers.                             

   Variations in rental income and space availability and vacancy rates in terms
of supply and demand are additional factors affecting real estate generally and 
REITs in particular. Properties owned by a REIT may not be adequately insured   
against certain losses and may be subject to significant environmental          
liabilities, including remediation costs.                                       

   You should also be aware that REITs may not be diversified and are subject to
the risks of financing projects. The real estate industry may be cyclical, and, 
if the Trust acquires REIT Securities at or near the top of the cycle, there is 
increased risk of a decline in value of the REIT Securities and therefore the   
value of the Units. REITs are also subject to defaults by borrowers and the     
market's perception of the REIT industry generally.                             

   Because of their structure, and the legal requirement that they distribute at
least 90% of their taxable income to shareholders annually, REITs require       
frequent amounts of new funding, through both borrowing money and issuing stock.
Thus, REITs historically have frequently issued substantial amounts of new      
equity shares (or equivalents) to purchase or build new properties. This may    
have adversely affected REIT equity share market prices. Both existing and new  
share issuances may have an adverse effect on these prices in the future,       
especially when REITs continue to issue stock when real estate prices are       
relatively high and stock prices are relatively low.                            

Consumer Staples. The Trust may invest significantly in companies that    
manufacture or sell various consumer staples. General risks of these companies  
include the general state of the economy, intense competition and consumer      
spending trends. A decline in the economy or other change which results in a    
reduction of consumers' disposable income can negatively impact spending habits.
Furthermore, the failure to continue developing new products, lack of or reduced
market acceptance of new and existing products, increased raw materials costs,  
an inability to raise prices, increased or changed regulation and product       
liability claims or product recalls could also adversely impact the performance 
and stock prices of the issuers of Securities in this industry group.           

Industrials. The Trust may invest significantly in industrials companies. 
General risks of industrials companies include the general state of the economy,
intense competition, consolidation, domestic and international politics, excess 
capacity and consumer spending trends. Capital goods companies may also be      
significantly affected by overall capital spending levels, economic cycles,     
technical obsolescence, delays in modernization, limitations on supply of key   
materials, labor relations, government regulations, government contracts and    
e-commerce initiatives. Furthermore, certain companies involved in the industry 
have also faced scrutiny for alleged accounting irregularities that may have led
to the overstatement of their financial results, and other companies in the     
industry may face similar scrutiny.                                             

  Industrials companies may also be affected by factors more specific to their
individual industries. Industrial machinery manufacturers may be subject to     
declines in commercial and consumer demand and the need for modernization.      
Aerospace and defense companies may be influenced by decreased demand for new   
equipment, aircraft order cancellations, disputes over or ability to obtain or  
retain government contracts, or changes in government budget priorities, changes
in aircraft-leasing contracts and cutbacks in profitable business travel. The   
number of housing starts, levels of public and non-residential construction     
including weakening demand for new office and retail space, and overall         
construction spending may adversely affect construction materials and equipment 
manufacturers.                                                                  

Health Care Issuers. The Trust may invest significantly in health care    
companies. These issuers include companies involved in advanced medical devices 
and instruments, drugs and biotec hnology, managed care, hospital               
management/health services and medical supplies. These companies face           
substantial government regulation and approval procedures. Congress and the     
President have proposed, and in some cases approved, a variety of legislative   
changes concerning health care issuers from time to time, including, but not    
limited to, cost and prescription drug price controls and more rigorous approval
processes for new pharmaceuticals and devices. Additional government regulation,
or any change in existing regulation, can have a significantly unfavorable      
effect on the price and availability of products and services.                  

Drug and medical products companies also face the risk of increasing      
competition from new products or services, generic drug sales, termination of   
patent protection for drug or medical supply products and the risk that a       
product will never come to market. The research and development costs of        
bringing a new drug or medical product to market are substantial. This process  
involves lengthy government review with no guarantee of approval. These         
companies may have losses and may not offer proposed products for several years,
if at all. The failure to gain approval for a new drug or product can have a    
substantial negative impact on a company and its stock.                         

Energy Issuers. The Trust may invest significantly in energy companies.   
Energy companies face risks related to political conditions in oil producing    
regions (such as the Middle East), the actions of the Organization of Petroleum 
Exporting Countries (OPEC), the price and worldwide supply of oil and natural   
gas, the price and availability of alternative fuels, the ability to find and   
acquire oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable, operating       
hazards, government regulation and the level of consumer demand. Political      
conditions of some oil producing regions have been unstable in the past.        
Political instability or war in these regions could have a negative impact on   
your investment. Oil and natural gas prices can be extremely volatile. OPEC     
controls a substantial portion of world oil production. OPEC may take actions to
increase or suppress the price or availability of oil. Various domestic and     
foreign government authorities and international cartels also impact these      
prices. Any substantial decline in these prices could have an adverse effect on 
energy companies. Energy companies depend on their ability to find and acquire  
additional energy reserves. The exploration and recovery process involves       
significant operating hazards and can be very costly. An energy company has no  
assurance that it will find reserves or that any reserves found will be         
economically recoverable. The industry also faces substantial government        
regulation, including environmental regulation. These regulations have increased
costs and limited production and usage of certain fuels. Furthermore, certain   
companies involved in the industry have also faced scrutiny for alleged         
accounting irregularities that may have led to the overstatement of their       
financial results, and other companies in the industry may face similar         
scrutiny.                                                                       

Technology Companies. Technology companies face risks related to rapidly  
changing technology, rapid product obsolescence, cyclical market patterns,      
evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions. An          
unexpected change in technology can have a significant negative impact on a     
technology company. The failure of a technology company to introduce new        
products or technologies or keep pace with rapidly changing technology, can have
a negative impact on the company's results. Technology stocks tend to experience
substantial price volatility and speculative trading. Announcements about new   
products, technologies, operating results or marketing alliances can cause stock
prices to fluctuate dramatically. At times, however, extreme price and volume   
fluctuations may occur in the Securities of companies in this industry group    
that are unrelated to the operating performance of the company.                 

 The market for certain products may have only recently begun to develop, is
rapidly evolving or is characterized by an increase in suppliers. Key components
of some technology products are available only from limited sources. This can   
impact the cost of and ability to acquire these components. Some technology     
companies service highly concentrated customer bases of only a limited number of
large companies. Any failure to meet the standards of these customers could     
result in a significant loss or reduction in sales. Many products and           
technologies are incorporated into other products. As a result, some companies  
are sometimes highly dependent on the performance of other technology companies.
We cannot guarantee that these customers will continue to place additional      
orders or will place orders in similar quantities as in the past.               

The life cycle of a new technology product or service tends to be short,  
resulting in volatile sales, earnings and stock prices for many technology      
companies. Additionally, with the rapid evolution of technologies, competitive  
advantages tend to be short lived and product pricing usually falls.            
Historically, many of the benefits from new technologies have gone to the       
consumer, as their creators have been unable to retain differentiation or       
pricing power. Some of the large technology companies have been involved in     
antitrust litigation and may continue to be in the future. A slowdown in        
corporate or consumer spending on technology will likely hurt technology company
revenues. Technology companies rely on international sales for a meaningful part
of their revenues. Any economic slowdown could hurt revenues.                   

   Consumer Cyclicals. The success of companies in the consumer cyclicals sector
depends heavily on consumer spending and disposable household income and is     
subject to severe competition. Therefore, the success of consumer cyclicals     
companies is tied closely to the performance of the domestic and international  
economy, interest rates, competition and consumer confidence. A slowdown in the 
economy would likely hurt the consumer cyclicals industry. The success of       
companies in the consumer cyclicals segment is also strongly affected by changes
in demographics and consumer tastes.                                            

Consumer Products. The Trust may invest significantly in companies that   
manufacture or sell various consumer products. General risks of these companies 
include the general state of the economy, intense competition and consumer      
spending trends. A decline in the economy which results in a reduction of       
consumers' disposable income can negatively impact spending habits. Furthermore,
the failure to continue developing new products, lack of or reduced market      
acceptance of new and existing products, increased raw materials costs, an      
inability to raise prices, increased or changed regulation and product liability
claims or product recalls could also adversely impact the performance and stock 
prices of the issuers of Securities in this industry group.                     

Telecommunications Companies. The Trust invests significantly in          
telecommunications companies. These companies are subject to substantial        
governmental regulation. For example, the United States government and state    
governments regulate permitted rates of return and the kinds of services that a 
company may offer. This industry has experienced substantial deregulation in    
recent years. Deregulation may lead to fierce competition for market share and  
can have a negative impact on certain companies. Recent federal legislation     
governing the United States telecommunications industry remains subject to      
judicial review and additional interpretation, which may adversely affect the   
companies whose securities are held by the Trust. Competitive pressures are     
intense and telecommunications stocks can experience rapid volatility. Certain  
telecommunications products may become outdated very rapidly. A company's       
performance can be hurt if the company fails to keep pace with technological    
advances.                                                                       

Several recent high-profile bankruptcies of large telecommunications      
companies have illustrated the potentially unstable condition of                
telecommunications companies. High debt loads that were accumulated during the  
industry growth spurt of the 1990s are catching up to the industry, causing debt
and stock prices to trade at distressed levels for many telecommunications      
companies and increasing the cost of capital for needed additional investment.  
At the same time, demand for some telecommunications services has fallen        
sharply, as several key markets have become oversaturated, some local customers 
have switched to substitute providers and technologies, and corporate profits   
and the economy generally remain weak. To meet increasing competition, companies
may have to commit substantial capital, particularly in the formulation of new  
products and services using new technologies. As a result, many companies have  
been compelled to cut costs by reducing their workforce, outsourcing,           
consolidating and/or closing existing facilities and divesting low selling      
product lines. Furthermore, certain companies involved in the industry have also
faced scrutiny for alleged accounting irregularities that may have led to the   
overstatement of their financial results, and other companies in the industry   
may face similar scrutiny. Due to these and other factors, the risk level of    
owning the securities of telecommunications companies has increased             
substantially and may continue to rise.                                         

Certain smaller companies in the portfolio may involve greater risk than  
larger, established issuers. Smaller companies may have limited product lines,  
markets or financial resources. Their securities may trade in lower volumes than
larger companies. As a result, the prices of these securities may fluctuate more
than the prices of other issuers.                                               

No FDIC Guarantee. An investment in the Trust is not a deposit of any bank
and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or
any other government agency.                                                    

PUBLIC OFFERING 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

General. Units are offered at the Public Offering Price which includes the
underlying value of the Securities, the sales charge, and cash, if any, in the  
Income and Capital Accounts. The maximum sales charge assessed to each          
Unitholder is set forth under "Summary of Essential Financial Information" in   
Part One. The secondary market sales charge will reduce annually by 0.5% to a   
minimum of 2.30% as set forth under "Summary of Essential Financial Information"
in Part One. The actual sales charge that may be paid by an investor may differ 
slightly from the sales charges shown herein due to rounding that occurs in the 
calculation of the Public Offering Price and in the number of Units purchased.  

   Employees, officers and directors (including their spouses and children under
21 living in the same household, and trustees, custodians or fiduciaries for the
benefit of such persons) of Van Kampen Funds Inc. and its affiliates, the       
Underwriter, and dealers and their affiliates may purchase Units at the Public  
Offering Price less the applicable dealer concession.                           

The minimum purchase is 200 Units but may vary by selling firm.           

Unit Price. The Public Offering Price of Units will vary from the amounts 
stated under "Summary of Essential Financial Information" in Prospectus Part One
in accordance with fluctuations in the prices of the underlying Securities in   
the Trust. The initial price of the Securities was determined by the Trustee.   
The Trustee will generally determine the value of the Securities as of the      
Evaluation Time on each business day and will adjust the Public Offering Price  
of Units accordingly. The Evaluation Time is the close of the New York Stock    
Exchange on each business day. The term "business day", as used herein and under
"Rights of Unitholders--Redemption of Units", excludes Saturdays, Sundays and   
holidays observed by the New York Stock Exchange. The Public Offering Price per 
Unit will be effective for all orders received prior to the Evaluation Time on  
each business day. Orders received by the Sponsor prior to the Evaluation Time  
and orders received by authorized financial professionals prior to the          
Evaluation Time that are properly transmitted to the Sponsor by the time        
designated by the Sponsor, are priced based on the date of receipt. Orders      
received by the Sponsor after the Evaluation Time, and orders received by       
authorized financial professionals after the Evaluation Time or orders received 
by such persons that are not transmitted to the Sponsor until after the time    
designated by the Sponsor, are priced based on the date of the next determined  
Public Offering Price per Unit provided they are received timely by the Sponsor 
on such date. It is the responsibility of authorized financial professionals to 
transmit orders received by them to the Sponsor so they will be received in a   
timely manner.                                                                  

The value of portfolio securities is based on the securities' market price
when available. When a market price is not readily available, including         
circumstances under which the Trustee determines that a security's market price 
is not accurate, a portfolio security is valued at its fair value, as determined
under procedures established by the Trustee or an independent pricing service   
used by the Trustee. In these cases, the Trust's net asset value will reflect   
certain portfolio securities' fair value rather than their market price. With   
respect to securities that are primarily listed on foreign exchanges, the value 
of the portfolio securities may change on days when you will not be able to     
purchase or sell Units. The value of any foreign securities is based on the     
applicable currency exchange rate as of the Evaluation Time. The Sponsor will   
provide price dissemination and oversight services to the Trust.                

   Unit Distribution. Units will be distributed to the public by the Sponsor and
the Underwriter at the Public Offering Price.                                   

The Sponsor intends to qualify Units for sale in a number of states. The  
Underwriter will be allowed a concession or agency commission in connection with
the distribution of Units as described under "Sponsor and Underwriter
Compensation".                                                                  

 Except as provided in this section, any discount provided to investors will
be borne by the selling dealer or agent as indicated under "General" above.     
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in no case shall the total of  
any concessions, agency commissions and any additional compensation allowed or  
paid to any broker, dealer or other distributor of Units with respect to any    
individual transaction exceed the total sales charge applicable to such         
transaction. The Sponsor reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any 
order for the purchase of Units and to change the amount of the concession or   
agency commission to dealers and others from time to time.                      

We may provide, at our own expense and out of our own profits, additional 
compensation and benefits to broker-dealers who sell Units of the Trusts and our
other products. This compensation is intended to result in additional sales of  
our products and/or compensate broker-dealers and financial advisors for past   
sales. We may make these payments for marketing, promotional or related         
expenses, including, but not limited to, expenses of entertaining retail        
customers and financial advisors, advertising, sponsorship of events or         
seminars, obtaining shelf space in broker-dealer firms and similar activities   
designed to promote the sale of the Trust and our other products. Fees may      
include payment for travel expenses, including lodging, incurred in connection  
with trips taken by invited registered representatives for meetings or seminars 
of a business nature. These arrangements will not change the price you pay for  
your Units.                                                                     

Sponsor and Underwriter Compensation. The Sponsor will receive a gross sales
commission equal to the total sales charge applicable to each transaction. The  
Underwriter will be allowed a concession or agency commission in connection with
the distribution of Units equal to 65% of the sales charge applicable to the    
transaction. Any sales charge discount provided to investors will be borne by   
the selling dealer or agent. In addition, the Sponsor will realize a profit or  
loss as a result of the difference between the price paid for the Securities by 
the Sponsor and the cost of the Securities to the Trust on the Initial Date of  
Deposit as well as on subsequent deposits. The Sponsor has not participated as  
sole underwriter or as manager or as a member of the underwriting syndicate or  
as an agent in a private placement for any of the Securities. The Underwriter   
may benefit from, or receive compensation in connection with, activities        
described under "Objectives and Securities Selection". The Sponsor may realize  
profit or loss as a result of the possible fluctuations in the market value of  
the Securities, since all proceeds received from purchasers of Units are        
retained by the Underwriter. In maintaining a secondary market, the Underwriter 
will realize profits or losses in the amount of any difference between the price
at which Units are purchased and the price at which Units are resold (which     
price includes the applicable sales charge) or from a redemption of repurchased 
Units at a price above or below the purchase price. Cash, if any, made available
to the Sponsor prior to the date of settlement for the purchase of Units may be 
used in the Sponsor's business and may be deemed to be a benefit to the Sponsor,
subject to the limitations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.              

The Sponsor, the Underwriter or an affiliate of either of them may have   
participated in a public offering of one or more of the Securities. The Sponsor,
the Underwriter or an affiliate of either of them or their employees may have a 
long or short position in these Securities or related securities. The Sponsor,  
the Underwriter or an affiliate of either of them may act as a specialist or    
market maker for these Securities. An officer, director or employee of the      
Sponsor, the Underwriter or an affiliate of either of them may be an officer or 
director for issuers of the Securities.                                         

Purchases and sales of Securities by the Trust may impact the value of the
Securities. This may especially be the case during the initial offering of      
Units, upon Trust termination and in the course of satisfying large Unit        
redemptions. Any publication of a list of Securities, or a list of anticipated  
Securities, to be included in the Trust may also cause increased buying activity
in certain Securities. Once this information becomes public, investors may      
purchase individual Securities appearing in such a publication and may do so    
during or prior to the initial offering of Units. It is possible that these     
investors could include investment advisory and brokerage firms of the Sponsor, 
the Underwriter or the affiliates of either of them or firms that are           
distributing Units. This activity may cause the Trust to purchase stocks at a   
higher price than those buyers who effect purchases prior to purchases by the   
Trust.                                                                          

  Market for Units. Although it is not obligated to do so, the Underwriter may
maintain a market for Units and purchase Units at the secondary market          
repurchase price, which is described under "Rights of Unitholders--Redemption of
Units". The Underwriter may discontinue purchases of Units or discontinue       
purchases at this price at any time. In the event that a secondary market is not
maintained, a Unitholder will be able to dispose of Units by tendering them to  
the Trustee for redemption at the Redemption Price. See "Rights of
Unitholders--Redemption of Units". Unitholders should contact their broker to   
determine the best price for Units in the secondary market. The Trustee will    
notify the Underwriter of any Units tendered for redemption. If the             
Underwriter's bid in the secondary market equals or exceeds the Redemption Price
per Unit, it may purchase the Units not later than the day on which Units would 
have been redeemed by the Trustee. The Underwriter may sell repurchased Units at
the secondary market Public Offering Price per Unit.                            

RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Units are available for purchase in connection with certain types of      
tax-sheltered retirement plans, including Individual Retirement Accounts for    
individuals, Simplified Employee Pension Plans for employees, qualified plans   
for self-employed individuals, and qualified corporate pension and profit       
sharing plans for employees. The purchase of Units may be limited by the plans' 
provisions and does not itself establish such plans.                            

RIGHTS OF UNITHOLDERS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Distributions. Dividends and any net proceeds from the sale of Securities 
received by the Trust will generally be distributed to Unitholders on each      
Distribution Date to Unitholders of record on the preceding Record Date. These  
dates appear under "Summary of Essential Financial Information" in Part One. A  
person becomes a Unitholder of record on the date of settlement (generally three
business days after Units are ordered). Unitholders may elect to receive        
distributions in cash or to have distributions reinvested into additional Units.

Dividends received by the Trust are credited to the Income Account of the 
Trust. Other receipts (e.g., capital gains, proceeds from the sale of           
Securities, etc.) are credited to the Capital Account. Proceeds received on the 
sale of any Securities, to the extent not used to meet redemptions of Units or  
to pay fees or expenses, will be distributed to Unitholders. Proceeds received  
from the disposition of any Securities after a Record Date and prior to the     
following Distribution Date will be held in the Capital Account and not         
distributed until the next Distribution Date. Any distribution to Unitholders   
consists of each Unitholder's pro rata share of the available cash in the Income
and Capital Accounts as of the related Record Date.                             

   Estimated Distributions. The estimated initial distribution and estimated net
annual distribution per Unit may be shown under "Summary of Essential Financial 
Information" in Prospectus Part One. The estimate of the income a Trust may     
receive is based on the most recent ordinary quarterly dividends declared by an 
issuer, the most recent interim and final dividends declared for certain foreign
issuers, or scheduled income payments (in all cases accounting for any          
applicable foreign withholding taxes). The actual net annual distributions are  
expected to decrease over time. Securities may also be sold to pay regular fees 
and expenses during a Trust's life. Dividend and income conventions for certain 
companies and/or certain countries differ from those typically used in the      
United States and in certain instances, dividends/income paid or declared over  
several years or other periods may be used to estimate annual distributions. The
actual net annual income distributions you receive will vary from the estimated 
amount due to changes in a Trust's fees and expenses, in actual income received 
by a Trust, currency fluctuations and with changes in a Trust such as the       
acquisition, call, maturity or sale of Securities. Due to these and various     
other factors, actual income received by a Trust will most likely differ from   
the most recent dividends or scheduled income payments.                         

Reinvestment Option. Unitholders may have distributions automatically     
reinvested in additional Units under the Automatic Reinvestment Option (to the  
extent Units may be lawfully offered for sale in the state in which the         
Unitholder resides). To participate in this reinvestment option, a Unitholder   
must file with the Trustee a written notice of election, together with any      
certificate representing Units and other documentation that the Trustee may then
require, at least five days prior to the related Record Date. A Unitholder's    
election will apply to all Units owned by the Unitholder and will remain in     
effect until changed by the Unitholder. If Units are unavailable for            
reinvestment, distributions will be paid in cash.                               

  In addition, under the Guaranteed Reinvestment Option Unithholders may elect
to have distributions automatically reinvested in certain Van Kampen mutual     
funds (the "Reinvestment Funds"). Each Reinvestment Fund has investment         
objectives which differ from those of the Trust. The prospectus relating to each
Reinvestment Fund describes its investment policies and how to begin            
reinvestment. A Unitholder may obtain a prospectus for the Reinvestment Funds   
from the Sponsor. Purchases of shares of a Reinvestment Fund will be made at a  
net asset value computed on the Distribution Date. Unitholders with an existing 
Guaranteed Reinvestment Option account (whereby a sales charge is imposed on    
distribution reinvestments) may transfer their existing account into a new      
account which allows purchases of Reinvestment Fund shares at net asset value.  

   A participant may elect to terminate his or her reinvestment plan and receive
future distributions in cash by notifying the Trustee in writing no later than  
five days before a Distribution Date. The Sponsor, each Reinvestment Fund, and  
its investment adviser shall have the right to suspend or terminate these       
reinvestment plans at any time.                                                 

Redemption of Units. A Unitholder may redeem all or a portion of his Units by
tender to the Trustee at Unit Investment Trust Division, 101 Barclay Street,    
20th Floor, New York, New York 10286. Certificates must be tendered to the      
Trustee, duly endorsed or accompanied by proper instruments of transfer with    
signature guaranteed (or by providing satisfactory indemnity in connection with 
lost, stolen or destroyed certificates) and by payment of applicable            
governmental charges, if any. No later than the seventh day following the       
tender, the Unitholder will be entitled to receive in cash an amount for each   
Unit equal to the Redemption Price per Unit next computed on the date of tender.
The "date of tender" is deemed to be the date on which Units are received by the
Trustee, except that with respect to Units received by the Trustee after the    
Evaluation Time or on a day which is not a Trust business day, the date of      
tender is deemed to be the next business day. Redemption requests received by   
authorized financial professionals prior to the Evaluation Time that are        
properly transmitted to the Trustee by the time designated by the Trustee, are  
priced based on the date of receipt. Redemption requests received by the Trustee
after the Evaluation Time, and redemption requests received by authorized       
financial professionals after the Evaluation Time or redemption requests        
received by such persons that are not transmitted to the Trustee until after the
time designated by the Trustee, are priced based on the date of the next        
determined redemption price provided they are received timely by the Trustee on 
such date. It is the responsibility of authorized financial professionals to    
transmit redemption requests received by them to the Trustee so they will be    
received in a timely manner. Certain broker-dealers or selling firms may charge 
an order handling fee for processing redemption requests. Units redeemed        
directly through the Trustee are not subject to such fees.                      

Unitholders tendering 2,500 or more Units (or $25,000) of the Trust for   
redemption may request an in-kind distribution of Securities equal to the       
Redemption Price per Unit on the date of tender. Unitholders may not request an 
in-kind distribution during the five business days preceding the Trust's        
termination. An in-kind distribution will be made by the Trustee through the    
distribution of each of the Securities in book-entry form to the account of the 
Unitholder's broker-dealer at Depository Trust Company. Amounts representing    
fractional shares will be distributed in cash. The Trustee may adjust the number
of shares of any Security included in a Unitholder's in-kind distribution to    
facilitate the distribution of whole shares.                                    

The Trustee may sell Securities to satisfy Unit redemptions. To the extent
that Securities are redeemed in-kind or sold, the size of the Trust will be, and
the diversity of the Trust may be, reduced. Sales may be required at a time when
Securities would not otherwise be sold and may result in lower prices than might
otherwise be realized. The price received upon redemption may be more or less   
than the amount paid by the Unitholder, depending on the value of the Securities
at the time of redemption. Special federal income tax consequences will result  
if a Unitholder requests an in-kind distribution. See "Taxation".               

 The Redemption Price per Unit and the secondary market repurchase price per
Unit are equal to the pro rata share of each Unit in the Trust, determined on   
the basis of (i) the cash on hand in the Trust, (ii) the value of the Securities
in the Trust and (iii) dividends receivable on the Securities in the Trust      
trading ex-dividend as of the date of computation, less (a) amounts representing
taxes or other governmental charges payable out of the Trust and (b) the accrued
expenses of the Trust. For these purposes, the Evaluator or Trustee will        
determine the value of the Securities in the manner set forth under "Public
Offering--Unit Price".                                                          

   The right of redemption may be suspended and payment postponed for any period
during which the New York Stock Exchange is closed, other than for customary    
weekend and holiday closings, or any period during which the SEC determines that
trading on that Exchange is restricted or an emergency exists, as a result of   
which disposal or evaluation of the Securities is not reasonably practicable, or
for other periods as the SEC may permit.                                        

   Units. Ownership of Units is evidenced in book-entry form unless a Unitholder
makes a written request to the Trustee that ownership be in certificate form.   
Units are transferable by making a written request to the Trustee and, in the   
case of Units in certificate form, by presentation of the certificate to the    
Trustee properly endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument or instruments 
of transfer. A Unitholder must sign the written request, and certificate or     
transfer instrument, exactly as his name appears on the records of the Trustee  
and on the face of any certificate with the signature guaranteed by a           
participant in the Securities Transfer Agents Medallion Program ("STAMP") or a  
signature guarantee program accepted by the Trustee. In certain instances the   
Trustee may require additional documents, including but not limited to, trust   
instruments, certificates of death, appointments as executor or administrator or
certificates of corporate authority. Fractional certificates will not be issued.
The Trustee may require a Unitholder to pay a reasonable fee for each           
certificate reissued or transferred and to pay any governmental charge that may 
be imposed in connection with each transfer or interchange. Destroyed, stolen,  
mutilated or lost certificates will be replaced upon delivery to the Trustee of 
satisfactory indemnity, evidence of ownership and payment of expenses incurred. 
Mutilated certificates must be surrendered to the Trustee for replacement.      

   Reports Provided. Unitholders will receive a statement of dividends and other
amounts received by the Trust for each distribution. Within a reasonable time   
after the end of each year, each person who was a Unitholder during that year   
will receive a statement describing dividends and capital received, actual Trust
distributions, Trust expenses, a list of the Securities and other Trust         
information. Unitholders may obtain evaluations of the Securities upon request  
to the Trustee. If you have questions regarding your account or your Trust,     
please contact your financial advisor or the Trustee. The Sponsor does not have 
access to individual account information.                                       

TRUST ADMINISTRATION 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Portfolio Administration. The Trust is not an actively managed fund and,  
except as provided in the Trust Agreement, Securities generally will not be sold
or replaced after the initial deposit. The Sponsor may, however, direct that    
Securities be sold in certain limited circumstances to protect the Trust based  
on advice from the Supervisor. These situations may include events such as the  
issuer having defaulted on payment of any of its outstanding obligations or the 
price of a Security having declined to such an extent, or other credit factors  
exist, so that in the opinion of the Supervisor retention of the Security would 
be detrimental to the Trust. If a public tender offer has been made for a       
Security or a merger or acquisition has been announced affecting a Security, the
Trustee may either sell the Security or accept a tender offer for cash if the   
Supervisor determines that the sale or tender is in the best interest of        
Unitholders. The Trustee will distribute any cash proceeds to Unitholders. In   
addition, the Trustee may sell Securities to redeem Units or pay Trust expenses.
The Trustee must reject any offer for securities or property other than cash in 
exchange for the Securities. If securities or property are nonetheless acquired 
by the Trust, the Sponsor may direct the Trustee to sell the securities or      
property and distribute the proceeds to Unitholders or to accept the securities 
or property for deposit in the Trust. Should any contract for the purchase of   
any of the Securities fail, the Sponsor will (unless substantially all of the   
moneys held in the Trust to cover the purchase are reinvested in substitute     
Securities in accordance with the Trust Agreement) refund the cash and sales    
charge attributable to the failed contract to all Unitholders on or before the  
next Distribution Date.                                                         

When the Trust sells Securities, the composition and diversity of the     
Securities in the Trust may be altered. In order to obtain the best price for   
the Trust, it may be necessary for the Supervisor to specify minimum amounts    
(generally 100 shares) in which blocks of Securities are to be sold. In         
effecting purchases and sales of the Trust's portfolio securities, the Sponsor  
may direct that orders be placed with and brokerage commissions be paid to      
brokers, including brokers which may be affiliated with the Trust, the Sponsor, 
the Underwriter or dealers participating in the offering of Units. In addition, 
in selecting among firms to handle a particular transaction, the Sponsor may    
take into account whether the firm has sold or is selling units of unit         
investment trusts which it sponsors.                                            

Pursuant to an exemptive order, when each Trust terminates, it may be     
permitted to sell Securities to a new trust series if those Securities meet the 
investment strategy of the new trust. The exemption may enable each Trust to    
eliminate commission costs on these transactions. The price for those securities
will be the closing sale price on the sale date on the exchange where the       
Securities are principally traded, as certified by the Sponsor.                 

 Amendment of the Trust Agreement. The Trustee and the Sponsor may amend the
Trust Agreement without the consent of Unitholders to correct any provision     
which may be defective or to make other provisions that will not adversely      
affect Unitholders (as determined in good faith by the Sponsor and the Trustee).
The Trust Agreement may not be amended to increase the number of Units or permit
acquisition of securities in addition to or substitution for the Securities     
(except as provided in the Trust Agreement). The Trustee will notify Unitholders
of any amendment.                                                               

 Termination. Each Trust will terminate on the Mandatory Termination Date or
upon the sale or other disposition of the last Security held in the Trust. A    
Trust may be terminated at any time with consent of Unitholders representing    
two-thirds of the outstanding Units or by the Trustee when the value of the     
Trust is less than $500,000 ($3,000,000 if the value of the Trust has exceeded  
$15,000,000) (the "Minimum Termination Value"). Unitholders will be notified of 
any termination. The Trustee may begin to sell Securities in connection with a  
Trust termination nine business days before, and no later than, the Mandatory   
Termination Date. Approximately thirty days before this date, the Trustee will  
notify Unitholders of the termination and provide a form enabling qualified     
Unitholders to elect an in kind distribution of Securities. You are qualified to
elect an in kind distribution of Securities at termination if you own at least  
1,000 Units of your Trust on the termination date (or such higher amount as may 
be required by your broker-dealer or selling agent). Any in kind distribution of
Securities at termination will be made in the manner and subject to the         
restrictions described under "Rights of Unitholders--Redemption of Units". In   
order to receive an in kind distribution of Securities at termination, this form
or other notice acceptable to the Trustee must be received by the Trustee at    
least five business days prior to the Mandatory Termination Date. Unitholders   
will receive a final cash distribution within a reasonable time after the       
Mandatory Termination Date. All distributions will be net of Trust expenses and 
costs. Unitholders will receive a final distribution statement following        
termination. The Information Supplement contains further information regarding  
termination of the Trust. See "Additional Information".                         

 Limitations on Liabilities. The Sponsor, Underwriter, Supervisor Evaluator,
if any, and Trustee are under no liability for taking any action or for         
refraining from taking any action in good faith pursuant to the Trust Agreement,
or for errors in judgment, but shall be liable only for their own willful       
misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence (negligence in the case of the       
Trustee) in the performance of their duties or by reason of their reckless      
disregard of their obligations and duties hereunder. The Trustee is not liable  
for depreciation or loss incurred by reason of the sale by the Trustee of any of
the Securities. In the event of the failure of the Sponsor to act under the     
Trust Agreement, the Trustee may act thereunder and is not liable for any action
taken by it in good faith under the Trust Agreement. The Trustee is not liable  
for any taxes or other governmental charges imposed on the Securities, on it as 
Trustee under the Trust Agreement or on the Trust, which the Trustee may be     
required to pay under any present or future law of the United States of America 
or of any other taxing authority having jurisdiction. In addition, the Trust    
Agreement contains other customary provisions limiting the liability of the     
Trustee. The Sponsor, Underwriter, and Supervisor may rely on any evaluation    
furnished by the Evaluator, if any, or the Trustee and have no responsibility   
for the accuracy thereof. Determinations by the Trustee shall be made in good   
faith upon the basis of the best information available to it.

stockholders' equity of Van Kampen Funds Inc. was $257,937,650.                 

 Van Kampen Funds Inc. and the Trust have adopted a code of ethics requiring
Van Kampen's employees who have access to information on Trust transactions to  
report personal securities transactions. This code is intended to avoid         
potential conflicts of interest and to prevent fraud, deception or misconduct   
with respect to the Trust. The Information Supplement contains additional       
information about the Sponsor.                                                  

If the Sponsor shall fail to perform any of its duties under the Trust    
Agreement or become incapable of acting or shall become bankrupt or its affairs 
are taken over by public authorities, then the Trustee may (i) appoint a        
successor Sponsor at rates of compensation deemed by the Trustee to be          
reasonable and not exceeding amounts prescribed by the Securities and Exchange  
Commission, (ii) terminate the Trust Agreement and liquidate the Trust as       
provided therein or (iii) continue to act as Trustee without terminating the    
Trust Agreement.                                                                

Underwriter. Edward D. Jones & Co., L.P., a Missouri limited partnership, is
the Underwriter for the Units. The Underwriter is a member of the National      
Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. and has its principal office at 12555   
Manchester Road, St. Louis, Missouri, 63131, (314) 515-2000.                    

The Underwriter, in its day to day activities, may act as a broker, agent,
principal, specialist or market maker in connection with the purchase and sale  
of equity securities, including the Securities. The Underwriter may also provide
investment banking services to, and may expect to receive or intend to seek     
compensation for underwriting services in the next three months from, some of   
the issuers of the Securities. Principals of the Underwriter may serve as a     
member of the board of directors of one or more issuers of the Securities or of 
affiliates of such issuers. Furthermore, the Underwriter may issue reports and  
make recommendations on the Securities. For any of these brokerage, specialist, 
market-making or investment banking activities, the Underwriter may receive     
additional compensation. The Underwriter may also receive compensation based on 
commissions generated by sales of Units in addition to its concession or agency 
commission. See "Public Offering--Sponsor and Underwriter Compensation".        

   Trustee. The Trustee is The Bank of New York, a trust company organized under
the laws of the State of New York. The Bank of New York has its principal unit  
investment trust division offices at 2 Hanson Place, 12th Floor, Brooklyn, New
York 11217, (800) 221-7668. If you have questions regarding your account or your
Trust, please contact the Trustee at its principal unit investment trust        
division offices or your financial advisor. The Sponsor does not have access to 
individual account information. The Bank of New York is subject to supervision  
and examination by the Superintendent of Banks of the State of New York and the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and its deposits are insured  
by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to the extent permitted by law.    
Additional information regarding the Trustee is set forth in the Information    
Supplement, including the Trustee's qualifications and duties, its ability to   
resign, the effect of a merger involving the Trustee and the Sponsor's ability  
to remove and replace the Trustee. See "Additional Information".                

TAXATION 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   This section summarizes some of the main U.S. federal income tax consequences
of owning Units of a Trust. This section is current as of the date of this      
prospectus. Tax laws and interpretations change frequently, and these summaries 
do not describe all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers. For example, these
summaries generally do not describe your situation if you are a corporation, a  
non-U.S. person, a broker/dealer, or other investor with special circumstances. 
In addition, this section does not describe your state, local or foreign tax    
consequences.                                                                   

   This federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice and opinion of
counsel to the Sponsor. The Internal Revenue Service could disagree with any    
conclusions set forth in this section. In addition, our counsel was not asked to
review, and has not reached a conclusion with respect to the federal income tax 
treatment of the assets to be deposited in the Trust. This may not be sufficient
for you to use for the purpose of avoiding penalties under federal tax law.     

As with any investment, you should seek advice based on your individual   
circumstances from your own tax advisor.                                        

Assets of the Trust. The Trust is expected to hold one or more of the     
following: (i) shares of stock in corporations (the "Stocks") that are treated  
as equity for federal income tax purposes, and (ii) equity interests in real    
estate investment trusts (the "REIT Shares") that constitute interests in       
entities treated as real estate investment trusts for federal income tax        
purposes.                                                                       

 It is possible that the Trust will also hold other assets, including assets
that are treated differently for federal income tax purposes from those         
described above, in which case you will have federal income tax consequences    
different from or in addition to those described in this section. All of the    
assets held by the Trust constitute the "Trust Assets". Neither our counsel nor 
we have analyzed the proper federal income tax treatment of the Trust Assets and
thus neither our counsel nor we have reached a conclusion regarding the federal 
income tax treatment of the Trust Assets.                                       

Trust Status. If the Trust is at all times operated in accordance with the
documents establishing the Trust and certain requirements of federal income tax 
law are met, the Trust will not be taxed as a corporation for federal income tax
purposes. As a Unit owner, you will be treated as the owner of a pro rata       
portion of each of the Trust Assets, and as such you will be considered to have 
received a pro rata share of income (e.g., dividends and capital gains, if any) 
from each Trust Asset when such income would be considered to be received by you
if you directly owned the Trust Assets. This is true even if you elect to have  
your distributions reinvested into additional Units. In addition, the income    
from Trust Assets that you must take into account for federal income tax        
purposes is not reduced by amounts used to pay sales charges or Trust expenses. 

   Your Tax Basis and Income or Loss Upon Disposition. If your Trust disposes of
Trust Assets, you will generally recognize gain or loss. If you dispose of your 
Units or redeem your Units for cash, you will also generally recognize gain or  
loss. To determine the amount of this gain or loss, you must subtract your tax  
basis in the related Trust Assets from your share of the total amount received  
in the transaction. You can generally determine your initial tax basis in each  
Trust Asset by apportioning the cost of your Units, including sales charges,    
among the Trust Assets ratably according to their values on the date you acquire
your Units. In certain circumstances, however, you may have to adjust your tax  
basis after you acquire your Units (for example, in the case of certain         
dividends that exceed a corporation's accumulated earnings and profits, or in   
the case of certain distributions with respect to REIT Shares that represent a  
return of capital, as discussed below).                                         

If you are an individual, the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net   
capital gain is generally 15% (generally 5% for certain taxpayers in the 10% and
15% tax brackets). These capital gains rates are generally effective for taxable
years beginning before January 1, 2009. For later periods, if you are an        
individual, the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net capital gain is       
generally 20% (10% for certain taxpayers in the 10% and 15% tax brackets). The  
20% rate is reduced to 18% and the 10% rate is reduced to 8% for long-term      
capital gains from most property acquired after December 31, 2000 with a holding
period of more than five years.                                                 

Net capital gain equals net long-term capital gain minus net short-term   
capital loss for the taxable year. Capital gain or loss is long-term if the     
holding period for the asset is more than one year and is short-term if the     
holding period for the asset is one year or less. You must exclude the date you 
purchase your Units to determine your holding period. The tax rates for capital 
gains realized from assets held for one year or less are generally the same as  
for ordinary income. The Internal Revenue Code, however, treats certain capital 
gains as ordinary income in special situations. Capital gain received from      
assets held for more than one year that is considered "unrecaptured section 1250
gain" (which may be the case, for example, with some capital gains attributable 
to the REIT Shares) is taxed at a maximum stated tax rate of 25%. In the case of
capital gains dividends, the determination of which portion of the capital gains
dividend, if any, is subject to the 25% tax rate, will be made based on rules   
prescribed by the United States Treasury.                                       

  Dividends From Stocks. Certain dividends received with respect to the Stocks
may qualify to be taxed at the same rates that apply to net capital gain (as    
discussed above), provided certain holding period requirements are satisfied.   
These special rules relating to the taxation of dividends at capital gains rates
generally apply to taxable years beginning before January 1, 2009.              

Dividends From REIT Shares. Some dividends on the REIT Shares may be      
designated as "capital gain dividends," generally taxable to you as long-term   
capital gains. If you hold a Unit for six months or less or if your Trust holds 
a REIT Share for six months or less, any loss incurred by you related to the    
disposition of such REIT Share will be treated as a long-term capital loss to   
the extent of any long-term capital gain distributions received (or deemed to   
have been received) with respect to such REIT Share. Distributions of income or 
capital gains declared on the REIT Shares in October, November or December will 
be deemed to have been paid to you on December 31 of the year they are declared,
even when paid by the REIT during the following January. Other dividends on the 
REIT Shares will generally be taxable to you as ordinary income, although in    
limited circumstances, some of the ordinary income dividends from a REIT may    
also qualify to be taxed at the same rates that apply to net capital gains (as  
discussed above), provided certain holding period requirements are satisfied.   
These special rules relating to the taxation of ordinary income dividends from  
real estate investment trusts generally apply to taxable years beginning before 
January 1, 2009.                                                                

Dividends Received Deduction. A corporation that owns Units generally will
not be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to many        
dividends received by the Trust, because the dividends received deduction is not
available for dividends from most foreign corporations or from REITs.           

In-kind Distributions. Under certain circumstances as described in this   
prospectus, you may request an in-kind distribution of Trust Assets when you    
redeem your Units or at your Trust's termination. By electing to receive an     
in-kind distribution, you will receive Trust Assets, plus, possibly, cash. You  
will not recognize gain or loss if you only receive whole Trust Assets in       
exchange for the identical amount of your pro rata portion of the same Trust    
Assets held by your Trust. However, if you also receive cash in exchange for a  
Trust Asset or a fractional portion of a Trust Asset, you will generally        
recognize gain or loss based on the difference between the amount of cash you   
receive and your tax basis in such Trust Asset or fractional portion.           

Exchanges. If you elect to have your proceeds from your Trust rolled over 
into a future series of the Trust, it is considered a sale for federal income   
tax purposes and any gain on the sale will be treated as a capital gain, and any
loss will be treated as a capital loss. However, any loss you incur in          
connection with the exchange of your Units of your Trusts for units of the next 
series will generally be disallowed with respect to this deemed sale and        
subsequent deemed repurchase, to the extent the two trusts have substantially   
identical Trust Assets under the wash sale provisions of the Internal Revenue   
Code.                                                                           

Limitations on the Deductibility of Trust Expenses. Generally, for federal
income tax purposes, you must take into account your full pro rata share of your
Trust's income, even if some of that income is used to pay Trust expenses. You  
may deduct your pro rata share of each expense paid by your Trust to the same   
extent as if you directly paid the expense. You may be required to treat some or
all of the expenses of your Trust as miscellaneous itemized deductions.         
Individuals may only deduct certain miscellaneous itemized deductions to the    
extent they exceed 2% of adjusted gross income.                                 

Foreign Taxes. Distributions by your Trust that are treated as U.S. source
income (e.g., dividends received on Stocks of domestic corporations) will       
generally be subject to U.S. income taxation and withholding in the case of     
Units held by nonresident alien individuals, foreign corporations or other      
non-U.S. persons, subject to any applicable treaty. If you are a foreign        
investor (i.e., an investor other than a U.S. citizen or resident or a U.S.     
corporation, partnership, estate or trust), you may not be subject to U.S.      
federal income taxes, including withholding taxes, on some of the income from   
your Trust or on any gain from the sale or redemption of your Units, provided   
that certain conditions are met. You should consult your tax advisor with       
respect to the conditions you must meet in order to be exempt for U.S. tax      
purposes. You should also consult your tax advisor with respect to other U.S.   
tax withholding and reporting requirements.                                     

   Some distributions by your Trust may be subject to foreign withholding taxes.
Any income withheld will still be treated as income to you. Under the grantor   
trust rules, you are considered to have paid directly your share of any foreign 
taxes that are paid. Therefore, for U.S. tax purposes, you may be entitled to a 
foreign tax credit or deduction for those foreign taxes.                        

New York Tax Status. Based on the advice of Katten Muchin Rosenman, LLP,  
special counsel to the Trust for New York tax matters, under the existing income
tax laws of the State and City of New York, your Trust will not be taxed as a   
corporation, and the income of your Trust will pass through to the Unit holders 
in the same manner as for federal income tax purposes. You should consult your  
tax advisor regarding potential foreign, state or local taxation with respect to
your Units.                                                                     

TRUST OPERATING EXPENSES 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

General. The fees and expenses of the Trust will accrue on a daily basis. The
fees and expenses are generally paid out of the Capital Account of the Trust. It
is expected that Securities will be sold to pay these amounts, which will result
in capital gains or losses to Unitholders. See "Taxation". The Sponsor's,       
Evaluator's, Supervisor's and Trustee's fees may be increased without approval  
of the Unitholders by amounts not exceeding proportionate increases under the   
category "All Services Less Rent of Shelter" in the Consumer Price Index or, if 
this category is not published, in a comparable category.                       

Trustee's Fee. For its services the Trustee will receive the fee from the 
Trust set forth under "Summary of Essential Financial Information" in Part One. 
The Trustee benefits to the extent there are funds in the Capital and Income    
Accounts since these Accounts are non-interest bearing to Unitholders and the   
amounts earned by the Trustee are retained by the Trustee. Part of the Trustee's
compensation for its services to the Trust is expected to result from the use of
these funds.                                                                    

Compensation of Sponsor, Evaluator and Supervisor. The Sponsor and the    
Supervisor, which is an affiliate of the Sponsor, will receive the annual fee   
for providing bookkeeping and administrative services and portfolio supervisory 
services set forth under "Summary of Essential Financial Information" in Part   
One. These fees may exceed the actual costs of providing these services to the  
Trust but at no time will the total amount received for these services rendered 
to all Van Kampen unit investment trusts in any calendar year exceed the        
aggregate cost of providing these services in that year. The Evaluator will     
receive the annual fee for providing evaluation services set forth under        
"Summary of Essential Financial Information" in Part One.                       

Miscellaneous Expenses. The following additional charges are or may be    
incurred by the Trust: (a) normal expenses (including the cost of mailing       
reports to Unitholders) incurred in connection with the operation of the Trust, 
(b) fees of the Trustee for extraordinary services, (c) expenses of the Trustee 
(including legal and auditing expenses) and of counsel designated by the        
Sponsor, (d) various governmental charges, (e) expenses and costs of any action 
taken by the Trustee to protect the Trust and the rights and interests of       
Unitholders, (f) indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability or      
expenses incurred in the administration of the Trust without negligence, bad    
faith or wilful misconduct on its part, (g) foreign custodial and transaction   
fees, (h) costs associated with liquidating the securities held in the Trust,   
(i) any offering costs incurred after the end of the initial offering period and
(j) expenditures incurred in contacting Unitholders upon termination of the     
Trust. The Trust may pay the expenses of updating its registration statement    
each year.

RISK FACTORS 

  Price Volatility. Because the Trust invests in common stocks, you should
understand the risks of investing in common stocks before purchasing Units.     
These risks include the risk that the financial condition of the company or the 
general condition of the stock market may worsen and the value of the stocks    
(and therefore Units) will fall. Common stocks are especially susceptible to    
general stock market movements. The value of common stocks often rises or falls 
rapidly and unpredictably as market confidence and perceptions of companies     
change. These perceptions are based on factors including expectations regarding 
government economic policies, inflation, interest rates, economic expansion or  
contraction, political climates and economic or banking crises. The value of    
Units will fluctuate with the value of the stocks in the Trust and may be more  
or less than the price you originally paid for your Units. As with any          
investment, we cannot guarantee that the performance of the Trust will be       
positive over any period of time. Because the Trust is not actively managed, the
Trustee will not sell stocks in response to market fluctuations as is common in 
managed investments.                                                            

     Dividends. Common stocks represent ownership interests in a company and are
not obligations of the company. Accordingly, common stockholders have a right to
receive payments from the company that is subordinate to the rights of          
creditors, bondholders or preferred stockholders of the company. This means that
common stockholders have a right to receive dividends only if a company's board 
of directors declares a dividend and the company has provided for payment of all
of its creditors, bondholders and preferred stockholders. If a company issues   
additional debt securities or preferred stock, the owners of these securities   
will have a claim against the company's assets before common stockholders if the
company declares bankruptcy or liquidates its assets even though the common     
stock was issued first. As a result, the company may be less willing or able to 
declare or pay dividends on its common stock.                                   

   Financial Services. An investment in Units of the Trust should be made with
an understanding of the problems and risks inherent in the bank, insurance and  
financial services sector in general.                                           

Banks and their holding companies are especially subject to the adverse   
effects of economic recession, volatile interest rates, portfolio concentrations
in geographic markets and in commercial and residential real estate loans, and  
competition from new entrants in their fields of business. Banks are highly     
dependent on net interest margin. Bank profits have come under pressure as net  
interest margins have contracted. There is no certainty that such conditions    
will continue. Banks had received significant consumer mortgage fee income as a 
result of activity in mortgage and refinance markets. As initial home purchasing
and refinancing activity subsided as a result of increasing interest rates and  
other factors, this income diminished. Economic conditions in the real estate   
markets, which have been weak in the past, can have a substantial effect upon   
banks because they generally have a portion of their assets invested in loans   
secured by real estate. Banks and their holding companies are subject to        
extensive federal regulation and, when such institutions are state-chartered, to
state regulation as well. Such regulations impose strict capital requirements   
and limitations on the nature and extent of business activities that banks may  
pursue. Furthermore, bank regulators have a wide range of discretion in         
connection with their supervisory and enforcement authority and may             
substantially restrict the permissible activities of a particular institution if
deemed to pose significant risks to the soundness of such institution or the    
safety of the federal deposit insurance fund. Regulatory actions, such as       
increases in the minimum capital requirements applicable to banks and increases 
in deposit insurance premiums required to be paid by banks and thrifts to the   
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"), can negatively impact earnings  
and the ability of a company to pay dividends. Neither federal insurance of     
deposits nor governmental regulations, however, insures the solvency or         
profitability of banks or their holding companies, or insures against any risk  
of investment in the securities issued by such institutions.                    

The statutory requirements applicable to, and regulatory supervision of,  
banks and their holding companies have increased significantly and have         
undergone substantial change in recent years. To a great extent, these changes  
are embodied in the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act,
enacted in August 1989; the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement   
Act of 1991, and the regulations promulgated under these laws. The impact of    
these laws on the business, financial condition and prospects of the Securities 
in the Trust's portfolio cannot be predicted with certainty. The                
Gramm-Leach-Bliley financial services overhaul legislation allows banks,        
securities firms and insurance companies to form one-stop financial             
conglomerates marketing a wide range of financial service products to investors.
This legislation will likely result in increased merger activity and heightened 
competition among existing and new participants in the field. Legislation to    
liberalize interstate banking has been enacted in recent years. Under the       
legislation, banks are able to purchase or establish subsidiary banks in any    
state. Since mid-1997, banks have been allowed to turn existing banks into      
branches. Consolidation may continue. The Securities and Exchange Commission and
the Financial Accounting Standards Board require the expanded use of market     
value accounting by banks and have imposed rules requiring market accounting for
investment securities held in trading accounts or available for sale. Adoption  
of additional such rules may result in increased volatility in the reported     
health of the industry, and mandated regulatory intervention to correct such    
problems. Additional legislative and regulatory changes may be forthcoming. For 
example, the bank regulatory authorities have proposed substantial changes to   
the Community Reinvestment Act and fair lending laws, rules and regulations, and
there can be no certainty as to the effect, if any, that such changes would have
on the Securities in the Trust's portfolio. In addition, from time to time the  
deposit insurance system is reviewed by Congress and federal regulators, and    
proposed reforms of that system could, among other things, further restrict the 
ways in which deposited moneys can be used by banks or reduce the dollar amount 
or number of deposits insured for any depositor. Such reforms could reduce      
profitability, as investment opportunities available to bank institutions become
more limited and as consumers look for savings vehicles other than bank         
deposits. Banks face significant competition from other financial institutions  
such as mutual funds, credit unions, mortgage banking companies and insurance   
companies, and increased competition may result from legislative broadening of  
regional and national interstate banking powers. Among other benefits, such     
legislation allows banks and bank holding companies to acquire across previously
prohibited state lines and to consolidate their various bank subsidiaries into  
one unit. Neither the Sponsor nor the Underwriter makes any prediction as to    
what, if any, manner of bank regulatory actions might ultimately be adopted or  
what ultimate effect such actions might have on the Trust's portfolio.          

The Federal Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 generally prohibits a bank   
holding company from (1) acquiring, directly or indirectly, more than 5% of the 
outstanding shares of any class of voting securities of a bank or bank holding  
company, (2) acquiring control of a bank or another bank holding company, (3)   
acquiring all or substantially all the assets of a bank, or (4) merging or      
consolidating with another bank holding company, without first obtaining Federal
Reserve Board ("FRB") approval. In considering an application with respect to   
any such transaction, the FRB is required to consider a variety of factors,     
including the potential anti-competitive effects of the transaction, the        
financial condition and future prospects of the combining and resulting         
institutions, the managerial resources of the resulting institution, the        
convenience and needs of the communities the combined organization would serve, 
the record of performance of each combining organization under the Community    
Reinvestment Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and the prospective      
availability to the FRB of information appropriate to determine ongoing         
regulatory compliance with applicable banking laws. In addition, the federal    
Change In Bank Control Act and various state laws impose limitations on the     
ability of one or more individuals or other entities to acquire control of banks
or bank holding companies.                                                      

The FRB has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by 
bank holding companies. In the policy statement, the FRB expressed its view that
a bank holding company experiencing earnings weaknesses should not pay cash     
dividends which exceed its net income or which could only be funded in ways that
would weaken its financial health, such as by borrowing. The FRB also may impose
limitations on the payment of dividends as a condition to its approval of       
certain applications, including applications for approval of mergers and        
acquisitions. Neither the Sponsor nor the Underwriter makes any prediction as to
the effect, if any, such laws will have on the Securities or whether such       
approvals, if necessary, will be obtained.                                      

Companies engaged in investment management and brokerage activities are   
subject to the adverse effects of economic recession, volatile interest rates,  
and competition from new entrants in their fields of business. Adverse changes  
in the direction of the stock market, investor confidence, the financial health 
of customers, equity transaction volume, the level and direction of interest    
rates and the outlook of emerging markets could adversely affect the financial  
stability, as well as the stock prices, of these companies. Additionally,       
competitive pressures, including increased competition with new and existing    
competitors, the ongoing commoditization of traditional businesses and the need 
for increased capital expenditures on new technology could adversely impact the 
profit margins of companies in the investment management and brokerage          
industries. Companies involved in investment management and brokerage activities
are also subject to extensive regulation by government agencies and             
self-regulatory organizations, and changes in laws, regulations or rules, or in 
the interpretation of such laws, regulations and rules could adversely affect   
the stock prices of such companies.                                             

   Companies involved in the insurance, reinsurance and risk management industry
underwrite, sell or distribute property, casualty and business insurance. Many  
factors affect insurance, reinsurance and risk management company profits,      
including but not limited to interest rate movements, the imposition of premium 
rate caps, a misapprehension of the risks involved in given underwritings,      
competition and pressure to compete globally, weather catastrophes or other     
natural or man-made disasters and the effects of client mergers. Individual     
companies may be exposed to material risks including reserve inadequacy and the 
inability to collect from reinsurance carriers. Insurance companies are subject 
to extensive governmental regulation, including the imposition of maximum rate  
levels, which may not be adequate for some lines of business. Proposed or       
potential tax law changes may also adversely affect insurance companies' policy 
sales, tax obligations and profitability. In addition to the foregoing, profit  
margins of these companies continue to shrink due to the commoditization of     
traditional businesses, new competitors, capital expenditures on new technology 
and the pressure to compete globally.                                           

In addition to the normal risks of business, companies involved in the    
insurance and risk management industry are subject to significant risk factors, 
including those applicable to regulated insurance companies, such as:           

o    the inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing          
       property-liability loss reserves, and the fact that ultimate losses
         could materially exceed established loss reserves, which could have a
  material adverse effect on results of operations and financial
condition;                                                  

o    the fact that insurance companies have experienced, and can be   
          expected in the future to experience, catastrophic losses, which could
         have a material adverse impact on their financial conditions, results
of operations and cash flow;                                

o    the inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing          
   property-liability loss reserves due to changes in loss payment
patterns caused by new claim settlement practices;          

  o    the need for insurance companies and their subsidiaries to maintain
        appropriate levels of statutory capital and surplus, particularly in
  light of continuing scrutiny by rating organizations and state
         insurance regulatory authorities, and in order to maintain acceptable
financial strength or claims-paying ability ratings;        

    o    the extensive regulation and supervision to which insurance companies
are subject, and various regulatory and other legal actions;

    o    the adverse impact that increases in interest rates could have on the
   value of an insurance company's investment portfolio and on the
attractiveness of certain of its products; and              

     o    the uncertainty involved in estimating the availability of reinsurance
and the collectability of reinsurance recoverables.         

   The state insurance regulatory framework has, during recent years, come under
increased federal scrutiny, and certain state legislatures have considered or   
enacted laws that alter and, in many cases, increase state authority to regulate
insurance companies and insurance holding company systems. Further, the National
Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") and state insurance regulators  
are re-examining existing laws and regulations, specifically focusing on        
insurance companies, interpretations of existing laws and the development of new
laws. In addition, Congress and certain federal agencies have investigated the  
condition of the insurance industry in the United States to determine whether to
promulgate additional federal regulation. The Sponsor is unable to predict      
whether any state or federal legislation will be enacted to change the nature or
scope of regulation of the insurance industry, or what effect, if any, such     
legislation would have on the industry.                                         

All insurance companies are subject to state laws and regulations that    
require diversification of their investment portfolios and limit the amount of  
investments in certain investment categories. Failure to comply with these laws 
and regulations would cause non-conforming investments to be treated as         
non-admitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus and, in some    
instances, would require divestiture.                                           

     Utility Issuers. An investment in Units of the Trust should be made with an
understanding of the characteristics of the public utility industry and the     
risks which such an investment may entail. General problems of the public       
utility industry include the difficulty in obtaining an adequate return on      
invested capital despite frequent increases in rates which have been granted by 
the public service commissions having jurisdiction, the difficulty in financing 
large construction programs during an inflationary period, the restrictions on  
operations and increased cost and delays attributable to environmental, nuclear 
safety and other regulatory considerations, the difficulty of the capital       
markets absorbing utility debt and equity securities, the difficulty in         
obtaining fuel for electric generation at reasonable prices, regulatory         
restrictions on the ability to pass increasing wholesale costs along to the     
retail and business customer, and the effects of energy conservation. There is  
no assurance that public service commissions will grant rate increases in the   
future or that any such increases will be timely or adequate to cover operating 
and other expenses and debt service requirements. All of the public utilities   
which are issuers of the Securities have been experiencing many of these        
problems in varying degrees. Furthermore, utility stocks are particularly       
susceptible to interest rate risk, generally exhibiting an inverse relationship 
to interest rates. As a result, electric utility stock prices may be adversely  
affected as interest rates rise. Similarly, the success of certain companies is 
tied to a relatively small concentration of products or technologies with       
intense competition between companies. There can be no assurance that these     
customers will place additional orders, or that an issuer of Securities will    
obtain orders of similar magnitude as past orders from other customers.         
Accordingly, a decline in demand of such products, technologies or from such    
customers could have a material adverse impact on issuers of the Securities.    

  Utilities are generally subject to extensive regulation by state utility
commissions which, for example, establish the rates which may be charged and the
appropriate rate of return on an approved asset base, which must be approved by 
the state commissions. Certain utilities have had difficulty from time to time  
in persuading regulators, who are subject to political pressures, to grant rate 
increases necessary to maintain an adequate return on investment. Any unexpected
limitations could negatively affect the profitability of utilities whose budgets
are planned far in advance. In addition, gas pipeline and distribution companies
have had difficulties in adjusting to short and surplus energy supplies,        
enforcing or being required to comply with long-term contracts and avoiding     
litigation with their customers, on the one hand, or suppliers, on the other. In
2001, two California public electric utilities claimed inability to meet their  
obligations to their suppliers in the deregulated wholesale market for          
electricity due to regulatory restrictions on their ability to pass increasing  
costs along to their customers in the retail market. These defaults led their   
wholesale suppliers to threaten to institute involuntary bankruptcy proceedings 
against the utility companies. Subsequently, one of the utility companies filed 
a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code of 
1978. Furthermore, regulatory authorities, which may be subject to political and
other pressures, may not grant future rate increases, or may impose accounting  
or operational policies, any of which could adversely affect a company's        
profitability and its stock price. In late 2001, a trader and marketer of       
utilities, commodities and financial and risk management services filed a       
voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 as a result of being negatively  
impacted by several of these and other factors.                                 

Certain of the issuers of the Securities may own or operate nuclear   
generating facilities. Governmental authorities may from time to time review    
existing, and impose additional, requirements governing the licensing,          
construction and operation of nuclear power plants. Nuclear generating projects 
in the electric utility industry have experienced substantial cost increases,   
construction delays and licensing difficulties. These have been caused by       
various factors, including inflation, high financing costs, required design     
changes and rework, allegedly faulty construction, objections by groups and     
governmental officials, limits on the ability to finance, reduced forecasts of  
energy requirements and economic conditions. This experience indicates that the 
risk of significant cost increases, delays and licensing difficulties remain    
present until completion and achievement of commercial operation of any nuclear 
project. Also, nuclear generating units in service have experienced unplanned   
outages or extensions of scheduled outages due to equipment problems or new     
regulatory requirements sometimes followed by a significant delay in obtaining  
regulatory approval to return to service. A major accident at a nuclear plant   
anywhere could cause the imposition of limits or prohibitions on the operation, 
construction or licensing of nuclear units.                                     

 In view of the uncertainties discussed above, there can be no assurance
that any utility company's share of the full cost of nuclear units under        
construction ultimately will be recovered in rates or the extent to which a     
company could earn an adequate return on its investment in such units. The      
likelihood of a significantly adverse event occurring in any of the areas of    
concern described above varies, as does the potential severity of any adverse   
impact. It should be recognized, however, that one or more of such adverse      
events could occur and individually or collectively could have a material       
adverse impact on a company's financial condition, the results of its           
operations, its ability to make interest and principal payments on its          
outstanding debt or to pay dividends.                                           

  Other general problems of the electric, gas and water utility industries
(including state and local joint action power agencies) include rising costs of 
rail transportation to transport fossil fuels, the uncertainty of transmission  
service costs for both interstate and intrastate transactions, changes in tax   
laws which adversely affect a utility's ability to operate profitably, increased
competition in service costs, recent reductions in estimates of future demand   
for electricity and gas in certain areas of the country, restrictions on        
operations and increased cost and delays attributable to environmental          
considerations, uncertain availability and increased cost of capital,           
unavailability of fuel for electric generation at reasonable prices, including  
the steady rise in fuel costs and the costs associated with conversion to       
alternate fuel sources such as coal, availability and cost of natural gas for   
resale, technical and cost factors and other problems associated with           
construction, licensing, regulation and operation of nuclear facilities for     
electric generation, including, among other considerations, the problems        
associated with the use of radioactive materials and the disposal of radioactive
wastes, and the effects of energy and environmental conservation efforts. Each  
of the problems referred to could adversely affect the ability of the issuers of
any Securities to make dividend payments and the value of such Securities on    
redemption of your Units.                                                       

Real Estate Investment Trusts. The Trust will invest in shares issued by  
REITs, domestic corporations or business trusts which invest primarily in income
producing real estate or real estate related loans or mortgages. REITs are      
financial vehicles that have as their objective the pooling of capital from a   
number of investors in order to participate indirectly in real estate ownership 
or financing. Thus, an investment in the Trust will be subject to risks similar 
to those associated with the direct ownership of real estate, in addition to    
securities markets risks, because of the Trust's investment in the securities of
companies in the real estate industry. These risks include:                     

o    declines in the value of real estate;                            

o    illiquidity of real property investments;                        

 o    risks related to general U.S. and global as well as local economic
conditions;                                                 

o    dependency on management skill;                                  

o    heavy cash flow dependency;                                      

o    possible lack of availability of mortgage funds;                 

o    excessive levels of debt or overleveraged financial structure;   

o    overbuilding;                                                    

o    extended vacancies, or obsolescence, of properties;              

o   increase in competition;                                          

o   increases in property taxes and operating expenses;               

o   changes in zoning laws;                                           

o   losses due to costs resulting from the clean-up of environmental  
problems;                                                     

 o   liability to third parties for damages resulting from environmental
problems;                                                     

o   casualty or condemnation losses;                                  

o   natural or man-made disasters;                                    

o   economic or regulatory impediments to raising rents;              

o   changes in neighborhood values and buyer demand;                  

o   changes in the appeal of properties to tenants; and               

o   changes in interest rates, tax rates or operating expenses.       

   In addition to these risks, equity REITs may be more likely to be affected by
changes in the value of the underlying property owned by the trusts. Further,   
REITs are dependent upon the management skills of the issuers and generally may 
not be diversified.                                                             

  The above factors may also adversely affect a borrower's or lessee's ability
to meet its obligations to the REIT. In the event of a default by a borrower or 
lessee, the REIT may experience delays in enforcing its rights as a mortgagee or
lessor and may incur substantial costs associated with protecting its           
investments.                                                                    

 A significant amount of the assets of a REIT may be invested in investments
in specific geographic areas or in specific property types, e.g., hotels,       
shopping malls, residential complexes, and office buildings. The impact of      
economic conditions on REITs also varies with geographic location and property  
type. Variations in rental income and space availability and vacancy rates in   
terms of supply and demand are additional factors affecting real estate         
generally and REITs in particular. In addition, you should be aware that REITs  
may not be diversified and are subject to the risks of financing projects. REITs
are also subject to                                                             

o    defaults by borrowers,                                           

o    the market's perception of the REIT industry generally,          

 o    the possibility of failing to qualify for tax-free pass-through of
income under the Internal Revenue Code, and                 

   o    the possibility of failing to maintain exemption from the Investment
Company Act of 1940.                                        

  A default by a borrower or lessee may cause the REIT to experience delays in
enforcing its rights as mortgagee or lessor and to incur significant costs      
related to protecting its investments.                                          

Some REITs in the Trust may be structured as UPREITs. An UPREIT owns an   
interest in a partnership that owns real estate. This can result in a potential 
conflict of interest between (1) shareholders of the REIT who may want to sell  
an asset and (2) other partnership interest holders who would be subject to tax 
liability if the REIT sells the property. In some cases, REITs have entered into
"no sell" agreements, which are designed to avoid taxing the holders of         
partnership units by preventing the REIT from selling the property. This        
arrangement may mean that the REIT would refuse a lucrative offer for an asset  
or be forced to hold on to a poor asset. Since parties to "no sell" agreements  
often do not disclose them, the Sponsor does not know whether any of the REITs  
in the Trust have entered into this kind of arrangement.                        

A REIT generally maintains comprehensive insurance on presently owned and 
subsequently acquired real property assets, including (1) liability, (2) fire   
and (3) extended coverage. However, there are certain types of losses, generally
of a catastrophic nature, such as earthquakes and floods, that may be           
uninsurable or not economically insurable, as to which the REIT's properties are
at risk in their particular locales. The management of a REIT uses its          
discretion in determining (1) amounts, (2) coverage limits and (3) deductibility
provisions of insurance. They generally aim to acquire appropriate insurance on 
their investments at reasonable costs and on suitable terms. This may result in 
insurance coverage that, in the event of a substantial loss, would not be       
sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement cost of  
the lost investment. Inflation, changes in building codes and ordinances,       
environmental considerations, and several other factors might make it unfeasible
to use insurance proceeds to replace a facility after it has been damaged or    
destroyed. Under such circumstances, the insurance proceeds that a REIT receives
might not be adequate to restore its economic position with respect to that     
property.                                                                       

Under various federal, state, and local environmental laws, ordinances and
regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be    
liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances 
on, under or in such property. Such laws often impose liability (1) whether or  
not the owner or operator caused or knew of the presence of the hazardous or    
toxic substances and (2) whether or not the storage of the substances was in    
violation of a tenant's lease. In addition, (1) the presence of hazardous or    
toxic substances, or (2) the failure to remediate the property properly, may    
hinder the owner's ability to borrow using that real property as collateral. We 
cannot give any assurance that one or more of the REITs in the Trust may not be 
currently liable or potentially liable for any of these costs in connection with
real estate assets they presently own or subsequently acquire while the shares  
of those REITs are held in the Trust.                                           

Consumer Staples. Your Trust may invest significantly in issuers that   
manufacture or sell consumer staples. The profitability of these companies will 
be affected by various factors including the general state of the economy and   
consumer spending trends. Weakness in the banking or real estate industry, a    
recessionary economic climate with the consequent slowdown in employment growth,
less favorable trends in unemployment or a marked deceleration in real          
disposable personal income growth could result in significant pressure on both  
consumer wealth and consumer confidence, adversely affecting consumer spending  
habits. Furthermore, the failure to continue developing new products, lack of or
reduced market acceptance of new and existing products, increased raw materials 
costs, an inability to raise prices, increased or changed regulation and product
liability claims or product recalls could also adversely impact the performance 
and stock prices of the issuers of Securities in this industry group.           

Industrials. Your Trust may invest significantly in industrials companies.
General risks of industrials companies include the general state of the economy,
intense competition, consolidation, domestic and international politics, excess 
capacity and consumer spending trends. In addition, capital goods companies may 
also be significantly affected by overall capital spending levels, economic     
cycles, technical obsolescence, delays in modernization, limitations on supply  
of key materials, labor relations, government regulations, government contracts 
and e-commerce initiatives. Furthermore, certain companies involved in the      
industry have also faced scrutiny for alleged accounting irregularities that may
have led to the overstatement of their financial results, and other companies in
the industry may face similar scrutiny.                                         

  Industrials companies may also be affected by factors more specific to their
individual industries. Industrial machinery manufacturers may be subject to     
declines in commercial and consumer demand and the need for modernization.      
Aerospace and defense companies may be influenced by decreased demand for new   
equipment, aircraft order cancellations, disputes over or ability to obtain or  
retain government contracts, or changes in government budget priorities, changes
in aircraft-leasing contracts and cutbacks in profitable business travel. The   
number of housing starts, levels of public and non-residential construction     
including weakening demand for new office and retail space, and overall         
construction spending may adversely affect construction equipment manufacturers.

   Health Care Issuers. An investment in Units of your Trust should be made with
an understanding of the problems and risks inherent in the healthcare industry  
in general. Health care companies involved in advanced medical devices and      
instruments, drugs and biotech, managed care, hospital management/health        
services and medical supplies have potential risks unique to their sector of the
healthcare field. These companies are subject to governmental regulation of     
their products and services, a factor which could have a significant and        
possibly unfavorable effect on the price and availability of such products or   
services. Furthermore, such companies face the risk of increasing competition   
from new products or services, generic drug sales, termination of patent        
protection for drug or medical supply products and the risk that technological  
advances will render their products obsolete. The research and development costs
of bringing a drug to market are substantial, and include lengthy governmental  
review processes with no guarantee that the product will ever come to market.   
Many of these companies may have losses and not offer certain products for      
several years. Such companies may also have persistent losses during a new      
product's transition from development to production, and revenue patterns may be
erratic.                                                                        

Legislative proposals concerning healthcare are proposed in Congress from 
time to time. These proposals span a wide range of topics, including cost and   
price controls (which might include a freeze on the prices of prescription      
drugs), national health insurance, incentives for competition in the provision  
of healthcare services, tax incentives and penalties related to healthcare      
insurance premiums and promotion of pre-paid healthcare plans. The Sponsor and  
the Underwriter are unable to predict the effect of any of these proposals, if  
enacted, on the issuers of Securities in your Portfolio.                        

     Energy Issuers. Energy companies face risks related to political conditions
in oil producing regions (such as the Middle East), the actions of the          
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), the price and worldwide   
supply of oil and natural gas, the price and availability of alternative fuels, 
the ability to find and acquire oil and gas reserves that are economically      
recoverable, operating hazards, government regulation and the level of consumer 
demand. Political conditions of some oil producing regions have been unstable in
the past. Political instability or war in these regions could have a negative   
impact on your investment. Oil and natural gas prices can be extremely volatile.
OPEC controls a substantial portion of world oil production. OPEC may take      
actions to increase or suppress the price or availability of oil. Various       
domestic and foreign government authorities and international cartels also      
impact these prices. Any substantial decline in these prices could have an      
adverse effect on energy companies. Energy companies depend on their ability to 
find and acquire additional energy reserves. The exploration and recovery       
process involves significant operating hazards and can be very costly. An energy
company has no assurance that it will find reserves or that any reserves will be
economically recoverable. The industry also faces substantial government        
regulation, including environmental regulation. These regulations have increased
costs and limited production and usage of certain fuels. Furthermore, certain   
companies involved in the industry have also faced scrutiny for alleged         
accounting irregularities that may have led to the overstatement of their       
financial results, and other companies in the industry may face similar         
scrutiny.                                                                       

Technology companies. The market for technology products and services,
especially those related to the Internet, is characterized by rapidly changing  
technology, rapid products obsolescence, cyclical market patterns, evolving     
industry standards and frequent new product introductions. The success of       
technology companies depends in substantial part on the timely and success      
introduction of new products. An unexpected change in one or more of the        
technologies affecting an issuer's products or in the market for products based 
on a particular technology could have a material adverse affect on an issuer's  
operating results. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that companies will be
able to respond timely to compete in the rapidly developing marketplace.        

The market for certain technology products and services may have only 
recently begun to develop, is rapidly evolving and is characterized by an       
increasing number of market entrants. Additionally, certain technology companies
may have only recently commenced operations or offered equity securities to the 
public. Such companies are in the early stage of development and have a limited 
operating history on which to analyze future operating results. It is important 
to note that following its initial public offering, a security is likely to     
experience substantial stock price volatility and speculative trading.          
Accordingly, there can be no assurance that, upon redemption of your Units or   
termination of the Trust, you will receive an amount greater than or equal to   
your initial investment.                                                        

    Based on trading history, factors such as announcements of new products or
development of new technologies and general conditions of the industry have     
caused and are likely to cause the market price of technology common stocks to  
fluctuate substantially. In addition, technology company stocks have experienced
extreme price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated to the     
operating performance of such companies. This market volatility may adversely   
affect the market price of the Securities and therefore your ability to redeem  
your Units, or roll over your Units into a new trust, at a price equal to or    
greater than the original price paid for such Units.                            

     Some key components of certain products of technology issuers are currently
available only from a single source. There can be no assurance that in the      
future suppliers will be able to meet the demand for components in a timely and 
cost effective manner. Accordingly, an issuer's operating results and customer  
relationships could be adversely affected by either an increase in price for, or
any interruption or reduction in supply of, any key components. Additionally,   
many technology issuers are characterized by a highly concentrated customer base
consisting of a limited number of large customers who may require product       
vendors to comply with rigorous and constantly developing industry standards.   
Any failure to comply with such standards may result in a significant loss or   
reduction of sales. Because many products and technology are incorporated into  
other related products, certain companies are often highly dependent on the     
performance of other computer, electronics and communications companies. There  
can be no assurance that these customers will place additional orders, or that  
an issuer of Securities will obtain orders of similar magnitude as past orders  
from other customers. Similarly, the success of certain companies is tied to a  
relatively small concentration of products or technology with intense           
competition between companies. Accordingly, a decline in demand for such        
products or technology from such customers could have a material adverse impact 
on issuers of the Securities.                                                   

  The life cycle of a new technology product or service tends to be short,
resulting in volatile sales, earnings and stock prices for many technology      
companies. Additionally, with the rapid evolution of technologies, competitive  
advantages tend to be short lived and product pricing usually falls.            
Historically, many of the benefits from new technologies have gone to the       
consumer, as their creators have been unable to retain differentiation or       
pricing power. Some of the large technology companies have been involved in     
antitrust litigation and may continue to be in the future. A slowdown in        
corporate or consumer spending on technology will likely hurt technology company
revenues. Technology companies rely on international sales for a meaningful part
of their revenues. Any slowdown in international economies could hurt revenues. 

Consumer Cyclicals. The success of companies in the consumer cyclicals
sector depends heavily on consumer spending and disposable household income and 
is subject to severe competition. Therefore, the success of consumer cyclicals  
companies is tied closely to the performance of the domestic and international  
economy, and to interest rates, competition and consumer confidence. A slowdown 
in the economy would likely hurt the consumer cyclicals industry. The success of
companies in the consumer cyclicals segment are also strongly affected by       
changes in demographics and consumer tastes.                                    

Consumer Products. Your Trust may invest significantly in issuers that  
manufacture or sell consumer products. The profitability of these companies will
be affected by various factors including the general state of the economy and   
consumer spending trends. Weakness in the banking or real estate industry, a    
recessionary economic climate with the consequent slowdown in employment growth,
less favorable trends in unemployment or a marked deceleration in real          
disposable personal income growth could result in significant pressure on both  
consumer wealth and consumer confidence, adversely affecting consumer spending  
habits. Furthermore, the failure to continue developing new products, lack of or
reduced market acceptance of new and existing products, increased raw materials 
costs, an inability to raise prices, increased or changed regulation and product
liability claims or product recalls could also adversely impact the performance 
and stock prices of the issuers of Securities in this industry group.           

   Telecommunications Issuers. Because the Portfolio is also concentrated in the
telecommunications industry, the value of the Units may be susceptible to       
factors affecting the telecommunications industry. The telecommunications       
industry is subject to governmental regulation, and the products and services of
telecommunications companies may be subject to rapid obsolescence. These factors
could affect the value of Units. Telephone companies in the United States, for  
example, are subject to both state and federal regulations affecting permitted  
rates of returns and the kinds of services that may be offered. Certain types of
companies represented in a portfolio are engaged in fierce competition for a    
share of the market of their products. As a result, competitive pressures are   
intense and the stocks are subject to rapid price volatility.                   

Several recent high-profile bankruptcies of large telecommunications    
companies have illustrated the potentially unstable condition of                
telecommunications companies. High debt loads that were accumulated during the  
industry growth spurt of the 1990s are catching up to the industry, causing debt
and stock prices to trade at distressed levels for many telecommunications      
companies and increasing the cost of capital for needed additional investment.  
At the same time, demand for some telecommunications services has fallen        
sharply, as several key markets have become oversaturated, some local customers 
have switched to substitute providers and technologies, and corporate profits   
and the economy generally remain weak. To meet increasing competition, companies
may have to commit substantial capital, particularly in the formulation of new  
products and services using new technologies. As a result, many companies have  
been compelled to cut costs by reducing their workforce, outsourcing,           
consolidating and/or closing existing facilities and divesting low selling      
product lines. Furthermore, certain companies involved in the industry have also
faced scrutiny for alleged accounting irregularities that may have led to the   
overstatement of their financial results, and other companies in the industry   
may face similar scrutiny. Due to these and other factors, the risk level of    
owning the securities of telecommunications companies has increased             
substantially and may continue to rise.                                         

    While a portfolio concentrates on the securities of established suppliers of
traditional telecommunication products and services, the Trust may also invest  
in smaller telecommunications companies which may benefit from the development  
of new products and services. These smaller companies may present greater       
opportunities for capital appreciation, and may also involve greater risk than  
large, established issuers. Such smaller companies may have limited product     
lines, market or financial resources, and their securities may trade less       
frequently and in limited volume than the securities of larger, more established
companies. As a result, the prices of the securities of such smaller companies  
may fluctuate to a greater degree than the prices of securities of other        
issuers.                                                                        

In addition, recent federal legislation governing the United States     
telecommunications industry remains subject to judicial review and additional   
interpretation, which may adversely affect the companies whose securities are   
held by the Trust.                                                              

 Liquidity. Whether or not the stocks in the Trust are listed on a stock
exchange, the stocks may delist from the exchange or principally trade in an    
over-the-counter market. As a result, the existence of a liquid trading market  
could depend on whether dealers will make a market in the stocks. We cannot     
guarantee that dealers will maintain a market or that any market will be liquid.
The value of the stocks could fall if trading markets are limited or absent.    

  Voting. Only the Trustee may sell or vote the stocks in the Trust. While
you may sell or redeem your Units, you may not sell or vote the stocks in the   
Trust. The Sponsor will instruct the Trustee how to vote the stocks. The Trustee
will vote the stocks in the same general proportion as shares held by other     
shareholders if the Sponsor fails to provide instructions.                      

    No FDIC Guarantee. An investment in the Trust is not a deposit of any bank
and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or
any other government agency.                                                    

SPONSOR INFORMATION

relates only to the Sponsor and not to the Trust or to any other Series thereof.
The information is included herein only for the purpose of informing investors  
as to the financial responsibility of the Sponsor and its ability to carry out  
its contractual obligations. More detailed financial information will be made   
available by the Sponsor upon request).                                         

Van Kampen Funds Inc. and your Trust have adopted a code of ethics    
requiring Van Kampen's employees who have access to information on Trust        
transactions to report personal securities transactions. This code is intended  
to avoid potential conflicts of interest and to prevent fraud, deception or     
misconduct with respect to your Trust.                                          

If the Sponsor shall fail to perform any of its duties under the Trust
Agreement or become incapable of acting or shall become bankrupt or its affairs 
are taken over by public authorities, then the Trustee may (i) appoint a        
successor Sponsor at rates of compensation deemed by the Trustee to be          
reasonable and not exceeding amounts prescribed by the Securities and Exchange  
Commission, (ii) terminate the Trust Agreement and liquidate the Trust as       
provided therein or (iii) continue to act as Trustee without terminating the    
Trust Agreement.                                                                

TRUSTEE INFORMATION                                                             

  The Trustee is The Bank of New York, a trust company organized under the
laws of the State of New York. The Bank of New York has its principal unit      
investment trust division offices at 2 Hanson Place, 12th Floor, Brooklyn, New
York 11217, (800) 221-7668. The Bank of New York is subject to supervision and  
examination by the Superintendent of Banks of the State of New York and the     
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and its deposits are insured  
by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to the extent permitted by law.    

   The duties of the Trustee are primarily ministerial in nature. It did not
participate in the selection of Securities for the Trust portfolio.             

     In accordance with the Trust Agreement, the Trustee shall keep proper books
of record and account of all transactions at its office for the Trust. Such     
records shall include the name and address of, and the number of Units of the   
Trust held by, every Unitholder. Such books and records shall be open to        
inspection by any Unitholder at all reasonable times during the usual business  
hours. The Trustee shall make such annual or other reports as may from time to  
time be required under any applicable state or federal statute, rule or         
regulation. The Trustee is required to keep a certified copy or duplicate       
original of the Trust Agreement on file in its office available for inspection  
at all reasonable times during the usual business hours by any Unitholder,      
together with a current list of the Securities held in the Trust.               

    Under the Trust Agreement, the Trustee or any successor trustee may resign
and be discharged of its responsibilities created by the Trust Agreement by     
executing an instrument in writing and filing the same with the Sponsor. The    
Trustee or successor trustee must mail a copy of the notice of resignation to   
all Unitholders then of record, not less than 60 days before the date specified 
in such notice when such resignation is to take effect. The Sponsor upon        
receiving notice of such resignation is obligated to appoint a successor trustee
promptly. If, upon such resignation, no successor trustee has been appointed and
has accepted the appointment within 30 days after notification, the retiring    
Trustee may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a 
successor. The Sponsor may remove the Trustee and appoint a successor trustee as
provided in the Trust Agreement at any time with or without cause. Notice of    
such removal and appointment shall be mailed to each Unitholder by the Sponsor. 
Upon execution of a written acceptance of such appointment by such successor    
trustee, all the rights, powers, duties and obligations of the original trustee 
shall vest in the successor. The resignation or removal of a Trustee becomes    
effective only when the successor trustee accepts its appointment as such or    
when a court of competent jurisdiction appoints a successor trustee.            

    Any corporation into which a Trustee may be merged or with which it may be
consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger or consolidation to  
which a Trustee shall be a party, shall be the successor trustee. The Trustee   
must be a banking corporation organized under the laws of the United States or  
any state and having at all times an aggregate capital, surplus and undivided   
profits of not less than $5,000,000.                                            

TRUST TERMINATION                                                               

The Trust may be liquidated at any time by consent of Unitholders     
representing 66 2/3% of the Units of such Trust then outstanding or by the      
Trustee when the value of the Securities owned by the Trust, as shown by any    
evaluation, is less than $500,000 ($3,000,000 if the value of the Trust has     
exceeded $15,000,000). The Trust will be liquidated by the Trustee in the event 
that a sufficient number of Units of the Trust not yet sold are tendered for    
redemption by the Sponsor, so that the net worth of such Trust would be reduced 
to less than 40% of the value of the Securities at the time they were deposited 
in the Trust. If the Trust is liquidated because of the redemption of unsold    
Units by the Sponsor, the Sponsor will refund to each purchaser of Units the    
entire sales charge paid by such purchaser. The Trust Agreement will terminate  
upon the sale or other disposition of the last Security held thereunder, but in 
no event will it continue beyond the Mandatory Termination Date.                

    Commencing during the period beginning nine business days prior to, and no
later than, the Mandatory Termination Date, Securities may begin to be sold in  
connection with the termination of the Trust. The Sponsor will determine the    
manner, timing and execution of the sales of the Securities. The Sponsor shall  
direct the liquidation of the Securities in such manner as to effectuate orderly
sales and a minimal market impact. In the event the Sponsor does not so direct, 
the Securities shall be sold within a reasonable period and in such manner as   
the Trustee, in its sole discretion, shall determine. At least 30 days before   
the Mandatory Termination Date the Trustee will provide written notice of any   
termination to all Unitholders of the appropriate Trust and in the case of a    
Trust will include with such notice a form to enable Unitholders owning the     
minimum number of Units described in the Prospectus to request an in-kind       
distribution of the Securities. To be effective, this request must be returned  
to the Trustee at least five business days prior to the Mandatory Termination   
Date. On the Mandatory Termination Date (or on the previous business day if a   
holiday) the Trustee will deliver each requesting Unitholder's pro rata number  
of whole shares of the Securities in the Trust to the account of the            
broker-dealer or bank designated by the Unitholder at Depository Trust Company. 
The value of the Unitholder's fractional shares of the Securities will be paid  
in cash. Unitholders not requesting an in-kind distribution will receive a cash 
distribution from the sale of the remaining Securities within a reasonable time 
following the Mandatory Termination Date. Regardless of the distribution        
involved, the Trustee will deduct from the funds of the Trust any accrued costs,
expenses, advances or indemnities provided by the Trust Agreement, including    
estimated compensation of the Trustee, costs of liquidation and any amounts     
required as a reserve to provide for payment of any applicable taxes or other   
governmental charges. Any sale of Securities in the Trust upon termination may  
result in a lower amount than might otherwise be realized if such sale were not 
required at such time. The Trustee will then distribute to each Unitholder of   
each Trust his pro rata share of the balance of the Income and Capital Accounts.

  Within 60 days of the final distribution Unitholders will be furnished a
final distribution statement of the amount distributable. At such time as the   
Trustee in its sole discretion will determine that any amounts held in reserve  
are no longer necessary, it will make distribution thereof to Unitholders in the
same manner.                                                                    

                                                                       EMSPRO390
