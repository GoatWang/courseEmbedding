Schlanger, who has served as CEO since 2013, is leaving the Company by mutual agreement. Mr. Wygod added, "On behalf of the Board of Directors, we thank David for his contributions as CEO over these last three years.

We wish David well in his future endeavors and Steve continued success in his new position."
