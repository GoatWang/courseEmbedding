                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

laws of the State of New York, including Section 5-1401 of the
General Obligations Law, without reference to its conflict of law
provisions and the obligations, rights, and remedies of the parties
hereunder shall be determined in accordance with such laws.

(b)        Each party hereto
hereby consents and agrees that the state or federal courts located
in the Borough of Manhattan in New York City shall have exclusive
jurisdiction to hear and determine any claims or disputes between
them pertaining to this Indenture Supplement or to any matter
arising out of or relating to this Indenture Supplement;
provided , that each party hereto acknowledges that any
appeals from those courts may have to be heard by a court located
outside of the Borough of Manhattan in New York City;
provided , further , that nothing in this Indenture
Supplement shall be deemed or operate to preclude the Indenture
Trustee from bringing suit or taking other legal action in any
other jurisdiction to realize on the Receivables or any security
for the obligations of the Issuer arising hereunder or to enforce a
judgment or other court order in favor of the Indenture Trustee.
Each party hereto submits and

consents in advance to such jurisdiction in any action or suite
commenced in any such court, and each party hereto hereby waives
any objection that such party may have based upon lack of personal

arising in connection with complex financial transactions are most
quickly and economically resolved by an experienced and expert
person and the parties wish applicable state and federal laws to
apply (rather than arbitration rules), the parties desire that
their disputes be resolved by a judge applying such applicable
laws. Therefore, to achieve the best combination of the benefits of

written notice to the Indenture Trustee, the Issuer shall establish
or cause to be established a new Principal Funding Account that is

Funding account. From the date each such new Principal Funding

Section 3.1 of the Servicing Agreement, the Servicer shall
have the power to instruct the Indenture Trustee to make

Trustee’s duties hereunder.

(c)                
The Controlled Accumulation Period is scheduled to commence the
first Business Day of the month that is twelve (12) calendar months

before the second Business Day immediately preceding the first
Business Day of the month that is twelve (12) months prior to the
Expected Final Payment Date, the Servicer shall determine the
“ Controlled Accumulation Period Length ,” which
shall equal the number of months not less than the number of whole
calendar months reasonably expected by the Servicer to be necessary
to accumulate from Series 2016-1 Available Principal Collections

available to Series 2016-1 from other Shared Excess Available

Period exceeds the amount available therefor pursuant to
Section 4.04(d) with respect to such Monthly Period,
the Allocation Amount will be reduced by the amount of such excess,
but not by more than the Series 2016-1 Default Amount for such
Payment Date (such reduction, an “ Investor Charge-Off
”).

Section 4.08.        
Reallocated Principal Collections . On each Payment Date,
the Servicer shall apply, to the extent permitted herein, or shall
instruct the Indenture Trustee in writing to apply Reallocated

Collections, less any amount released and used to purchase
Receivables under Section 4.01(f) , for the related Monthly
Period or (b) the Monthly Subordination Amount for such
Payment Date in accordance with the priority

Charge Collections allocable to Series 2016-1 with respect to each
Monthly Period shall mean an amount equal to the Series Available
Finance Charge Collections Shortfall, if any, with respect to
Series 2016-1 for such Monthly Period; provided ,
however , that if the aggregate amount of Shared Excess
Available Finance Charge Collections for all Series in Shared
Excess Available Finance Charge Collections Group One for each
Monthly Period is less than the Aggregate Series Available Finance
Charge Collections Shortfall for such Monthly Period, then Shared
Excess Available Finance Charge Collections allocable to Series
2016-1 with respect to such Monthly Period shall equal the product
of (i) Shared Excess Available Finance Charge Collections for
all Series in Shared Excess Available Finance Charge Collections
Group One for such Monthly Period and (ii) a fraction, the
numerator of which is the Series Available Finance Charge
Collections Shortfall with respect to Series 2016-1 for such
Monthly Period and the denominator of which is the Aggregate Series
Available Finance Charge Collections Shortfall for such Monthly
Period.

priority provided for under Sections 4.05(b)(i)-(iii) .
Shared Excess Available Principal Collections allocable to Series
2016-1 with respect to each Monthly Period shall mean an amount
equal to the Series Available Principal Collections Shortfall, if

provided , however , that if the aggregate amount of
Shared Excess Available Principal Collections for all Series in

Monthly Period is less than the Aggregate Series Available
Principal Collections Shortfall for such Monthly Period, then

2016-1 with respect to such Monthly Period shall equal the product
of (i) Shared Excess Available Principal Collections for all
Series in Shared Excess Available Principal Collections Group One
for such Monthly Period and (ii) a fraction, the numerator of
which is the Series Available Principal Collections Shortfall with
respect to Series 2016-1 for such Monthly Period and the
denominator of which is the Aggregate Series Available Principal
Collections Shortfall for such Monthly Period.

(c)

One, any Shared Excess Available Principal Collections for each

with Section 5.02(c) of the Indenture. The Indenture Trustee

and the Indenture Trustee upon being notified in writing of such
ineligibility (or the Servicer or the Owner Trustee for the Issuer)

Eligible Deposit Account, and shall transfer any funds or other

Servicer in accordance with written instructions from the Servicer;
provided , that the funds are invested in investments that

Investment shall be disposed of prior to its maturity;
provided , however , that the Indenture
Trustee shall sell, liquidate or dispose of any such Eligible
Investment if, prior to the maturity of such Eligible Investment, a
default occurs in the payment of principal, interest or any other
amount with respect to such Eligible Investment; provided
further , however , that the Servicer shall
deliver prompt written notice to the Indenture Trustee of any such
default; and provided further , that, subject to
Section 8.01 of the Indenture, the Indenture Trustee shall not
in any way be held liable by reason of any insufficiency in such
Accumulation Reserve Account resulting from any loss on any
Eligible Investment included therein except for losses attributable
to the Indenture Trustee’s failure to make payments on such
Eligible Investments issued by the Indenture Trustee, in its
commercial capacity, in accordance with their terms. On each Note
Transfer Date, all interest and earnings (net of losses and
investment expenses) accrued since the preceding Note Transfer Date
on funds on deposit in the Accumulation Reserve Account shall be
retained in the Accumulation Reserve Account (to the extent that
the Available Accumulation Reserve Account Amount is less than the
Required Accumulation Reserve Account Amount) and the balance, if
any, shall be deposited in the Collection Account for application
in accordance with Section 4.04 . For purposes of
determining the availability of funds or the balance in the
Accumulation Reserve Account for any reason under this Indenture
Supplement, except as otherwise provided in the preceding sentence,
investment earnings, if any, on such funds shall be deemed not to
be available or on deposit.
