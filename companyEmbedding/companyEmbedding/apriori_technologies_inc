  What We ProvideEarly Visibility to Cost of Trade Off Decisions  





Costing Without Complexity
aPriori is a software application that helps you answer cost questions faster than you could ever imagine:

What happens if I change the Product Design? Did the cost go up or down?
What happens to the cost of my design if we change the Material from Aluminum to Steel?
How much savings can we get if we make 50,000 vs. 100?
If I use a Die Casting Process instead of a Sand Casting process, will this reduce my cost?
What will happen to the cost if we move the manufacturing of our product from Mexico to China?

Until now, most software applications that attempted to provide the cost of a manufactured part required large amounts of data input each time a new quote was required. Furthermore, these products could only be used by a handful of specialists that required extensive training to be productive with the application. aPriori is an entirely different cost management solution that is dedicated to providing our customers “Costing without Complexity”.
Download the cost reports that illustrate the beginning cost assessment and end results from the video above that answers these types of questions in detail.
Costing Across the Enterprise
aPriori is a product designed to be used by people throughout your company, requires very little training to become proficient, and provides a cost estimate in real-time simply by opening a 3D CAD design, picking the type of manufacturing process from a drop down menu, entering the volume of production, and selecting the virtual factory that will be used to generate the cost. Groups that would find great value in using aPriori include:

Design Engineering
Manufacturing Engineering
Manufacturing Process Planning
Cost Estimation, Value Analysis/Value Engineering
Purchasing, Procurement, Sourcing
Program and Project Management

These people are required to answer cost questions like the ones above every single day. How they answer those questions will ultimately impact the profitability of your products – quite possibly in a negative way. Today, your employees are flying blind. Most companies do not have a product cost management platform available to them. As a consequence, they make their decisions based on the traditional criteria of Form, Fit or Function. What would happen if throughout their day, as they were making those tradeoff decisions, they could immediately know the cost of that decision?
The aPriori Product Cost Management software platform unlocks this hidden economic opportunity by providing product cost visibility and by answering cost questions early and continuously during the product development and production delivery process. By answering these cost questions in real-time, aPriori enables users to quickly understand the cost consequences of their design, manufacturing or sourcing decisions, and find the least expensive solution while meeting their various functional requirements. Users are still free to make their own decisions; aPriori is simply answering the very difficult question of what is the cost impact of each decision they make.

  aPriori Solutions Overview   




Product Cost Solutions Across the Lifecycle
For manufacturers struggling to deliver profits in the face of rising product costs and global competition, understanding product costs early and throughout the product lifecycle is crucial.

 
aPriori’s revolutionary cost management capabilities empower organizations to identify quantifiable savings in material, tooling, labor and overhead when evaluating alternative designs, manufacturing processes and sources. With access to real-time cost assessments throughout the product development process, employees in sourcing, engineering and manufacturing will make well-informed decisions that drive significant costs out of products pre- and post-production.
Through an innovative, patented understanding of how product design, materials and manufacturing processes translate into product costs, aPriori replaces traditional, inefficient cost-estimation techniques (such as activity-based costing, contract quoting or statistical analysis) with precise cost assessments that update in real-time as parameters change. aPriori provides true cost visibility to everyone in the organization that impacts cost – designers, manufacturing engineers and planners, purchasing and sourcing professionals, cost managers, program management and executives.
Meeting Unique Industry Challenges
aPriori is used to help product teams address cost challenges across cost a wide range of industry verticals and products, from tractors, to forklifts, HVAC equipment, snowmobiles, engines, trucks, ATMs, mail machines and more.
Specific areas of expertise include:

Agricultural Equipment / Heavy Equipment / Industrial Equipment
Meeting target costs at product launch traditionally has been a challenge for companies in the agricultural / heavy / industrial equipment industries as they lack access to accurate cost data early in the development process. aPriori’s real-time “should cost” assessments make cost data available sooner, making cost targets more achievable. With the increase in parts outsourced to suppliers, sourcing professionals can use aPriori’s “should cost” details to make sure they never overpay suppliers for their parts.  Examples of aPriori customers in this space include: AGCO Corporation, CNH, NMHG, Jungheinrich, FMC Technologies, ThyssenKrupp Elevator and Dematic.


Automotive / Transportation / Recreational Vehicles
aPriori’s ability to cost metal and plastic parts, welded assemblies and more helps OEMs and suppliers get better control over their part and product costs. With Cost of Goods sold usually between 75 and 90 percent of revenue, companies in these markets are extremely cost sensitive. Using aPriori to reduce product costs even by a small percentage yields exponential results to profit margin. Examples of aPriori customers in this space include:  Ford Motor Company, Alstom Transport, American Axle & Manufacturing (AAM), Blue Bird Corporation and Commercial Vehicle Group.


Electronics & High Technology (EHT)
With medium to high production volumes, the mechanical spend for high tech devices (e.g., computers, printers, scanners, labratory equipment, medical devices, etc.) can be significant. By supporting stage tooling, progressive die and injection molding plastic processes, aPriori can help cost-reduce new and existing parts for companies that produce computer equipment, audio & video equipment, communications equipment, instruments and control equipment, laboratory equipment and other high tech products.  Examples of aPriori customers in this space include: Wincor Nixdorf, Diebold, Zebra Technologies, and several of the largest manufacturers of Computer Equipment and Peripherals in the world.


Aerospace & Defense
Products designed and manufactured in the commercial aerospace or defense markets are often extremely complex and have very long life cycles.  For commercial aerospace companies, managing cost across a complex supply chain is becoming more complicated by the day.  With national defense departments increasingly moving away from “Cost-Plus” type contracts, system integrators and their subcontractors are being asked to submit fixed price bids.  Multi-tier, global supply chains and fixed price targets put significant stress on manufacturers to quote accurately, design to cost, and avoid overpaying for outsourced components.  aPriori was designed to help address all of these challenges through an enterprise platform approach that provides early visibility to cost, and enables frequent evaluation of cost each and every time an important tradeoff decision is made.  Examples of aPriori customers in this space include:  Boeing and Honeywell.


Durable Goods/Appliances
Companies that make products with a high concentration of metal and plastic parts – including refrigerators, ovens, air conditioners, motors, generators, and other large and small appliances and durable goods – can take advantage of aPriori’s real-time cost information to keep prices low in highly competitive markets.  Examples of aPriori customers in this space include:  Bissell and one of the largest manufacturers of refrigerators, washing machines and ovens in the world.

Really like the fact that there was three tracks depending on the role attendant is playing in his company. The game night to beginning was really great, it helps breaking the ice and give a relax mood.


Marc-Andre Patry, Soucy



In my eyes the 2016 NA STARS conference was another huge success for the aPriori team. I was brought back together for face time with many now familiar faces in the industry to talk cost estimating. The presentation by Soucy was my favorite as it resonated well with my use case of the tool and shed some light on ideas and approaches to tackle the issue.


John Allen, Celestica



STARS 2016 was a valuable event, personally and professionally. Professionally...Learning about current and future capabilities within aPriori, networking with other companies and users, and engaging with the aPriori leadership. Personally learning how to play Craps. The hotel selection provided a balance between focus work environment and summer vacation.


David Ondrias, Whirlpool

  About UsImproving Your Profitability through Enterprise Product Cost Management   PlayOur VisionAn Enterprise Product Cost Management platform provides early visibility to cost, consistency of costing practices across all members of the product team and higher throughput of cost optimized parts, all leading to a more cost conscious culture where where everyone is considering profitability with each decision they make.Watch Video  




aPriori is a software company located in Concord, Massachusetts that develops and markets product cost management software. The company was founded in 2003. Since then, we have invested hundreds of man-years into the development of our product and acquired numerous world class manufacturing corporations as customers.
Fundamentally, aPriori software and services generate hard-dollar product cost savings for discrete manufacturing organizations. Using aPriori’s real-time product cost assessments, employees in sourcing, manufacturing and design engineering make more-informed decisions that drive costs out of products pre- and post-production. With aPriori, manufacturers launch products at cost targets, maximize savings in re-work projects and never overpay for sourced parts. As a result, aPriori customers significantly reduce product costs and measurably improve overall financial performance, all while delivering high-value products to their customers .
Launch New Products at or Below Target Cost
Even best-in-class manufacturing companies can miss their cost targets when launching new products. With aPriori, engineers can explore more design alternatives earlier in the development process without sacrificing schedules. Within seconds of making a design change, aPriori provides a real-time assessment of how the change has affected the cost of the part or product. With on-going access to product cost information, engineers make better decisions that prevent costs from being designed into new products while reducing the need for changes later in development – when making changes is incrementally more expensive.
Avoid Overpaying for Outsourced Parts
aPriori makes it possible for companies to ensure consistently optimal pricing for their outsourced parts and products. With aPriori’s real-time product cost information, sourcing professionals always know precisely how much a part or product “should cost” to produce. Access to precise “should cost” information enables sourcing experts to easily identify where they are overpaying for outsourced parts and to always negotiate the best deals with suppliers. The result is significant product cost savings en route to meeting (or surpassing) cost reduction goals.
Maximize Cost Savings on Re-Design Work
For re-design projects, aPriori provides design engineers with instant cost feedback as they attempt to cost-reduce and improve production parts. Designers can simply load parts to see what they cost today and then evaluate cost-saving, alternative designs using aPriori’s precise product cost information. Cost assessments are delivered in real-time as designs are modified, providing engineers with visibility into how the most recent change will impact overall cost. With aPriori, designers always know what it “should cost” to produce a design without having to wait for a formal cost estimate or supplier quote. As a result, engineers can evaluate more alternatives and make better decisions that ultimately result in lower product costs.
Increase the Accuracy and Speed of RFQ Responses
OEMs are looking to outsource business to suppliers, but demand accurate and detailed quotations. From the supplier’s perspective, it’s challenging to keep up with the number of business opportunities because generating accurate and detailed quotations is a manual, resource-intensive process. With aPriori, the time required to generate a detailed cost estimate can be reduced from days to minutes.

aPriori Technologies Inc. Key Developments

Rafael Selects aPriori for Product Cost Management
Jun 20 17
aPriori has been selected by Rafael Advanced Defense Systems. Rafael will start their implementation of aPriori at their design and engineering center in Haifa, and will be growing their deployment across their enterprise over the course of the multi-year program. aPriori's product cost management platform will provide Rafael's design and sourcing teams with real-time cost estimates on parts and products in design. The software leverages CAD and intelligent cost models to quickly determine feasible manufacturing methods and product costs while generating detailed manufacturing analysis and cost estimates that quantify the impact of changes to product design, materials, manufacturing processes, volumes and location in real time. aPriori will also provide the Rafael procurement and sourcing teams with regional cost benchmarks based on the company's specific product requirements, enabling it to collaborate more effectively with its suppliers.


aPriori Expands Into Costing of Electronic Products
Jan 11 17
aPriori announced an important addition to the company’s product portfolio – a new software module that automates the cost calculation of Printed Circuit Board Assembly (PCBA). With automated PCBA costing software, users will be able to quickly generate a detailed cost estimate by importing a Bill of Materials with basic attribute information about the components. The PCBA costing module will assign a cost to the board components using a library of component costs and estimate the assembly costs of attaching the components to the board. Users can also specify test and verification processes required whereby the system will automatically assess the cost of each process and roll it into the overall PCBA cost. The aPriori PCBA costing module comes with more than forty-five out-of-the-box assembly and test manufacturing cost models and is built on aPriori’s extensible platform, supporting the addition of more processes. Key benefits that customers will realize with aPriori’s new PCBA cost module include: Providing engineers with early visibility into the cost impact of design decisions and supporting exploration of options like single vs. double sided or the assembly cost impact of using different size boards; Enable Sourcing to negotiate more effectively with suppliers by providing detail on component costs, manufacturing costs & commercial costs; Quantify cost impact of VAVE explorations; Ability to aggregate and analyze data across product lines and business units; and Centrally located cost models will drive consistency of costing across a team. Printed Circuit Boards (PCB) are used in all but the simplest electronic devices and are used to route signals and power through electronic devices. They appear in almost all discrete manufactured products to some degree. They can also represent a significant portion the cost for a product, especially in industry verticals such as aerospace & defense, high tech electronics (computer and communications equipment and other consumer electronic products), healthcare, oil & gas and increasingly in automotive and transportation products. While it is a significant portion of a company’s spend, the divisions responsible for PCB design are typically smaller than those responsible for mechanical designs. This has the potential to create a time-to-market bottleneck that can be easily overcome by automating the product costing process. Key capabilities of the new PCBA costing module will include: Component Costing: - Automatically calculated for an entire BOM based on part lookup in centralized Component Library; Cost information will be stored within component library: Volume Discounting; and Company Negotiated Costs.


Barco Selects aPriori for Product Cost Management
Sep 28 16
aPriori has been selected by Barco. The company will implement aPriori’s software as part of a companywide value and cost engineering initiative focused on managing new product introductions at target cost and ensuring that parts and materials are being sourced at competitive market prices. Barco will make the software available to a core team of R&D engineers and procurement officers from each of its product groups including projectors, display solutions, hardware and peripherals. The implementation will involve facilities in Belgium, Germany, Norway and China. aPriori’s product cost management platform will provide Barco’s R&D teams with real-time cost estimates on parts and products in design. The software leverages CAD and intelligent cost models to quickly determine feasible manufacturing methods and product costs while generating detailed manufacturing analysis and cost estimates that quantify the impact of changes to product design, materials, manufacturing processes, volumes and location in real time. aPriori will also provide Barco procurement and sourcing teams with regional cost benchmarks based on the company’s specific product requirements, enabling it to collaborate more effectively with its suppliers.

Über uns

aPriori is a software company located in Concord, Massachusetts 
that develops and markets product cost management software. The company 
was founded in 2003. Since then, we have invested 150 man-years of 
development into our product and acquired numerous world class 
manufacturing corporations as customers. Launch New Products at or Below Target Cost
Even best-in-class manufacturing companies can miss their cost 
targets when launching new products. With aPriori, engineers can explore
 more design alternatives earlier in the development process without 
sacrificing schedules. Within seconds of making a design change, aPriori
 provides a real-time assessment of how the change has affected the cost
 of the part or product. With access to real-time product cost 
information, engineers make better decisions that prevent costs from 
being designed into new products while reducing the need for changes 
later in development – when making changes is incrementally more 
expensive. 
Never Overpay for Outsourced Parts
aPriori makes it possible for companies to ensure consistently 
optimal pricing for their outsourced parts and products. With aPriori’s 
real-time product cost information, sourcing professionals always know 
precisely how much a part or product “should cost” to produce. Access to
 precise “should cost” information enables sourcing experts to easily 
identify where they are overpaying for outsourced parts and to always 
negotiate the best deals with suppliers. The result is significant 
product cost savings en route to meeting (or surpassing) cost reduction 
goals. 
Maximize Cost Savings on Re-Design Work
For re-design projects, aPriori provides design engineers with 
instant cost feedback as they attempt to cost-reduce production parts. 
Designers can simply load parts to see what they cost today and then 
evaluate cost-saving, alternative designs using aPriori’s precise 
product cost information. Cost assessments are delivered in real-time as
 designs are modified, providing engineers with instant visibility into 
how the most recent change will impact overall cost. With aPriori, 
designers always know what it “should cost” to produce a design without 
having to wait for a formal cost estimate or supplier quote. As a 
result, engineers can evaluate more alternatives and make better 
decisions that ultimately result in lower product costs. 
Increase the Accuracy and Speed of RFQ Responses
OEMs are looking to outsource business to suppliers, but demand
