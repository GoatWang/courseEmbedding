When Your Commute Is 25,000 feet...SOLR™ Airborne Systems designs and manufactures a line of oxygen products for the most extreme HAHO and HALO missions, known as SOLR™.



 
jTrax Navaid™Navigation From Above The jTrax Navaid is a device worn on a jumper’s harness to aid in navigation to the intended Impact Point (IP). The Navaid improves safety and increases effectiveness of military jumpers by providing accurate navigation for even the most demanding missions.



 
What are combo drops? Combo drops are anytime a GPADS is used in conjunction with jumpers. The GPADS can either fly itself to the pre-programmed coordinates, or a jumper can manually steer it to the destination. This proves extremely helpful in covert missions, minimizing the amount of gear the jumper must carry.



 
Hi-5®OUR NEWEST CANOPY Airborne Systems has designed a revolutionary ram air parachute like no other.  Visit the Hi-5® page and watch the video to learn how we are changing the future of parachutes.



 
Intruder System (RA-1)Ram-Air Tactical Parachute Systems Superior glide performance for maximum offset and performance characteristics to minimize the potential for injury on landing.



 
The MicroFly II®Airborne Systems newest GPADS is available today. Improve military mission capabilities without compromising safety or increasing training requirements.

SOLR™ Oxygen Mask























SOLR™ Oxygen Mask
Overview
SpecificationsSpec SheetsRelated Products 

Overview



The SOLR™ Oxygen Mask builds on the reliability and strong features of its predecessor, the Airborne Systems’ PHAOS Oxygen Mask, the current reference for the Parachutist Oxygen Masks used by Military Units worldwide.
The SOLR™ Oxygen Mask is compatible with the new SOLR™ and legacy PHAOS Bailout Bottles. It is also compatible with the PHANTOM Bailout Bottle.
The SOLR™ Oxygen Mask provides the same performance and time proven reliability as the PHAOS Oxygen Mask, with the added benefit of new features developed based on input received from experiences collected over the years from the Military Free Fall community.
The SOLR™ Oxygen Mask features a new non-dilution oxygen demand regulator which delivers 100% oxygen during inhalation, both during pre-breathing and during the actual jump and descent under canopy.  This ensures that the jumper is never breathing a mix of gas and mitigates the risk of hypoxia, drastically increasing the safety of operation.  This breakthrough innovation is made possible thanks to the very high service pressure of Airborne Systems’ latest Bailout Bottles, allowing them to contain significantly more oxygen than traditional Bailout Bottles.
Key Features:

Lightweight
On demand regulator, no dilution (100% O2)
Modular (dilution module optional)
Compatible with SOLR / PHAOS / PHANTOM Bailout Bottles
5 sizes
Compatible with all parachutist helmets on the market
Easy maintenance

Intruder System (RA-1)

Suited for a novice in need of docile performance or an experienced pilot who demands performance extremes for mission success.

Intended for use during HALO or HAHO missions, the Intruder 360 main canopy incorporates a design developed by Airborne Systems that improves velocity and glide.
Pressurized stabilizers increase glide performance and improve performance in deep brakes by forcing the canopy to track forward without lateral slip. The pressurized stabilizers also render the canopy completely silent.

FlyClops 2K®
Overview
SpecificationsSpec SheetsRelated ProductsRelated Training 

Overview



One-time Use Cargo Delivery Parachute System
The FlyClops 2K is a unique, low-cost, one-time use Guided Precision Aerial Delivery System (GPADS) solution that eliminates recovery, maintenance and support requirements for payloads between 750-2200lb (340-998kg). The FlyClops 2K is a complete cargo delivery parachute system that is an alternative and low-cost option to our standard FireFly 2K system and includes:

One-time use GPADS
One time use 2K1T canopy

Once deployed, the system need not be recovered. The reduction in initial cost and the lifecycle resource savings provide added operational flexibility.
GPADS Capability

Supports operational payload between 700 – 2,200 lbs. (317.5 – 998 kg)
Lightweight, 77 lbs. (35 kg)
Max release altitude of 17,500 ft. (5334 m)
2K1T Canopy

Precision Airdrops Made Simple
FlyClops 2K® can glide up to 25 kilometers after being dropped, and will land within 150 meters of a designated Impact Point (IP). This horizontal and vertical separation between the delivery aircraft and the unit receiving supplies increases safety for the air crew and improves security for the receiving unit. The ability to autonomously deliver supplies reduces the need for vehicular traffic, reducing the logistical footprint and the number of convoys required to sustain a deployed force.
Reduce Cost, Improve Flexibility
The 2K1T parachute delivers the same high performance and capability as the 2K FireFly® parachute, but is designed to enable the soldier to cut the payload and guidance system free, leaving the parachute behind. Using the lower cost 2K1T parachute reduces the equipment cost of providing aerial supplies using GPADS should operational constraints dictate that the conventional FireFly® parachute cannot be recovered at the time. This option provides greater operational flexibility to commanders in the field.
Ease of Use
The FlyClops 2K® is delivered packed and ready for deployment, and requires only simple rigging to the payload.
Cargo Delivery Parachute Mission Planning
The FlyClops 2K® is compatible with the jTrax Mission Planner and the U.S. Air Force Consolidated Airdrop Tool Mission Planning Application (CAT MPA).

The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

Multivitamins and other supplements can help make up the difference and prevent vitamin and mineral deficiencies. They can also provide more nutrients than diet alone, which may help to protect against or manage certain diseases. Find out a little bit more about what your body needs to stay healthy. What are the most essential vitamins? The following list of vitamins are essential for the body to function properly: Vitamin A is needed for healthy eyes, skin and skeletal tissue. Vitamin B1 (thiamin) helps the body use up fat and produce energy. Vitamin B2 (riboflavin) is an antioxidant that protects the body s cells protect against free radical damage. Vitamin B3 (niacin) may reduce the risk of heart disease. Vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid) is important for hormone production, immune system health and energy. Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) helps protect the layer around cells. Vitamin B7 (biotin) aids the metabolism and promotes healthy skin, hair, nails and cells. Vitamin B9 (folate) is necessary for the proper functioning of the nervous system. Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) is essential for the production of healthy red blood and nerve cells. vitamin C is essential for the growth and repair of body tissue. Vitamin D helps with calcium absorption and helps build healthy bones and optimal immune function. Vitamin E protects against free radicals and may also boost the immune system. Vitamin K may help the blood to clot and prevent excessive bleeding while keeping your heart healthy and your bones strong. Choline is important for liver function, nerve function and muscle movement. Optimize your immune system Your immune system serves to protect your body against infection and disease. What you put into our body affects your immune system, and a lack of selected micronutrients can lead to immune deficiency. Vitamins A, C and E help maintain the lining of the respiratory and digestive tracts, which acts as a barrier against infection. Vitamin D works with certain white blood cells which are important to the immune system s ability to fight off infection and disease. Selenium acts as an antioxidant to help fight infection and protect the body against oxygen free radical damage. Probiotics help to maintain the integrity of the lining of the intestines, which help to boost immunity. Omega 3 fatty acids are essential for reducing inflammation. Some people have a higher risk of vitamin and mineral deficiencies. If you've lost weight recently, you may be deficient in a wide range of vitamins and minerals. Be sure to start taking a high-quality multivitamin and mineral supplement. These popular supplements come in a wide variety of forms: pills, capsules, chewable tablets, gummies, drinks (liquids and powders) and more. With so many options, it should be easy to find one that works for you. Vegetarians and vegans If you're a vegetarian, you may have deficiencies in protein, vitamin B12, iron, vitamin D, zinc, iodine, riboflavin, calcium and selenium. Vegans are especially likely to be low in protein, selenium and B12. In addition to a multivitamin and mineral supplement, you might want to consider adding a vegan-friendly protein shake or two to your daily regimen. There are a wide variety of shake powders on the market, typically available in, but not limited to, vanilla, chocolate and strawberry flavors. One scoop of protein powder usually provides approximately 25 grams of protein, but it varies from one supplier to another. Macrobiotic diet If you're on a macrobiotic diet, which is fixed on ideas about the types of food drawn from Zen Buddhism, you may be deficient in vitamin B12, iron, vitamin D and other nutrients. The goal as a macrobiotic is to bring enlightenment, or healthy well-being, by teaching you how to thoughtfully choose what you eat. But it may come at a cost of some important vitamins. As with vegetarians and vegans, consider a solid multivitamin as a nutritional supplement. More support for seniors Seniors living in their own homes are often deficient in vitamin D, vitamin A, vitamin E, calcium and zinc and occasionally vitamin B1 and vitamin B2. Older adults need more calcium and vitamin D to help maintain bone health. Try three daily servings of vitamin D-fortified low-fat or fat-free milk or yogurt. Other calcium-rich foods include fortified cereals and fruit juices, dark green leafy vegetables and canned fish. These are all great additions to your daily meals, but be sure to take a multivitamin with age-adjusted doses of nutrients for people aged 50 years and older. Workout warriors For those who like to workout with weights, supplements can aid the recovery process and build muscle. Strength training on a regular basis breaks down your muscles so they can grow back bigger and stronger. Be sure to have a solid meal plan, get plenty of rest between workouts, lots of water and consider a protein supplement in the form of powders that can be mixed or protein bars. You can also add creatine to help build muscle and a variety of other workout supplements to assist with your fitness goals. At Walmart, you'll find a wide selection of vitamins and other supplements to help you keep up with your nutritional needs. Save money.

Multivitamins and other supplements can help make up the difference and prevent vitamin and mineral deficiencies. They can also provide more nutrients than diet alone, which may help to protect against or manage certain diseases. Find out a little bit more about what your body needs to stay healthy. What are the most essential vitamins? The following list of vitamins are essential for the body to function properly: Vitamin A is needed for healthy eyes, skin and skeletal tissue. Vitamin B1 (thiamin) helps the body use up fat and produce energy. Vitamin B2 (riboflavin) is an antioxidant that protects the body s cells protect against free radical damage. Vitamin B3 (niacin) may reduce the risk of heart disease. Vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid) is important for hormone production, immune system health and energy. Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) helps protect the layer around cells. Vitamin B7 (biotin) aids the metabolism and promotes healthy skin, hair, nails and cells. Vitamin B9 (folate) is necessary for the proper functioning of the nervous system. Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) is essential for the production of healthy red blood and nerve cells. vitamin C is essential for the growth and repair of body tissue. Vitamin D helps with calcium absorption and helps build healthy bones and optimal immune function. Vitamin E protects against free radicals and may also boost the immune system. Vitamin K may help the blood to clot and prevent excessive bleeding while keeping your heart healthy and your bones strong. Choline is important for liver function, nerve function and muscle movement. Optimize your immune system Your immune system serves to protect your body against infection and disease. What you put into our body affects your immune system, and a lack of selected micronutrients can lead to immune deficiency. Vitamins A, C and E help maintain the lining of the respiratory and digestive tracts, which acts as a barrier against infection. Vitamin D works with certain white blood cells which are important to the immune system s ability to fight off infection and disease. Selenium acts as an antioxidant to help fight infection and protect the body against oxygen free radical damage. Probiotics help to maintain the integrity of the lining of the intestines, which help to boost immunity. Omega 3 fatty acids are essential for reducing inflammation. Some people have a higher risk of vitamin and mineral deficiencies. If you've lost weight recently, you may be deficient in a wide range of vitamins and minerals. Be sure to start taking a high-quality multivitamin and mineral supplement.
