(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis also contains forward-looking statements and should be read in conjunction with the disclosures and information contained in "Disclosures Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" and "Risk Factors" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. References to "we," "our," "us," "the Company," or "root9B Technologies" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K refer to root9B Technologies, Inc. "SEC" refers to the Securities and Exchange Commission. All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal year, which ends on December 31.  Results of Operations Our results of operations for 2015, 2014, and 2013 are highlighted in the table below and discussed in the following paragraphs: Years Ended December 31 % of Net % of Net % of Net 2015 Revenue 2014 Revenue 2013 Revenue Net Revenue $ 29,358,429 $ 20,175,488 $ 26,399,916 Operating Expenses: Cost of revenues 22,925,136 78.1 % 14,982,996 74.3 % 20,845,516 79.0 % Selling, general & administrative 17,446,270 59.4 % 11,184,909 55.4 % 9,214,410 34.9 % Depreciation and amortization 1,600,246 5.5 % 386,282 1.9 % 380,951 1.4 % Energy repositioning and subcontract obligation - 0.0 % 1,162,089 5.8 % - 0.0 % Acquisition related costs 649,442 2.2 % - 0.0 % - 0.0 % Total operating expenses 42,621,094 145.2 % 27,716,276 137.4 % 30,440,877 115.3 % Loss from Operations (13,262,665 ) -45.2 % (7,540,788 ) -37.4 % (4,040,961 ) -15.3 % Other Income (Expense): Derivative (expense) income 3,644,594 12.4 % (10,344,753 ) -51.3 % 2,149,951 8.1 % Adjustment to estimates recorded at acquisition - 0.0 % - 0.0 % 431,919 1.6 % Interest expense, net (793,289 ) -2.7 % (59,066 ) -0.3 % (44,270 ) -0.2 % Goodwill impairment - 0.0 % (6,363,630 ) -31.5 % (4,472,089 ) -16.9 % Intangibles impairment - 0.0 % (429,394 ) -2.1 % (238,803 ) -0.9 % Other income (expense) (166,583 ) -0.6 % 301,065 1.5 % 87,799 0.3 % Total other income (expense) 2,684,722 9.1 % (16,895,778 ) -83.7 % (2,085,493 ) -7.9 % Loss Before Income Taxes (10,577,943 ) -36.0 % (24,436,566 ) -121.1 % (6,126,454 ) -23.2 % Income Tax Benefit 2,239,917 7.6 % - 0.0 % - 0.0 % Net Loss (8,338,026 ) -28.4 % (24,436,566 ) -121.1 % (6,126,454 ) -23.2 % Preferred Stock Dividends (406,372 ) -1.4 % (1,597,356 ) -7.9 % (1,280,408 ) -4.9 % Deemed Dividend On Preferred Stock - 0.0 % - 0.0 % (509,184 ) -1.9 % Net Loss Available to Common Stockholders $ (8,744,398 ) -29.8 % $ (26,033,922 ) -129.0 % $ (7,916,046 ) -30.0 %  Comparison of 2015 to 2014  The result of operations described below includes the Cyber Solutions ("CS"), Business Advisory Solutions ("BAS") and the Energy Solutions ("ES") segments for the entire years of 2015 and 2014. We acquired IPSA International, Inc. on February 9, 2015 and this new business is included in the BAS segment as of the acquisition date.  Net Revenue Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $29,358,429 as compared to $20,175,488 for the year ended December 31, 2014, a net increase of $9,182,941, or 45.5%. Revenue by segment was as follows: Year Ended December 31st 2015 2014 % growth Cyber Solutions $ 2,975,583 $ 4,076,050 -27.0 % IPSA/Business Advisory Solutions: Without IPSA 8,107,977 12,964,920 -37.5 % IPSA 16,480,226 - nm Total IPSA/ BAS 24,588,203 12,964,920 89.7 % Energy Solutions 1,794,643 3,134,518 -42.7 % Total Revenue $ 29,358,429 $ 20,175,488 45.5 %  Cyber Solutions Segment  Revenue for the CS segment for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased 27.0% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The primary reason for the decline in revenue is due to revenue from hardware re-sales in 2014, in the amount of approximately $1,600,000 which was not repeated during 2015. Revenue for this line of business (hardware re-sales) is significantly lower in 2015 as compared to 2014 and it is being discontinued. The CS segment has operated as an early stage business. We believe that the Company's products and service offerings represent a disruptive technology and our efforts have been focused on gaining acceptance in the marketplace. The Company believes that its products and service offerings provide unique and significant benefits over the existing products, and while we have expanded our sales efforts and continue to enhance our product offerings, no assurance can be given as to if and when our products will receive broad acceptance in the marketplace.  IPSA/Business Advisory Solutions Segment  Revenue for the IPSA/BAS segment for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased 89.7% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The large increase is due to the acquisition of IPSA on February 9, 2015. Revenue for the this segment, excluding the contribution of the IPSA acquisition, for the year ended December 31, 2015, decreased 37.5% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The decline in revenue for the BAS segment was mainly due to a significant decline in revenue from four large customers as well as the impact of five projects that were active and completed during 2014, which was not fully offset by revenue from new customers in 2015. Our sales efforts have not been effective in replacing revenue reductions from existing customers. Revenue due to the IPSA acquisition during the year ended December 31, 2015 was $16,480,226 and was entirely incremental. The competitive environment has sharpened significantly as more companies have entered this line of business, including those who use off shore labor and indirect sourcing and provide services at significantly lower rates. The Company continues to evaluate it's pricing and service delivery processes to respond to this new market condition.  Energy and Controls Solutions Segment  Revenue for the ES segment for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased 42.7% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. As a part of the Company's shift in strategy and repositioning that was announced in September 2014, the Company decided to de-emphasize the energy business and, as a result the assets of the energy audit business were sold in the first quarter of 2015. This shift in the energy business is and may continue to be a primary reason for the decline in revenue.  Gross Margin  Gross margin (revenue less cost of revenues, defined as all costs for billable staff for the IPSA/BAS segment and cost of goods for the ES and CS segments) increased to $6,433,293 for 2015 from $5,192,492 for 2014, an increase of $1,240,801 or 23.9%. The main reason for the increase in gross margin was the acquisition of IPSA on February 9, 2015. Gross margin for 2015 excluding the contribution from the acquisition of IPSA was $728,870, a net decrease of $4,463,622 when compared to 2014. Gross margin, as a percentage of revenue, decreased to 21.9% in 2015 from 25.7% in 2014.  The main reasons for the decreased gross margin are: i) increased expenditures in revenue related resources and staffing in the Cyber Solutions segment, ii) expansion of the cyber proprietary platform, which were charged to cost of revenues, iii) a decrease in gross margin contribution associated with 2014 CS hardware sales not repeated in 2015, and iv) Energy Solutions revenue reductions greater than an associated reduction in cost of revenue expenses.  On a segment basis, the gross margin percentage increased in the BAS segment to 31.1% in 2015 from 27.0% in 2014, decreased in the ES segment to 7.8% in 2015 from 18.3% in 2014, and with the investment in people and resources in advance of revenue, decreased in the CS segment to -45.9% in 2015 from 27.6% in 2014.  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses increased to $17,446,270 in 2015 from $11,184,909 in 2014, an increase of 56.0%. SG&A expenses for 2015 excluding the impact from the acquisition of IPSA were $11,730,023, an increase of $545,114 when compared to 2014, or 4.9%. As a percentage of revenue, SG&A expenses increased to 59.5% in 2015 as compared to 55.4% in 2014. SG&A expenses increased $6,261,361 during 2015 as compared to 2014 and break out as follows:  Cyber Segment  SG&A expenses in the CS segment were $2,786,314 in 2015 as compared to $1,130,601 in 2014, an increase of $1,655,713. The increase is primarily due to increased labor costs of approximately $830,000, increased travel expense of $290,000, increased rent expense of $220,000 and increased professional fees of $147,000. Labor costs and travel expense increased during 2015 as the Company continues to invest in and build out CS resources and expertise as the Company positions this segment for future growth. Rent expense increased as the Company leased three new office/training facilities during 2015 and professional fees increased due to higher marketing costs. CS expenses as a percentage of segment revenue increased to 93.6% in 2015 from 27.7% in 2014.  IPSA/BAS Segment  SG&A expenses in the BAS segment increased to $7,135,061 in 2015 as compared to $2,085,476 in 2014, an increase of $5,049,585 or 242.1%. The increase is attributable to the incremental expenses due to the acquisition of IPSA which were $5,716,247. BAS expenses as a percentage of segment revenue increased to 29.1% in 2015 from 16.1% in 2014.  ES Segment  SG&A expenses in the ES segment decreased to $840,823 in 2015 as compared to $1,874,589 in 2014, a decrease of $1,033,766 or 55.1%. The decrease is primarily attributable to reduced labor costs of approximately $703,000. The decrease in labor costs is due to planned reductions in the labor force as the Company's shifted its strategy and de-emphasized the energy segment. ES expenses as a percentage of segment revenue decreased to 46.9% in 2015 from 59.8% in 2014.  Corporate Overhead  Corporate Overhead SG&A expenses increased to $6,684,072 in 2015 from $6,094,243 in 2014, an increase of $589,829 or 9.7%. The main drivers of the increase were increases in professional fees of $575,000 and stock option expenses of $370,000. Those increases were offset by a decrease in labor costs of $440,000. The increase in professional fees is primarily due to higher legal and accounting fees as well as increased public relations and advisory fees. The increase in stock option expense was primarily due to the increase in the valuations of the options issued in 2015 as compared to those issued in 2014. The decrease in labor costs was primarily due to a reduction in bonus expense for senior executives.  Energy repositioning and subcontract obligation  During 2014, the Company incurred one-time charges of approximately $1,162,000 related to two items: 1) the repositioning of the Company to accentuate an increased focus and commitment to cybersecurity and regulatory risk mitigation and 2) recording a liability where the Company is alleged to have signed as a co-indemnitor with Prime Solutions, Inc. which is a subcontractor to Honeywell on a solar project, which items are explained below.  On October 17, 2014, the Company announced it would reposition the business to focus on cyber security and regulatory risk mitigation, rename the Company "root9B Technologies, Inc.", and de-emphasize the ES segment by adjusting its focus to operate in support of the Cyber Solutions and IPSA/Business Advisory Solutions segments. As a part of this repositioning the Company reduced headcount in the ES segment and incurred one-time expenses of $412,000 related to the headcount adjustments.  Platte River has alleged that the Company signed as a co-indemnitor in support of surety bonds issued by Platte River on behalf of Prime Solutions for the benefit of Honeywell pursuant to Prime Solutions, Inc.'s ("Prime") solar project located in Worcester Massachusetts (the "Prime Contract"). The Company filed its answer to the complaint relating to this action denying the allegations of Platte River. On February 1, 2016, the Company received a demand letter from Platte River for immediate payment of an $868,617 claim under the terms of the co-indemnity agreement. The Company continues to deny the allegations and will not agree to the demand. The Company's maximum liability exposure under the bond is $1,412,544, if Prime fails to meet its contracted obligations. In October 2014, the Company determined it was probable that Prime would fail to meet its contracted obligations under the Prime Contract, and therefore, that the potential existed that the Company may have to meet outstanding Prime Contract obligations. The Company has evaluated the status of the project, amounts paid to date on the contract and assessed the remaining work to be performed. Notwithstanding the demand letter from Platte River, the Company continues to believe its potential obligation under the Prime Contract is approximately $650,000, and that amount was accrued as a Selling, general and administrative expense on the Consolidated Statement of Operations during 2014. The Company intends to vigorously defend this litigation.  Acquisition related costs  On February 6, 2015, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with IPSA International, Inc. ("IPSA"). On February 9, 2015, the Company and IPSA consummated and closed the Merger. During 2015, the Company incurred legal, accounting and advisory fees of $649,442 related to the merger transaction.  Other Income (Expense)  Other Income (Expense) for 2015 resulted in income of $2,684,722 as compared to an expense of $16,895,788 in 2014. The components of the net income/expense are discussed below.  Derivative (expense) income  From May 2010 through the first quarter of 2013, the Company issued Series B Preferred Stock, Debentures, Series C Preferred Stock, 7% Convertible Redeemable Promissory Notes, and Series D Preferred Stock, all with detachable common stock purchase warrants deemed to be derivative instruments. Additionally, a contingent value right was issued as a part of the merger agreement with IPSA International, Inc. and this right was also deemed to be a derivative instrument. These warrants and the contingent value right are recorded as derivative liabilities and "marked-to-market" based on fair value estimates at each reporting date. Collectively, these derivatives were valued at an estimated fair value of $3,540,084 at December 31, 2015, with the change (decrease) in value since December 31, 2014 of $3,644,594, being recognized as derivative (non-cash) income on the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015. For the year ended December 31, 2014, the change in derivative valuation for the like period was non-cash expense of $10,344,753.  Interest Expense  Interest expense increased to $793,289 in 2015 as compared to $59,066 in 2014. The Company's IPSA subsidiary sells certain of its accounts receivable with full recourse to Advance Payroll Funding Ltd. ("Advance"). Fees charged to the Company from this factoring arrangement with Advance for accounts receivable sold with full recourse include an administrative fee that is incurred upon funding of the factored invoices to the Company and a closing fee that is incurred when payment of the original accounts receivable amount is paid to the factoring company by the Company's customer. Administrative and closing fees from the factoring arrangement are included in interest expense in the consolidated financial statements. During 2015 interest expense related to this arrangement was approximately $467,837 and completely incremental as compared to 2014. Additionally, during 2015, the Company incurred interest expense of approximately $320,458 related to the outstanding convertible notes, which compares to $26,278 during 2014.  Goodwill impairment  An annual goodwill impairment evaluation for 2015 was performed as prescribed by FASB ASC 350. No impairment charge was recorded as a result of the evaluation. An annual goodwill impairment evaluation for 2014 was performed by applying both the Step 1 and Step 2 tests as prescribed by FASB ASC 350. The results of the Step 1 test for the BAS segment indicated no impairment to goodwill related to this segment and Step 2 was not required. The results for the Step 1 test for the ES segment did indicate impairment of goodwill and Step 2 was completed to determine the amount of impairment. The Company engaged an outside firm that specializes in valuation assessments to perform the Step 1 and Step 2 tests and valuation work. Of the $10,715,807 in goodwill that was recorded as of December 31, 2013, $6,363,630 was attributable to the ES segment. After completion of the valuation work of the segment it was determined that the fair value of the goodwill for the ES segment was $0, resulting in a non-cash impairment charge of $6,363,630. The impairment was due primarily to the slower than planned growth in revenue, earnings and cash flow as well as the repositioning of the Company to focus on cyber security and regulatory risk mitigation while deemphasizing the energy business. See further discussion on goodwill and goodwill impairment in Note 7 to the Financial Statements.  Intangibles impairment  There was no impairment charge related to intangible assets during 2015. As a part of the acquisitions of GHH and Ecological, both in 2012, the Company recorded intangible assets for the acquired customer lists and trade names of both companies. The value at acquisition of these assets was $1,118,000 and they were being amortized over 5 to 7 years. The balance at December 31, 2014 prior to impairment was $429,000. The estimates of future revenue, income and cash flow were reduced from prior estimates and the Company shifted its strategy to focus on cyber security and regulatory risk mitigation while deemphasizing the energy segment. Based on the revised strategy and estimates, we measured the fair value of the intangible assets as of December 31, 2014 and determined the fair value for each of these intangible assets to be $0, resulting in a non-cash impairment charge of $429,000 during the year ended December 31, 2014.  Other income (expense)  Other income (expense) decreased to an expense of $166,583 in 2015 as compared to income of $301,065 in 2014. The expense during 2015 is primarily due to realized and unrealized currency translation gains. Additionally, during 2015, the Company sold some assets from its Energy Solutions segment which resulted in a realized gain of approximately $85,000 and is included in other income. During 2014, the Company entered into an agreement with the landlord for the New York office where it was agreed that the Company would vacate the office space at the end of 2014, which was earlier than the lease term, and in exchange incurred no rent expense during 2014. As a result of this agreement, the Company recorded a gain related to the early termination of the contract of $239,248 in 2014, which was included in other income.  Income Tax Benefit (Expense)  The Company had an income tax benefit for 2015 of $2,239,917, compared to $0 of income tax expense for 2014. The effective tax rate was 21.2% in 2015 and 0.0% in 2014.  As a part of the purchase price allocation for the IPSA acquisition, the Company recorded net deferred tax assets, which were recorded on IPSA's books at the time of acquisition, of approximately $556,000. In connection with the purchase price allocation, the Company recorded a deferred tax liability of approximately $2,842,000, with a corresponding increase to goodwill, for the tax effect of the acquired identifiable intangible assets from IPSA. This liability was recorded as there will be no future tax deductions related to the acquired intangibles but they will be amortized as described above for financial reporting purposes.  Prior to the acquisition, the Company had determined that it was more likely than not that some portion or all of its deferred tax assets would not be realized and therefore had recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of its deferred tax assets (which were $7,543,910 at December 31, 2014). Upon the acquisition, the Company evaluated the likelihood that the acquired deferred tax assets and liabilities would be realized and as a result of that evaluation, recorded an increase to the valuation allowance of approximately $474,000 related to the acquired deferred tax assets and recorded a reduction to the valuation allowance of approximately $2,842,000 related to the deferred tax liability associated with the acquired identifiable intangible assets. The net amount of these two adjustments to the Company's valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets was approximately $2,368,000 and is included in the income tax benefit on the Company's consolidated statement of operations for year ended December 31, 2015.  Preferred Stock Dividends  The Company has two series of Convertible Preferred Stock which pay dividends at annual specified rates. The two series are: Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, which has a 7% dividend rate, and the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, which has a 8% dividend rate. See further discussion on the Convertible Preferred Stock in Note 11 to the Financial Statements. Dividends paid during 2015, which were paid in common stock, were valued at issuance as follows: to Series B, 36,369 shares valued at $56,372 and to Series C, 225,807 shares valued at $350,000. Dividends paid during 2014, which were paid in common stock, were valued at issuance as follows: to Series B, 98,003 shares valued at $56,372, to Series C, 603,448 shares valued at $350,000 and to Series D, 1,592,748 shares valued at $1,190,984.  Comparison of 2014 to 2013  The result of operations described below includes the Business Advisory Solutions ("BAS") segment and the Energy Solutions ("ES") segment for the entire years of 2014 and 2013. We acquired root9B, LLC on November 22, 2013, and the results of operations for the Cyber Solutions ("CS") segment are for the full year of 2014 and only the period from November 22, 2013 to December 31, 2013 is included in 2013.  Net Revenue Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $20,175,488 as compared to $26,399,916 for the year ended December 31, 2013, a net decrease of $6,224,428, or 23.6%. Revenue by segment was as follows: Year Ended December 31st 2014 2013 % growth Business Advisory Solutions Revenue $ 12,964,920 $ 14,482,476 -10.5 % Energy Solutions Revenue $ 3,134,518 $ 11,908,690 -73.7 % Cyber Solutions Revenue $ 4,076,050 $ 8,750 nm Total Revenue $ 20,175,488 $ 26,399,916 -23.6 %  Business Advisory Solutions Segment  Revenue for the BAS segment for the year ended December 31, 2014 decreased 10.5% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. Revenue for the BAS segment was below the Company's plans for mid-to-high single digit revenue growth and was mainly due to a significant decline in revenue from two large customers as well as the impact of three projects that were completed during 2013 and the related revenue was not fully offset by revenue from new customers in 2014.  Energy Solutions Segment  Revenue for the ES segment for the year ended December 31, 2014 decreased 73.7% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. There are two key reasons for the decline in revenue. First, the Company had two significant contracts during 2013 that generated approximately $7.6 million of revenue and did not have similar large sized projects during 2014. Second, the ES segment had a significant amount of revenue in 2013 related to the implementation of auto demand response (ADR) systems in California. During 2013, the state of California altered the ADR program and incentives to corporations for implementing these type of energy saving systems and as a result the demand for this business has dropped significantly. During 2014, the Company had no revenue from ADR systems work. In light of the Company's repositioning effort and strategy adjustment as well as lower than planned revenue growth in the ES segment, the energy business changed its deliverables based on current capabilities and opportunities to have a more narrow focus going forward on controls and automation.  Cyber Solutions Segment  Revenue for the CS segment for the year ended December 31, 2014, which is generated from cyber security advisory and technical services, was approximately $4,076,000, and was almost entirely incremental as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, and is attributable to the acquisition of root9B, LLC. The CS segment was formed upon the acquisition of root9B, LLC in November 2013, and . . .  Mar 30, 2016  (c) 1995-2016 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved
