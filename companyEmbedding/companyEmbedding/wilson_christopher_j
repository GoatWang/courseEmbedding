Designby Chris Wilson | Leave a Comment  Tweet Pin Share
If you’ve seen my English teaching blog recently you might have noticed the change in design. As I’ve mentione
d in the past this was partly due to getting a new theme on my blog (standard v.3) but also it was inspired by the arrival of the Olympics and Team GB’s colour and font set.
I’ve based my header around the font ITC Avant grant gothic and the colours are mainly white, red and blue with some black involved as well. I’ve also been trying to include a warn effect and retro aspects, paying tribute to the 1908 and 1948 olympics. 
I’m thinking of applying the same affects to this blog but would love your thoughts first before I go ahead and do that, at the moment the only design element I actually have on here that is different from the standard theme is the background which was a royalty free wallpaper!
I also have a new website coming up (more to come soon) which I am currently planning to run using similar styling (keeping uniformity across projects) This is unless I receiving any negative comments about the current scheme.
Much of this has been inspired by Dustin W Scott of Dustn.TV who is currently running a series on blog design as well as his equally good series on “things he couldn’t say as a youth pastor in a church.” Well worth checking out.
I have a few random slightly disconnected thoughts about various things that have arisen out of these experiments in design.
1. “[Design] perfection isn’t achieved when there is nothing left to add. But when there is nothing left to take away.” Antoine De Saint-Exupery
Could this be said of life as well as design? After all the Christian life is about dying to ourselves, picking up our cross and being used by God on earth.
2. Design and colours can highlight or play down things.
When thinking about design it’s amazing how a dash of colour can make people feel certain emotions or draw eyes to where you want. Sometimes this can be used to get people to ignore how rubbish something is, on other occasions it can highlight really great features. This means you can play to your strengths (both with blogs and with teaching handouts)
3.People still judge books (and blogs) by their covers.
You can have the best substance in the world but loads of people will ignore it if it looks crap. This doesn’t mean that you need to have a trendy brand, and tell people if they do x attractive people will find them attractive and their life will be amazing. Instead taking some care and attention shows that the product had attention given to it.
My concern with this is that we get lured in by rubbish masquerading as something good (and this isn’t just products but with people as well) and that what is on the inside is more important. However, pay some care to our presentation isn’t always the worst thing, showing we care about things can be important.
I’m sure there is much more that could be mentioned about Design (hence why there are many books, blogs, courses etc on the topic!) but these are a couple of thoughts I had going round in my head.
I hope you like the few pictures I have up in the next week and a half I should have an exciting new project to talk about on here. So I’ll ask you,
What has been exciting in your life recently?
P.S. I have included some affiliate links to my blog theme and web host in the sidebar as I really think they are both great products. Not for everyone, of course, for many people a free, hosted, blog is better than a paid for self-hosted one but I thought I’d just point them out whilst I talk about design.
