Leadership





Diane Morais

Diane Morais joined Ally Financial in 2008, and currently has oversight for consumer and commercial banking products. Her responsibilities include the company’s Deposits, Mortgage, Online Brokerage and Wealth Management and Corporate Finance businesses, as well as   oversight for Ally’s digital strategies.
As President, Consumer & Commercial Banking Products, Morais has responsibility for the strategic direction and profitability of the deposits franchise, product innovation and pricing, customer service, and ensuring all activities are consistent with high standards of safety and soundness.  Under her leadership, Ally Bank has achieved double-digit retail deposit growth each year since the bank was launched in 2009.  The bank now has more than 1.2 million customers, and it has received numerous third-party accolades, including being named Best Online Bank by Money® Magazine for five consecutive years and by Kiplinger Personal Finance for three years.  Morais also led the expansion of two new products in 2016, the Ally CashBack Credit Card and Ally Home, the bank’s direct-to-consumer mortgage business.
In addition to Ally Bank, Morais has responsibility for the Online Brokerage and Wealth Management business Ally acquired through its April 2016 acquisition of TradeKing, Inc., including oversight of the integration and rebranding of the business under Ally.  The addition of investing and wealth management significantly broadens the portfolio of personal finance options Ally has to offer to provide consumers with a cohesive approach to managing their savings and investment alternatives, while benefitting from the bank’s competitive rates and innovative deposit products.
Prior to holding key leadership positions of increasing responsibility at Ally, Morais achieved a number of significant professional accomplishments in the financial services sector.  During a career spanning twelve years at Bank of America, she served as the deposit and debit products executive, national customer experience executive, card services marketing, and consumer mortgage vendor management executive.  Morais also spent nine years at Citibank’s credit card division in a variety of marketing, risk and finance roles.
Morais holds a bachelor’s degree from Pennsylvania State University.  In September 2015, Morais was named to American Banker Magazine’s ‘25 Women to Watch’ list, and in September 2016, she was ranked #12 on the publication’s ‘25 Most Powerful Women in Banking’ list.  The rankings recognize the professional achievements, personal tenacity and overall influence of the industry’s top-performing female executives.

This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

Diane Morais




Ally Bank President, Consumer and Commercial Banking Products





Diane Morais joined Ally Financial in 2008, and currently has oversight for consumer and commercial banking products. Her responsibilities include the company’s Deposits, Mortgage, Online Brokerage and Wealth Management and Corporate Finance businesses, as well as   oversight for Ally’s digital strategies.

As President, Consumer & Commercial Banking Products, Morais has responsibility for the strategic direction and profitability of the deposits franchise, product innovation and pricing, customer service, and ensuring all activities are consistent with high standards of safety and soundness.  Under her leadership, Ally Bank has achieved double-digit retail deposit growth each year since the bank was launched in 2009.  The bank now has more than 1.2 million customers, and it has received numerous third-party accolades, including being named Best Online Bank by Money® Magazine for five consecutive years and by Kiplinger Personal Finance for three years.  Morais also led the expansion of two new products in 2016, the Ally CashBack Credit Card and Ally Home, the bank’s direct-to-consumer mortgage business.

In addition to Ally Bank, Morais has responsibility for the Online Brokerage and Wealth Management business Ally acquired through its April 2016 acquisition of TradeKing, Inc., including oversight of the integration and rebranding of the business under Ally.  The addition of investing and wealth management significantly broadens the portfolio of personal finance options Ally has to offer to provide consumers with a cohesive approach to managing their savings and investment alternatives, while benefitting from the bank’s competitive rates and innovative deposit products.

Prior to holding key leadership positions of increasing responsibility at Ally, Morais achieved a number of significant professional accomplishments in the financial services sector.  During a career spanning twelve years at Bank of America, she served as the deposit and debit products executive, national customer experience executive, card services marketing, and consumer mortgage vendor management executive.  Morais also spent nine years at Citibank’s credit card division in a variety of marketing, risk and finance roles.

Morais holds a bachelor’s degree from Pennsylvania State University.  In September 2015, Morais was named to American Banker Magazine’s ‘25 Women to Watch’ list, and in September 2016, she was ranked #12 on the publication’s ‘25 Most Powerful Women in Banking’ list.  The rankings recognize the professional achievements, personal tenacity and overall influence of the industry’s top-performing female executives.
