Guggenheim Investments ETFs may not be suitable for all investors. • Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate so that when shares are redeemed, they may be worth more or less than original cost. Most investors will also incur customary brokerage commissions when buying or selling shares of an ETF. • Investments in securities and derivatives, in general, are subject to market risks that may cause their prices to fluctuate over time. • ETF Shares may trade below their net asset value ("NAV"). The NAV of shares will fluctuate with changes in the market value of an ETF's holdings. In addition, there can be no assurance that an active trading market for shares will develop or be maintained. • Please review a prospectus carefully for more information of the risks associated with each ETF.

Investment Objective
Guggenheim Insider Sentiment ETF (NFO) seeks investment results that correspond generally to the performance, before the fund’s fees and expenses, of the Nasdaq US Insider Sentiment Index.


Index Description
The Nasdaq US Insider Sentiment Index is designed to provide exposure to U.S. companies within the Nasdaq US Large Mid Cap Index (which consists of approximately 900 stocks) which exhibit high degrees of corporate insider buying. The universe of securities is screened by a series of three factors—increase in average shares held by corporate insiders, and a combination of positive share price momentum and lower share price volatility. The 100 highest-ranking securities, subject to industry weight constraints, are selected for inclusion in the Index and an equal weighting methodology is applied.


Fund Highlights

Corporate Insider Insights. Seeks to provide exposure to companies with a high degree of corporate insider buying.
Multi-Factor Approach. Adds momentum and volatility to an insider buying screen to identify companies with attractive share price characteristics.
Equal Weighted. Provides equal weight exposure to all stocks in the index, which may result in a more balanced and diversified portfolio.

Index Methodology


                             
Effective October 24, 2016, Guggenheim Insider Sentiment ETF (NFO) changed its benchmark index to the Guggenheim Nasdaq US Insider Sentiment Index from the Sabrient Insider Sentiment Index.
The Index Provider selects securities for the Index using a rules-based selection criteria designed to increase the Index’s exposure, relative to the starting universe, to securities that reflect favorable corporate insider buying trends by considering the following factors:

Insider Buying Trends. Increases in average shares of a company held by corporate insiders are evaluated by calculating the average shares held by corporate insiders over a trailing 12-month period and comparing that average to the average number of shares held by corporate insiders over a 13 to 24-month period.
Momentum. Momentum is calculated based on each company's one-month, three-month, six-month, nine-month and twelve-month returns.
Volatility. Volatility reflects the degree of fluctuation in a company’s share price and it is calculated based on a company's trailing one-year share price fluctuation.
	Eligible securities are ranked based on the above three factors and the top 100 ranking securities are selected for inclusion in the Index. The Index is also subject to industry specific constraints. The Index is evaluated and rebalanced semi-annually. As of September 30, 2016, the Index was comprised of approximately 100 securities.








 Risks and Other Considerations


Performance displayed represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate so that when shares are redeemed, they may be worth more or less than original cost. Total returns reflect the reinvestment of all dividends. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. For up-to-date fund performance, including performance current to the most recent month-end, please visit the ETF performance page.  ETFs are subject to third party transaction fees/commissions. Net asset value (NAV) is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from total assets, then dividing by the number of shares outstanding. Market close is the last price at which shares are traded. Fund shares may trade at, above or below NAV. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.
Performance results for periods under one year are short - term and may not provide an adequate basis for evaluating the performance potential of the fund over varying market conditions or economic cycles.
Guggenheim Insider Sentiment ETF is subject to risks and may not be suitable for all investors. Investing involves risk and special consideration, including the possible loss of principal. There are no assurances that the fund will achieve its investment objective and/or strategy. Investments in large- and mid-capitalization stocks may underperform other segments of the equity market or the equity market as a whole. The fund may hold the securities of non-U.S. companies in the form of ADRs, which are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that may affect the value of the fund’s portfolio. The value of the securities underlying the ADRs may change materially when the U.S. markets are not open for trading. Investments in the underlying foreign securities also involve political and economic risks distinct from those associated with investing in the securities of U.S. issuers. Investing in real estate securities (which include REITs) may subject the fund to risks associated with the direct ownership of real estate, and risks inherent in operating and financing a limited number of projects. The fund may be adversely affected by events or developments negatively impacting the real estate sector or issuers within the real estate sector. The fund may be adversely affected by events or developments negatively impacting the utilities sector or issuers within the utilities sector. The fund is not actively managed which means the fund would not necessarily sell a security because the security’s issuer was in financial trouble unless that security is removed from the Index. In addition, the fund will not otherwise take defensive positions in declining markets unless such positions are reflected in the Index. Non-correlation risk refers to the risk that the Advisor may not be able to cause the fund’s performance to match or correlate to that of the fund’s underlying index, either on a daily or aggregate basis. Shares may trade below their net asset value (“NAV”). The NAV of shares will fluctuate with changes in the market value of the fund’s holdings. In addition, although the fund’s shares are currently listed on NYSE Arca, Inc. (the “Exchange”), there can be no assurance that an active trading market for shares will develop or be maintained. Most investors will incur customary brokerage commissions when buying or selling shares of an ETF. If the index concentrates in an industry or group of industries, the fund’s investments will be concentrated accordingly. In such event, the fund’s value of the shares may rise and fall more than the value of shares of a fund that invests in securities of companies in a broader range of industries. Please read the prospectus for more detailed Information regarding these and other risks.
Fund data is subject to change on a daily basis.
Composition is subject to change. Information provided is for illustration purposes only and may not reflect current investments by the fund. Referenced companies are not affiliated with Guggenheim Investments and Guggenheim Investments does not sponsor, endorse, sell or promote the referenced companies.











Performance displayed represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate so that 
            when shares are redeemed, they may be worth more or less than original cost. Total returns reflect the reinvestment of all dividends. Current performance 
            may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. For up-to-date fund performance, including performance current to the most recent month-end, 
            please visit the ETF performance page. ETFs are subject to third party transaction fees/commissions. Net asset value (NAV) is calculated by subtracting 
            total liabilities from total assets, then dividing by the number of shares outstanding. Market close is the last price at which shares are traded. 
            Fund shares may trade at, above or below NAV. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.
Performance results for periods under one year are short - term and may not provide an adequate basis for evaluating the performance potential of 
            the fund over varying market conditions or economic cycles.

NEW YORK, July  03, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Guggenheim Investments, the investment management division of Guggenheim Partners, today announced the distribution declarations for CurrencyShares® Australian Dollar Trust (NYSE:FXA). NYSE TickerFund NameDeclaration Date Ex-dividend DateRecord DatePayable Date/Share   Distribution FXA CurrencyShares Australian Dollar Trust 6.30.2017 7.3.2017 7.6.2017 7.11.2017 $0.05529          Distributions are made to shareholders on a pro-rata basis (in accordance with the number of shares that are owned) only in the event that the interest earned by the Trust exceeds the sum of the sponsor’s fee for the prior month plus other Trust expenses, if any. There is no guarantee that distributions will be made on a monthly basis. CurrencyShares® offer investors and institutions a convenient and cost-effective method of gaining investment benefits similar to that of holding foreign currencies, including potential diversification and hedging benefits. More details about the products are available at www.currencyshares.com. About Guggenheim Investments Guggenheim Investments is the global asset management and investment advisory division of Guggenheim Partners, with $217 billion1 in total assets across fixed income, equity, and alternative strategies. We focus on the return and risk needs of insurance companies, corporate and public pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, endowments and foundations, consultants, wealth managers, and high-net-worth investors. Our 275+ investment professionals perform rigorous research to understand market trends and identify undervalued opportunities in areas that are often complex and underfollowed. This approach to investment management has enabled us to deliver innovative strategies providing diversification opportunities and attractive long-term results. Diversification neither assures a profit nor eliminates the risk of experiencing investment losses. CurrencyShares are subject to risks similar to those of stocks and may not be suitable for all investors. The value of the shares of each CurrencyShares Trust relates directly to the value of the foreign currency held by the particular Trust. This creates a concentration risk associated with fluctuations in the price of the applicable foreign currency. Accordingly, a decline in the price of that currency will have an adverse effect on the value of the shares of the particular CurrencyShares Trust. Factors that may have the effect of causing a decline in the price of a foreign currency include national debt levels and trade deficits, domestic and foreign interest rates, investment and trading activities of institutions and global or regional political, economic or financial events and situations. Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of these products carefully before investing. The prospectus pertaining to each product contains this and other information about the product. Please read the applicable prospectus, including the Risk Factors section, carefully before you invest. Shares can be bought and sold through a broker and the purchasers or sellers may have to pay brokerage commissions in connection with the transaction. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate so that shares may be worth more or less than original cost. Shares may only be redeemed directly from the Trust by Authorized Participants via baskets (as defined in the prospectus). There can be no assurance that an active trading market for the shares will develop or be maintained. The CurrencyShares Trusts are not investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. As a result the Trust(s) are not subject to the regulatory requirements of investment companies. The CurrencyShares® Australian Dollar Trust, CurrencyShares® British Pound Sterling Trust, CurrencyShares® Canadian Dollar Trust, CurrencyShares® Chinese Renminbi Trust, CurrencyShares® Euro Trust, CurrencyShares® Japanese Yen Trust, CurrencyShares® Singapore Dollar Trust,  CurrencyShares® Swiss Franc Trust and CurrencyShares® Swedish Krona Trust (each a “Trust” and collectively, the “Trusts”) has filed a registration statement (including a prospectus) with the SEC for the offerings to which this communication relates. Before you invest in the shares of a Trust, you should read the prospectus in the registration statement and other documents the Trust has filed with the SEC for more complete information about the Trust and its offering. You may get these documents for free by visiting EDGAR on the SEC web site at www.sec.gov. Alternatively, you may click the links above or the Trust will arrange to send you its prospectus if you request it by calling toll-free 800.820.0888. The CurrencyShares Trusts are distributed by Guggenheim Funds Distributors, LLC.

Guggenheim to sell Rydex Fund Services to MUFG


July 28, 2016
By Iris Dorbian






MUFG Investor Services has agreed to acquire Rydex Fund Services, a mutual fund administration business, from Guggenheim Investments. No financial terms were disclosed for a deal that’s expected to close in the fourth quarter of this year.
PRESS RELEASE
New York, 28 July – MUFG Investor Services, the global asset servicing group of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, and Guggenheim Investments, the global asset management and investment advisory business of Guggenheim Partners, today announced that they have entered into an agreement in which MUFG Investor Services will acquire Guggenheim’s 1940-Act mutual fund administration business, Rydex Fund Services. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions.
When consummated the deal will complete MUFG Investor Services’ full service offering for investment managers, adding regulated 1940 Act mutual fund and exchange traded fund services expertise to a comprehensive service proposition, which spans single manager, fund of hedge fund, private equity and real estate funds, pension funds and traditional asset managers.
The acquisition when completed will add $52 billion to MUFG Investor Services’ assets under administration (AuA) bringing total AuA to $422 billion. The assets serviced by Rydex Fund Services primarily consist of Guggenheim and Rydex branded mutual funds, exchange-traded products and closed-end funds, for which Guggenheim Investments will continue to serve as investment advisor. 





Junichi Okamoto, Group Head of Trust Assets Business Group, Deputy President, Mitsubishi UFJ Trust and Banking Corporation said: “The acquisition of Rydex Fund Services will strengthen our position as an industry-leading administrator and is an important part of our commitment to supporting the growth of new clients and extending our services to existing clients. This deal will add capabilities which will allow us to respond more dynamically to our clients’ changing needs, enabling them to fully realize new market opportunities and support their growth ambitions.”
John Sergides, Managing Director, Global Head, Business Development and Marketing, MUFG Investor Services, said: “Demand for liquid alternative strategies has risen significantly in recent years as retail investors recognize the return potential and diversification benefits relative to traditional asset classes.

Our 275+ investment professionals perform rigorous research to understand market trends and identify undervalued opportunities in areas that are often complex and underfollowed. This approach to investment management has enabled us to deliver innovative strategies providing diversification opportunities and attractive long-term results.Diversification neither assures a profit nor eliminates the risk of experiencing investment losses.CurrencyShares are subject to risks similar to those of stocks and may not be suitable for all investors. The value of the shares of each CurrencyShares Trust relates directly to the value of the foreign currency held by the particular Trust. This creates a concentration risk associated with fluctuations in the price of the applicable foreign currency. Accordingly, a decline in the price of that currency will have an adverse effect on the value of the shares of the particular CurrencyShares Trust. Factors that may have the effect of causing a decline in the price of a foreign currency include national debt levels and trade deficits, domestic and foreign interest rates, investment and trading activities of institutions and global or regional political, economic or financial events and situations. Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of these products carefully before investing. The prospectus pertaining to each product contains this and other information about the product. Please read the applicable prospectus, including the Risk Factors section, carefully before you invest. Shares can be bought and sold through a broker and the purchasers or sellers may have to pay brokerage commissions in connection with the transaction. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate so that shares may be worth more or less than original cost. Shares may only be redeemed directly from the Trust by Authorized Participants via baskets (as defined in the prospectus). There can be no assurance that an active trading market for the shares will develop or be maintained. The CurrencyShares Trusts are not investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. As a result the Trust(s) are not subject to the regulatory requirements of investment companies.The CurrencyShares® Australian Dollar Trust, CurrencyShares® British Pound Sterling Trust, CurrencyShares® Canadian Dollar Trust, CurrencyShares® Chinese Renminbi Trust, CurrencyShares® Euro Trust, CurrencyShares® Japanese Yen Trust, CurrencyShares® Singapore Dollar Trust,  CurrencyShares® Swiss Franc Trust and CurrencyShares® Swedish Krona Trust (each a “Trust” and collectively, the “Trusts”) has filed a registration statement (including a prospectus) with the SEC for the offerings to which this communication relates. Before you invest in the shares of a Trust, you should read the prospectus in the registration statement and other documents the Trust has filed with the SEC for more complete information about the Trust and its offering. You may get these documents for free by visiting EDGAR on the SEC web site at www.sec.gov.

Amana Mutual Funds Trust
 





Amana Founders Video

 


Watch Amana Mutual Funds Trust founders, Nick Kaiser and Yaqub Mirza, discuss the creation and history of the Trust.

At Saturna Capital and the Amana Mutual Funds Trust, we endeavor to align our investments with our principles.
Our Funds favor companies with low price-to-earnings multiples, strong balance sheets, and proven businesses. They follow a value-oriented approach consistent with Islamic finance principles. Generally, these principles require that investors avoid interest and investments in businesses such as liquor, pornography, gambling, and banks. The Funds avoid bonds and other conventional fixed-income securities.
Saturna Capital selects investments in companies that to its knowledge do not violate the requirements of the Islamic faith at the time of investment. To ensure that investments continue to meet the requirements of the Islamic faith, Saturna Capital engages Amanie Advisors Sdn Bhd, a leading consultant specializing in Islamic finance.
The Amana Funds limit the securities they purchase to those consistent with Islamic principles. This limits opportunities and may affect performance.
 
 





Saturna White Papers: Educational Series 

  
  
 Dancing with Correlation 
 We explore the correlation between Islamic investment certificates, including sukuk, and other investment asset classes as a means of better understanding the risk and return characteristics of this unique and distinct asset class.
 
   

  
 What Makes Sukuk Halal? 
 We explain what differentiates Islamic investment certificates, often called sukuk, from conventional bonds, and identifies the distinctive features that form the core of what makes sukuk Islamic-compliant, or halal.

Wealth Structuring
Preservation and Transfer
Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.






Wealth Planning
Integrating your personal and financial affairs
By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.
Learn more about Philanthropy at U.S. Trust
Custody Services
Benefiting from the experience of dedicated custody specialists
U.S. Trust is the custodian of choice for many sophisticated investors with extensive and complex holdings. Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.

Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax or estate planning strategy.
Bank of America, N.A. and the U.S. Trust Company of Delaware (collectively the "Bank") do not serve in a fiduciary capacity with respect to all products or services. Fiduciary standards or fiduciary duties do not apply, for example, when the Bank is offering or providing credit solutions, banking, custody or brokerage products/services or referrals to other affiliates of the Bank.
