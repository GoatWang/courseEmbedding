Charting a garden-variety pullback, Dow industrials nail the breakout point (again)
True to 2017 form, the major U.S. benchmarks have flatlined following an initially powerful technical June breakout.  In the process, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has closely observed first support, across consecutive sessions, while the S&P 500 continues to hold relatively tightly to record highs.

Chinese ADRs edge higher as China downgrade shrugged off
Shares of U.S.-listed Chinese companies inched higher in premarket trade Wednesday, as investors shrugged of the downgrade of China's credit rating. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.'s stock  ticked up 0.2%, while shares of Baidu Inc.  tacked on 0.2% and JD.com Inc.  edged up 0.2% and Sina Corp.  gained 0.6%. Meanwhile, the iShares China Large-Cap ETF  ticked 0.1% lower. Moody's Investors Service cut China's rating overnight to A1 from Aa3, the first downgrade of the country since 1989. The Shanghai Composite initially fell more than 1% after the downgrade, but bounced to close up 0.1%.

Charting a garden-variety pullback, Dow industrials nail the breakout point (again)
True to 2017 form, the major U.S. benchmarks have flatlined following an initially powerful technical June breakout.  In the process, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has closely observed first support, across consecutive sessions, while the S&P 500 continues to hold relatively tightly to record highs.

Chinese ADRs edge higher as China downgrade shrugged off
Shares of U.S.-listed Chinese companies inched higher in premarket trade Wednesday, as investors shrugged of the downgrade of China's credit rating. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.'s stock  ticked up 0.2%, while shares of Baidu Inc.  tacked on 0.2% and JD.com Inc.  edged up 0.2% and Sina Corp.  gained 0.6%. Meanwhile, the iShares China Large-Cap ETF  ticked 0.1% lower. Moody's Investors Service cut China's rating overnight to A1 from Aa3, the first downgrade of the country since 1989. The Shanghai Composite initially fell more than 1% after the downgrade, but bounced to close up 0.1%.

We estimate that we will receive net proceeds from this offering and the
concurrent private placement to Alibaba of approximately $304.7 million, or
approximately $344.8 million if the underwriters exercise their option to
purchase additional ADSs in full and without giving effect to Ali WB’s right to
acquire additional Class A ordinary shares upon the underwriters’ exercise of
their option, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and the
estimated offering expenses payable by us.

The primary purposes of this offering are to enhance our brand recognition,
retain talented employees by providing them with equity incentives, and obtain
additional capital. We will use approximately $250 million of the net proceeds
we receive from this offering to repay loans we owe to SINA, our parent company
and controlling shareholder. The loans from SINA are repayable upon demand, but
there is an understanding between us and SINA that the loans will be repaid
after the completion of this offering. The loans accrue interest at prevailing
market interest rates by reference to the three-month time deposit rate of the
People’s Bank of China, which have ranged from 2.55% to 3.05%. We intend to use
the proceeds from the issuance of ordinary shares to Ali WB upon its option
exercise to repurchase certain shares and vested options held by individuals who
provided services to us. We intend to use the remainder to invest in technology,
infrastructure and product development, to expand sales and marketing efforts,
and for working capital and other general corporate purposes. Additionally, we
may use a portion of the net proceeds to invest in or acquire complementary
businesses, products, services or technologies. However, we do not have
agreements or commitments for any material acquisitions as of the date of this
prospectus. The amounts and timing of any expenditures will vary depending on
the amount of cash generated by our operations, and the rate of growth, if any,
of our business. Accordingly, our management will have significant flexibility
in applying the net proceeds of the offering. If an unforeseen event occurs or
business conditions change, we may use the proceeds of this offering differently
than as described in this prospectus.

In utilizing the proceeds of this offering, we are permitted under PRC laws and
regulations to provide funding to our PRC subsidiaries only through loans or
capital contributions. Subject to satisfaction of applicable government
registration and approval requirements, we may extend inter-company loans to our
PRC subsidiary or make additional capital contributions to our PRC subsidiary to
fund its capital expenditures or working capital. We cannot assure you that we
will be able to obtain these government registrations or approvals on a timely
basis, if at all. The foregoing represents our current intentions to use and
allocate the net proceeds of this offering based upon our present plans and
business conditions. Our management, however, will have significant flexibility
and discretion to apply the net proceeds of this offering. If an unforeseen
event occurs or business conditions change, we may use the proceeds of this
offering differently than as described in this prospectus.

Pending use of the net proceeds, we intend to hold our net proceeds in demand
deposits or invest them in interest-bearing government securities.


We face significant competition both for the time and attention of Chinese 
internet users and for the advertising spending of companies that market to 
Chinese businesses and consumers. Social media is relatively new as a means of 
advertising and we compete for advertising budgets with a wide variety of
traditional and new media. We must compete effectively for users and for
advertising and marketing customers in order to grow our platform and increase
our revenues. We intend to continue to invest in product development, technology
infrastructure and our sales and marketing capabilities to address the
competition we face.

---

Major Chinese internet companies, including Sohu, NetEase, Tencent and Phoenix
New Media, as well as other microblogging services and new players in China who
offer online media, including content aggregation and distribution services,
compete directly with us for user traffic and user engagement, content, talent
and marketing resources. As a media platform in nature, we also compete with
offline media companies for audiences and content.

In addition, as a form of social media featuring social networking services and
messaging services, we are subject to intense competition from providers of
similar services as well as potential new types of online services, including
interest-based social products. These services include mobile applications, such
as WhatsApp, Line, Ozone, WeChat, QQ Mobile, Kakao Talk, Yixin, Laiwang, Douban
and Momo, and websites, such as renren.com. We also compete with both offline
and online games for the time and money of gamers. We have begun to offer social
commerce solutions to our customers that enable them to conduct e-commerce on
our platform. Consequently, our offerings compete with e-commerce platforms that
enable merchants to conduct e-commerce, including location-based services and
online-to-offline services. In addition to direct competition, we face indirect
competition from companies that sponsor or maintain high traffic volume websites
or provide an initial point of entry for internet users, including but not
limited to providers of search services and navigation pages, such as Baidu,
Inc. and Qihoo 360 Technology Co., Ltd. We may also face increasing competition
from global social media and social networking services, such as Twitter and
Facebook. Some of our competitors may have substantially more cash, traffic,
technical and other resources than we do.

We also face significant competition for advertising and marketing spending. A
substantial majority of our revenues is generated from the sale of advertising
and marketing services. We compete against internet and mobile businesses that
offer such services, including Sohu, Netease, Tencent, Baidu and Youku Tudou. We
also compete against traditional media outlets, such as television, radio and
print, for advertising and marketing spending. Some of our larger competitors
have substantially broader product or service offerings and leverage their
relationships based on other products or services to gain a larger share of
advertising and marketing budgets. We believe that our ability to compete
effectively for advertising and marketing spending depends upon many factors,
including the size, composition and engagement of our user base, our ad
targeting capabilities, market acceptance of our advertising and marketing
services, our marketing and selling efforts, the return our customers receive
from our advertising and marketing services and the strength and reputation of
our brands. 

We experience significant competition for highly skilled personnel, including
management, engineers, designers and product managers. Our growth strategy
depends in part on our ability to retain our existing personnel and add
additional highly skilled employees.


Company Description
Weibo is a leading social media platform for people to create, distribute and 
discover Chinese-language content. By providing an unprecedented and simple way 
for Chinese people and organizations to publicly express themselves in real 
time, interact with others on a massive global platform and


 stay connected with 
the world, Weibo has had a profound social impact in China. 

Since our inception four years ago, Weibo has amassed a large user base in China 
and in Chinese communities in more than 190 countries. In December 2013, Weibo 
had 129.1 million monthly active users, or MAUs, and 61.4 million average daily 
active users, or average DAUs, increasing from 96.7 million MAUs and 45.1 
million average DAUs in December 2012, and 72.9 million MAUs and 25.2 million 
average DAUs in December 2011. In March 2014, Weibo had 143.8 million MAUs and 
66.6 million average DAUs, increasing from 107.3 million MAUs and 48.6 million 
average DAUs in March 2013. A microcosm of Chinese society, Weibo has attracted 
a wide range of users, including ordinary people, celebrities and other public 
figures, as well as organizations such as media outlets, businesses, government 
agencies and charities. 

Weibo represents a new online experience in China by combining the means of
real-time public self-expression with a powerful platform for social
interaction, as well as content aggregation and distribution. Any user can
create and post a feed of up to 140 Chinese characters and attach multimedia or
long-form content. User relationships on Weibo may be asymmetric; any user can
follow any other user and add comments to a feed while reposting. The simple,
asymmetric and distributed nature of Weibo allows an original feed to become a
live viral conversation stream. Over 2.8 billion feeds were shared on Weibo in
December 2013, including 2.2 billion feeds with pictures, 81.7 million feeds
with short videos and 21.5 million feeds with songs.

Weibo has become a cultural phenomenon in China. Weibo allows people to be heard
publicly and exposed to the rich ideas, cultures and experiences of the broader
world. Media outlets use Weibo as a source of news and a distribution channel
for their headline news. Government agencies and officials use Weibo as an
official communication channel for disseminating timely information and gauging
public opinion to improve public services. Individuals and charities use Weibo
to make the world a better place by launching charitable projects, seeking
donations and volunteers and leveraging the celebrities and organizations on
Weibo to amplify their social influence.

In addition to users, Weibo’s ecosystem includes customers and platform
partners:

.   Customers. We enable our advertising and marketing customers to promote   
    their brands, products and services to our users. We offer a wide range of
    advertising and marketing solutions to customers ranging from large       
    companies to small-and-medium enterprises, or SMEs, to individuals. Our   
    performance-based ads allow our customers to reach a targeted audience    
    based on the social interest graphs of our users. In addition, our        
    customers can benefit from the potentially viral effect of their promoted 
    feeds generated from the public and distributed nature of our platform,   
    commonly known as “earned media”. 

.   Platform Partners. We have attracted a large number of platform partners, 
    including media outlets and developers of games and other applications.   
    Our platform partners contribute a vast amount of content to Weibo,       
    broadly distribute Weibo content across their properties and develop      
    products and applications for our platform, enriching the experience of   
    our users while increasing our monetization opportunities.                

Designed with a “mobile first” philosophy, Weibo displays content in a simple
information feed format. With a limit of 140 Chinese characters per feed, the
high information-density of Chinese characters and users’ ability to personalize
content information flow, Weibo is particularly suited for mobile use, and we
have seen significant mobile adoption. Over 70% of our MAUs in December 2013
accessed Weibo from mobile devices at least once during the month. In the fourth
quarter of 2013, we had over 120 million check-ins where users recorded their
location by using a mobile device to post their location in a feed on Weibo.
Mobile revenues accounted for 28.0% of our advertising and marketing revenues in
2013.

We began monetization of our platform in 2012. We generate revenues primarily
from customers who purchase advertising and marketing services, and, to a lesser
extent, from platform partners who develop games for our users to play. We
provide most of our services to users free of charge, with VIP membership
services being the primary exception. In 2012 and 2013, we generated 77.4% and
78.8% of our revenues from advertising and marketing services, 19.3% and 12.2%
from game-related services, and 3.3% and 5.9% from VIP membership services,
respectively. While we distinguish between users, customers and platform
partners in classifying our products and analyzing our sources of revenues, the
same person or organization may simultaneously be included in two or more of the
categories.

SINA Corporation (SINA  -  Free Report)	 is set to report first-quarter 2017 results on May 16. Last quarter, earnings of 27 cents was  in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Notably, the company has a mixed earnings surprises track for the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 368.75%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlaySINA has a strong product pipeline and is investing in product development and marketing. The company’s robust user base for its e-commerce and Weibo offerings are positives.We believe that SINA will benefit from the growth potential of e-commerce, e-banking, online payment and online entertainment services markets in China.Sina Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Sina Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Sina Corporation QuoteFurther, the booming gaming market in China is also a positive for the company. Shares of SINA have outperformed the Zacks categorized Internet Content industry. On a year-to-date basis shares of SINA have increased 35.2% compared with the industry's gain of 22%.We believe that Weibo’s monetization ability will be a major driving factor for SINA amid intensifying competition from the likes of Sohu.com Inc. (SOHU  -  Free Report)	 and NetEase (NTES  -  Free Report)	 in the video and brand advertising market.However, the company’s business is likely to be impacted by soft macroeconomic conditions in China. Also, significant restrictions on online search and other social-networking activities in the region remain concerns.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that SINA is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: SINA has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at a loss of 28 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: SINA has a Zacks Rank #3. Though Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 increases the predictive power of ESP, the company’s ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stock to ConsiderHere’s a stock that you may want to consider as our model shows that it has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in its upcoming release.Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report)	 with an Earnings ESP of +1.32% and a Zacks Rank #2.

In a survey conducted by Gallup (China) Research Ltd in April 2003, Sina was the most popular company in China, and was estimated to have three billion page data volumes every day. Also, it was awarded the "China's Media of the Year" in 2003 by Southern Weekend.[7]

(Information based on Xin, 2002)[8]
In March 1999, Stone Rich Sight Information Technology Ltd (四通利方信息技术有限公司, SRS), established by Sina former CEO and President Wang Zhidong (王志东; Wáng Zhìdōng), merged with Sinanet (华渊资讯公司), a US website company of Sunnyvale, California. The merging of the two largest Chinese websites formed into the later Sina. Since then the service had been extended across the straits and North America, before it extended to Hong Kong in July 1999.
Sina overtook the dominant role of sohu for the first time in 1999 by its fast, continuous, and comprehensive reports on the NATO Bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade in 1999, according to CNNIC's survey conducted 2 months after the incident.[9]
Sina was the first to be approved for listing on the Nasdaq National market on 13 April 2000, followed by Netease and Sohu, two other web-based companies in China, in June and July respectively. It succeeded in raising US$68,000,000 before Nasdaq plummeted in May 2000. In July 2000, Sina was the official website for on-line coverage of the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney as selected by the government and the Chinese Olympic committee. (Xin, 2002).[10]
Management[edit]
Key officers[edit]

Mr. Charles Chao: Chief Executive Officer and President. He received his Master of Professional Accounting from the University of Texas in Austin, TX. and holds an MA degree in Journalism from the University of Oklahoma.
Mr. Herman Yu: Acting Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Yu holds a Masters of Accountancy from the University of Southern California and a Bachelor of Arts in Economics with Honors from the University of California.
Mr. Hurst Lin: Chief Operating Officer. He received his MBA from Stanford University and holds a bachelor's degree in electronic engineering from Dartmouth College.
Mr. LC Chang: Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer. He received his Executive MBA from National Taiwan University.[11]

Partnership[edit]
Sina cooperates with other web-based companies such as People, Nanfang Daily, Lifeweek and Xinhuanet, etc. Apart from the media partners, its clients include Microsoft, DELL, IBM, Motorola, and Kodak. Recently Sina started developing its business in the field of wireless internet, in the meantime collaborating with China Mobile, China Telecom, Ericsson.
On January 13, 2004, Sina and Yahoo started to jointly provide online auction services in China;[12] in response to this, EachNet (Chinese: "易趣網"), which cooperates with eBay, lowered its registration fee in early February 2004 in order to keep its market share.[13]
Sina also sponsors the annual ChinICT conference held at the Tsinghua Science Park.
Recently, Sina has begun collaborating with Qihoo 360 on internet security. Through this collaboration, Qihoo 360 intend to provide Sina Weibo tech support in order to protect Weibo from hackers and viruses. As of April 24, 2012 an official statement has not yet been made announcing the collaboration.[14]
Marketing[edit]
To provide tailored internet services for local people, Sina has been conducting quantitative and qualitative marketing researches, including demographic research, psychograph, etc., on target audience in specific regions.[citation needed]
Features[edit]
Multiple services[edit]
Sina provides internet services to the Chinese population around the world. In every localized website, there are over thirty integrated channels, including news, sports, technology information, finance, advertising services, entertainment, fashion, and travel.
Sina is a multiple-service provider, its major services are SMS, Mail, Search, Games, Match, Entertainment, Sina Sports, Sina Blog, and Sina Microblogging. Sina Blog (中文:新浪博客) is the blog service of Sina, which features the blogs of celebrities, including the most popular blog in the world, the one of Xu Jinglei.[15] Sina Weibo is an equivalent to Tencent Weibo. Many celebrities from mainland China, Taiwan and also Hong Kong use Sina's Microblog as a platform to reach out to their fans and supporters. Some famous users on Sina's Microblog include Taiwanese hosts Dee Shu and Kevin Tsai, with more than ten million followers on their microblogs each.
A big challenge for Sina is monetizing the massive Weibo following. Sina has taken several steps in that direction, and is reportedly developing a "pay-for-forward" feature. The feature will enable users to pay to have a message forwarded by an account with a large following. Sina plans to keep 20% of the revenue generated from "pay-for-forward" fees.[16]
Local content[edit]
Internationalized services have a common layout which consists of sections like news, information, infotainment and email services with localized content.[citation needed]}
Localization involves political censorship. As with all internet content providers operating within mainland China, the web pages which are geared toward mainland China audiences have internet censors controlling the discussion for sensitive political content. In addition, the news from sina comes from local newspapers, which in the case of mainland China are themselves subject to censorship by the government. This censorship does not extend to pages and forums which are not intended for audiences within mainland China.[citation needed]
Online news[edit]
Sina provides a lot of feature news and ads as the focus of the lead story or the main photo. On the other hand, its domestic political news is sourced from The People’s Daily or Xinhua News Agency. Compared to conventional medium for news distribution, Sina is a telecom platform for ads from the traditional media. That means, according to its CEO, Wang Zhidong, Sina would never hire journalists (Xin, 2000).[citation needed]
Network technology[edit]
According to the company's published information, Sina.comXpressTM and Sina.comPlusTM are Sina.com's two main exclusive technologies, which bring ease-of-use benefits and enable the audience of Big 5 (traditional Chinese character), and GB (simplified Chinese characters) to view the webpages sourced from around the Chinese communities of the world.[citation needed]

History[edit]

(Information based on Xin, 2002)[8]
In March 1999, Stone Rich Sight Information Technology Ltd (四通利方信息技术有限公司, SRS), established by Sina former CEO and President Wang Zhidong (王志东; Wáng Zhìdōng), merged with Sinanet (华渊资讯公司), a US website company of Sunnyvale, California. The merging of the two largest Chinese websites formed into the later Sina. Since then the service had been extended across the straits and North America, before it extended to Hong Kong in July 1999.
Sina overtook the dominant role of sohu for the first time in 1999 by its fast, continuous, and comprehensive reports on the NATO Bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade in 1999, according to CNNIC's survey conducted 2 months after the incident.[9]
Sina was the first to be approved for listing on the Nasdaq National market on 13 April 2000, followed by Netease and Sohu, two other web-based companies in China, in June and July respectively. It succeeded in raising US$68,000,000 before Nasdaq plummeted in May 2000. In July 2000, Sina was the official website for on-line coverage of the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney as selected by the government and the Chinese Olympic committee. (Xin, 2002).[10]
Management[edit]
Key officers[edit]

Mr. Charles Chao: Chief Executive Officer and President. He received his Master of Professional Accounting from the University of Texas in Austin, TX. and holds an MA degree in Journalism from the University of Oklahoma.
Mr. Herman Yu: Acting Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Yu holds a Masters of Accountancy from the University of Southern California and a Bachelor of Arts in Economics with Honors from the University of California.
Mr. Hurst Lin: Chief Operating Officer. He received his MBA from Stanford University and holds a bachelor's degree in electronic engineering from Dartmouth College.
Mr. LC Chang: Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer. He received his Executive MBA from National Taiwan University.[11]

Partnership[edit]
Sina cooperates with other web-based companies such as People, Nanfang Daily, Lifeweek and Xinhuanet, etc. Apart from the media partners, its clients include Microsoft, DELL, IBM, Motorola, and Kodak. Recently Sina started developing its business in the field of wireless internet, in the meantime collaborating with China Mobile, China Telecom, Ericsson.
On January 13, 2004, Sina and Yahoo started to jointly provide online auction services in China;[12] in response to this, EachNet (Chinese: "易趣網"), which cooperates with eBay, lowered its registration fee in early February 2004 in order to keep its market share.[13]
Sina also sponsors the annual ChinICT conference held at the Tsinghua Science Park.
Recently, Sina has begun collaborating with Qihoo 360 on internet security. Through this collaboration, Qihoo 360 intend to provide Sina Weibo tech support in order to protect Weibo from hackers and viruses. As of April 24, 2012 an official statement has not yet been made announcing the collaboration.[14]
Marketing[edit]
To provide tailored internet services for local people, Sina has been conducting quantitative and qualitative marketing researches, including demographic research, psychograph, etc., on target audience in specific regions.[citation needed]
Features[edit]
Multiple services[edit]
Sina provides internet services to the Chinese population around the world. In every localized website, there are over thirty integrated channels, including news, sports, technology information, finance, advertising services, entertainment, fashion, and travel.
Sina is a multiple-service provider, its major services are SMS, Mail, Search, Games, Match, Entertainment, Sina Sports, Sina Blog, and Sina Microblogging. Sina Blog (中文:新浪博客) is the blog service of Sina, which features the blogs of celebrities, including the most popular blog in the world, the one of Xu Jinglei.[15] Sina Weibo is an equivalent to Tencent Weibo. Many celebrities from mainland China, Taiwan and also Hong Kong use Sina's Microblog as a platform to reach out to their fans and supporters. Some famous users on Sina's Microblog include Taiwanese hosts Dee Shu and Kevin Tsai, with more than ten million followers on their microblogs each.
A big challenge for Sina is monetizing the massive Weibo following. Sina has taken several steps in that direction, and is reportedly developing a "pay-for-forward" feature. The feature will enable users to pay to have a message forwarded by an account with a large following. Sina plans to keep 20% of the revenue generated from "pay-for-forward" fees.[16]
Local content[edit]
Internationalized services have a common layout which consists of sections like news, information, infotainment and email services with localized content.[citation needed]}
Localization involves political censorship. As with all internet content providers operating within mainland China, the web pages which are geared toward mainland China audiences have internet censors controlling the discussion for sensitive political content. In addition, the news from sina comes from local newspapers, which in the case of mainland China are themselves subject to censorship by the government. This censorship does not extend to pages and forums which are not intended for audiences within mainland China.[citation needed]
Online news[edit]
Sina provides a lot of feature news and ads as the focus of the lead story or the main photo. On the other hand, its domestic political news is sourced from The People’s Daily or Xinhua News Agency. Compared to conventional medium for news distribution, Sina is a telecom platform for ads from the traditional media. That means, according to its CEO, Wang Zhidong, Sina would never hire journalists (Xin, 2000).[citation needed]
Network technology[edit]
According to the company's published information, Sina.comXpressTM and Sina.comPlusTM are Sina.com's two main exclusive technologies, which bring ease-of-use benefits and enable the audience of Big 5 (traditional Chinese character), and GB (simplified Chinese characters) to view the webpages sourced from around the Chinese communities of the world.[citation needed]

History[edit]

(Information based on Xin, 2002)[8]
In March 1999, Stone Rich Sight Information Technology Ltd (四通利方信息技术有限公司, SRS), established by Sina former CEO and President Wang Zhidong (王志东; Wáng Zhìdōng), merged with Sinanet (华渊资讯公司), a US website company of Sunnyvale, California. The merging of the two largest Chinese websites formed into the later Sina. Since then the service had been extended across the straits and North America, before it extended to Hong Kong in July 1999.
Sina overtook the dominant role of sohu for the first time in 1999 by its fast, continuous, and comprehensive reports on the NATO Bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade in 1999, according to CNNIC's survey conducted 2 months after the incident.[9]
Sina was the first to be approved for listing on the Nasdaq National market on 13 April 2000, followed by Netease and Sohu, two other web-based companies in China, in June and July respectively. It succeeded in raising US$68,000,000 before Nasdaq plummeted in May 2000. In July 2000, Sina was the official website for on-line coverage of the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney as selected by the government and the Chinese Olympic committee. (Xin, 2002).[10]
Management[edit]
Key officers[edit]

Mr. Charles Chao: Chief Executive Officer and President. He received his Master of Professional Accounting from the University of Texas in Austin, TX. and holds an MA degree in Journalism from the University of Oklahoma.
Mr. Herman Yu: Acting Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Yu holds a Masters of Accountancy from the University of Southern California and a Bachelor of Arts in Economics with Honors from the University of California.
Mr. Hurst Lin: Chief Operating Officer. He received his MBA from Stanford University and holds a bachelor's degree in electronic engineering from Dartmouth College.
Mr. LC Chang: Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer. He received his Executive MBA from National Taiwan University.[11]

Partnership[edit]
Sina cooperates with other web-based companies such as People, Nanfang Daily, Lifeweek and Xinhuanet, etc. Apart from the media partners, its clients include Microsoft, DELL, IBM, Motorola, and Kodak. Recently Sina started developing its business in the field of wireless internet, in the meantime collaborating with China Mobile, China Telecom, Ericsson.
On January 13, 2004, Sina and Yahoo started to jointly provide online auction services in China;[12] in response to this, EachNet (Chinese: "易趣網"), which cooperates with eBay, lowered its registration fee in early February 2004 in order to keep its market share.[13]
Sina also sponsors the annual ChinICT conference held at the Tsinghua Science Park.
Recently, Sina has begun collaborating with Qihoo 360 on internet security. Through this collaboration, Qihoo 360 intend to provide Sina Weibo tech support in order to protect Weibo from hackers and viruses. As of April 24, 2012 an official statement has not yet been made announcing the collaboration.[14]
Marketing[edit]
To provide tailored internet services for local people, Sina has been conducting quantitative and qualitative marketing researches, including demographic research, psychograph, etc., on target audience in specific regions.[citation needed]
Features[edit]
Multiple services[edit]
Sina provides internet services to the Chinese population around the world. In every localized website, there are over thirty integrated channels, including news, sports, technology information, finance, advertising services, entertainment, fashion, and travel.
Sina is a multiple-service provider, its major services are SMS, Mail, Search, Games, Match, Entertainment, Sina Sports, Sina Blog, and Sina Microblogging. Sina Blog (中文:新浪博客) is the blog service of Sina, which features the blogs of celebrities, including the most popular blog in the world, the one of Xu Jinglei.[15] Sina Weibo is an equivalent to Tencent Weibo. Many celebrities from mainland China, Taiwan and also Hong Kong use Sina's Microblog as a platform to reach out to their fans and supporters. Some famous users on Sina's Microblog include Taiwanese hosts Dee Shu and Kevin Tsai, with more than ten million followers on their microblogs each.
A big challenge for Sina is monetizing the massive Weibo following. Sina has taken several steps in that direction, and is reportedly developing a "pay-for-forward" feature. The feature will enable users to pay to have a message forwarded by an account with a large following. Sina plans to keep 20% of the revenue generated from "pay-for-forward" fees.[16]
Local content[edit]
Internationalized services have a common layout which consists of sections like news, information, infotainment and email services with localized content.[citation needed]}
Localization involves political censorship. As with all internet content providers operating within mainland China, the web pages which are geared toward mainland China audiences have internet censors controlling the discussion for sensitive political content. In addition, the news from sina comes from local newspapers, which in the case of mainland China are themselves subject to censorship by the government. This censorship does not extend to pages and forums which are not intended for audiences within mainland China.[citation needed]
Online news[edit]
Sina provides a lot of feature news and ads as the focus of the lead story or the main photo. On the other hand, its domestic political news is sourced from The People’s Daily or Xinhua News Agency. Compared to conventional medium for news distribution, Sina is a telecom platform for ads from the traditional media. That means, according to its CEO, Wang Zhidong, Sina would never hire journalists (Xin, 2000).[citation needed]
Network technology[edit]
According to the company's published information, Sina.comXpressTM and Sina.comPlusTM are Sina.com's two main exclusive technologies, which bring ease-of-use benefits and enable the audience of Big 5 (traditional Chinese character), and GB (simplified Chinese characters) to view the webpages sourced from around the Chinese communities of the world.[citation needed]
