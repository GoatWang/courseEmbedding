Georgia-Pacific Consumer Products LP And SPG Holdings LLC Reach Agreement For Georgia-Pacific To Acquire SPG	






ATLANTA AND DALLAS. Updated Thu June 19, 2014



























Georgia-Pacific Consumer Products LP and SPG Holdings LLC announced today that they have reached an agreement under which Georgia-Pacific would purchase SPG, a paper goods company that manufactures and converts products for the foodservice industry. SPG has operations in Green Bay, Wisconsin; Hattiesburg, Mississippi; and Augusta, Georgia. CIC Partners, a Dallas-based middle market private equity firm, has been lead investor in the company since 2011.
Closing of the acquisition, subject to regulatory review and customary closing conditions, is anticipated later this year. Financial details of the agreement are not being disclosed. Jefferies LLC acted as exclusive financial advisor to SPG Holdings LLC in connection with this transaction.
“SPG has skilled employees, high-quality assets, efficient operations and an excellent customer service model, and will be a significant addition to the Georgia‑Pacific Professional business,” said Kathy Walters, who leads Georgia-Pacific’s Consumer Products Group that includes the Professional business.
Greg Santaga, CEO of SPG, said, “We have enjoyed many great years with the support of CIC Partners and are looking forward to building upon that success with Georgia‑Pacific.  We believe Georgia-Pacific provides the best, long-term option for our employees, our customers and our shareholders. The SPG organization and assets will fit well with the healthy and growing Georgia-Pacific Professional business.”
Marshall Payne, chairman of SPG’s board of directors and partner at CIC, added, “Greg Santaga and the founding team of SPG have been outstanding partners. SPG has done an excellent job of generating strong organic growth and enhancing the company’s position in the foodservice specialty paper segment, resulting in a great outcome for our investors and management partners.”
Scott Light, president, Georgia-Pacific Professional, added, “Georgia-Pacific believes SPG will help us to better serve our existing customers in the foodservice industry, particularly limited-service restaurants, as well as to help us expand our capabilities to further grow our business in these important segments.”

USA PATRIOT Act:  Foreign Banking Clients and Customer Identification Program In response to the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, the US Congress passed the USA PATRIOT Act.  Parts of this Act apply to the financial services industry and require certain financial institutions to request specific information from foreign banks on a “certification” form.  Also as part of the USA PATRIOT Act and to assist in the government’s fight against terrorist financing and money laundering, SGAS is required to obtain and verify information about the identity of our clients.  Because of this, when you open an account at SGAS, we will ask for information that will allow us to confirm your identity or the identity of your corporation, partnership or other entity.  This process may include a request to see to your driver’s license, passport, corporate papers or other identifying documents.
