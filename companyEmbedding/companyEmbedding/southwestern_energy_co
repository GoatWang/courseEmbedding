            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Current operations[edit]
The company's primary exploration and production activities are in the Appalachian Basin and in the Fayetteville Shale in Arkansas, where the company controls 918,535 net acres.[1] The company also controls 2,518,519 net undeveloped acres in New Brunswick, Canada.[1] However, because of a moratorium on hydraulic fracturing in New Brunswick, these resources cannot be developed.[1]
As of December 31, 2016 the company had 875 million barrels of oil equivalent (5.35×109 GJ) of estimated proved reserves, of which 7% was petroleum and 93% was natural gas.[1]
The company also owns 2,061 miles of pipeline, almost entirely in Arkansas.[1]
History[edit]
The company traces its roots to Arkansas Western Gas Company, which was established in July 1929 as a subsidiary of Southern Union Gas Company of Dallas.[2]
In 1985, the company merged with Mustang Fuel in a $200 million transaction.[3]
Controversies[edit]
Public opposition to hydraulic fracturing in New Brunswick, Canada[edit]
See also: Shale gas in Canada
Shale gas was discovered in New Brunswick, Canada in 2003, but technologies such as hydraulic fracturing made its extraction viable later that decade. In March 2010, Southwestern successfully bid for exclusive licenses from the Department of Natural Resources of New Brunswick to search and conduct an exploration program.[1] In 2010, Corridor Resources, in partnership with Apache Resources, who operated in the McCully Field play, announced that "it found more natural gas in place in southern New Brunswick than is available in all of western Canada's proven reserves." In July 2011, Tom Alexander, Southwestern's general manager for New Brunswick, assured residents that the company was only exploring, not fracking. In July seismic equipment owned by Southwestern was vandalized in an isolated work camp in Cumberland Bay. In August 2011, protests against hydraulic fracturing were held in Fredericton, Sussex, Hampton, Norton and Rexton. Local residents were "concerned that the seismic testing could lead to hydro-fracking in their communities" and that the fracking would "harm their air and water quality." According to Ralph Carr, the mayor of Sussex, New Brunswick, by December 2011, Southwestern and Apache, had "announced their intentions to aggressively search for gas in the deep shale deposits that lay beneath us." Carr argued that controversy about shale gas development in New Brunswick was partially fueled by media attention, when Calgary-based Windsor Energy Inc. conducted seismic testing within the town boundaries, before Sussex town council had given official permission. Carr argued against an outright ban on shale gas production but admitted that, "[m]issteps and mistakes by some companies involved with shale gas production have caused environmental damage and tarnished the image of the industry as a whole." In early August 2011, 40 people from Penniac, Taymouth, Stanley, Rogersville and several First Nations blocked a road north of Stanley, stopping Southwestern Resources Canada trucks used in seismic testing. There was a blockade on New Brunswick Route 134 in Mi’kmaq territory in New Brunswick. On October 3, 2013, the Court of Queen's Bench in New Brunswick granted Southwestern an injunction to end the protests of the Elsipogtog First Nation. However, the protesters were undeterred, and on October 17, they brought matters to a head with a demonstration that blocked the highway and set several police cars on fire. The situation "exploded in violence, sending dozens of people to jail and reducing five police cars to smouldering ruins". The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said "more than 40 protesters were arrested for various offences including firearms offences, uttering threats, intimidation, mischief and for refusing to abide by a court injunction". In 2015, the provincial government in New Brunswick imposed a moratorium on hydraulic fracturing.[4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12]

Current operations[edit]
The company's primary exploration and production activities are in the Appalachian Basin and in the Fayetteville Shale in Arkansas, where the company controls 918,535 net acres.[1] The company also controls 2,518,519 net undeveloped acres in New Brunswick, Canada.[1] However, because of a moratorium on hydraulic fracturing in New Brunswick, these resources cannot be developed.[1]
As of December 31, 2016 the company had 875 million barrels of oil equivalent (5.35×109 GJ) of estimated proved reserves, of which 7% was petroleum and 93% was natural gas.[1]
The company also owns 2,061 miles of pipeline, almost entirely in Arkansas.[1]
History[edit]
The company traces its roots to Arkansas Western Gas Company, which was established in July 1929 as a subsidiary of Southern Union Gas Company of Dallas.[2]
In 1985, the company merged with Mustang Fuel in a $200 million transaction.[3]
Controversies[edit]
Public opposition to hydraulic fracturing in New Brunswick, Canada[edit]
See also: Shale gas in Canada
Shale gas was discovered in New Brunswick, Canada in 2003, but technologies such as hydraulic fracturing made its extraction viable later that decade. In March 2010, Southwestern successfully bid for exclusive licenses from the Department of Natural Resources of New Brunswick to search and conduct an exploration program.[1] In 2010, Corridor Resources, in partnership with Apache Resources, who operated in the McCully Field play, announced that "it found more natural gas in place in southern New Brunswick than is available in all of western Canada's proven reserves." In July 2011, Tom Alexander, Southwestern's general manager for New Brunswick, assured residents that the company was only exploring, not fracking. In July seismic equipment owned by Southwestern was vandalized in an isolated work camp in Cumberland Bay. In August 2011, protests against hydraulic fracturing were held in Fredericton, Sussex, Hampton, Norton and Rexton. Local residents were "concerned that the seismic testing could lead to hydro-fracking in their communities" and that the fracking would "harm their air and water quality." According to Ralph Carr, the mayor of Sussex, New Brunswick, by December 2011, Southwestern and Apache, had "announced their intentions to aggressively search for gas in the deep shale deposits that lay beneath us." Carr argued that controversy about shale gas development in New Brunswick was partially fueled by media attention, when Calgary-based Windsor Energy Inc. conducted seismic testing within the town boundaries, before Sussex town council had given official permission. Carr argued against an outright ban on shale gas production but admitted that, "[m]issteps and mistakes by some companies involved with shale gas production have caused environmental damage and tarnished the image of the industry as a whole." In early August 2011, 40 people from Penniac, Taymouth, Stanley, Rogersville and several First Nations blocked a road north of Stanley, stopping Southwestern Resources Canada trucks used in seismic testing. There was a blockade on New Brunswick Route 134 in Mi’kmaq territory in New Brunswick. On October 3, 2013, the Court of Queen's Bench in New Brunswick granted Southwestern an injunction to end the protests of the Elsipogtog First Nation. However, the protesters were undeterred, and on October 17, they brought matters to a head with a demonstration that blocked the highway and set several police cars on fire. The situation "exploded in violence, sending dozens of people to jail and reducing five police cars to smouldering ruins". The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said "more than 40 protesters were arrested for various offences including firearms offences, uttering threats, intimidation, mischief and for refusing to abide by a court injunction". In 2015, the provincial government in New Brunswick imposed a moratorium on hydraulic fracturing.[4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12]

We are energy. For more than 80 years, Southwestern Energy Company has thrived because of a deep commitment to providing the energy that powers our world. Our success continues to be dependent upon the dedication of our employees to the company and to the communities in which we operate. Currently the third largest producer of natural gas in the US Lower 48, Southwestern Energy Company is a growing independent energy company primarily engaged in natural gas and crude oil exploration, development and production. We are also focused on creating and capturing additional value through our natural gas gathering and marketing businesses, which we refer to as Midstream Services. We are explorers and producers. Every day, our people work to discover innovative new ways to fuel the future. Though we search far beyond our current operating footprint, our work is principally focused on the development of natural gas in the Fayetteville Shale in Arkansas and the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania, and the exploration of oil and natural gas in other new venture plays in North America. We are Midstream Services. Our commitment to creating value through innovation is evident in our Midstream Services segment, which primarily supports our E&P operations. Midstream Services generates revenue from gathering fees associated with the transportation of natural gas to market and through the marketing of our own gas production and some third-party natural gas.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

            What We Do

Southwestern Energy Company produces domestic natural gas – an important natural resource that helps fuel our nation’s economy while playing a critical role in America’s quest for energy independence. We began operating in Arkansas more than 80 years ago and now we produce natural gas from more than 1.5 million acres of land principally located in the Fayetteville Shale in Arkansas and the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania and West Virginia, and the exploration of oil and natural gas in other new venture plays in North America.
