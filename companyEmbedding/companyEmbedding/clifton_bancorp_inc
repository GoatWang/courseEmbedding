History[edit]
Clifton Savings Bancorp was founded as Botany Building and Loan Association in 1928 in Clifton's Botany Village section of town. The bank became known as East Clifton Building and Loan two years later and assumed the name Clifton Savings and Loan Association in 1954, all while remaining in the Botany section of Clifton; the bank served as the company's headquarters until 1998.
The bank's first branch office was opened in the Richfield section of Clifton in 1954, is located on the portion of Clifton Avenue designated NJ 161, and was the first to offer a drive-up window for banking. Fourteen years later Clifton Savings added a third branch in Clifton's Athenia section, in a storefront located on Van Houten Avenue. Two more branches opened in 1970 and 1971, on Lakeview Avenue and Valley Road in the Lakeview and Albion sections of town.
In 1975 Clifton Savings expanded their operations to outside of their base, opening a branch on Palisade Avenue in neighboring Garfield. Two years later a second Garfield branch opened on Lanza Avenue.
In 1981, Clifton Savings opened two new locations. Both were located on Van Houten Avenue; one was a replacement for the old Athenia storefront branch and the other was a large branch in the Maple Valley section of the city which served as both a bank and the headquarters for Clifton Savings' mortgage lending department (which the bank has since moved to a separate office space in the Allwood section of Clifton). In 1998, during a massive remodeling, the Maple Valley branch became the bank's base of operations, as well as becoming the first branch to install an automated teller machine; an ATM has since been installed at all but three branches. The Maple Valley branch was also the last new, non-replacement branch to be built for over twenty years.
In 1989, Clifton Savings changed its name from Clifton Savings and Loan Association to Clifton Savings Bank, SLA.
Clifton Savings opened six new branches in the 2000s. Of the six, three were built to replace existing banks; those locations were in the Athenia section of Clifton and Garfield (as both of the bank's branches were replaced). The other three branches are located in Wallington, Wayne, and Fair Lawn, New Jersey; the former two branches opened in 2003 and the latter in 2009.[1] Clifton Savings' most recent openings are in Lyndhurst, New Jersey, at the site of a former TD Banknorth branch, and in Woodland Park, New Jersey, at the site of a former Capital One Bank branch. Both of these branches were opened in 2010. Clifton Savings' last three openings have been in locations that formerly housed other financial institutions; the Fair Lawn branch was a former Washington Mutual branch that JPMorgan Chase elected not to convert to a Chase branch. Also in 2010, Clifton Savings' Botany branch, after operating for eighty-two years in the neighborhood at three different locations, was shut down by the bank and its accounts were transferred to the Lakeview branch.
In 2015, Clifton Savings announced it would be expanding to Hudson County and opening a branch in Hoboken. The bank also announced it would be shutting down its Albion branch and moving its accounts to the Maple Valley headquarters branch which the bank is now referring to as Montclair Heights. [2] In 2016 Clifton Savings rebranded itself as CSBK and opened a branch in Montclair, New Jersey.
As of March 4, 2017, with the closure of the Woodland Park branch, CSBK operates twelve branches. Four branches are located in its hometown of Clifton, and every branch except for Richfield has an ATM. Half of the branches offer drive-up banking.
Going public[edit]
In 2004, as part of a reorganization, Clifton Savings Bank was reincorporated as a federal mutual holding company and took its current name. Later that year, using the ticker symbol CSBK, the company became a publicly traded company on the NASDAQ stock market. The bank became a federal savings bank in 2007.

Clifton Bancorp, Inc., d/b/a Clifton Savings Bank (abbreviated CSBK) and formerly known as Clifton Savings Bancorp, is a publicly traded American retail savings bank headquartered in Clifton, New Jersey, United States. The bank operates twelve branches in northern New Jersey, five of which are in its home city.

History[edit]
Clifton Savings Bancorp was founded as Botany Building and Loan Association in 1928 in Clifton's Botany Village section of town. The bank became known as East Clifton Building and Loan two years later and assumed the name Clifton Savings and Loan Association in 1954, all while remaining in the Botany section of Clifton; the bank served as the company's headquarters until 1998.
The bank's first branch office was opened in the Richfield section of Clifton in 1954, is located on the portion of Clifton Avenue designated NJ 161, and was the first to offer a drive-up window for banking. Fourteen years later Clifton Savings added a third branch in Clifton's Athenia section, in a storefront located on Van Houten Avenue. Two more branches opened in 1970 and 1971, on Lakeview Avenue and Valley Road in the Lakeview and Albion sections of town.
In 1975 Clifton Savings expanded their operations to outside of their base, opening a branch on Palisade Avenue in neighboring Garfield. Two years later a second Garfield branch opened on Lanza Avenue.
In 1981, Clifton Savings opened two new locations. Both were located on Van Houten Avenue; one was a replacement for the old Athenia storefront branch and the other was a large branch in the Maple Valley section of the city which served as both a bank and the headquarters for Clifton Savings' mortgage lending department (which the bank has since moved to a separate office space in the Allwood section of Clifton). In 1998, during a massive remodeling, the Maple Valley branch became the bank's base of operations, as well as becoming the first branch to install an automated teller machine; an ATM has since been installed at all but three branches. The Maple Valley branch was also the last new, non-replacement branch to be built for over twenty years.
In 1989, Clifton Savings changed its name from Clifton Savings and Loan Association to Clifton Savings Bank, SLA.
Clifton Savings opened six new branches in the 2000s. Of the six, three were built to replace existing banks; those locations were in the Athenia section of Clifton and Garfield (as both of the bank's branches were replaced). The other three branches are located in Wallington, Wayne, and Fair Lawn, New Jersey; the former two branches opened in 2003 and the latter in 2009.[1] Clifton Savings' most recent openings are in Lyndhurst, New Jersey, at the site of a former TD Banknorth branch, and in Woodland Park, New Jersey, at the site of a former Capital One Bank branch. Both of these branches were opened in 2010. Clifton Savings' last three openings have been in locations that formerly housed other financial institutions; the Fair Lawn branch was a former Washington Mutual branch that JPMorgan Chase elected not to convert to a Chase branch. Also in 2010, Clifton Savings' Botany branch, after operating for eighty-two years in the neighborhood at three different locations, was shut down by the bank and its accounts were transferred to the Lakeview branch.
In 2015, Clifton Savings announced it would be expanding to Hudson County and opening a branch in Hoboken. The bank also announced it would be shutting down its Albion branch and moving its accounts to the Maple Valley headquarters branch which the bank is now referring to as Montclair Heights. [2] In 2016 Clifton Savings rebranded itself as CSBK and opened a branch in Montclair, New Jersey.
As of March 4, 2017, with the closure of the Woodland Park branch, CSBK operates twelve branches. Four branches are located in its hometown of Clifton, and every branch except for Richfield has an ATM. Half of the branches offer drive-up banking.
Going public[edit]
In 2004, as part of a reorganization, Clifton Savings Bank was reincorporated as a federal mutual holding company and took its current name. Later that year, using the ticker symbol CSBK, the company became a publicly traded company on the NASDAQ stock market. The bank became a federal savings bank in 2007.

Commercial and multi-family loans drove our loan growth and now represent 29% of our total portfolio. Residential lending remains an important business for us and grew 14% this past year. Focused deposit gathering efforts resulted in a 28% increase in our checking and savings products, advancing our multi-year mission to transform our deposit mix. We also delivered on our commitment to repurchase shares of our common stock at attractive prices as a prudent way to deploy our excess capital. In summary, we are proud of our fiscal year 2017 results and we look forward to continuing to build a competitive franchise.âBalance Sheet and Credit Quality ReviewTotal assets increased $178.7 million, or 14.3%, to $1.43 billion at March 31, 2017 from $1.25 billion at March 31, 2016.

One-to-four family real estate loans increased $84.7 million, or 13.7%, while multi-family and commercial real estate loans increased $140.8 million, or 91.6%, during fiscal 2017.

Securities, including both available for sale and held to maturity issues, decreased $42.1 million, or 11.8%, to $315.3 million at March 31, 2017 from $357.5 million at March 31, 2016, mainly because of calls, maturities and repayments. One security totaling $3.7 million was sold during fiscal 2017, resulting in a gain of $84,000. Cash and cash equivalents decreased $16.4 million, or 52.8%, to $14.7 million at March 31, 2017 from $31.1 million at March 31, 2016, as cash and cash flows were redeployed largely into loans.Deposits increased $150.2 million, or 21.6%, to $844.8 million at March 31, 2017 from $694.7 million at March 31, 2016. Borrowed funds increased $44.3 million, or 19.1%, to $275.8 million at March 31, 2017 from $231.5 million at March 31, 2016. The Companyâs outstanding borrowings at March 31, 2017 had a weighted average rate of 1.74% and a weighted average term of 18 months. All outstanding borrowings are with the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York.Total stockholdersâ equity decreased $18.7 million, or 5.9%, to $296.6 million at March 31, 2017 from $315.3 million at March 31, 2016, primarily as a result of $21.6 million in repurchases of common stock, and the payment of $5.3 million in cash dividends, partially offset by net income of $4.7 million.Nonaccrual loans totaled $3.7 million at both March 31, 2017 and 2016. Included in nonaccrual loans at March 31, 2017 were six loans totaling $1.1 million that were current or less than 90 daysâ delinquent, but which were previously 90 days or more delinquent and on nonaccrual status pending a sustained period of repayment performance (generally six months). The percentage of nonperforming loans to total gross loans decreased to 0.41% at March 31, 2017 from 0.47% at March 31, 2016. The allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans increased to 146.11% at March 31, 2017 from 119.19% at March 31, 2016, as loans grew, nonperforming loans remained constant and provisions were added mainly due to significant increases in loans outstanding.Read MoreIncome Statement ReviewNet interest income increased by $838,000, or 12.5%, to $7.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 as compared to $6.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016. Net interest income increased despite a decrease of 8 basis points in net interest margin and a decrease of $15.0 million in average net interest-earning assets, primarily because other categories of interest-earning assets were redeployed into the Bankâs highest yielding asset category.Net interest income increased by $2.4 million, or 9.2%, to $28.7 million for the year ended March 31, 2017 as compared to $26.2 million for year ended March 31, 2016. Net interest income increased despite a decrease of 8 basis points in net interest margin and a decrease of $33.6 million in average net interest-earning assets, primarily because other categories of interest-earning assets were redeployed into the Bankâs highest yielding asset category.The provision for loan losses decreased $162,000, or 23.0%, to $541,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, as compared to $703,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2016, and increased $920,000, or 86.4%, to $1.99 million for the year ended March 31, 2017, as compared to $1.07 million for the year ended March 31, 2016. The decrease for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was due to the large provision recorded in the 2016 three- month period as a result of the purchase of a $36.5 million package of commercial real estate loans from a local financial institution. The increase in the provision for the year ended March 31, 2017 was mainly because of the significant increases in the balance of outstanding loans, partially offset by more favorable trends in qualitative factors related to delinquencies considered in the periodic reviews of the general valuation allowance.Non-interest expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2017 increased $385,000, or 7.4%, to $5.56 million, as compared to $5.17 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The increase consisted primarily of increases in salaries and employee benefits of $360,000, or 11.6%, and occupancy expense of $117,000, or 27.9%, partially offset by a decrease in directorsâ compensation of $91,000, or 26.3%. The increases in salaries and employee benefits resulted from the hiring of lending and Hoboken and Montclair Banking Center personnel. In addition, expenses reflect typical annual increases in compensation and benefits expenses and employee stock ownership plan expense due to an increase in the price of the Companyâs common stock. The increase in occupancy expense was mainly related to the costs of the Hoboken and Montclair Banking Centers. The decrease in directorsâ compensation was related to the retirement of a board member during the first fiscal quarter of 2016 and the shrinking of the board by one member at that time.Non-interest expenses for the year ended March 31, 2017 increased $2.6 million, or 13.6%, to $21.7 million, as compared to $19.1 million for the year ended March 31, 2016. The increase consisted primarily of increases in salaries and employee benefits of $2.1 million, or 18.5%, occupancy expense of $307,000, or 19.6%, and advertising and marketing expense of $201,000, or 49.5%. The increases in salaries and employee benefits and occupancy expense was a result of the items noted above with respect to the quarterly period. The increase in advertising and marketing expense was mainly related to the costs to promote the Hoboken and Montclair Banking Centers, as well as new products and services.About Clifton Bancorp Inc.Clifton Bancorp Inc. is the holding company for Clifton Savings Bank (CSBK), a federally chartered savings bank headquartered in Clifton, New Jersey.
