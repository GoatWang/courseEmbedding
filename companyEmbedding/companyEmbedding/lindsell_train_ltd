LEGAL INFORMATION
This website is issued and approved by Lindsell Train Limited (LTL), authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority ("FCA") in the United Kingdom with registration number 194229.
When accessing any information or material made available on this website you accept and agree to comply with the terms and conditions as set out below
No Solicitation
The website is provided for information purposes only and does not constitute a recommendation, offer or solicitation to enter into any contract or agreement to provide any investment services, or to apply for, or buy any investments, securities or funds. You acknowledge that your use of this website and requests for information are unsolicited.
Jurisdiction
The information contained in this website is directed only at persons who are resident in the United Kingdom. The information contained in this website is not directed at you if LTL is prohibited by any law of any jurisdiction from making the information on this site available to you and is not intended for any use that would be contrary to local law or regulation. None of the services, investments or funds referred to in this site are available for sale or use in any jurisdiction where such activity is prohibited. This website should not be accessed by any person in the United States. Persons who are resident outside the UK and US should consult their professional advisers or local regulator to satisfy themselves of local regulatory requirements.
Funds
The Funds described in this website can only be marketed in certain jurisdictions. It is your responsibility to be aware of the applicable laws and regulations of your country of residence. Further information is available in the Prospectus and other constitutional documents for each fund. Applications to invest in any fund referred to on this site, must only be made on the basis of the offering documents relating to the specific investment.
The Funds described in the LTL website are not available for general distribution to or sale to US investors. The Funds will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") and the Funds will not be registered under or the Investment Company Act of 1940 (as defined in Regulation S under the Securities Act ) of the United States of America ("USA").

Risk Warning
Investors should consider carefully all specific risks of the products described in this website carefully prior to making an investment. Some general risks to consider include: Past performance of an investment is not a guide to any future performance; the value of investments and any income generated may go down as well as up and is not guaranteed; changes in exchange rates may have an adverse effect on the value, price or income of investments. Some funds e.g. investment trusts have the ability to borrow money in order to make further investments. This is known as "gearing" and can improve returns of an investment in rising markets but can reduce returns in falling markets. Shares in investment trusts can fluctuate in accordance with demand and supply and may not reflect the underlying net asset value of the shares. Depending on market conditions, the spread between a purchase and sale price can vary widely.
Nothing in this site constitutes any investment, legal, tax and other advice and it is not to be relied upon in making any investment decision. If you are unsure about the meaning of any information in this website you should consult your financial or other professional adviser.

Investment Objective
To invest primarily in UK company shares to achieve capital and income growth and provide a total return in excess of that of the FTSE All-Share Index.
There is no guarantee that a positive return will be delivered.
Investment Approach
We aim to achieve the Fund’s objective by constructing a concentrated portfolio of “exceptional” companies, with a focus on those businesses with truly sustainable business models and/or established resonant brands. In building the portfolio we focus on companies demonstrating long-term durability in cash and profit generation.

Bestinvest view

Lindsell Train was established in 2000 by Michael Lindsell and Nick Train and was founded on the shared investment philosophy they developed while working together in the early 1990s. They have a distinct investment style, taking large positions in a small number of high conviction businesses. Given the quality and stability of these businesses this does not necessarily increase risk, and in fact their funds have typically offered a degree of protection in falling markets. Both portfolios and performance have little in common with the index and they have often lagged rising markets, but over time they have outperformed

Investment process

The fund aims to achieve capital and income growth over the long term by investing in a concentrated portfolio of global equities, primarily those listed in developed countries. Despite the focus on developed markets, the managers believe that a company's location can be irrelevant given the increasing level of globalisation. The managers look for durable, cash-generative businesses that will still be profitably in business in 20 years’ time. A sustainable high return on equity and low capital intensity are important fundamentals in identifying potential buys, before the managers calculate an intrinsic value relative to the share price. They believe that companies that are properly researched along these criteria offer relatively low risk, therefore they form a highly concentrated portfolio. This will typically be focused on consumer franchises, but will also include owners of intellectual property and marketplaces. Stock turnover is very low as the managers are relatively insensitive to changes in valuation, considering the quality of the business more important. The portfolio will typically look very different from the index so performance is likely to substantially deviate from its benchmark.

Portfolio details

20-35 companies. Initial position sizes typically 3-6% for major companies, 1-3% for smaller companies.				


Constraints

                
					There are no formal constraints and the portfolio may be concentrated in certain sectors or countries.
                

					The portfolio usually has very little commonality with the benchmark and so performance can be expected to differ markedly on occasions.

Michael Lindsell

                                
A Zoology graduate from Bristol University, Lindsell began his investment career at Lazards in 1982. He joined Scimitar Asset Management in 1985, where he was responsible for Pacific and Japanese mandates, before specialising in Japan. In 1989 he moved to Warburg's London where he was director and head of MAM's Japanese fund management. He joined GT, Tokyo, in 1992 and was CIO as well as being responsible for GT’s Japanese funds and global funds sourced out of Japan. He returned to London in 1997 to assume responsibility for GT's Global and International funds, and following Invesco's aquisition of GT in 1998 he became head of the combined global product team. In 2000 he left Invesco to form his own investment management business, Lindsell Train Ltd, along with Nick Train.				


Track record

Michael Lindsell has 12.8 years experience of managing mutual funds in this sector. Over this period the average monthly return relative to the benchmark index has been +0.49%.

About the MRI

					Our unique indicator: the Bestinvest Manager Record Index (MRI)
					measures the likelihood that the fund manager is adding value through their decisions.
					It is based on their performance record over the course of their career, adjusted
					for the amount of risk taken. MRI is an important contributor to our fund rating
					system but it is also vital to take account of qualitative factors. It is also very
					important to select funds to form a cohesive portfolio with an appropriate overall
					risk level.

                How initial savings affect the buy price



                The initial saving applied to a fund depends on how it is priced. Dual priced funds have two
                different prices (a sell price and a buy price); single priced funds have a single price
                (at which the fund can be bought and sold).

                For dual priced funds the difference between the buy and sell price is made up of the initial
                charge and other costs e.g. the fund manager's dealing costs. The 'initial saving from HL' will
                reduce the buying price, but even with a full discount the buying price may still be higher than
                the selling price.

                For single priced funds the price quoted does not include the 'initial charge'. Any
                'initial charge' after deduction of the 'initial saving from HL' will be added to the price
                quoted.

                Please note that even where a full saving is offered a
                dilution levy could be applied on the way in or out of the fund.

                For full details please see the HL guide to fund prices, savings and yields.

Inclusive - Class A - Income (GBP)

(Net ongoing charge 0.75%)








HMRC believes that from April 2013 rebates of annual charges (such as loyalty bonuses) paid on funds held in nominee accounts, such as our Fund & Share Account, should be subject to income tax. Loyalty bonuses paid on funds in ISAs and SIPPs are unaffected, and they remain tax-free.
 We believe all loyalty bonuses are tax-free and we are challenging HMRC's interpretation. However, while we make this challenge we are paying loyalty bonuses within the Vantage Fund & Share Account net of an amount equivalent to the basic rate tax. If we are successful in our challenge we will return this money to clients. If we are unsuccessful we will use the money to pay over any amounts due to HMRC. 
 If loyalty bonuses are taxable then the value of our ongoing saving to you could be reduced, depending on the rate of tax you pay. The below table gives an indication of how this may affect you.
 In this case, the ongoing saving is 0.20%, of which 0.00% is paid by loyalty bonus. The tax that could be payable on this loyalty bonus, and therefore the value of this saving to you, is shown below.

                    Tax rules can change and benefits depend on individual circumstances. Please remember loyalty bonuses received on funds held in the Vantage ISA or Vantage SIPP are exempt from tax.
                

                    Also, loyalty bonuses received by overseas investors, companies and charities are not required to be paid with the deduction of tax. Therefore, if you are an overseas investor, or you represent a company or charity please let us know if you would like your loyalty bonuses paid without the deduction of an amount equivalent to the basic rate tax.

            In some cases the ongoing savings are provided by our loyalty bonus. Loyalty bonuses are tax-free in an ISA or SIPP.  However, they may be
             subject to tax  in a Fund & Share Account which would, in effect, reduce their value and increase the net ongoing charge.
