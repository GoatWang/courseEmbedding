Leadership / 
       		Lawrence Burian








Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary
The Madison Square Garden Company
Lawrence J. Burian is executive vice president, general counsel and secretary of The Madison Square Garden Company (MSG), a sports and entertainment leader with renowned performance venues, entertainment properties, and professional sports teams. Mr. Burian also serves as general counsel of MSG Networks Inc., which houses two award-winning regional sports and entertainment networks – MSG Network and MSG+.
 
At MSG, Mr. Burian is responsible for advising executive management on key legal and strategic matters and for managing the company's legal department, including all corporate, commercial, transactional, litigation, regulatory and day-to-day legal matters. He also plays a primary role in advancing MSG’s growth strategy, which has recently included investments in the entertainment production company, Boston Calling Events, and TAO Group, a hospitality group with globally-recognized entertainment dining and nightlife brands.  
 
In 2015, Mr. Burian helped lead the successful spin-off of MSG from its predecessor company (previously named The Madison Square Garden Company and now called MSG Networks Inc.) to become a standalone sports and entertainment company. Following the spin-off, MSG Networks Inc. became a standalone media company, for which Mr. Burian continues to oversee and direct all legal affairs. 
 
From 2010 to 2015, Mr. Burian worked at the predecessor company, which included the assets of both MSG Networks Inc. and MSG.  During his six years with the former The Madison Square Garden Company, he played an integral role in the company's key initiatives, including the unprecedented, three-year Transformation of the Madison Square Garden arena and the company’s partnerships with Azoff MSG Entertainment, Tribeca Enterprises and Brooklyn Bowl Las Vegas. He also helped drive the company’s purchase and reinvention of the Forum in Inglewood, CA; and its acquisition of the Westchester Knicks. In 2014, Mr. Burian led the sale of the company's Fuse music television network and, in his first year with the former The Madison Square Garden Company, was a key contributor to its successful spin-off from Cablevision Systems Corporation. 
 
Before joining MSG, Mr. Burian worked for 10 years at Cablevision Systems Corporation, where he played an instrumental role in many of the company's strategic transactions, including the acquisitions of Sundance Channel, Newsday Media Group and 4Connections, as well as the sale of the Fox Sports New England and Fox Sports Bay Area regional sports networks. From 2005 to 2009, Mr. Burian served as senior vice president, associate general counsel and business affairs at Cablevision, providing legal and strategic counsel to the company’s executive management. He also oversaw the legal staff responsible for various corporate legal matters, including real estate and employee benefits, and supported Cablevision's PVI Virtual Media Services subsidiary, including as a board member. Previously, Mr. Burian served as vice president, associate general counsel for three years. He joined Cablevision in 2000 as assistant general counsel.
 
Before joining Cablevision, Mr. Burian was an associate with the law firm of Davis Polk & Wardwell, specializing in mergers and acquisitions, and served in both their New York and London offices. In 1995, he served as a law clerk for then Deputy President (and later President) Aharon Barak of the Supreme Court of Israel in Jerusalem.
 
Mr. Burian serves on the boards of Boston Calling Events, Tribeca Enterprises and Fuse Media. He also serves on the boards of the Garden of Dreams Foundation, a non-profit organization that works closely with all areas of MSG to help brighten the lives of children facing obstacles; the American Society for Yad Vashem, a non-profit that works in partnership with Yad Vashem in Jerusalem to support global Holocaust remembrance, research and education; and ElderServe Health (“RiverSpring Health”) and the affiliated Hebrew Home at Riverdale, non-profits that provide a wide variety of care and service programs for older adults across the greater New York area.
 
Mr. Burian holds a doctorate of jurisprudence from Yale Law School and received his Bachelor of Arts in economics from Yeshiva University in New York, where he graduated summa cum laude. Mr. Burian lives in Westchester with his wife and four children.

About Peer Rating
Martindale-Hubbell® Peer Review Ratings™ are the gold standard in attorney ratings, and have been for more than a century. These ratings indicate attorneys who are widely respected by their peers for their ethical standards and legal expertise in a specific area of practice.


The Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings process is the gold standard due to its objectivity and comprehensiveness. Lawyers solicited for peer reviews include both those selected by the attorney being reviewed and lawyers independently selected by Martindale-Hubbell. All reviewers are verified as attorneys through Martindale-Hubbell's extensive attorney database. Only attorneys practicing at least three years and receiving a sufficient number of reviews from non-affiliated attorneys are eligible to receive a Rating.
What are the different Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings?
AV Preeminent®: The highest peer rating standard. This rating signifies that a large number of the lawyer's peers rank him or her at the highest level of professional excellence for their legal knowledge, communication skills and ethical standards.
Distinguished: An excellent rating for a lawyer with some experience. This rating indicates the attorney is widely respected by their peers for high professional achievement and ethical standards.
Notable: This rating indicates that the lawyer has been recognized by a large number of their peers for strong ethical standards.
Lawyers who have received peer reviews after 2009 will display more detailed information, including practice areas, summary ratings, detailed numeric ratings and written feedback (if available). Details for individual reviews received before 2009 are not displayed.
Attorneys that receive reviews from their peers, but not a sufficient number to establish a Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Rating, will have those reviews display on our websites.
For more information on Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings™, please visit our Ratings Page on Martindale.com and our Frequently Asked Questions
Close ×




About Client Rating
The Martindale-Hubbell® Client Review Ratings™ display reviews submitted by clients of lawyers and law firms.


The Client Review Rating score is determined through aggregation of validated responses. People who submit reviews are clients of law firms who hired a lawyer within the last year, whose matter is not pending and who want to share their experience of that lawyer or law firm with other potential clients. Reviewers can be anyone who hires a lawyer including in-house counsel, corporate executives, small business owners and private individuals.
Martindale-Hubbell validates that the reviewer is a person with a valid email address. As part of the review process, respondents must affirm that they have been a client of the lawyer or law firm identified within the past year, although Martindale-Hubbell cannot confirm the lawyer/client relationship as it is often confidential. The content of the responses are entirely from client reviewers.
Prior results do not guarantee a similar outcome and Martindale-Hubbell accepts no responsibility for the content or accuracy of any review.

See what people like you are saying about BeenVerified







Natasha, Oklahoma
Nursing Student
"My daughter recently went out for soccer. I decided it would be a good idea to run another player’s father through BeenVerified. Turns out this guy had been charged with indecent exposure and was on parole."


Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"


Bob M, New Jersey
Retired Detective
"I am retired and have a ministry helping the dying and sick. I found a son and the mother was dying of cancer. She held on waiting for her son who had not been in touch for years."


Rhonda, Missouri
Caring Mom
"I'm a single mother dating online and I use BeenVerified to help protect my family!"









More Testimonials





From the Press
Gizmodo.com
"It found my photos on Flickr, my Amazon wishlist, my public Foursquare records, Vimeo, Picassa, and Stumbleupon accounts. It grabbed approximately twelve bajillion photos of me (with many, many false positives) and even more web links."


From the Press
U.S. News & World Report
"BeenVerified easily and inexpensively provides access to public records information through its website and several mobile phone applications. No longer are large corporations the only ones who can afford background checks."


From the Press
NBC 6 Miami
"Instant information… Court documents, mortgage deeds, criminal records right in the palm of your hand."
