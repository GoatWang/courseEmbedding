Investment Philosophy
We are domestic equity investors with a bias toward long-term investing. We seek superior returns without undue risk to capital. Our focus is on undervalued companies with strong management, strong free cash flow, and a shareholder orientation. Independent research, personal relationships with management teams and investment discipline have allowed us to generate superior investment results over the past decade.
Investment Strategy: Primarily U.S. equities. Long only. No leverage or derivatives
Investment Objective: Long-term growth of capital and capital preservation.
Diversification: Generally hold 15 to 25 stocks per portfolio with no more than a 5% concentration in any one security. These amounts may vary depending on the circumstances.
Research: Independent research focused on bottom-up company analysis.
Our targeted investments are companies with the following attributes:

Operating in industries that we actively follow and believe we understand well; for the most part, industries that we have been involved with throughout our careers.
Sustainable, industry-leading market positions generating significant cash flow.
Restructurings, reorganizations or other turnaround situations where we know the management team, understand the industry, and feel the market is incorrectly pricing the opportunity.

What are analysts saying about Crown Holdings stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Crown Holdings stock: 
1. KeyCorp analysts commented, "We are increasing our 2017 adj. EPS estimate from $3.95 to $4.02 (guidance is $3.90- $4.05) on account of fewer shares outstanding, lower interest expense, lower D&A expense, and better operations; we had already incorporated a $1.14 euro rate into our estimates two weeks ago. Of CCK’s $0.07-$0.08 guidance increase, $0.03-$0.04 was FX, ~$0.02 was lower interest expense, and the rest was better operations. CCK did not increase its FCF guidance on account of a one-time payment, which offset the boost to net income guidance. Consequently, we are maintaining our 2017 FCF estimate of $365 million, which is lower than CCK’s guidance of $425 million because we are deducting dividends to minority interests (which the Company does not). For perspective, dividends to minorities in 1H17 were $37 million. We are assuming flat FCF in 2018 because we expect capex to be the same as in 2017 ($450 million). Our 2018 adj." (7/20/2017)
2. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Crown Holdings' estimates have been going up lately. The company expects adjusted diluted earnings per share for the second quarter in the range of $1.05–$1.15 and for 2017  to be in the range of $3.80–$4.00. To meet growing beverage can demand, Crown Holdings intends to build new facilities and is poised to gain from the geographic expansion of its beverage can lines. Additionally, the company will gain from potential strategic acquisitions in geographic areas and product lines. Further, the company has an impressive positive record of earnings surprises in the past few quarters. Its estimates have gone up lately." (7/10/2017)
3. Jefferies Group LLC analysts commented, "While CCK is facing some headwinds, it's managing it well and we expect earnings to inflect in 2018. Separately, following a multi-year reinvestment cycle, FCF generation should accelerate next year and we remain comfortable with our Buy." (2/6/2017)

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Crown Holdings (NYSE:CCK) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 4 Hold Ratings, 5 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 2.56)Consensus Price Target: $63.00 (5.30% upside)
