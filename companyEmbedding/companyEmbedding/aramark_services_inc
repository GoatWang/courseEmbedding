FOOD THAT ENRICHES EXPERIENCES






When great food turns a meal into a memory, we know we’ve done our job.







Food inspired by the people we serve.
A revitalizing lunch that powers a team through the workday. 
A warm meal that fuels students through finals. 
The essential nutrients that help a patient recover.
A game-time snack that energizes the most devoted fan.
We create memorable food experiences wherever people work, learn, recover and play.
Whether it’s designing an innovative menu based on consumer insights, setting high service standards, or ensuring we have the right people with the right skills, we put those we serve at the core of what we do.
Our approach is simple:

Craft chef-inspired menus with high-quality ingredients 
Encourage healthier living with nutritious options
Offer convenience that fits different lifestyles
Enable personalized experiences through exceptional service

We believe that excellent food can enhance experiences and empower people to be better. So we work to channel our passion for food into enriching and nourishing the lives we touch. And we do it with a singular goal: to enable great food experiences that go beyond what’s expected.








OUR PASSION FOR FOOD GOES INTO EVERY ITEM WE CRAFT.
See how we feed people’s desire for experiences that matter.













WE BRING FLAVOR TO MANY INDUSTRIES AND SETTINGS

About Aramark in San Francisco
Aramark Building Community is a global philanthropic and volunteer program focused on strengthening the critical work of local community centers serving families in need. Aramark partners with local community centers around the world to address their primary areas of need – job readiness, nutrition and wellness, and access to safe and enriching neighborhood gathering places. 





Aramark Volunteers in the San Francisco Community
Our San Francisco team volunteered Alameda County Food Bank sorting and packaging donated food. We also participated in an ABC event at Precita Valley Community Center/Precita Muralists Art Center last year where our team assisted with building picnic tables and other furniture and painting and decorating the community center.




Customer Testimonials in the San Francisco Area
"When Amy (Aramark Sales Consultant) told me better refreshments (especially coffee), would make a big difference in office performance, I thought she was just being a sales person. Well, we gave it a try. In less than a week, everyone was happier with better morale. In two weeks, one of our employees added a major account which we can attribute to the better morale. The service has more than paid for itself. I highly recommend getting this service. Aramark is great."Kelly LamExecutive DirectorWorldwide Boaters Safety Group

FOOD THAT ENRICHES EXPERIENCES






When great food turns a meal into a memory, we know we’ve done our job.







Food inspired by the people we serve.
A revitalizing lunch that powers a team through the workday. 
A warm meal that fuels students through finals. 
The essential nutrients that help a patient recover.
A game-time snack that energizes the most devoted fan.
We create memorable food experiences wherever people work, learn, recover and play.
Whether it’s designing an innovative menu based on consumer insights, setting high service standards, or ensuring we have the right people with the right skills, we put those we serve at the core of what we do.
Our approach is simple:

Craft chef-inspired menus with high-quality ingredients 
Encourage healthier living with nutritious options
Offer convenience that fits different lifestyles
Enable personalized experiences through exceptional service

We believe that excellent food can enhance experiences and empower people to be better. So we work to channel our passion for food into enriching and nourishing the lives we touch. And we do it with a singular goal: to enable great food experiences that go beyond what’s expected.








OUR PASSION FOR FOOD GOES INTO EVERY ITEM WE CRAFT.
See how we feed people’s desire for experiences that matter.













WE BRING FLAVOR TO MANY INDUSTRIES AND SETTINGS
