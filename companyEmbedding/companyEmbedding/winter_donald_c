Donald Charles Winter (born June 15, 1948)[1] is an American businessman who served as United States Secretary of the Navy. A former top executive of TRW, Aerospace & Defense, he was nominated in 2005 by President George W. Bush, confirmed by the United States Senate, and took the oath of office on January 3, 2006. In January 2009 Defense Secretary Gates requested that Winter remain in office until President Obama picked his successor on March 13, 2009.[2] He resigned on March 13.[3]
Life and career[edit]
Winter earned a bachelor's degree (with highest distinction) in physics from the University of Rochester in 1969. He received a master's degree in 1970, and a doctorate in physics in 1972, from the University of Michigan.
He joined the aerospace technology company TRW in 1972, and directed laser physics projects in Redondo Beach, California. By 1978, he was head of the optics department there.
In 1980, Winter received a three-year appointment to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), serving under Dr. Bob Cooper during the very early years of research into the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) proposed by President Ronald Reagan. Winter's main responsibility was for Talon Gold, an advanced acquisition, tracking, and pointing experiment in space. During that period, he was awarded the Secretary of Defense's Medal for Meritorious Civilian Service.

In 1982, Winter resigned from his DARPA appointment early and returned to TRW, where he held senior systems engineering and program management responsibilities for a variety of space system programs for the next eight years. From 1990 through 1997, as vice president and general manager of the defense systems division of TRW's Space & Electronics (S&E) business, Winter directed space systems activities that supported the national defense effort.
Winter was president and CEO of TRW Systems from January 2000 until its acquisition by Northrop Grumman in December 2002. After the Northrop acquisition, Winter became head of Northrop Grumman Mission Systems until his nomination by President Bush to become the civilian head of the Department of the Navy.

1/3/2006 - 3/13/2009The Honorable Donald C. WinterRetired 3/13/2009




Donald C. Winter is the 74th Secretary of the Navy, sworn into office on Jan. 3, 2006. As Secretary of the Navy, Winter leads America's Navy and Marine Corps Team and is responsible for an annual budget in excess of $125 billion and almost 900,000 people. Prior to joining the administration of President George W. Bush, Winter served as a corporate vice president and president of Northrop Grumman's Mission Systems sector. In that position he oversaw operation of the business and its 18,000 employees, providing information technology systems and services; systems engineering and analysis; systems development and integration; scientific, engineering, and technical services; and enterprise management services. Winter also served on the company's corporate policy council. Previously, Winter served as president and CEO of TRW Systems; vice president and deputy general manager for group development of TRW’s Space & Electronics business; and vice president and general manager of the defense systems division of TRW. From 1980 to 1982, he was with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency as program manager for space acquisition, tracking, and pointing programs. The Secretary of the Navy is responsible for all the affairs of the Department of the Navy, including recruiting, organizing, supplying, equipping, training, mobilizing, and demobilizing. The Secretary also oversees the construction, outfitting, and repair of naval ships, equipment and facilities. The office is also responsible for the formulation and implementation of naval policies and programs that are consistent with the national security policies and objectives established by the President and the Secretary of Defense. The Department of the Navy consists of two uniformed Services: the United States Navy and the United States Marine Corps. Winter earned a bachelor’s degree (with highest distinction) in physics from the University of Rochester in 1969. He received a master’s degree and a doctorate in physics from the University of Michigan in 1970 and 1972, respectively. He is a 1979 graduate of the USC Management Policy Institute, a 1987 graduate of the UCLA Executive Program, and a 1991 graduate of the Harvard University Program for Senior Executives in National and International Security. In 2002, he was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering.

Honorable Donald C. Winter
Professor of Engineering Practice


 
 




Donald C. Winter is Professor of Engineering Practice at the University of Michigan. He served as the 74th Secretary of the Navy from January 2006 to March 2009. Previously, Dr. Winter held multiple positions in the aerospace and defense industry as a systems engineer, program manager and corporate executive. Dr. Winter received a doctorate in physics from the University of Michigan in 1972. He was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering in 2002, and was the chair of the NAE committee that investigated the Deepwater Horizon incident for the Secretary of the Interior.
His first position in industry was with TRW Systems where he was mentored by Simon Ramo, one of the founders of TRW, and a principle developer of the construct of systems engineering across engineering and non-engineering domains. After this, Prof. Winter became involved in a wide range of activities including satellite systems, large information technology programs, and ship building activities.
Throughout his career, many of the issues and challenges associated with the development of very large systems and very complex products have illustrated the need for systems engineering, and he uses many of these as examples in class. As Secretary of the Navy he reviewed many different ongoing development programs such as ships, air craft, and IT systems and found that the programs that used a reasonably developed engineering systems approach were doing far better than those in which the process was short circuited or ignored entirely.
 Professor Winter talks about his long career in systems engineering and its importance in modern engineering education.

                           The acoustic-optical imaging process utilizes Bragg diffraction of lightly by a beam of sound to produce an optical image
                              of an acoustically irradiated object. Inasmuch as many materials which are quite opaque to light are, to varying degrees,
                              transparent to certain acoustic frequencies, the technique offers the possibility of visually examining the internal structure
                              of optically opaque bodies. The imaging of internal features is made possible by the fact that different materials and structures
                              often have different acoustic characteristics, thus causing the sound to be reflected, scattered, absorbed and diffracted.
                              These factors cause perturbation in the acoustic wavefronts which are transformed in the light-sound interaction into a visual
                              image, in real time, which may be observed by eye photographed by a camera, or processed by other conventional optical methods.
                              This program was directed toward an evaluation of the acoustic-optical imaging technique as a means of detecting bubbles formed
                              in the circulatory system during decompression. (Author)

Statement of Honorable Donald C. Winter, Secretary of the Navy, before the House Armed Services Committee(

                           Mr. Chairman, Mr. Ranking Member, and Members of the Committee, it is an honor to appear before you representing the brave
                              men and women of the United States Navy and the United States Marine Corps active, reserve, and civilian over 800,000 strong.
                              Over the past year, I have had many opportunities to meet with Sailors and Marines who are stationed both within the continental
                              United States and abroad. I have traveled three times to the Central Command Area of Responsibility including Iraq. During
                              my visits I have had countless conversations with our young Sailors and Marines. I am continually amazed at how dedicated
                              and committed they are to carrying out their duties -- without question, without complaint. Our Sailors and Marines recognize
                              the significance of their mission. They remain determined to win the current war and are committed to defending our Nation
                              against future threats. They are the very best and they deserve the very best from their leadership in the Pentagon and on
                              Capitol Hill. Today, I am here to present the Department of the Navy's plan to support our Sailors and Marines in their mission
                              to fight the Global War on Terror and to defend our Nation against future challenges. I believe the President's Fiscal Year
                              2008 budget request for the Navy and Marine Corps provides them what they need and I ask that you support this request submitted
                              to Congress on February 5, 2007. The Department of the Navy's budget signifies a vital investment in our Navy and Marine Corps.
                              In its totality, this budget represents $160 billion in requested funding for FY 2008, including the estimated costs of the
                              Global War on Terror

Donald Charles Winter (born June 15, 1948)[1] is an American businessman who served as United States Secretary of the Navy. A former top executive of TRW, Aerospace & Defense, he was nominated in 2005 by President George W. Bush, confirmed by the United States Senate, and took the oath of office on January 3, 2006. In January 2009 Defense Secretary Gates requested that Winter remain in office until President Obama picked his successor on March 13, 2009.[2] He resigned on March 13.[3]
Life and career[edit]
Winter earned a bachelor's degree (with highest distinction) in physics from the University of Rochester in 1969. He received a master's degree in 1970, and a doctorate in physics in 1972, from the University of Michigan.
He joined the aerospace technology company TRW in 1972, and directed laser physics projects in Redondo Beach, California. By 1978, he was head of the optics department there.
In 1980, Winter received a three-year appointment to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), serving under Dr. Bob Cooper during the very early years of research into the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) proposed by President Ronald Reagan. Winter's main responsibility was for Talon Gold, an advanced acquisition, tracking, and pointing experiment in space. During that period, he was awarded the Secretary of Defense's Medal for Meritorious Civilian Service.




Winter sworn in as Secretary of the Navy, January 2006.

In 1982, Winter resigned from his DARPA appointment early and returned to TRW, where he held senior systems engineering and program management responsibilities for a variety of space system programs for the next eight years. From 1990 through 1997, as vice president and general manager of the defense systems division of TRW's Space & Electronics (S&E) business, Winter directed space systems activities that supported the national defense effort.
Winter was president and CEO of TRW Systems from January 2000 until its acquisition by Northrop Grumman in December 2002. After the Northrop acquisition, Winter became head of Northrop Grumman Mission Systems until his nomination by President Bush to become the civilian head of the Department of the Navy.

Donald Charles Winter (born June 15, 1948)[1] is an American businessman who served as United States Secretary of the Navy. A former top executive of TRW, Aerospace & Defense, he was nominated in 2005 by President George W. Bush, confirmed by the United States Senate, and took the oath of office on January 3, 2006. In January 2009 Defense Secretary Gates requested that Winter remain in office until President Obama picked his successor on March 13, 2009.[2] He resigned on March 13.[3]
Life and career[edit]
Winter earned a bachelor's degree (with highest distinction) in physics from the University of Rochester in 1969. He received a master's degree in 1970, and a doctorate in physics in 1972, from the University of Michigan.
He joined the aerospace technology company TRW in 1972, and directed laser physics projects in Redondo Beach, California. By 1978, he was head of the optics department there.
In 1980, Winter received a three-year appointment to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), serving under Dr. Bob Cooper during the very early years of research into the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) proposed by President Ronald Reagan. Winter's main responsibility was for Talon Gold, an advanced acquisition, tracking, and pointing experiment in space. During that period, he was awarded the Secretary of Defense's Medal for Meritorious Civilian Service.

In 1982, Winter resigned from his DARPA appointment early and returned to TRW, where he held senior systems engineering and program management responsibilities for a variety of space system programs for the next eight years. From 1990 through 1997, as vice president and general manager of the defense systems division of TRW's Space & Electronics (S&E) business, Winter directed space systems activities that supported the national defense effort.
Winter was president and CEO of TRW Systems from January 2000 until its acquisition by Northrop Grumman in December 2002. After the Northrop acquisition, Winter became head of Northrop Grumman Mission Systems until his nomination by President Bush to become the civilian head of the Department of the Navy.

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator

The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
