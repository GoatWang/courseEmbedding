dsTest Network Testing Solutions and Interfaces
dsTest offers server emulation and client simulation capabilities for comprehensive testing of 3GPP 3G/4G/5G core network interface functionality and performance.   Select the interfaces required to accomplish your testing goals–surround a network element with client simulators that simulate client activity,  or provision a server emulator with the interfaces necessary to support end-to-end testing, test agents and proxies using both client simulation and server emulation.  Test your LTE, EPC, eMBMS, SMS, WLAN Offload, VoLTE and CIoT networks or gather Big Data to support the identification of patterns and that will provide new business opportunities, revenues, and efficiencies  to network operations.  dsTest is a software product that provides an environment that supports the goals of network function virtualization (NFV) and Software Defined Networking (SDN).  See Overview, Capacity and Performance, and Architecture for dsTest specifics.

Test serving network element subscriber session and mobility management functionality with our HSS and HLR server emulators. Test HSS, HLR, and EIR capacity and performance with our interface simulator applications.







Test serving network element policy, credit, and charging functionality with our PCRF, OCS, OFCS and gsmSCF server emulators.  Test the capacity and performance of policy and credit management servers with our interface simulation applications.  With the PCRF and TDF, use DPI to identify gather Big Data patterns to identify new business opportunities, revenues, and efficiencies  to network operations.  In addition to the interfaces shown above, we also support RADIUS, 3GPP RADIUS, and NASREQ.

MTC/CIoTdsTest OverviewCapacity & PerformanceArchitecture





Machine-to-Machine/Machine Type Communications/Internet of Things (IoT)






dsTest is targeted for network equipment manufacturers and service providers to enable reduced time to market of new services while ensuring the network quality and performance requirements are not compromised.  It allows you to validate the network performance and capacity in a realistic network environment with a mix of subscriber profiles, replicating a deployed configuration.
Designed explicitly to facilitate the cost-effective testing of high performance protocols and applications, dsTest is focused on 3G and 4G core network service interfaces to support your network evolution testing.  A suite of common components expedites the development cycle, allowing us to provide testing capabilities in a timeframe that can assist both vendors and carriers during the development and deployment of the evolved core network.  dsTest provides a base from which new protocols and applications can be quickly developed to support new standards or custom protocols and applications.

Measure call performance and capacity
Verify new mobility features and standards before deployment
Identify performance ceilings and bottlenecks
Validate system scalability with easily scalable subscriber loads
Plan capacity
Interactive control and monitoring for real-time test configuration, event triggering, and measurement sampling
Unattended test modes for users creating real-world scenarios with heavy load and long-duration stability tests

Network interface applications (client simulators or service node emulators) are individually licensed, allowing you to purchase only the interface functionality that your test plans require.  Applications focus on true emulation rather than scripted commands and responses.  Support node emulators implement interaction between active interfaces where applicable when more than one interface is licensed.






In an optimal configuration, dsTest supports the following maximums on the reference platform:

More than 200,000,000 subscribers, depending on memory capacity and emulator configuration (number of nodes, number of interfaces, and the number of features enabled)
Expanded memory capacity results in a nearly linear expansion of subscriber/session capacity
Up to 40,000 transactions per second per active core (an application layer request/response exchange is considered a transaction)

Performance can be impacted by:

the number of messages required for each call
the amount of subscriber data required for each message
the number of features enabled
the cache structure/size
the memory bus and I/O throughput
the number of CPU cores and CPU clock speed

Capacity is largely based on the amount of available memory and can also be impacted by the configuration.
