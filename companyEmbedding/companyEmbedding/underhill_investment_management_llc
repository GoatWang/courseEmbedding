Sell Discipline - Underhill Investment Management LLC.





















































SELL DISCIPLINE

Most investors, if asked, would say that knowing when to sell is much more difficult than knowing when to buy. We agree. We have defined criteria for selling, although we retain conviction in owning great companies for long periods of time. Despite what happened to stocks in the 1930's, the 1970's and in the severe downdraft of 2007-2009, there are numerous companies whose earnings streams have expanded powerfully over decades and have made large amounts of money for their long term shareholders.
Despite our wish to reduce risk and to avoid loss of principal, we remind investors that being largely in cash is a terrible way to face the prospect of the risk of inflation that will likely be the result of the enormous jumps in government deficit spending and the expansion of the monetary base by the Federal Reserve. Under similar circumstances cash became worthless in 1920s Germany. The value of the 1965 U.S. dollar is about 10 cents. We therefore remain advocates of owning important amounts of equities, notwithstanding the need to hold a prudent degree of other liquid assets whether it is bonds or other liquid short term assets. Nonetheless, there are times to sell stocks.
Certainly, stocks of companies in more cyclical industries need to be trimmed or sold when times are ebullient and such stocks have one of their typical, cyclical big advances in earnings. Otherwise, like Sisyphus, it will be the investors' fate to push the descended stone back up the hill again. Industries such as autos, housing, steel, mining and chemicals fit this category. Normally, we have only limited exposure to companies in these fields because they do not generally possess the investment criteria we seek; for example, sustainably strong ROIC or operating margins, high barriers to entry, and lots of free cash flow, among other things are not found abundantly in these industries.
Stocks can become overpriced just as they can occasionally become undervalued, for long periods of time. We do not concern ourselves if a stock we like experiences modest over-valuation. A 10%-20% over-valuation does not bother us much. To exit a stock for a short time, and to try to reenter a few points lower is too much like trading and cannot be done consistently by anyone we know. On the other hand, when a stock is discounting earnings expectations several years into the future or where the P/E ratio is substantially higher than its historical range, we may cut back the position materially or completely exit the stock.
Then, sometimes our judgment is just plain faulty, and we have to admit a mistake was made in the initial analysis and decision to invest. This tends to happen where the research we have done missed some important consideration, or we missed a change in competitive conditions. In such instances, we will cut our losses to live for another day.
Of course, sometimes we come up with a new idea that is better than something we already own.
We footnote this discussion with the statement that in decades of investing, the opportunity cost of exiting stocks too early has far outdistanced the losses sustained in owning stocks that simply went down after we invested. Patience is still a necessary ingredient of successful investing. 








































Underhill's Investment Process - Underhill Investment Management LLC.





















































THE INVESTMENT PROCESS

PORTFOLIO MANAGERS ARE RESEARCH ANALYSTS:
We do not have a typical investment management industry hierarchical structure of portfolio managers supported by a layer of junior analysts that do most of the actual research work, visiting the companies and reporting back to headquarters. Too many things are lost in the handoff in such a structure, in which the portfolio manager never gets his hands dirty. Such structures are frequently seen as necessary in large or even medium sized investment management companies. How else can they try to stay on top of 50-100 companies they seem to think are necessary for proper diversification? It is not the quantity of researchers that lead to good performance; otherwise the large investment managers would have the best numbers. Clearly, that is not the case. There is no correlation between size of an investment organization and results.
RESEARCH DRIVEN: Over the last several decades, the portfolio managers at Underhill Investment Management have examined hundreds of companies. We make sure we visit most of the companies we own, many on a regular basis and, of course, we supplement this coverage with phone calls, conference calls and by attending investment conferences and various trade shows. Visiting companies and getting to know their people gives us a better understanding of the company and allows the management of the company to gradually become more comfortable with us. We also develop our own detailed financial models on each holding. Over the years we have built extensive Rolodexes of contacts across various industries as well as long relationships with a number of especially outstanding analysts on Wall Street who we utilize as "sanity checks".
CONCENTRATED PORTFOLIOS: We concentrate our clients' investment monies and do not overdiversify.  It has been shown that once a portfolio of common stocks gets much beyond 15 or so companies, without having more than one stock in any industry, adding one position reduces risk from concentration by less than 1%. Focusing on three or four handfuls of stocks allows us to know our companies better.  We believe over-diversification is a major cause of mediocre performance.
LONG TIME HORIZON: When we find a truly great company we tend to hold the stock for a very long time, thereby giving management the years to fully exploit its competitive advantages and allowing the magic of compounding to impact the portfolio for several years or more.  Some of our holdings we started to buy in the last century.


INVESTMENT CRITERIA
Our #1 and #2 investment criteria in importance are high barriers to entry and a durable competitive advantage.
Usually you don't get one without the other. A distinct competitive leg up may come in many forms, from proprietary one-of-a-kind products to a superior distribution set up, to low cost producer status, but it is nearly always accompanied by, or leads to, a high barrier to entry and the ideal of most businesses --- limited competition. Such a situation will not last long if the barriers to entry fall and the competitive advantages erode.
Other important criteria include:
     
  
  1. Open-ended growing markets.
  
    
         2. A leadership brand franchise like Heinz in catsup, Coca Cola        in soft drinks or Frito-Lay in snack foods.
  
  
       3. Being first into a market, like Federal Express.
  
  
       4. A long time proven track record.
  
  
       5. Cash flow well in excess of capital spending.
  
  
       6. The ability to self-finance growth.
  
  
       7. Management that allocates capital well and that owns goodly         amounts of the stock, or whose compensation is highly                   dependent on growing earnings.
  
  
       8. Consistently above average returns on invested capital and            operating margins.
  
  
       9. Pricing power of the company's products.
  
  
     10. Little or no debt.
  
  
     11. A rising dividend. 






MARGIN OF SAFETY
THE KEY TO OUR PRICING DISCIPLINE: Our pricing discipline is based on the standard "margin of safety" concept, which Ben Graham and Warren Buffett, among many other successful investors have called amongst the most important ideas in investing. Margin of safety is our key to pricing discipline in "buying low" and also, in reducing risk. By margin of safety, we mean a cushion or discount should exist between our assessment of fair or intrinsic value and what is paid for a stock.
We believe a major cause of mediocre performance is not just poor stock selection but investing in otherwise terrific companies at high or non-bargain prices.
Gains from holding some very good companies thus become average unless the stocks are bought at those rare times, such as the mid-1970's, 1981-2, 1987, 1990, 1994-5, etc., when great company stocks become a bargain.  Anyone knows that PepsiCo, Proctor & Gamble, and Schlumberger are fine companies but the question is when to buy them.
The traditional stock pricing mechanism in our business is to project earnings 5-10 years into the future (good luck!), and then discount those earnings by a chosen discount percentage to arrive at a valuation one is willing to pay for a stock. A terminal value is also assumed. This approach involves too many estimates and too many guesses, in our opinion.
Historically, earnings multiples tend to eventually approximate the return on invested capital (ROIC) of a particular company. The purchase of a high-grade stock at a discount to the ROIC thus tends to greatly reduce the risk of common stock investing via taking advantage of a temporary mispricing. This approach takes historic ROIC and requires an earnings multiple at a discount, the larger the better. Return on invested capital is merely net income after taxes divided by the total of long term debt plus common and preferred equity.  This methodology uses primarily historic and audited numbers, not much in the way of guesswork. Such a margin of safety doesn't guarantee success but, we believe, it greatly reduces market risk and enlarges appreciation potential.

Underhill's Investment Philosophy - Underhill Investment Management LLC.





















































OUR INVESTMENT PHILOSOPHY

Our singular devotion to traditional investment in stocks and bonds means   that we exclude all sorts of other lately popular and exotic vehicles such as venture capital, private equity, commodities and derivatives. The   portfolios of our various clients will have a large number of stocks in common, but the portfolios are nevertheless tailored according to our   clients' specific objectives, income requirements and risk profiles. With this careful, traditional philosophy practiced for many years, we are   steadfast and accomplished in our endeavor to deliver long term value for our clients.

THE SEVEN CORNERSTONES OF THE UNDERHILL INVESTMENT PHILOSOPHY
ALL-CAPITALIZATION:  We are an All-Cap manager, tending to shift our emphasis to where we find value, be it large, mid or small capitalization companies. Being an All-Cap manager we do not confine our investments to boxes like large cap growth or small cap value that may become overpriced for long periods of time.
GARP: We describe ourselves as GARP investors (Growth At a Reasonable Price). We are growth oriented but we do not buy growth stocks at any price just because the story is exciting. The latter approach has been tried and found wanting. A great deal of performance derives from keeping the price one pays for a stock, the denominator, low. By doing that, the numerator, the amount the stock can appreciate, has more potential upside. Keeping the denominator low also reduces quantitative or market risk. More on that topic will be discussed in a later section. We are not so doctrinaire toward growth stocks that we don't occasionally buy so-called value stocks or depressed cyclical companies' stocks when the price is right and we can see change coming.
CONCENTRATED: Since we focus on 15-18 above average American companies we can find at "our" price, we can afford to be very selective, using only our best ideas. We do not have to reach for marginal ideas in order to "fill out" a portfolio. We can be quite selective. By focusing our research on a few outstanding companies, we can spend the time to know our portfolio companies well.  We believe managers of over-diversified mutual funds or portfolios with 50-100 stocks have an almost impossible job keeping up with that many companies, while simultaneously researching new ideas.
LOW TURNOVER: Our turnover is low because our holding period is generally several years. High turnover of 50%-100% is also typical of many managers and makes focusing on any one company very difficult. Such high turnover results in excessive commissions and frictional costs that tend to erode capital and performance. Although traditional "Buy and Hold" investing has not been a reliable strategy over the past few years, it has stood the test of time for most of the last 200 years; it is a strategy we understand and with which we are comfortable.
STOCK-PICKERS: We are old fashioned, bottom up stock pickers in that we use fundamental research which relies mostly on our own work and network of contacts. We visit and speak with various companies around the country, and their respective competitors, suppliers, and customers. We are not market timers, nor are we top down thinkers, although we do pay attention to the macroeconomic picture and particularly now to shifts in government regulation. Historically, market timing has performed poorly verses individual stock selection. To exit markets adroitly, and to reenter on a timely basis is an ideal that is rarely accomplished. However, many American fortunes, including the majority of those in the Forbes 400, have been achieved by buying and holding a few great companies for many years.
QUALITY HOLDINGS: Typically, our top holdings have an average return on capital (net income divided by the total of long term debt and shareholders' equity) of over 20% and an average operating profit margin in the high teens. Well over half of our portfolio companies have little or no debt. We have saved our clients a lot of money over the years by avoiding companies with leveraged or complicated balance sheets, another advantage of closely following a few outstanding companies.
CAPITAL PRESERVATION: Our highest investment priority is to preserve capital, that is, not to dent principal as it can take years of growth to make up a year or two of negative results. Of course we want to build capital over time which we seek to do by
                             not overpaying for a few outstanding companies.  We seek to identify superbly managed, unique businesses, with limited competition, sound balance sheets (usually debt-free or nearly so), and plenty of free cash flow, that retain their edge over the
                             competition.


 We like companies with proven track records, durably high returns on capital, high barriers to entry, and the kind of management with which you would enjoy working.
With this careful approach, practiced for many years, we hope to outperform the general market averages, not every year, but more often than not, and certainly in the 5-10 year time frame. No one, not even Warren Buffett, outperforms the market every year, but to do it over time is our incessant goal. When available at reasonable or bargain prices, such firms as described above provide the core of a portfolio that becomes a long term weapon in what the legendary E.F. Hutton broker Gerald M. Loeb called "the battle for investment survival."
