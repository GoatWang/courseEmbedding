Kinney Group   |  Our History






















 















Driven by a vision and an ethos







Our History
Kinney Group was founded in 2006 by Jim Kinney with a simple vision:
To harness the power and promise of information technology to improve people’s lives.
From humble beginnings in Jim Kinney’s Indiana home, the company has grown to more than 60 employees at our Indianapolis office, with impressive year-over-year revenue growth.
Since cutting his teeth in the 80s as part of the rapidly changing data processor world, Jim remains driven by an insatiable curiosity for technological evolution and a fascination with making technology deliver simple, real, demonstrable human benefits.
Our founder’s enduring career in technology combined with his entrepreneurial spirit have resulted in a contemporary offering with a 21st century culture. The imperative to improve people’s lives extends beyond customers. Kinney Group supports employees in their own communities through charitable contributions that matter most to each individual – from scholarship funds, to hospice resources, to Search & Rescue K9s.  Our office is located in the heart of a vibrant neighborhood resurgence and hosts an urban garden on site that is tended and managed by youth who live nearby.
