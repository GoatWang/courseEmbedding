Key Stock Data     ?    P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares.

With the exception of historical matters, the matters discussed herein are
forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking
statements include, but are not limited to, statements concerning anticipated
trends in revenues and net income, projections concerning operations and
available cash flow. Our actual results could differ materially from the results
discussed in such forward-looking statements. The following discussion of our
financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with
our financial statements and the related notes thereto appearing elsewhere
herein.




Background Overview




Poverty Dignified, Inc. is incorporated in the State of Nevada in September
2013. We were formed to operate as a micro-franchise business incubation company
servicing the energy needs of poor households in rural and peri-urban areas
across the globe. In September 2013, we commenced our planned principal
operations. To date, we have invested in developing our business plan,
developing relationships with a variety of potential marketplaces, developing
our charging station for our wholly owned subsidiary, My Power Solutions, Inc,
and developing our franchise agreement. From inception through May 31, 2017, we
have sold three franchises. The Company has completed the services required to
recognize the revenue for one of the franchise units. As such, the Company has
recognized franchise revenue of $132,869 and associated franchise expenses of
$160,234, including $13,482 of revenue and $55,847 of expenses for the nine
months ended May 31, 2017. For the remaining two franchise units for which the
Company has not completed the services required to recognize revenue, the
Company has deferred revenue of $206,999 at May 31, 2017. Additionally, during
the nine months ended May 31, 2017, the Company recognized product revenue and
associated cost of product revenue of $15,840 and $12,956, respectively.
Since our inception on September 27, 2013 to May 31, 2017, we have only
generated $148,709 in revenues and have incurred an accumulated deficit of
$9,325,394, due in part from recording stock compensation for issuing our stock
at par value to certain insiders in exchange for cash and services. For the nine
months ended May 31, 2017, we incurred expenses of $1,110,044 and recorded a net
loss of $1,080,722.



Going Concern



The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going
concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction
of liabilities in the normal course of business. As of May 31, 2017, the Company
had cash of $11,768, a working capital deficit of $1,088,943 and a stockholders'
deficit of $1,138,019. The Company has incurred net losses from start-up costs
and minimal operations since inception to May 31, 2017 and continues to expend
cash in order to accomplish its business objectives. Based on the Company's
current progress in its business plan, it has not successfully implemented its
plan to mitigate the going concern issue. Specifically, the Company has only
sold three units, only one for which revenue has been recognized, and has not
been effective in reducing operational expenses. As a result, as of May 31,
2017, these issues raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to
continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not
include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of
asset amounts or the classification of liabilities that might be necessary
should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

The Company needs to sell additional franchises or raise additional capital,
reduce expenses and curtail cash outflows in order to be able to accomplish its
business plan. In the interim, the Company will accrue for management salaries
and defer certain payments until the franchise sales are finalized and will
continue to borrow funds from affiliates as needed. Additionally, funds to equip
franchise units are not expended until franchise agreements are executed and
payment is received from the franchisee. From inception through May 31, 2017, we
have sold three franchises. The Company has completed the services required to
recognize revenue on one of the franchise units. As such, the Company has
recognized franchise revenue of $132,869 and associated franchise expenses of
$160,234 from inception through May 31, 2017. For certain portions of the three
franchise units for which the Company has not completed the services required to
recognize the associated revenue, the Company has deferred revenue of $206,999
at May 31, 2017.
The Company also has the ability to sell Master Franchise Agreements for various
territories throughout Africa, which could generate sufficient cash to fund
working capital needs. Poverty Dignified, Inc. is an "Incubation" company. The
Company is constantly incubating other business concepts and technologies that
will be wholly owned subsidiaries of Poverty Dignified. These concepts could
contribute to the overall profitability of Poverty Dignified, Inc. and allow the
necessary funds to be in place to offset any additional costs from the
operations of My Power Solutions, Inc.
The Company's primary source of operating funds since inception has been equity
financings through a private placement. In its private placement memorandum
dated January 2014 and closed November 2014, the Company raised $1,182,180 for
its operations, research and development, and marketing of its franchise
opportunities. Poverty Dignified, Inc. recently closed a Private Investment in
Public Equity transaction, in which the Company offered 1,000,000 unregistered
shares to accredited investors at a discounted price of $0.75 per share to raise
an additional $750,000 of growth capital. Under this offering, the Company sold
999,970 shares of common stock for proceeds of $749,977, including 784,302
shares of common stock for proceeds of $588,226 during the nine months ended May
31, 2017. Poverty Dignified, Inc. is currently doing a Private Placement
Memorandum, in which the Company is offering 2,000,000 shares at a price of
$1.50 per share to raise an additional $3,000,000 in growth capital. In this
Private Placement Memorandum, the Company has the option to sell shares at a
price lower than the $1.50 per share. Through May 31, 2017, under this Private
Placement Memorandum, the Company has issued 144,000 shares of common stock at a
discounted price of $0.75 per share for proceeds of $108,000 and has issued
36,000 shares of common stock at the offering price of $1.50 per share for
proceeds of $54,000. Once the Private Placement Memorandum in closed, Poverty
Dignified, Inc. plans to ask for approval for a secondary offering. Upon
approval, the Company plans to register shares in an S-1 registration. Once
"effective" by the SEC, these shares will be made available to the public
market. We cannot provide any assurance or guarantee that we will be able to
raise the full amount or any additional funds under this offering. Further, we
may be required to raise funds in addition to this offering.
During the quarter ended May 31, 2017, the Company entered into two separate
convertible note payable agreements, which provided net proceeds of $125,075,
after payment of debt issuance costs totaling $24,925.
Additionally, the Company has borrowed funds from a related party for working
capital purposes and $267,173 remains outstanding under notes payable to this
related party at May 31, 2017.



Results of Operations



For the three and nine months ended May 31, 2017
We recognized franchise revenue of $7,029 and $13,482, respectively, for the
three and nine months ended May 31, 2017. The associated franchise expenses were
$20,944 and $55,847, respectively. Franchise expenses exceed franchise revenue
on the Company's first operational franchise due to the Company bearing
unforeseen, additional set-up costs, which are not expected to recur in future
franchises.




         17

  Table of Contents




During the nine months ended May 31, 2017, we recognized $15,840 of revenue and
$12,956 of cost of revenue associated with product sale and installation of
equipment for digital classroom purposes within a school in our initial
franchise market, but not included in our initial franchise unit. Except for our
currently operational franchise and the two units sold but not yet operational,
we expect all future revenues associated with digital classrooms, whether within
a school or a franchise unit, to be included within the scope of our franchise
revenue structure.
Our expenses for the nine months ended May 31, 2017 were related to franchise
expenses of $55,847, cost of product revenue of $12,956, research and
development of $558, professional fees of $134,647, and general and
administrative costs of $880,526. General and administrative costs primarily
consisted of payroll expenses of $526,980, $112,500 of non-cash stock-based
compensation, $52,163 in advertising and $121,797 of travel related costs. Of
the payroll expenses, $226,864 related to amounts accrued for, but not paid to,
the Company's management team.
Additionally, we have incurred interest expense of $16,771 and $25,510,
respectively, for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2017, primarily due to
interest on our related party and convertible notes payable and amortization of
the debt discounts on the convertible notes payable.
For the three and nine months ended May 31, 2016
The Company has recognized franchise revenue and franchise expenses of $95,757
and $80,757, respectively, related to one franchise unit for the three and nine
months ended May 31, 2016. There was a net loss of $240,059 and $617,580,
respectively, for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2016. The net loss was
mostly related to stock-based compensation, payroll expenses and professional
fees.
Our expenses for the nine months ended May 31, 2016 were related to research and
development of $14,806, professional fees of $68,473, and general and
administrative costs of $533,118. General and administrative costs primarily
consisted of non-cash stock-based compensation of $75,000 and payroll expenses
of $413,831. $386,951 of the payroll expenses related to amounts accrued for,
but not yet paid to, the Company's management team.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Company had $20,557 in cash and a balance of $124,463 in prepaid expenses at
August 31, 2016. As of May 31, 2017 the Company had a cash balance of $11,768,
accounts receivable of $3,507 and $136,081 of prepaid expenses. Additional cash
will be necessary to continue the development of our business plan, roll out of
the sales of our franchises in My Power Solutions, Inc., travel expenses for our
management to Africa to deploy our business plan, research and development, and
relationship development with potential franchisees.
We continue to explore market opportunities in South Africa. From inception to
May 31, 2017, we have incurred an accumulated deficit of $9,325,394, of which
$6,043,500 was non-cash compensation. Although we do believe we will continue to
need the services of our founders and consultants, we do not believe that we
will continue to issue large quantities of stock for those services. Stock to
our founders and consultants was tendered at par value and for various services.
Through May 31, 2017, we have sold three franchises. The Company has completed
the services required to recognize the revenue for one of the franchise units.
As such, the Company has recognized franchise revenue of $132,869 and associated
franchise expenses of $160,234, included $13,482 of revenues and $55,847 of
expenses for the nine months ended May 31, 2017. For the remaining two franchise
units for which the Company has not completed the services required to recognize
revenue, the Company has deferred revenue of $206,999 at May 31, 2017.
Additionally, during the nine months ended May 31, 2017, we recognized $15,840
of revenue and $12,956 of cost of revenue associated with product sale and
installation of equipment for digital classroom purposes within a school in our
initial franchise market, but not included in our initial franchise unit. Except
for our currently operational franchise and the two units sold but not yet
operational, we expect all future revenues associated with digital classrooms,
whether within a school or a franchise unit, to be included within the scope of
our franchise revenue structure.
We have the ability to sell Master Franchise Agreements for various territories
throughout Africa, generating sufficient cash to fund working capital needs.
Poverty Dignified, Inc. is an "Incubation" company. The Company is constantly
incubating other business concepts and technologies that will be wholly owned
subsidiaries of Poverty Dignified, and thus contributing to the revenues and
profitability of Poverty Dignified as a whole.

  Table of Contents




As of May 31, 2017, we had cash of $11,768 and have had a net decrease in cash
of $8,789 during the nine months ended May 31, 2017. We will need to find
additional sources of capital to continue. We believe in the near future we will
generate significant revenues from the deployment of franchises. We are
substantially complete with our research and development activities as it
relates to My Power Solutions, Inc. and our franchise operations in Africa. We
do not expect to incur any additional significant research and development
expenses at this time with respect to the aforementioned My Power Solutions,
Inc. business concept. We have begun to generate revenues under the My Power
Solutions, Inc. business concept and believe we will be generating more revenues
for the remainder of fiscal year 2017, but there can be no guarantee of our
doing so.
On June 7, 2017, Poverty Dignified, Inc. signed a Memorandum of Agreement with
the South African Department of Basic Education to deliver 100 franchise units
to be placed next to 100 pre-selected schools throughout five provinces in South
Africa, which means we are now officially recognized as a collaborating partner
by the Department of Basic Education and Provincial Departments of Education.
Inside South Africa, and the continent of Africa, there is an immediate need for
the basic electrification of rural townships, and the delivery of digital
education. These basic needs represent an enormous social impact opportunity for
Poverty Dignified to roll out its sustainable franchise business model. Poverty
Dignified, through its wholly owned subsidiary, My Power Solutions, has
developed a sustainable franchise model that is proving to meet the basic needs
of rural communities in South Africa, while at the same time creating a pathway
out of poverty by delivering infrastructure for electricity, education,
connectivity and retail services. While keeping the focus on community impact
and changing lives, My Power Solutions is planning to work alongside the
Department of Basic Education to deploy a delivery system in which the DBE Cloud
Platform will have a portal to deliver its National Education Curriculum to
rural schools and communities. My Power Solutions is currently securing funding
to roll out the first of 100 franchise units to be placed next to 100
pre-selected schools throughout five provinces in South Africa as part of the
Government's National Educational Program to deliver infrastructure for basic
electricity, digital education and connectivity throughout rural townships. My
Power Solutions believes it will play a pivotal role in rural transformation by
providing digital education, electricity, connectivity and retail services
throughout the continent of Africa. Each My Power Solution franchise unit
delivers life changing products and services to a minimum of 1,000 homes.
We do not currently have enough cash on hand to fully deploy our current
business plan or fund the delivery of the franchise units noted under the
aforementioned Memorandum of Agreement. However, we have a history of raising
capital and have the ability to continue to raise capital through the issuance
of stock. In our private placement memorandum dated January 2014 and closed
November 2014, we raised $1,182,180 for operations, research and development,
and marketing of franchise opportunities. Poverty Dignified, Inc. recently
closed a Private Investment in Public Equity transaction, in which the Company
offered 1,000,000 unregistered shares to accredited investors at a discounted
price of $0.75 per share to raise an additional $750,000 of growth capital.
Under this offering, the Company sold 999,970 shares of common stock for
proceeds of $749,977, including 784,302 shares of common stock for proceeds of
$588,226 during the nine months ended May 31, 2017. Poverty Dignified, Inc. is
currently doing a Private Placement Memorandum, in which the Company is offering
2,000,000 shares at a price of $1.50 per share to raise an additional $3,000,000
in growth capital. In this Private Placement Memorandum, the Company has the
option to sell shares at a price lower than the $1.50 per share. Through May 31,
2017, under this Private Placement Memorandum, the Company has issued 144,000
shares of common stock at a discounted price of $0.75 per share for proceeds of
$108,000 and has issued 36,000 shares of common stock at the offering price of
$1.50 per share for proceeds of $54,000. Once the Private Placement Memorandum
in closed, Poverty Dignified, Inc. plans to ask for approval for a secondary
offering. Upon approval, the Company plans to register shares in an S-1
registration. Once "effective" by the SEC, these shares will be made available
to the public market. We cannot provide any assurance or guarantee that we will
be able to raise the full amount or any additional funds under this offering.
Further, we may be required to raise funds in addition to this offering. We
cannot provide any assurance or guarantee that we will be able to conduct other
additional rounds of financing at all or on terms acceptable to us.
The Company is currently involved in negotiations within a Public Private
Partnership through the South African National Treasury to bring micro-grid
electricity to rural communities throughout South Africa. Should this discussion
lead to official signed agreements, My Power Solutions, Inc., a wholly owned
subsidiary of Poverty Dignified, Inc., would benefit from funding arrangements
to begin a five year, 230 location build out in rural communities across South
Africa. Should this materialize, Poverty Dignified, Inc., through its wholly
owned subsidiary, My Power Solutions, Inc., would have sufficient capital
resources to accomplish its business plan. We cannot provide any assurance or
guarantee that we will be able to close on these negotiations.

The selling stockholders are selling shares of common stock covered by this
prospectus for their own account. We will not receive any of the proceeds from
the resale of these shares. We have agreed to bear the expenses relating to the
registration of the shares for the selling security holders.


Our business model is one that has been primarily carried out by non-profit
organizations. We believe we will have a competitive advantage by presenting a
traditional non-profit model but encouraging profit and an entrepreneurial
spirit. To date, we have been unable to identify direct, for profit,
competitors.

Because we are a for profit enterprise, we may not receive the same favor and
treatment as our non-profit competitors. Therefore, we may find it more
difficult to enter into countries or marketplaces. We may also be more expensive
than our non-profit counterparts.
