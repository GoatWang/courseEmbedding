Publication number:  20170204355
                                            

Abstract:  A method for preparing ethanol-containing nanolipid particles, which can be used in food products, frozen desserts, or beverages. The method comprises nanolipidic vehicles in which ethanol-containing substances are encapsulated, said ethanol-containing nanolipidic vehicles can be combined with food products, desserts or beverage ingredients including those that are subsequently frozen. The food product, dessert or beverage can remain in a frozen state during consumption by an individual. A composition comprising ethanol-containing nanolipid particles, which can be used in food products, frozen desserts, or beverages.

NANOLIPIDIC PARTICLE ASSEMBLY POPULATIONS



Publication number:  20170042826
                                            

Abstract:  Nanolipidic Particles (NLPs) having average mean diameters of 1 nm to 20 nm are made from a precursor solution. NLPs can be loaded with a desired passenger molecule. Assemblies of these particles, called NLP assemblies, result in a vehicle population of a desired size. Single application or multifunction NLP assemblies are made from the loaded NLPs and range in size from about 30 to about 200 nm. A method of using preloaded NLPs to make larger carrier vehicles or a mixed population provides increased encapsulation efficiency. NLPs have application in the cosmetics, pharmaceutical, and food and beverage industries.

Publication number:  20160317452
                                            

Abstract:  A method for preparing a phospholipid delivery system encapsulating one or more bio-affecting compounds, includes the steps of solubilizing a heterogeneous phospholipid mixture into an organic solvent to form a concentrated formulation of phospholipids, in which the phospholipids include a charged phospholipid species and mixing the concentrated formulation with an aqueous solution having at least one bio-affecting compound.

Method for Making Nanolipidic Particles



Publication number:  20140170226
                                            

Abstract:  Nanolipidic Particles (NLPs) having average mean diameters of 1 nm to 20 nm are made from a precursor solution. NLPs can be loaded with a desired passenger molecule. Assemblies of these particles, called NLP assemblies, result in a vehicle population of a desired size. Single application or multifunction NLP assemblies are made from the loaded NLPs and range in size from about 30 nm to about 200 nm. A method of using preloaded NLPs to make larger carrier vehicles or a mixed population provides increased encapsulation efficiency. NLPs have application in the cosmetics, pharmaceutical, and food and beverage industries.

Michael W Fountain's Experience
Title: Director of Entrepreneurial Studies
               Company: University of South Florida
Job Details
               USF is focusing primarily on biotechnology and life sciences research and entrepreneurship. This represents an unprecedented vision and focus that USF President Judy Genshaft has brought to the university's role in stimulating regional economic development. Even before she arrived at USF, Genshaft had already identified biotechnology and life sciences as research strengths for the university and envisioned building a biotech research park. She saw strong research programs in medicine, engineering and the basic sciences, and she wanted to maximize the partnerships USF already established with medical partners such as the Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, Tampa General, All Children's and the James A. Haley Veteran's Hospital. Building upon these strengths, Genshaft said, is how she would lead USF into an ever-stronger national research university. As she examined the strengths within USF, Genshaft also explored the existing high-tech strengths within the Tampa Bay business community. She saw that the Bay area was home to more than 370 medical device businesses that contribute about 51,000 jobs and more than $5 billion annually to the region's economy.
