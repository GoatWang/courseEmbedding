Regenerations Ahead








Biostage is a biotechnology company developing bioengineered organ implants to treat cancers and other life-threatening conditions of the esophagus, bronchus and trachea.
The company’s novel Cellframe™ technology is engineered to stimulate the body’s signaling pathways and natural healing process to regenerate and restore organ function. Our Cellframe technology is based on over 20 years of scientific progress in the fields of tissue engineering, cell biology and material science. Cellframe technology combines the best attributes of a synthetic scaffold with tissue engineering and cell biology to create what may be a revolutionary method of addressing organ damage.
Biostage has been developing its new generation of organ implants as a platform capable of being used in the esophagus and main airways (trachea and bronchi). The current platform, based on our Cellframe technology, represents a complete re-engineering of our earlier organ scaffold and cell technology to better stimulate the regenerative properties of each of these organs. Biostage’s Cellframe technology platform is used to create organ specific Cellspan implants. Recent large animal data showed promising results as our Cellframe technology applied to the esophagus achieved the regeneration of esophageal tissue.
The company is currently expanding its preclinical data in collaboration with Mayo Clinic, and intends to submit the Cellspan Esophageal Implant IND with the FDA in the third quarter of 2017 and begin first-in-man studies in the fourth quarter of 2017.

HOLLISTON —Harvard Apparatus Regenerative Technology Inc., which is developing bioengineered organ implants to address life-threatening conditions, is set to disclose Thursday that it is changing its name to Biostage Inc.The new name refects the company’s focus on organ regeneration and is intended to avoid confusion with its former corporate parent, Harvard Bioscience Inc., which spun out the regenerative technology business in late 2013 to operate as an independent company.

Biostage, which is located next door to Harvard Bioscience, will be changing its stock symbol from HART to BSTG on the Nasdaq exchange, starting Friday.“We want to have a clear focus,” said Biostage chief executive Jim McGorry, a one-time Genzyme Corp. executive who took the helm at HART last year.

“We’re trying to apply our technology to diseases of the esophagus, bronchus, and tracea. The company is evolving as technology evolves.”
In an e-mail that will be sent to shareholders, McGorry said the new name combines the company’s bioengineering approach with the “staging” that underlies its Cellframe product, a biocompatible scaffold seeded with the recipient’s stem cells to create implants.Biostage, which has 19 employees in Holliston, is testing its products in animal studies in a lab in the Worcester County town of Lancaster and at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.

The company’s initial focus is replacement tracheas for patients who need airway transplants. Its product aims to guide the repair of the patient’s own tissue through natural healing.“Our new corporate brand culminates the transformation and refocusing of our company over the past two years,” McGorry wrote to shareholders. “We have developed an entirely new technology platform, established a deeply experienced management team, solidified our board and scientific leadership, expanded our base of research partnerships and set clear research, regulatory and commercialization goals.”Among the new hires is chief medical officer Severio LaFrancesca, an Italian-born doctor who was formerly a cardiovascular surgeon on staff at Houston Methodist Hospital.

Biostage: Look For It To Rise Again - Biostage, Inc. (NASDAQ:BSTG) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Biostage: Look For It To Rise AgainMay.13.16 | About: Biostage, Inc. (BSTG) Spencer Osborne Growth, value, special situations, momentumSummaryCompany announced positive news on esophagus regeneration product and will seek human trials.Company reported a $2.5 million or $018 per share.Stocked spiked to $2.86 before selling off to below $2.Boistage (NASDAQ:BSTG) announced its Q1 corporate update as well as an update on its pre-clinical program for esophagus regeneration. Biostage is a biotech firm concentrating on research and development in the area of tissue regeneration using a patients' own cells. The reaction of the street to the call likely has many people scratching their heads. From a business perspective the numbers should not have been a surprise. Most of the Biostage business is in a research and development phase. Research and development costs money and losses should be expected. The Financial Results The company reported a net loss of $2.5 million or $0.18 per share. This was a slight improvement from the $2.6 million that was lost in Q1 of 2015. Research and development costs were $1.4 million. Selling, general, and administrative costs came in at $1.1 million, and improvement from the $1.4 million spent in the year prior. Cash used in operating activities increased to $2.5 million in the first quarter of 2016 as compared to $1.7 million in the first quarter of 2015. Cash on hand at March 31, 2016 was $4.8 million. The company continues to have in place its $15 million, 30 month Stock Purchase Agreement with Aspire Capital Fund, LLC. The Clinical Update The clinical update offered by the company was highly encouraging. The update included discussion of pre-clinical data, including the complete regeneration of a segment of the esophagus, from its collaborative large-animal study of its Cellspan organ implants with Mayo Clinic According to management the study has clearly demonstrated in a predictive large-animal model the ability of Biostage Cellspan organ implants to successfully stimulate the regeneration of sections of esophagus that had been surgically removed for the study. The study utilized Cellspan esophageal implants, consisting of a proprietary bio-compatible synthetic scaffold seeded with the recipient animal's own stem cells, were surgically implanted in place of the esophagus section that had been removed. Study animals were returned to a solid diet just two weeks after implantation surgery. The scaffolds which provide the framework for cell regeneration, are intended to be in place only temporarily. The scaffolds were later retrieved via the animal's mouth in a non-surgical endoscopic procedure.
 After 2.5 months, a complete epithelium and other specialized esophagus tissue layers were fully regenerated. Animals in the study demonstrated weight gain and appear healthy and free of any significant side effects, including a few that are now more than 90 days post implantation, and are receiving no specialized care. Biostage views their research results as a watershed event for the company and indicated that it strongly feels that its procedures, science, and products are validated. Management believes that it now possesses sufficient data to initiate Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) studies to demonstrate that its technology, personnel, systems and practices are sufficient for advancing into clinical trials. GLP studies are required to advance to an Investigation New Drug (IND) application with the U.S. FDA, which would seek approval to initiate clinical trials for Biostage Cellspan esophageal implants in humans. Biostage currently expects to complete its IND filing by year-end 2016. What That Means To Investors Given that there was no real surprise in the financials, and that the pre-clinical update was very positive the stock price reaction in the hours after the call was a bit odd. The stock closed yesterday at $2.24 per share and opened trading today at $2.85. The stock has sold off ever since the call. It went below the $2.00 mark by early afternoon. The strong sell-off actually presents a compelling upside opportunity based on four near term catalysts. 1) The company has indicated that it is proceeding to initiate GLP studies and intends to get FDA approval on an IND for human trials by the end of 2016. 2) The company did not really speak to the concept of garnering orphan status. In my opinion the company's technology and treatment has a high probability of getting that status. Cancer of the esophagus is highly terminal and current treatments are highly invasive. The importance of orphan status is that it could streamline the path in clinical trials as well as get a product to market more quickly.
 3) Peer review data publication. When a company can publish its data in respected medical journals the doubters out there will have less doubt. Peer review removes a level of speculation and actually confirms the science, concepts, and potential. The company discussed publishing its data. Getting published in the right place could be a big driver of the equity. 4) FDA acceptance of IND application. Once the company applies for approval to initiate human trials the future of the company will hinge on garnering approval. If the FDA allows human trials to commence, the street will have little doubt about the company being on the correct path. Some Risks 1) Investors may be concerned with the cash position of the company, but there exists a facility that allows the company to tap into $15 million with Aspire. Some investors may characterize such a deal as an ATM facility. In essence the company can sell up to $15 million dollars worth of stock with Aspire being a "guaranteed buyer". These stock sales can happen at any time and while dilutive to the existing holders, are limited in nature to a value that is pre-determined. As long as you consider these possible shares in your own due diligence, you should not see any real surprise. In my opinion the ATM will need to be utilized in 2016. 2) Biostage is a small company with a small market cap, and small number of outstanding shares. This can create volatility that may shake the confidence of the average investor more than it should on down days, and boost confidence more than it should on up days. 3) Failure of concept. In my opinion the odds of failure are less today than they were back in November. Large animal studies offer some real world results that give true indications of what we can expect to see in human studies. Large animals have passed the 90 day mark with what are apparent no complications. If a complication arises prior to any human studies, the company programs could get sidelined. As stated, Biostage is a speculative play that can have volatility. If you believe in the technology and that human trials will start, then seek an opportunity to buy your stake with the full understanding that pops and drops will be in the cards. Stay Tuned!

	Item 3.01.






	Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing.






	 


	As previously disclosed, Biostage, Inc.
	(the “Company”) received written notice from the Listing Qualifications Staff (the “Staff”) of The NASDAQ
	Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) on November 18, 2016, indicating that the Company no longer satisfied Nasdaq Listing Rule
	5550(a)(2) (the “Bid Price Rule”), which requires an issuer to maintain a closing bid price of at least $1.00 per share,
	as the bid price for the Company’s common stock had closed below $1.00 per share for the prior 30 consecutive business days.
	In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company was granted a grace period of 180 days, through May 17, 2017,
	to regain compliance with the Bid Price Rule.


	 


	On May 22, 2017, the Company issued a press
	release announcing that the Staff had notified the Company by letter dated May 18, 2017, that based upon the Company’s continued
	non-compliance with the Bid Price Rule as of May 17, 2017, as well as the Company’s non-compliance with the minimum $2.5
	million stockholders equity requirement for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market, as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule
	5550(b)(1) (the “Stockholders’ Equity Rule”), as of March 31, 2017, the Company’s common stock would be
	subject to delisting from Nasdaq unless the Company timely requests a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”).


	 


	The Company plans to timely request a hearing
	before the Panel, which request will stay any delisting action by the Staff at least pending the issuance of the Panel’s
	decision following the hearing and the expiration of any extension period that may be granted by the Panel. At the hearing, the
	Company will present its plan to evidence compliance with the Bid Price and Stockholders’ Equity Rules and request an extension
	of time within which to do so. The Panel has the discretion to grant the Company an extension through no later than November 14,
	2017. The Company’s common stock will continue to trade on Nasdaq under the symbol “BSTG” at least pending the
	ultimate conclusion of the hearing process.


	 


	There can be no assurances that the Panel will grant the Company’s
	request for continued listing or that the Company will be able to evidence compliance with all applicable requirements for continued
	listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market within any extension of time that may be granted by the Panel.

	minimum $1.00 bid price requirement by May 17, 2017, and its non-compliance with the $2.5 million stockholders’ equity requirement
	as of the quarter ended March 31, 2017, could serve as a basis for delisting the Company’s common stock from The Nasdaq Capital
	Market unless the Company timely requests a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”).


	 


	The Company plans to timely request a hearing
	before the Panel, which request will stay any delisting action by the Staff at least pending the issuance of the Panel’s
	decision following the hearing and the expiration of any extension period that may be granted by the Panel. At the hearing, Biostage

	2017. The Company’s common stock will continue to trade on Nasdaq under the symbol “BSTG” at least pending the
	ultimate conclusion of the hearing process. Biostage intends to provide a further update when additional relevant information becomes

HOLLISTON, Mass., March 31, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Harvard Apparatus Regenerative Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:    HART) announced today it has changed its corporate name to Biostage, Inc. and will trade under the Nasdaq symbol "BSTG" effective April 1, 2016. Concurrently, the company has launched a new web site www.biostage.com to provide greater clarity and visibility for its technology.








The name change reflects the company's broad commitment and expertise in pioneering the development of bioengineered organ implants for the esophagus, bronchus and trachea. It also eliminates market confusion with its former parent company from which it was spun-out in November 2013. 
Jim McGorry, CEO, commented, "The Biostage™ name change reflects the evolution of our focus from commercializing bioreactors and research tools to the pioneering development of bioengineered organ implants for the esophagus, bronchus, and trachea. We have changed our company name to Biostage to better communicate and differentiate our new Cellframe™ technology and strategic direction."
The Biostage name embodies the company's "biotechnology" focus on bioengineered implants that provide critical "staging" for the body's innate healing processes with its new Cellframe™ technology platform. Mr. McGorry added, "Cellframe employs a process in which the patient's own stem cells are taken from a simple adipose/fat tissue biopsy, the cells are first isolated, expanded and then seeded onto a proprietary biocompatible scaffold that mimics the natural dimensions of the damaged organ. After incubation in our proprietary bioreactor, the Cellspan implant is ready to be implanted. Cellspan implants are designed to deliver the necessary cues for triggering, guiding, and modulating the regenerative process. 
"Biostage is the result of a nearly two-year corporate transformation that centered on people, research, and technologies. We put in place a deeply experienced management team and board of directors to effectively lead our team of cell biology experts, materials scientists, and engineers to develop and pursue a clearly-defined set of research, regulatory, and commercialization goals. Biostage has also expanded its research partnership base to cost-effectively add technology resources critical to our success. Collectively, these efforts allow Biostage to pursue a new approach to restoring function to damaged organs for patients who deserve better clinical solutions and improved outcomes."
Biostage's Initial IND to Focus on Cellspan Esophageal ImplantBiostage's Cellframe technology features a biocompatible scaffold seeded with a recipient's own stem cells to create Cellspan™ implants for treatment of life-threatening conditions of the esophagus, trachea, and bronchus. Key large-animal data for Biostage's Cellspan esophageal and other implants was first announced in November 2015.  
Based on its preclinical data, Biostage identified life-threatening conditions of the esophagus as the initial clinical application to advance its Cellspan esophageal implant. Biostage plans to file an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) in late 2016, seeking to initiate clinical trials in humans. 
Biostage is currently expanding its preclinical testing of its Cellspan esophageal implants in collaboration with Mayo Clinic to support its planned IND application. The company anticipates providing an update on its preclinical research collaboration mid-second quarter 2016.
