Make Your Home All Your Own
Interior decorating isn’t just about placing a rug here and a throw pillow there. It means expressing yourself through color choices, furniture placement and accent pieces. It’s about creating just the right ambiance that says, “This is my home.” But transforming your decorating scheme doesn’t have to break the bank. On just about any budget, you can make simple or major design changes to achieve a look that perfectly suits your style.

Choosing a Focal Point
Most professional interior designers recommend selecting a main focal point for each room in your home that showcases the theme, style or mood of the room. It can be a large piece of furniture, an antique rug or a striking tapestry. You can then use smaller home décor items—such as decorative pillows, jar candles and embellished picture frames—to build on the focal point. Any room in your house -- from kitchen, dining, bathroom, even laundry or office – can benefit from a little décor TLC.

Shop for High-End Embellishments
Have some money to invest in major changes to your home décor? eBay has an extensive selection of lamps, lights and ceiling fans, handmade window treatments and contemporary wall shelves to suit any taste or design. It’s amazing what a difference new bedding or decorative pillows can make in sprucing up your bedroom. New blankets and throws, too, can help establish new color schemes, or accent existing ones.

Decorating on a Dime
It’s amazing the difference a single slipcover, set of curtains or mirror can make! Completely transform the look of a room with simple, inexpensive updates. Buy a few colorful cotton throw blankets or a decorative lamp to jazz up your living room. Or find a comfortable new duvet to give your bedroom a fresh look. Shop eBay for low-cost wood frames, mirrors and clocks without sacrificing quality or flair. And wall art is an easy way to bring a new spark to your home décor, and many pieces are affordable. And making a small investment in home storage can help you declutter.

Décor for any Decorating Style
Whether you feel most comfortable surrounded by bright colors and modern silhouettes, or you prefer a more traditional, formal decorating style, eBay has the perfect décor for your home. Shop our extensive selection of rugs, lighting, throw pillows, home fragrances, posters, prints and photo frames, or simply peruse our site for interior decorating inspiration.

Decorating for the Season
Fall is just around the bend, so why not incorporate it into your redecorating choices? Browse eBay's selection of home décor for items with rich, golden autumn colors to bring a touch of warmth into your home when cooler weather hits. Shop floral décor for items with maple leaf prints, or consider nature-themed wall art, decals and vinyl art with an autumn setting to celebrate the season and refresh your interior design a bit. Let eBay become your destination for home décor of any type or style, and for any season or theme.Side Refine PanelShop by CategoryHome & GardenHome DécorAfghans & Throw BlanketsDécor BasketsHome Décor BookendsDécor BottlesDécor Boxes, Jars & TinsDécor CandlesCandle Holders & AccessoriesHome Décor ClocksDécor Decals, Stickers & Vinyl ArtDecorative Fruit & VegetablesDecorative Plates & BowlsDisplay EaselsDoor DécorDoorstopsDécor FigurinesFloral DécorPicture FramesDécor GlobesHome FragrancesIndoor FountainsKey & Letter HoldersDecorative MasksMessage Boards & HoldersHome Décor MirrorsHome Décor PillowsHome Décor Plaques & SignsPlate Racks & HangersHome Décor Posters & PrintsShadow BoxesSuncatchers & MobilesTapestriesArt TilesVasesWall PocketsWall SculpturesWall ShelvesOther Home Décor ItemsMoreLessEveryday ValuesArea Rugs Under $100Wall Decals Under $15
