Real Estate Project Funding


                We examine qualified projects for our own portfolio and those of qualified funding
                programs active in the location of the project. All funding solutions require an
                experienced development team, a shovel ready or fully approved project, verified
                developer equity, liquidity, and detailed project information including our Project
                Submission Form, Executive Summary. Business Plan, Financial projections thru the
                funding and repayment periods, and concise strategies for construction, marketing,
                advertising, management, and exit for the lender. So if your project makes sense
                in today's economy, is fully documented, tell us your plans, requirements, and time
                frames, and we can discuss specific funding solutions utilizing our mortgage funds
                and those of specific, verified lenders seeking your project type, size, and location.
                

                Depending on the exact lender program we will use, including our in-house funding
                solutions, you may need an appraisal dated within the last six months, showing the
                current market value of the site, a future value or 'To Be when Built" value may
                also be necessary. Larger fundings sometimes require third party feasibility studies,
                and each lender may have other requirements based on your project, its components,
                and your plans. Detailed developer resumes are always needed, verification of the
                funds you have invested to date, and draw schedules showing your required funding
                amounts as the project is built, monthly thru the full construction and loan repayment,
                will be developed in the funding process, approved by the lender and developer together,
                and will become your construction draw schedule.
                

                Our sources include direct funding by our firm, verified banking relationships in
                the US, Europe, Asia, Panama, and the UK. The programs available are straight debt,
                joint venture, combination programs, and in some cases, sale/leaseback projects.
                You can typically include the land acquisition or payoff of existing debt, and all
                hard and soft costs to bring the project to a stabilized position, where the sales
                and income from the project is capable of servicing the debt in full, and continuing
                the development. We can also arrange permanent funding for the income producing
                elements of your project once fully stabilized.
                

                Every project, every developer is unique, and our funding solutions are designed
                with the right lender, the right program, the right solution, structured to your
                project and requirements. More program information is available in the columns to
                the right.
            

Debt Programs


                Lenders today, have  foreclosed on all of the real estate projects they can carry on their balance sheets, and still meet reserve requirements imposed by the governing bodies in their location, like the Federal Reserve in the USA. That does not mean that funding is impossible, but it does mean that they are more selective, have tighter funding parameters, and great projects with all of the pieces in place are going to be funded. As a direct fund, we  often receive 50-100 projects per month, and only the best of the best will receive straight debt offers to fund. 

You will find out very quickly, that lenders, including Solutions,  know as much as you do about your location, your region, and your competition. They know what costs, fees and sale prices are realistic, and your project documentation needs to be in line with the other projects they have funded, are examining, or own. You must demonstrate that your project is carefully planned, conceived, and that you have the confidence to have invested your own funds prior to contacting them. If you have zero of your funds invested, lenders are not going to invest their funds. Liquidity or cash on hand is definitely going to be required, and varies widely based on funding size, location and loan to costs.   We all see the scams and schemes, and so do the lenders. Once the lender has proven their ability to fund, proven their history of funding, and issued an approval, be prepared to pay a fee of some form in direct verification costs or an escrow for the same, to move from application to the closing table. Fees are always an issue, but at the proper time, with the right program, they are a reality. If your local bank in your hometown requires an appraisal, a title exam. credit reports, property inspection, background check, and many other verifications to fund a condo down the street, it is not realistic to expect a lender to  fund a condo project, in another country, at zero costs. Developers that insist on paying absolutely nothing until funding will never get to the closing table, and any program stating that is a scam, pure and simple. 

That being said, our direct in house debt fund considers projects with 21% to 39% down payment, and typical Private Equity and or Bank Programs require 40% down payment or higher on a project by project basis.  These down payments are paid at funding, in the traditional closing.  Our program and others will require you to demonstrate your ability via a proof of funds or escrow of some form, once approved. 

Our project investigation and interviews with the developer will result in a candid discussion of our program and requirements, your ability to match yourself, your project, and your ability to engage and close.  Once your project is fully verified, approved, and engaged with our program, we will  openly discuss the funding, our legal and accounting, funding history, abilities, and costs.  If you or your project do not fit our in-house criteria, we may have third party fund sources available to highly qualified projects, or those exceeding $200 million USD.
Our program does not have any form of upfront, bogus fee of any form.  We underwrite the project internally at our expense, with our employees and contractors.  Once we determine the project is of interest, we will issue general terms and conditions via a Funding Proposal, which openly discusses the program, timing, documentation and verifications needed, and our site visit/inspection.  We are paid at funding, period, we either perform, or we do not get paid. 
            

Joint Ventures


                In today's climate, many developers are pursuing a joint venture funding with a lender, and many lenders are only offering joint venture. Typically the project is placed into a Trust or special purpose holding corporation, the project is funded for 80% to 100% of the development costs, with the developer and lender participating in profits. JV programs are available with the lender holding from 20% to 60% depending on the size, time frame, costs, loan to costs and loan to value of the project. Equity invested prior to the funding is often a determining factor, and will reduce the equity requirement to the lender. Programs vary widely and lenders may be strictly hands off, receiving monthly or quarterly reports, to lenders involved in most aspects of the project day to day. 

Joint venture funding is going to require in most cases, your ability to prove your staying power to the new funding partner. A lender funding your project will require you to demonstrate financial reserves or ability to complete the project in the event costs increase or sales decrease from the projections you provide. As the old saying goes, "the best laid plans can go astray" is true, so if they enter into a funding agreement with you, they will certainly require you to demonstrate the liquid assets to maintain your position post funding. This guarantee can be as simple as providing your financial statement showing your ability, and as complex as a required escrow or deposit to insure the completion of construction and sell out of the project. 

Joint ventures take many forms and will usually involve repayment of the funding amount, at a reduced or lower interest as compared to debt.  The down payment requirements are typically much less at a range of 4% to 19%. Our firm provides direct joint venture funding via our private investment trust, and we work with other lenders as well in Asia and Europe seeking qualified projects for co investing and ownership. 

The underwriting and verification process equals debt funding, and in some cases, is actually more stringent, since the fund is your partner and lender.

Energy Project Funding

                In a world starving for renewable energy, with costs of traditional power generation
                tied to expensive black oil or natural gas, Solutions Project Funding is direct
                to multiple lenders and our own funding programs for verified renewable energy projects
                globally. Most funding solutions start at $10 million USD and go up to no limit,
                and are available in any stable, location. Bio-diesel, wind, solar, waste to energy,
                thermal, hydroelectric, just about any renewable energy project can be funded.
                

                Energy funding falls into two distinct categories of projects being funded, with
                multiple solutions available in both categories. Many of the projects we work on
                daily, offer the lender a strong governmental or corporate guarantee by an end purchaser
                of the power being generated. If this purchase agreement, usually referred to as
                the "off take" or "PPA" agreement is absolute, without a cancellation or termination
                clause of any form, and the purchaser is a credit rated corporation or government
                entity, rated BB+ or better by Standard & Poors or Moody's, we have multiple funding
                solutions in straight debt, joint venture, or sale/leaseback that can fund the project
                100%, quickly, at favorable terms. The funding term will usually match the term
                of the PPA agreement for the power generated, to 5-30 years on a project by project
                basis.
                

                For projects that cannot supply a guaranteed off take with a rated power purchaser,
                the rules of the game are similar to those for real estate projects, liquidity,
                equity, and strength of the developer will take the place of the off take or PPA
                agreement. You will usually be looking at a funding program requiring some form
                of bonding, to provide the collateral a lender is going to need to fund the project.
                Costs and requirements are going to be similar to a real estate project, and can
                generally be included in the funding provided.
                

                Any project presenting a new technology, patented technology, or a process that
                can be duplicated many times in various locations will also attract attention to
                both straight debt, joint venture, and sale leaseback funding solutions. We have
                qualified funding programs with huge amounts of investment funding available, earmarked
                specifically for qualified renewable energy, interested in an out right purchase,
                joint venture, or sale leaseback.
            

Sale Lease Programs

                The sale lease funding options often used with companies seeking to finance equipment,
                receivables, and inventory have been adopted by several major energy funding programs
                to fund qualified projects. Once approved, the lender actually buys your project
                for the required funding amount necessary to make the project a reality. They then
                lease the project at completion back to the developer, and the developer sells the
                product or energy produced, makes a lease payment to the lender, on an agreed to
                term, and at the end of the lease term receives the project back or has the right
                to purchase it at a pre determined price.
                

                Our ability to arrange this type of funding is strictly limited to the credit rating
                of the off take purchaser, and usually requires a minimum rating of BB+. The overall
                costs can be equal to or better than a traditional mortgage or joint venture, but
                will keep the capital of the developer available for multiple projects, multiple
                locations, etc. Most of these programs also start at $10 million USD, and go to
                any size for a qualified project. These lenders are generally large institutional
                investors with very large appetites, seeking developers capable of doing multiple
                projects annually, for many years to come. They are often able to provide construction,
                engineering, etc as part of the package.
            

Developer Programs

                If you're a renewable energy developer, and can obtain an absolute purchase agreement
                or off take agreement from a credit rated purchaser for your power, bio-diesel,
                etc, we can directly fund 100% of the costs of your project, for as many projects
                as you can operate, in any global location. The world is choking on garbage, costs
                of power generation go up every day, and the demand for clean, renewable energy
                is endless world wide.
                

                With the right off take agreement, and the right purchaser, we have institutional
                fund sources with literally billions in available cash reserves ready, willing and
                able to partner with you under straight debt, joint venture, and sale leaseback
                funding options.
                

                Any major city in the world is producing tons of trash daily for waste to energy
                conversion facilities, global demand for energy in all forms increases with every
                child born, every automobile sold, every home built, every minute of every day.
                Our sources include providers of technology, financing, and operational expertise
                to meet this demand at any level, in any location that is friendly to the US and
                European sources, for any number of projects you can provide the required off take
                agreements.
                

                A developer with the right corporate or governmental contacts, or the corporation
                or government themselves, can discuss their requirements, technology, and funding
                needs with us to find the right solution, from the ground up. We can assist you
                with providing a comprehensive presentation that includes the technology, the financing,
                and the management functions for any renewable program in most global locations.

This type of loan is often used for house flippers (fix and flip), developers, renovators, and speculators whose goal is to renovate or develop a property to sell or refinance. Unlike traditional banks and inexperienced lenders, we have the ability to underwrite, evaluate, and fund loans faster and more efficiently with our common sense approach.Learn MoreUltra Short Transactional FundingSame day and up to 90 day fundsTransactional Funding is a two step process for deals that require an intermediary between an original buyer and end buyer, a situation that may occur with many lenders. Typically, most lenders will not allow contract assignments and instead require the original buyer to provide funds immediately upon purchase, regardless of when they anticipate transferring it to the end buyer in a secondary sale. These initial funds can be borrowed for anywhere between 0 and 90 days in order to satisfy the requirements of the bank for the initial purchase before the funds from the end buyer are attained. All standard underwriting procedures are still followed.Learn MoreJoint VenturesCall us to discuss your next dealYork Funding gets creative with joint venture real estate projects with select borrowers.

Order Entry System
“Our fixed income desk has been overly pleased with CD Funding’s Order Entry System.  It has allowed our team to process more trades in significantly less time, and having the ability to view submitted orders significantly aids in the management of order flow throughout the month,” says Tom McCarthy, Manager, Fixed Income Trade Desk at CFS.  “CD Funding was able to customize the system to accommodate our firm’s specific needs allowing us to roll the application out to all of our advisors.  We anticipate further time savings, error reduction, and better tracking with the new system.”

	MANAGER, FIXED INCOME TRADE DESK

Expertise
"CD Funding Group orchestrated a comprehensive launch plan for our proprietary market-linked CDs which brought the product to our advisors and investors in record time. They coordinated the critical conversations and infrastructure across many of our business lines and support units. Their execution was flawless. It is clear that CD Funding Group has the requisite experience and expertise to help financial institutions of all sizes to promote this significant product offering."
CURTIS J. FUSZARD, CFA, CFP®, CLTC
	PRESIDENT AND CEO
	ASSOCIATED BANK INVESTMENT SERVICES, INC.
	CLIENT SINCE 07/2011




Superior Bank Support
"Like any new program implementation, when we first started the Power CD program with CD Funding, I was a bit concerned that it would absorb a significant amount of my time each month – time I felt I really didn’t have.  In all actuality, and quite the contrary, the program represents less than 5% of my total job function.  CD Funding makes our Market-Linked CD program simple.  From an administrative standpoint, there are no knowledge prerequisites.  CD Funding notifies us of all upcoming events, prepares every report and provides all contact information we need.  CD Funding’s expertise is unmatched in the industry, and we are extremely pleased with our partnership."
DONNA R. GREER
	BUSINESS SUPPORT MANAGER
	BANK OF OKLAHOMA
	CLIENT SINCE 12/2006




Best In Class Service
"CD Funding is much more than just building and distributing our monthly proprietary offering.  CD Funding provides “best in class” training, knowledge, and service to our team, and their dedication is second to no one in our industry.  Our advisors and program have benefited greatly from the partnership with CD Funding.  Thanks to the ongoing efforts of CD Funding, I take comfort in knowing our advisors are well educated and trained to position and recommend Market-Linked CDs with current clients and prospects."
VANCE RICHARD
	PROGRAM MANAGER, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT
	IBERIA BANK FINANCIAL SERVICES, LLC
	CLIENT SINCE 06/2010




Ease of implementation
"CD Funding helped us move from concept through approval to launch in record time.  I heard at a conference recently that it has taken some banks as much as 18 months to two years to implement a proprietary CD program.  With the help of CD Funding, we were offering an equity-linked CD in the Banco Popular name just two weeks after executing an agreement with them.  CD Funding’s strong, knowledgeable team, led by Tim Bonacci, provided the guidance and strategic support to make the implementation process smooth and seamless.   Their initial rep training and ongoing field support are both critical to the success of our program."
DAVID PETERS
	PROGRAM MANAGER, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT
	BANCO POPULAR
	CLIENT SINCE 02/2011
