Spike's Tactical Spike's Tactical mission is simple, they strive to build the highest quality products and offer them at the best possible price to the consumer. It doesn’t matter if you are simply a gun enthusiast, a competitive 3 gun shooter or a military or law enforcement professional, our rifles will serve you well and will not let you down when it counts and they guarantee it. 
Spike's Tactical only uses the highest quality American made materials, you will never find inferior imported materials in their rifles.

 



Magpul From the onset of every project, Magpul uses a list of mission-driven requirements to dictate design, material construction, and manufacturing methods that will be most efficient without sacrificing quality or performance. The goal of the design itself is to be both simple and intuitive. By incorporating ergonomic considerations, a proper user interface, and subtle visual and tactile features, the product itself should actually instruct the user about its operation and function

 



Geissele Geissele Automatics was established in 2004 as a manufacturer of trigger mechanisms for the AR15 rifle. Our first trigger, the Hi-Speed National Match, was designed by our Founder, Bill Geissele, for CMP and NRA Hi-Power Rifle competition. Although designed for target shooting, the Geissele Hi-Speed trigger was found by the U.S. Military to have applications in semi-automatic sniper weapons. In 2005 Geissele Automatics received a request from the Department of Defense: "Can you build us a select-fire trigger that is as good as your Hi-Speed?" In response, Bill designed the Geissele Super Select-Fire trigger (SSF). After rigorous testing the SSF was adopted by entities in the U.S. Special Operations community and has become their trigger of choice for M4 carbine based weapons.

 



BRAVO COMPANY MANUFACTURING (BCM) BCM(Bravo Company Manufacturing) was founded in 2005 by a veteran United States Marine in Hartland, Wisconsin, where the company maintains its HQ today.
BCM builds weapon systems that are manufactured, reinforced and tested to meet the unforgiving needs of law enforcement, military, security and peace keeping professionals in some of the most high stress environments and situations in the world.

 



ALG Defense ALG Defense is a woman owned company that was founded by Amy Lynn Geissele in 2012. As a sister company to Geissele Automatics, the same manufacturing and engineering teams are utilized to deliver the most cost effective and highest quality products available. ALG's experience is resourced from all over the industry; everything from the everyday target shooter to providing equipment to various branches of the special forces as a registered defense contractor.

The most important property of a firearm lubricant is its lubricity or “slickness." In comparison to military grade CLP, Go-Juice is 500% more slick as determined by laboratory tests.  Other key characteristics of a good gun lube are corrosion resistance and long term stability or resistance to breakdown that leads to gumminess and a gun that won’t function.

 The four factors of production are as follows -    1] Land -     It is fixed and immobile in nature.    It is a free gift of nature.    It is used for many purposes such as mining, agriculture.............    It is an important factor of production, as, without land, production is not possible.    Rent is the remuneration for land.     2] Labour -     They are not fixed and are mobile in nature.    They do a variety of works like mining, construction work........    Without them, production cannot take place. So, they are an important part of production.    They move from one place to another place, one employer to another employer, in search of wage rates.    Wage rate is the remuneration for labourers.     3] Physical Capital-     They are called as 'The Life Blood of All Economic Activities '.    Without them, production cannot take place. So, they are an important part of production.    It can be divided into two - Fixed capital and Working Capital.    Interest is the remuneration for capital     4] Human Capital / Organiser / Enterprinter. -     Organiser is a person who is pooling all the factors of production.    An organiser should be ready to take risks.    Profit is the remuneration for Human Capital.
