Great service with a wide variety of products
Product came promptly and is part of the original equipment.  A different brand off the shelf of a local dealer had holes that didn't quiet match the original.

Fast service Parts same as OEM
Super fast service, replaced original valves without a problem (other then how the trailer mfg mounted them so the bolts didn't come out).

Perfect Fit!
I had to replace both the grey and black water tank valves on my toyhauler and these valves fit perfectly.  No more nasty surprises when I remove the drain cap!
