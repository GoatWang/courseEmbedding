2015-11-14T04:05:38+00:00

Inspired by the dedication and vision of its Chairman and CEO Ronald O. Perelman, MacAndrews & Forbes, its affiliates and the Perelman Family Foundation are firmly committed to philanthropy, focusing on women’s health, education and the arts.  Ranked among the top philanthropists in the United States, Mr. Perelman is driven by the philanthropic ethos that infuses all his endeavors and affiliations.
Mr. Perelman is the founder of the Revlon/UCLA Women’s Cancer Research Program, which analyzes the causes of and develops groundbreaking treatment for breast and ovarian cancer. Launched in 1994, the program was responsible for the development of Herceptin, the first genetically-based treatment for a major cancer to be approved by the FDA, which currently cures more than thirty percent of breast cancer cases in women. In 2014, he co-founded, along with Barbra Streisand, the Women’s Heart Alliance to raise awareness, encourage action and drive new research to fight heart disease in women.
This commitment to philanthropy is demonstrated through the Ronald O. Perelman Center for Emergency Services at NYU Langone Medical Center, a state-of-the-art emergency care location, opened in April 2014;  the Ronald O. Perelman Department of Dermatology at NYU Langone Medical Center, known globally for its innovative leadership in patient care, education and research in the area of dermatologic care; the Ronald O. Perelman Heart Institute at New York Presbyterian Hospital, an internationally-recognized center offering comprehensive, innovative, and world-class cardiovascular care and heart health education; and the Ronald O. Perelman and Claudia Cohen Center for Reproductive Medicine at Weill Cornell Medical Center, world-renowned for its commitment to the highest academic and scientific standards for both patient care and cutting-edge scientific research in the areas of fertility health and wellness.  The Perelman Family Foundation has also provided support to Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital and the National Breast Cancer Coalition.
Mr. Perelman is a member of the Columbia Business School Board of Overseers, where the Perelman Family Foundation donated $100 million for the construction of a new academic building.  He is a member of the Board of Trustees of Brown University, and is a trustee emeritus of the University of Pennsylvania, where he is a longtime supporter.
Mr. Perelman serves as Vice Chairman of the Apollo Theater, and sits on the board of the Museum of Modern Art, the Tribeca Film Institute, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation, and Ford’s Theater in Washington, D.C.  He is the former chairman of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York.

History[edit]
Group[edit]
MacAndrews & Forbes & Co. was founded in 1850 by Edward MacAndrews and William Forbes, a distributor of licorice extract and chocolate.[2]
In 1978, Perelman purchased a 40% stake in Cohen-Hatfield Jewelers,[3] and in 1980, Perelman, through Cohen-Hatfield Jewelers, bought MacAndrews & Forbes & Co. Through the purchase, Cohen-Hatfield Jewelers was merged into what became MacAndrews & Forbes Group Inc.[4]
Holdings[edit]
In 1983, Perelman formed MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings, Inc. to take MacAndrews & Forbes Group Inc. private. Perelman started selling bonds to acquire the remaining 66% stake in MacAndrews & Forbes Group Inc.
Also in 1983, MacAndrews acquired Technicolor Inc. The divisions were sold off and, in 1988, its core business was sold to Carlton Communications for 6.5 times the purchase price. Using the proceeds from the Technicolor division sell off, MacAndrews & Forbes purchased a 20 percent stake in Compact Video Inc., a television and film syndication company. Ownership of Compact Video Inc. was increased to 40% in 1987 after the buyout of Four Star International. Despite the bond debt, in 1984, MacAndrews & Forbes purchased Consolidated Cigar Holdings Ltd. from Gulf & Western Industries, in addition to Video Corporation of America.[4]
Revlon Group[edit]
MacAndrews next purchased Pantry Pride Inc., in June 1985. Its three retail supermarket chains were sold off within months.[4]
In 1985, Perelman also took on his biggest deal yet: The Revlon Corporation. Financed with over $700 million in junk bonds from Michael Milken's firm, Drexel Burnham Lambert, Pantry Pride Inc. offered to buy any or all of Revlon's 38.2 million outstanding shares for $47.5 per share when its street price stood at $45 per share. Initially rejected, Perelman repeatedly raised his offer until it reached $53 per share, while fighting Revlon's management every step of the way. Forstmann Little & Company swooped in and offered $56 per share. A brief public bidding war ensued, and Perelman triumphed with an offer of $58 per share. As a result, Perelman paid $1.8 billion to Revlon's shareholders, but he also paid $900 million in other costs associated with the purchase.[5]
After the acquisition, Perelman had Revlon sell four of its divisions: Two were sold for $1 billion, the Vision Care division was sold for $574 million, and, in 1988, the National Health Laboratories division became a publicly owned corporation. Additional makeup lines were purchased for Revlon: Max Factor in 1987 and Betrix in 1989 (they were later sold to Procter & Gamble, in 1991).[4] Despite Perelman's regular cleansing of upper management[6] and injecting millions of dollars into the company,[7] Revlon was unable to turn a profit for several years. As of the first quarter of 2007, it had had one profitable quarter in the previous 32.[8]
By 2012, Revlon was rebounding, and its net income had grown to $51.5 million.[9] As of April 2014, Revlon was trading at $25.45 per share, rising from a low of $1.20 per share in 2007.[10] A major cause of Revlon's financial problems was the debt load stemming from Perelman's purchase of the company.[11]
Gillette, Four Star, and the actions of the late eighties[edit]
In 1986, Ronald Perelman made several attempts on behalf of MacAndrews & Forbes to take-over Gillette Company, offering $4.12 billion, and eventually $5.7 billion. In October 1987, Perelman withdrew the last offer. In 1988, Consolidated Cigar was sold. Attempted take overs were targeted at CPC International. Ronald Perelman's controlling buyout of Compact Video was in 1986. Four Star International was purchased through a golden parachute deal that was negotiated with David Charnay and Ron Perelman after Charnay was notified of stock purchases made by Perelman. After Compact shut down, its remaining assets, including Four Star International, were folded into MacAndrews & Forbes. By the end of 1989, MacAndrews refinanced the Holding companies' junk bonds for standard bank loans.[4]
Savings and loans[edit]
Main article: Savings and Loan crisis
Perelman first entered what became known as the Savings & Loan crisis in 1988 when along with Gerald J. Ford he bought five insolvent thrifts with $12.2 billion in assets and $5.1 billion in federal aid for $315 million.[12] The five banks originally operated as a single entity named First Texas Bank, but the name changed to First Gibraltar after about a week.[13] Perelman's turn-around manifested as trimming the payroll, selling branches, and dumping of $2.5 billion of underperforming assets. In 1990, Perelman added San Antonio Savings Association and Sooner Federal to First Gibraltar for $10.1 million and $5.1 million, respectively. The purchase of San Antonio added $1.1 billion of healthy assets, $1.2 billion unhealthy assets, and a $1.3 billion government cash advance to Perelman's larder while Sooner only provided $1.2 billion in assets along with the typical government guarantees.[14][15] Sooner Federal was not only the last S&L Perelman bought, but the first he sold; In August 1992, he sold the pieces of Sooner to Bank of Oklahoma and Fourth Financial Corporation for $31.4 million.[14] The following month he sold the rest of First Gibraltar to BankAmerica for $110 million, retaining four branches in Plano, Texas and $1.2 billion of assets in the mortgage and property management sectors.[16] He renamed the four branches First Madison.[17] It's unclear how much money Perelman made from his savings & loan deals, but it's estimated that he made anywhere from $600 million to $1.2 billion with most of the profits manifesting as tax breaks elsewhere in his empire.[18] In essence, by owning First Gibraltar he was able to avoid paying hundreds of millions in federal taxes.[19]
Perelman jumped back into the savings & loan game in a big way in 1994 by buying First Nationwide from the Ford Motor Company for $664 million.[20] Ford held onto $1.8 billion of First Nationwide's assets valued at $444 million, two-thirds of which were considered troubled assets,[20] offered to buy back up to $500 million of First Nationwide's other $7.9 billion of assets that went bad in the future, and gave Perelman $50 million to cover potential severance payments.[18] Perelman quickly boosted its portfolio, adding $10 billion worth of mortgages in exchange for a $175 million payment to Resolution Trust Corporation.[21] Before 1995 ended, Perelman added two more thrifts to his collective: SFFed's $4.1 billion of assets for $250 million[22] and Home Federal Financial's $735 million of assets and $662 million of deposits for $70.6 million.[23] Just as quickly as he added assets, branches, and deposits in California, he dumped what he had elsewhere in the country. In 1995 alone he sold off 79 branches with $4.3 billion in deposits spread out across five states.[24] 1996 went a little slower, but not eventfully. He acquired California Federal Bancorp for $1.2 billion, creating the 4th largest thrift in the country with $32.3 billion in assets.[25] In 1997, another $3.3 billion in mortgages were added courtesy of WMC Mortgage but it was an otherwise quiet year for First Nationwide.[26] In 1998, Perelman negotiated a stock swap with Golden State Bancorp to create the third largest thrift in the country with $50 billion of assets. The deal left Golden State's shareholders the majority, but Perelman's camp still controlled the company.[27] Everything remained quiet until May 2002 when Citigroup announced plans to buy Golden State for $5.8 billion, but ultimately reduced the offer to $4.9 billion due to a stock drop.[28] Citigroup's final offer was 0.821 shares of Citigroup common stock and $7.47 cash for every share of Golden State exchanged, which converted Perelman's 43 million shares of Golden State into $321,210,000 in cash plus 36,124,000 shares of Citigroup. All things considered, Perelman expected to make about $2 billion off the deal, but because he had quasi-sold many of his shares in the past, he probably gained substantially less than that.[29]
Andrews Group[edit]
Andrews Group, Inc. is formed from the corporate shell of the former Compact Video. Andrews Group purchases Marvel Entertainment Group, Inc. in 1989 and later its former parent company New World Entertainment, Inc.
In 1989, Andrews Group lost $14.8 million with a negative net worth of $10 million. At this time, MacAndrews & Forbes owned 57%.
In 1991, Marvel Entertainment Group, Inc. goes public with 30% sold to the public.
Andrews Group goes on a buying spree picking up:

Fleer – September 1992
Toy Biz, Inc. – 46% Stake – 1993
SCI Television – 54% Stake – 1993
Genesis Entertainment – 50% Stake – Part of New World Entertainment.[4]

In 1994, Perelman bought four more stations from the Great American Communications Company for $360 million and four more from Argyle Television Holdings for $716 million. The purchase of Genesis and New World set up one of the spokes for the major 1994 television industry realignment in the wake of Fox's acquisition of NFL rights.[30] Rupert Murdoch bought complete control of New World Communications for $3 billion, giving Perelman a large profit from the sale.[31][32]
Meridian Sports Holdings[edit]
Also in 1989, MacAndrews & Forbes acquired The Coleman Company, Inc., maker of stoves, lanterns, and camping and other recreational equipment, for $545 million. Perelman reduced the debt for this purchase by selling the heating and air-conditioning divisions. By the end of 1990 he had sold everything except Coleman's camping equipment and boat businesses, plus added power tool and recreational vehicle businesses. Between 1993 and late 1995 he bought seven more companies for Coleman.[4] In December 1997, Perelman and Al Dunlap met in order to discuss a possible deal between Coleman and Sunbeam Products. Coleman's famous but narrow brand held less growth potential than originally thought and Ronald Perelman wanted out. Coincidentally, Al Dunlap was sitting on a financially insolvent company he wanted to dump.[33] It took until March 2 for them to finally come to an agreement: With some convincing from his banker Morgan Stanley, Perelman sold his entire stake (82%) in Coleman to Al Dunlap in exchange for $1.5 billion in cash and $680 million of Sunbeam stock.[34] They completed the deal on March 30, despite a sell-off triggering press release from March 19 that said Sunbeam would not meet sales expectations. On April 3, another press release took Sunbeam's stock from bad to worse: It would not only fall short of sales expectations for that quarter, but it would barely meet the sales expectations of two years ago. The stock went into a tail spin, falling from $54 a share to $24 a share in a matter of weeks and continued its downward spiral in the following weeks. Perelman bought control of Sunbeam in an effort to salvage the situation but it was for naught. The company had to file for bankruptcy within three years.[35]
Morgan Stanley[edit]
On February 17, 2005, Perelman filed a lawsuit against Morgan Stanley.[36] Two facts were at issue: Did Morgan Stanley know about the problems with Sunbeam and was Ronald Perelman misled? During the discovery phase, the judge became exasperated with what she perceived as deliberate stonewalling on the part of Morgan Stanley and ordered the jury to assume Morgan Stanley deliberately and knowingly defrauded Perelman.[37] Hobbled, Morgan Stanley had no choice but to argue that Perelman was too savvy an investor to have fallen for their transparent tricks.[38] After a five-week trial, the jury deliberated for two days, found in favor of Perelman, and awarded him $1.45 billion.[39] The damages stung particularly because Morgan Stanley passed up Perelman's offer to settle the case for $20 million.[40] Morgan Stanley maintained that the court case was improperly decided, citing the judge's decision to use Florida law over New York law and her decision to order the jury to consider Morgan Stanley guilty before the trial began.[41] In 2007, the courts of appeal reversed the judgement. The judges' declared Perelman hadn't provided any evidence showing he'd suffered any actual damage as a result of Morgan Stanley's actions. Perelman appealed,[42] but found himself shot down by the Florida Supreme Court who dismissed it in a 5–0 decision.[43] Undeterred even after that setback, Perelman went back to the trial court and asked for the case to be reopened because the hiding of email evidence was "a classic example of fraud on the court". The trial court rejected his arguments, but as of January 2009, he is beseeching Florida's 4th Circuit to reopen the case.[44]
SPAC[edit]
In 2007, Perelman filed the paperwork for a SPAC (Special Purpose Acquisition Company) called MAFS Acquisition through his holding company MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings. A SPAC is a company founded solely for the purpose of buying out another company, but without any preselected target company. In Perelman's case, the company was selling 50 million units for $10 each. The IPO was being underwritten by Citigroup,[45] but on December 12, 2008, a year after filing for an IPO, MAFS opted to withdraw their application for the "protection of investors".[46]

History[edit]
Group[edit]
MacAndrews & Forbes & Co. was founded in 1850 by Edward MacAndrews and William Forbes, a distributor of licorice extract and chocolate.[2]
In 1978, Perelman purchased a 40% stake in Cohen-Hatfield Jewelers,[3] and in 1980, Perelman, through Cohen-Hatfield Jewelers, bought MacAndrews & Forbes & Co. Through the purchase, Cohen-Hatfield Jewelers was merged into what became MacAndrews & Forbes Group Inc.[4]
Holdings[edit]
In 1983, Perelman formed MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings, Inc. to take MacAndrews & Forbes Group Inc. private. Perelman started selling bonds to acquire the remaining 66% stake in MacAndrews & Forbes Group Inc.
Also in 1983, MacAndrews acquired Technicolor Inc. The divisions were sold off and, in 1988, its core business was sold to Carlton Communications for 6.5 times the purchase price. Using the proceeds from the Technicolor division sell off, MacAndrews & Forbes purchased a 20 percent stake in Compact Video Inc., a television and film syndication company. Ownership of Compact Video Inc. was increased to 40% in 1987 after the buyout of Four Star International. Despite the bond debt, in 1984, MacAndrews & Forbes purchased Consolidated Cigar Holdings Ltd. from Gulf & Western Industries, in addition to Video Corporation of America.[4]
Revlon Group[edit]
MacAndrews next purchased Pantry Pride Inc., in June 1985. Its three retail supermarket chains were sold off within months.[4]
In 1985, Perelman also took on his biggest deal yet: The Revlon Corporation. Financed with over $700 million in junk bonds from Michael Milken's firm, Drexel Burnham Lambert, Pantry Pride Inc. offered to buy any or all of Revlon's 38.2 million outstanding shares for $47.5 per share when its street price stood at $45 per share. Initially rejected, Perelman repeatedly raised his offer until it reached $53 per share, while fighting Revlon's management every step of the way. Forstmann Little & Company swooped in and offered $56 per share. A brief public bidding war ensued, and Perelman triumphed with an offer of $58 per share. As a result, Perelman paid $1.8 billion to Revlon's shareholders, but he also paid $900 million in other costs associated with the purchase.[5]
After the acquisition, Perelman had Revlon sell four of its divisions: Two were sold for $1 billion, the Vision Care division was sold for $574 million, and, in 1988, the National Health Laboratories division became a publicly owned corporation. Additional makeup lines were purchased for Revlon: Max Factor in 1987 and Betrix in 1989 (they were later sold to Procter & Gamble, in 1991).[4] Despite Perelman's regular cleansing of upper management[6] and injecting millions of dollars into the company,[7] Revlon was unable to turn a profit for several years. As of the first quarter of 2007, it had had one profitable quarter in the previous 32.[8]
By 2012, Revlon was rebounding, and its net income had grown to $51.5 million.[9] As of April 2014, Revlon was trading at $25.45 per share, rising from a low of $1.20 per share in 2007.[10] A major cause of Revlon's financial problems was the debt load stemming from Perelman's purchase of the company.[11]
Gillette, Four Star, and the actions of the late eighties[edit]
In 1986, Ronald Perelman made several attempts on behalf of MacAndrews & Forbes to take-over Gillette Company, offering $4.12 billion, and eventually $5.7 billion. In October 1987, Perelman withdrew the last offer. In 1988, Consolidated Cigar was sold. Attempted take overs were targeted at CPC International. Ronald Perelman's controlling buyout of Compact Video was in 1986. Four Star International was purchased through a golden parachute deal that was negotiated with David Charnay and Ron Perelman after Charnay was notified of stock purchases made by Perelman. After Compact shut down, its remaining assets, including Four Star International, were folded into MacAndrews & Forbes. By the end of 1989, MacAndrews refinanced the Holding companies' junk bonds for standard bank loans.[4]
Savings and loans[edit]
Main article: Savings and Loan crisis
Perelman first entered what became known as the Savings & Loan crisis in 1988 when along with Gerald J. Ford he bought five insolvent thrifts with $12.2 billion in assets and $5.1 billion in federal aid for $315 million.[12] The five banks originally operated as a single entity named First Texas Bank, but the name changed to First Gibraltar after about a week.[13] Perelman's turn-around manifested as trimming the payroll, selling branches, and dumping of $2.5 billion of underperforming assets. In 1990, Perelman added San Antonio Savings Association and Sooner Federal to First Gibraltar for $10.1 million and $5.1 million, respectively. The purchase of San Antonio added $1.1 billion of healthy assets, $1.2 billion unhealthy assets, and a $1.3 billion government cash advance to Perelman's larder while Sooner only provided $1.2 billion in assets along with the typical government guarantees.[14][15] Sooner Federal was not only the last S&L Perelman bought, but the first he sold; In August 1992, he sold the pieces of Sooner to Bank of Oklahoma and Fourth Financial Corporation for $31.4 million.[14] The following month he sold the rest of First Gibraltar to BankAmerica for $110 million, retaining four branches in Plano, Texas and $1.2 billion of assets in the mortgage and property management sectors.[16] He renamed the four branches First Madison.[17] It's unclear how much money Perelman made from his savings & loan deals, but it's estimated that he made anywhere from $600 million to $1.2 billion with most of the profits manifesting as tax breaks elsewhere in his empire.[18] In essence, by owning First Gibraltar he was able to avoid paying hundreds of millions in federal taxes.[19]
Perelman jumped back into the savings & loan game in a big way in 1994 by buying First Nationwide from the Ford Motor Company for $664 million.[20] Ford held onto $1.8 billion of First Nationwide's assets valued at $444 million, two-thirds of which were considered troubled assets,[20] offered to buy back up to $500 million of First Nationwide's other $7.9 billion of assets that went bad in the future, and gave Perelman $50 million to cover potential severance payments.[18] Perelman quickly boosted its portfolio, adding $10 billion worth of mortgages in exchange for a $175 million payment to Resolution Trust Corporation.[21] Before 1995 ended, Perelman added two more thrifts to his collective: SFFed's $4.1 billion of assets for $250 million[22] and Home Federal Financial's $735 million of assets and $662 million of deposits for $70.6 million.[23] Just as quickly as he added assets, branches, and deposits in California, he dumped what he had elsewhere in the country. In 1995 alone he sold off 79 branches with $4.3 billion in deposits spread out across five states.[24] 1996 went a little slower, but not eventfully. He acquired California Federal Bancorp for $1.2 billion, creating the 4th largest thrift in the country with $32.3 billion in assets.[25] In 1997, another $3.3 billion in mortgages were added courtesy of WMC Mortgage but it was an otherwise quiet year for First Nationwide.[26] In 1998, Perelman negotiated a stock swap with Golden State Bancorp to create the third largest thrift in the country with $50 billion of assets. The deal left Golden State's shareholders the majority, but Perelman's camp still controlled the company.[27] Everything remained quiet until May 2002 when Citigroup announced plans to buy Golden State for $5.8 billion, but ultimately reduced the offer to $4.9 billion due to a stock drop.[28] Citigroup's final offer was 0.821 shares of Citigroup common stock and $7.47 cash for every share of Golden State exchanged, which converted Perelman's 43 million shares of Golden State into $321,210,000 in cash plus 36,124,000 shares of Citigroup. All things considered, Perelman expected to make about $2 billion off the deal, but because he had quasi-sold many of his shares in the past, he probably gained substantially less than that.[29]
Andrews Group[edit]
Andrews Group, Inc. is formed from the corporate shell of the former Compact Video. Andrews Group purchases Marvel Entertainment Group, Inc. in 1989 and later its former parent company New World Entertainment, Inc.
In 1989, Andrews Group lost $14.8 million with a negative net worth of $10 million. At this time, MacAndrews & Forbes owned 57%.
In 1991, Marvel Entertainment Group, Inc. goes public with 30% sold to the public.
Andrews Group goes on a buying spree picking up:

Fleer – September 1992
Toy Biz, Inc. – 46% Stake – 1993
SCI Television – 54% Stake – 1993
Genesis Entertainment – 50% Stake – Part of New World Entertainment.[4]

In 1994, Perelman bought four more stations from the Great American Communications Company for $360 million and four more from Argyle Television Holdings for $716 million. The purchase of Genesis and New World set up one of the spokes for the major 1994 television industry realignment in the wake of Fox's acquisition of NFL rights.[30] Rupert Murdoch bought complete control of New World Communications for $3 billion, giving Perelman a large profit from the sale.[31][32]
Meridian Sports Holdings[edit]
Also in 1989, MacAndrews & Forbes acquired The Coleman Company, Inc., maker of stoves, lanterns, and camping and other recreational equipment, for $545 million. Perelman reduced the debt for this purchase by selling the heating and air-conditioning divisions. By the end of 1990 he had sold everything except Coleman's camping equipment and boat businesses, plus added power tool and recreational vehicle businesses. Between 1993 and late 1995 he bought seven more companies for Coleman.[4] In December 1997, Perelman and Al Dunlap met in order to discuss a possible deal between Coleman and Sunbeam Products. Coleman's famous but narrow brand held less growth potential than originally thought and Ronald Perelman wanted out. Coincidentally, Al Dunlap was sitting on a financially insolvent company he wanted to dump.[33] It took until March 2 for them to finally come to an agreement: With some convincing from his banker Morgan Stanley, Perelman sold his entire stake (82%) in Coleman to Al Dunlap in exchange for $1.5 billion in cash and $680 million of Sunbeam stock.[34] They completed the deal on March 30, despite a sell-off triggering press release from March 19 that said Sunbeam would not meet sales expectations. On April 3, another press release took Sunbeam's stock from bad to worse: It would not only fall short of sales expectations for that quarter, but it would barely meet the sales expectations of two years ago. The stock went into a tail spin, falling from $54 a share to $24 a share in a matter of weeks and continued its downward spiral in the following weeks. Perelman bought control of Sunbeam in an effort to salvage the situation but it was for naught. The company had to file for bankruptcy within three years.[35]
Morgan Stanley[edit]
On February 17, 2005, Perelman filed a lawsuit against Morgan Stanley.[36] Two facts were at issue: Did Morgan Stanley know about the problems with Sunbeam and was Ronald Perelman misled? During the discovery phase, the judge became exasperated with what she perceived as deliberate stonewalling on the part of Morgan Stanley and ordered the jury to assume Morgan Stanley deliberately and knowingly defrauded Perelman.[37] Hobbled, Morgan Stanley had no choice but to argue that Perelman was too savvy an investor to have fallen for their transparent tricks.[38] After a five-week trial, the jury deliberated for two days, found in favor of Perelman, and awarded him $1.45 billion.[39] The damages stung particularly because Morgan Stanley passed up Perelman's offer to settle the case for $20 million.[40] Morgan Stanley maintained that the court case was improperly decided, citing the judge's decision to use Florida law over New York law and her decision to order the jury to consider Morgan Stanley guilty before the trial began.[41] In 2007, the courts of appeal reversed the judgement. The judges' declared Perelman hadn't provided any evidence showing he'd suffered any actual damage as a result of Morgan Stanley's actions. Perelman appealed,[42] but found himself shot down by the Florida Supreme Court who dismissed it in a 5–0 decision.[43] Undeterred even after that setback, Perelman went back to the trial court and asked for the case to be reopened because the hiding of email evidence was "a classic example of fraud on the court". The trial court rejected his arguments, but as of January 2009, he is beseeching Florida's 4th Circuit to reopen the case.[44]
SPAC[edit]
In 2007, Perelman filed the paperwork for a SPAC (Special Purpose Acquisition Company) called MAFS Acquisition through his holding company MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings. A SPAC is a company founded solely for the purpose of buying out another company, but without any preselected target company. In Perelman's case, the company was selling 50 million units for $10 each. The IPO was being underwritten by Citigroup,[45] but on December 12, 2008, a year after filing for an IPO, MAFS opted to withdraw their application for the "protection of investors".[46]

History[edit]
Group[edit]
MacAndrews & Forbes & Co. was founded in 1850 by Edward MacAndrews and William Forbes, a distributor of licorice extract and chocolate.[2]
In 1978, Perelman purchased a 40% stake in Cohen-Hatfield Jewelers,[3] and in 1980, Perelman, through Cohen-Hatfield Jewelers, bought MacAndrews & Forbes & Co. Through the purchase, Cohen-Hatfield Jewelers was merged into what became MacAndrews & Forbes Group Inc.[4]
Holdings[edit]
In 1983, Perelman formed MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings, Inc. to take MacAndrews & Forbes Group Inc. private. Perelman started selling bonds to acquire the remaining 66% stake in MacAndrews & Forbes Group Inc.
Also in 1983, MacAndrews acquired Technicolor Inc. The divisions were sold off and, in 1988, its core business was sold to Carlton Communications for 6.5 times the purchase price. Using the proceeds from the Technicolor division sell off, MacAndrews & Forbes purchased a 20 percent stake in Compact Video Inc., a television and film syndication company. Ownership of Compact Video Inc. was increased to 40% in 1987 after the buyout of Four Star International. Despite the bond debt, in 1984, MacAndrews & Forbes purchased Consolidated Cigar Holdings Ltd. from Gulf & Western Industries, in addition to Video Corporation of America.[4]
Revlon Group[edit]
MacAndrews next purchased Pantry Pride Inc., in June 1985. Its three retail supermarket chains were sold off within months.[4]
In 1985, Perelman also took on his biggest deal yet: The Revlon Corporation. Financed with over $700 million in junk bonds from Michael Milken's firm, Drexel Burnham Lambert, Pantry Pride Inc. offered to buy any or all of Revlon's 38.2 million outstanding shares for $47.5 per share when its street price stood at $45 per share. Initially rejected, Perelman repeatedly raised his offer until it reached $53 per share, while fighting Revlon's management every step of the way. Forstmann Little & Company swooped in and offered $56 per share. A brief public bidding war ensued, and Perelman triumphed with an offer of $58 per share. As a result, Perelman paid $1.8 billion to Revlon's shareholders, but he also paid $900 million in other costs associated with the purchase.[5]
After the acquisition, Perelman had Revlon sell four of its divisions: Two were sold for $1 billion, the Vision Care division was sold for $574 million, and, in 1988, the National Health Laboratories division became a publicly owned corporation. Additional makeup lines were purchased for Revlon: Max Factor in 1987 and Betrix in 1989 (they were later sold to Procter & Gamble, in 1991).[4] Despite Perelman's regular cleansing of upper management[6] and injecting millions of dollars into the company,[7] Revlon was unable to turn a profit for several years. As of the first quarter of 2007, it had had one profitable quarter in the previous 32.[8]
By 2012, Revlon was rebounding, and its net income had grown to $51.5 million.[9] As of April 2014, Revlon was trading at $25.45 per share, rising from a low of $1.20 per share in 2007.[10] A major cause of Revlon's financial problems was the debt load stemming from Perelman's purchase of the company.[11]
Gillette, Four Star, and the actions of the late eighties[edit]
In 1986, Ronald Perelman made several attempts on behalf of MacAndrews & Forbes to take-over Gillette Company, offering $4.12 billion, and eventually $5.7 billion. In October 1987, Perelman withdrew the last offer. In 1988, Consolidated Cigar was sold. Attempted take overs were targeted at CPC International. Ronald Perelman's controlling buyout of Compact Video was in 1986. Four Star International was purchased through a golden parachute deal that was negotiated with David Charnay and Ron Perelman after Charnay was notified of stock purchases made by Perelman. After Compact shut down, its remaining assets, including Four Star International, were folded into MacAndrews & Forbes. By the end of 1989, MacAndrews refinanced the Holding companies' junk bonds for standard bank loans.[4]
Savings and loans[edit]
Main article: Savings and Loan crisis
Perelman first entered what became known as the Savings & Loan crisis in 1988 when along with Gerald J. Ford he bought five insolvent thrifts with $12.2 billion in assets and $5.1 billion in federal aid for $315 million.[12] The five banks originally operated as a single entity named First Texas Bank, but the name changed to First Gibraltar after about a week.[13] Perelman's turn-around manifested as trimming the payroll, selling branches, and dumping of $2.5 billion of underperforming assets. In 1990, Perelman added San Antonio Savings Association and Sooner Federal to First Gibraltar for $10.1 million and $5.1 million, respectively. The purchase of San Antonio added $1.1 billion of healthy assets, $1.2 billion unhealthy assets, and a $1.3 billion government cash advance to Perelman's larder while Sooner only provided $1.2 billion in assets along with the typical government guarantees.[14][15] Sooner Federal was not only the last S&L Perelman bought, but the first he sold; In August 1992, he sold the pieces of Sooner to Bank of Oklahoma and Fourth Financial Corporation for $31.4 million.[14] The following month he sold the rest of First Gibraltar to BankAmerica for $110 million, retaining four branches in Plano, Texas and $1.2 billion of assets in the mortgage and property management sectors.[16] He renamed the four branches First Madison.[17] It's unclear how much money Perelman made from his savings & loan deals, but it's estimated that he made anywhere from $600 million to $1.2 billion with most of the profits manifesting as tax breaks elsewhere in his empire.[18] In essence, by owning First Gibraltar he was able to avoid paying hundreds of millions in federal taxes.[19]
Perelman jumped back into the savings & loan game in a big way in 1994 by buying First Nationwide from the Ford Motor Company for $664 million.[20] Ford held onto $1.8 billion of First Nationwide's assets valued at $444 million, two-thirds of which were considered troubled assets,[20] offered to buy back up to $500 million of First Nationwide's other $7.9 billion of assets that went bad in the future, and gave Perelman $50 million to cover potential severance payments.[18] Perelman quickly boosted its portfolio, adding $10 billion worth of mortgages in exchange for a $175 million payment to Resolution Trust Corporation.[21] Before 1995 ended, Perelman added two more thrifts to his collective: SFFed's $4.1 billion of assets for $250 million[22] and Home Federal Financial's $735 million of assets and $662 million of deposits for $70.6 million.[23] Just as quickly as he added assets, branches, and deposits in California, he dumped what he had elsewhere in the country. In 1995 alone he sold off 79 branches with $4.3 billion in deposits spread out across five states.[24] 1996 went a little slower, but not eventfully. He acquired California Federal Bancorp for $1.2 billion, creating the 4th largest thrift in the country with $32.3 billion in assets.[25] In 1997, another $3.3 billion in mortgages were added courtesy of WMC Mortgage but it was an otherwise quiet year for First Nationwide.[26] In 1998, Perelman negotiated a stock swap with Golden State Bancorp to create the third largest thrift in the country with $50 billion of assets. The deal left Golden State's shareholders the majority, but Perelman's camp still controlled the company.[27] Everything remained quiet until May 2002 when Citigroup announced plans to buy Golden State for $5.8 billion, but ultimately reduced the offer to $4.9 billion due to a stock drop.[28] Citigroup's final offer was 0.821 shares of Citigroup common stock and $7.47 cash for every share of Golden State exchanged, which converted Perelman's 43 million shares of Golden State into $321,210,000 in cash plus 36,124,000 shares of Citigroup. All things considered, Perelman expected to make about $2 billion off the deal, but because he had quasi-sold many of his shares in the past, he probably gained substantially less than that.[29]
Andrews Group[edit]
Andrews Group, Inc. is formed from the corporate shell of the former Compact Video. Andrews Group purchases Marvel Entertainment Group, Inc. in 1989 and later its former parent company New World Entertainment, Inc.
In 1989, Andrews Group lost $14.8 million with a negative net worth of $10 million. At this time, MacAndrews & Forbes owned 57%.
In 1991, Marvel Entertainment Group, Inc. goes public with 30% sold to the public.
Andrews Group goes on a buying spree picking up:

Fleer – September 1992
Toy Biz, Inc. – 46% Stake – 1993
SCI Television – 54% Stake – 1993
Genesis Entertainment – 50% Stake – Part of New World Entertainment.[4]

In 1994, Perelman bought four more stations from the Great American Communications Company for $360 million and four more from Argyle Television Holdings for $716 million. The purchase of Genesis and New World set up one of the spokes for the major 1994 television industry realignment in the wake of Fox's acquisition of NFL rights.[30] Rupert Murdoch bought complete control of New World Communications for $3 billion, giving Perelman a large profit from the sale.[31][32]
Meridian Sports Holdings[edit]
Also in 1989, MacAndrews & Forbes acquired The Coleman Company, Inc., maker of stoves, lanterns, and camping and other recreational equipment, for $545 million. Perelman reduced the debt for this purchase by selling the heating and air-conditioning divisions. By the end of 1990 he had sold everything except Coleman's camping equipment and boat businesses, plus added power tool and recreational vehicle businesses. Between 1993 and late 1995 he bought seven more companies for Coleman.[4] In December 1997, Perelman and Al Dunlap met in order to discuss a possible deal between Coleman and Sunbeam Products. Coleman's famous but narrow brand held less growth potential than originally thought and Ronald Perelman wanted out. Coincidentally, Al Dunlap was sitting on a financially insolvent company he wanted to dump.[33] It took until March 2 for them to finally come to an agreement: With some convincing from his banker Morgan Stanley, Perelman sold his entire stake (82%) in Coleman to Al Dunlap in exchange for $1.5 billion in cash and $680 million of Sunbeam stock.[34] They completed the deal on March 30, despite a sell-off triggering press release from March 19 that said Sunbeam would not meet sales expectations. On April 3, another press release took Sunbeam's stock from bad to worse: It would not only fall short of sales expectations for that quarter, but it would barely meet the sales expectations of two years ago. The stock went into a tail spin, falling from $54 a share to $24 a share in a matter of weeks and continued its downward spiral in the following weeks. Perelman bought control of Sunbeam in an effort to salvage the situation but it was for naught. The company had to file for bankruptcy within three years.[35]
Morgan Stanley[edit]
On February 17, 2005, Perelman filed a lawsuit against Morgan Stanley.[36] Two facts were at issue: Did Morgan Stanley know about the problems with Sunbeam and was Ronald Perelman misled? During the discovery phase, the judge became exasperated with what she perceived as deliberate stonewalling on the part of Morgan Stanley and ordered the jury to assume Morgan Stanley deliberately and knowingly defrauded Perelman.[37] Hobbled, Morgan Stanley had no choice but to argue that Perelman was too savvy an investor to have fallen for their transparent tricks.[38] After a five-week trial, the jury deliberated for two days, found in favor of Perelman, and awarded him $1.45 billion.[39] The damages stung particularly because Morgan Stanley passed up Perelman's offer to settle the case for $20 million.[40] Morgan Stanley maintained that the court case was improperly decided, citing the judge's decision to use Florida law over New York law and her decision to order the jury to consider Morgan Stanley guilty before the trial began.[41] In 2007, the courts of appeal reversed the judgement. The judges' declared Perelman hadn't provided any evidence showing he'd suffered any actual damage as a result of Morgan Stanley's actions. Perelman appealed,[42] but found himself shot down by the Florida Supreme Court who dismissed it in a 5–0 decision.[43] Undeterred even after that setback, Perelman went back to the trial court and asked for the case to be reopened because the hiding of email evidence was "a classic example of fraud on the court". The trial court rejected his arguments, but as of January 2009, he is beseeching Florida's 4th Circuit to reopen the case.[44]
SPAC[edit]
In 2007, Perelman filed the paperwork for a SPAC (Special Purpose Acquisition Company) called MAFS Acquisition through his holding company MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings. A SPAC is a company founded solely for the purpose of buying out another company, but without any preselected target company. In Perelman's case, the company was selling 50 million units for $10 each. The IPO was being underwritten by Citigroup,[45] but on December 12, 2008, a year after filing for an IPO, MAFS opted to withdraw their application for the "protection of investors".[46]

History[edit]
Group[edit]
MacAndrews & Forbes & Co. was founded in 1850 by Edward MacAndrews and William Forbes, a distributor of licorice extract and chocolate.[2]
In 1978, Perelman purchased a 40% stake in Cohen-Hatfield Jewelers,[3] and in 1980, Perelman, through Cohen-Hatfield Jewelers, bought MacAndrews & Forbes & Co. Through the purchase, Cohen-Hatfield Jewelers was merged into what became MacAndrews & Forbes Group Inc.[4]
Holdings[edit]
In 1983, Perelman formed MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings, Inc. to take MacAndrews & Forbes Group Inc. private. Perelman started selling bonds to acquire the remaining 66% stake in MacAndrews & Forbes Group Inc.
Also in 1983, MacAndrews acquired Technicolor Inc. The divisions were sold off and, in 1988, its core business was sold to Carlton Communications for 6.5 times the purchase price. Using the proceeds from the Technicolor division sell off, MacAndrews & Forbes purchased a 20 percent stake in Compact Video Inc., a television and film syndication company. Ownership of Compact Video Inc. was increased to 40% in 1987 after the buyout of Four Star International. Despite the bond debt, in 1984, MacAndrews & Forbes purchased Consolidated Cigar Holdings Ltd. from Gulf & Western Industries, in addition to Video Corporation of America.[4]
Revlon Group[edit]
MacAndrews next purchased Pantry Pride Inc., in June 1985. Its three retail supermarket chains were sold off within months.[4]
In 1985, Perelman also took on his biggest deal yet: The Revlon Corporation. Financed with over $700 million in junk bonds from Michael Milken's firm, Drexel Burnham Lambert, Pantry Pride Inc. offered to buy any or all of Revlon's 38.2 million outstanding shares for $47.5 per share when its street price stood at $45 per share. Initially rejected, Perelman repeatedly raised his offer until it reached $53 per share, while fighting Revlon's management every step of the way. Forstmann Little & Company swooped in and offered $56 per share. A brief public bidding war ensued, and Perelman triumphed with an offer of $58 per share. As a result, Perelman paid $1.8 billion to Revlon's shareholders, but he also paid $900 million in other costs associated with the purchase.[5]
After the acquisition, Perelman had Revlon sell four of its divisions: Two were sold for $1 billion, the Vision Care division was sold for $574 million, and, in 1988, the National Health Laboratories division became a publicly owned corporation. Additional makeup lines were purchased for Revlon: Max Factor in 1987 and Betrix in 1989 (they were later sold to Procter & Gamble, in 1991).[4] Despite Perelman's regular cleansing of upper management[6] and injecting millions of dollars into the company,[7] Revlon was unable to turn a profit for several years. As of the first quarter of 2007, it had had one profitable quarter in the previous 32.[8]
By 2012, Revlon was rebounding, and its net income had grown to $51.5 million.[9] As of April 2014, Revlon was trading at $25.45 per share, rising from a low of $1.20 per share in 2007.[10] A major cause of Revlon's financial problems was the debt load stemming from Perelman's purchase of the company.[11]
Gillette, Four Star, and the actions of the late eighties[edit]
In 1986, Ronald Perelman made several attempts on behalf of MacAndrews & Forbes to take-over Gillette Company, offering $4.12 billion, and eventually $5.7 billion. In October 1987, Perelman withdrew the last offer. In 1988, Consolidated Cigar was sold. Attempted take overs were targeted at CPC International. Ronald Perelman's controlling buyout of Compact Video was in 1986. Four Star International was purchased through a golden parachute deal that was negotiated with David Charnay and Ron Perelman after Charnay was notified of stock purchases made by Perelman. After Compact shut down, its remaining assets, including Four Star International, were folded into MacAndrews & Forbes. By the end of 1989, MacAndrews refinanced the Holding companies' junk bonds for standard bank loans.[4]
Savings and loans[edit]
Main article: Savings and Loan crisis
Perelman first entered what became known as the Savings & Loan crisis in 1988 when along with Gerald J. Ford he bought five insolvent thrifts with $12.2 billion in assets and $5.1 billion in federal aid for $315 million.[12] The five banks originally operated as a single entity named First Texas Bank, but the name changed to First Gibraltar after about a week.[13] Perelman's turn-around manifested as trimming the payroll, selling branches, and dumping of $2.5 billion of underperforming assets. In 1990, Perelman added San Antonio Savings Association and Sooner Federal to First Gibraltar for $10.1 million and $5.1 million, respectively. The purchase of San Antonio added $1.1 billion of healthy assets, $1.2 billion unhealthy assets, and a $1.3 billion government cash advance to Perelman's larder while Sooner only provided $1.2 billion in assets along with the typical government guarantees.[14][15] Sooner Federal was not only the last S&L Perelman bought, but the first he sold; In August 1992, he sold the pieces of Sooner to Bank of Oklahoma and Fourth Financial Corporation for $31.4 million.[14] The following month he sold the rest of First Gibraltar to BankAmerica for $110 million, retaining four branches in Plano, Texas and $1.2 billion of assets in the mortgage and property management sectors.[16] He renamed the four branches First Madison.[17] It's unclear how much money Perelman made from his savings & loan deals, but it's estimated that he made anywhere from $600 million to $1.2 billion with most of the profits manifesting as tax breaks elsewhere in his empire.[18] In essence, by owning First Gibraltar he was able to avoid paying hundreds of millions in federal taxes.[19]
Perelman jumped back into the savings & loan game in a big way in 1994 by buying First Nationwide from the Ford Motor Company for $664 million.[20] Ford held onto $1.8 billion of First Nationwide's assets valued at $444 million, two-thirds of which were considered troubled assets,[20] offered to buy back up to $500 million of First Nationwide's other $7.9 billion of assets that went bad in the future, and gave Perelman $50 million to cover potential severance payments.[18] Perelman quickly boosted its portfolio, adding $10 billion worth of mortgages in exchange for a $175 million payment to Resolution Trust Corporation.[21] Before 1995 ended, Perelman added two more thrifts to his collective: SFFed's $4.1 billion of assets for $250 million[22] and Home Federal Financial's $735 million of assets and $662 million of deposits for $70.6 million.[23] Just as quickly as he added assets, branches, and deposits in California, he dumped what he had elsewhere in the country. In 1995 alone he sold off 79 branches with $4.3 billion in deposits spread out across five states.[24] 1996 went a little slower, but not eventfully. He acquired California Federal Bancorp for $1.2 billion, creating the 4th largest thrift in the country with $32.3 billion in assets.[25] In 1997, another $3.3 billion in mortgages were added courtesy of WMC Mortgage but it was an otherwise quiet year for First Nationwide.[26] In 1998, Perelman negotiated a stock swap with Golden State Bancorp to create the third largest thrift in the country with $50 billion of assets. The deal left Golden State's shareholders the majority, but Perelman's camp still controlled the company.[27] Everything remained quiet until May 2002 when Citigroup announced plans to buy Golden State for $5.8 billion, but ultimately reduced the offer to $4.9 billion due to a stock drop.[28] Citigroup's final offer was 0.821 shares of Citigroup common stock and $7.47 cash for every share of Golden State exchanged, which converted Perelman's 43 million shares of Golden State into $321,210,000 in cash plus 36,124,000 shares of Citigroup. All things considered, Perelman expected to make about $2 billion off the deal, but because he had quasi-sold many of his shares in the past, he probably gained substantially less than that.[29]
Andrews Group[edit]
Andrews Group, Inc. is formed from the corporate shell of the former Compact Video. Andrews Group purchases Marvel Entertainment Group, Inc. in 1989 and later its former parent company New World Entertainment, Inc.
In 1989, Andrews Group lost $14.8 million with a negative net worth of $10 million. At this time, MacAndrews & Forbes owned 57%.
In 1991, Marvel Entertainment Group, Inc. goes public with 30% sold to the public.
Andrews Group goes on a buying spree picking up:

Fleer – September 1992
Toy Biz, Inc. – 46% Stake – 1993
SCI Television – 54% Stake – 1993
Genesis Entertainment – 50% Stake – Part of New World Entertainment.[4]

In 1994, Perelman bought four more stations from the Great American Communications Company for $360 million and four more from Argyle Television Holdings for $716 million. The purchase of Genesis and New World set up one of the spokes for the major 1994 television industry realignment in the wake of Fox's acquisition of NFL rights.[30] Rupert Murdoch bought complete control of New World Communications for $3 billion, giving Perelman a large profit from the sale.[31][32]
Meridian Sports Holdings[edit]
Also in 1989, MacAndrews & Forbes acquired The Coleman Company, Inc., maker of stoves, lanterns, and camping and other recreational equipment, for $545 million. Perelman reduced the debt for this purchase by selling the heating and air-conditioning divisions. By the end of 1990 he had sold everything except Coleman's camping equipment and boat businesses, plus added power tool and recreational vehicle businesses. Between 1993 and late 1995 he bought seven more companies for Coleman.[4] In December 1997, Perelman and Al Dunlap met in order to discuss a possible deal between Coleman and Sunbeam Products. Coleman's famous but narrow brand held less growth potential than originally thought and Ronald Perelman wanted out. Coincidentally, Al Dunlap was sitting on a financially insolvent company he wanted to dump.[33] It took until March 2 for them to finally come to an agreement: With some convincing from his banker Morgan Stanley, Perelman sold his entire stake (82%) in Coleman to Al Dunlap in exchange for $1.5 billion in cash and $680 million of Sunbeam stock.[34] They completed the deal on March 30, despite a sell-off triggering press release from March 19 that said Sunbeam would not meet sales expectations. On April 3, another press release took Sunbeam's stock from bad to worse: It would not only fall short of sales expectations for that quarter, but it would barely meet the sales expectations of two years ago. The stock went into a tail spin, falling from $54 a share to $24 a share in a matter of weeks and continued its downward spiral in the following weeks. Perelman bought control of Sunbeam in an effort to salvage the situation but it was for naught. The company had to file for bankruptcy within three years.[35]
Morgan Stanley[edit]
On February 17, 2005, Perelman filed a lawsuit against Morgan Stanley.[36] Two facts were at issue: Did Morgan Stanley know about the problems with Sunbeam and was Ronald Perelman misled? During the discovery phase, the judge became exasperated with what she perceived as deliberate stonewalling on the part of Morgan Stanley and ordered the jury to assume Morgan Stanley deliberately and knowingly defrauded Perelman.[37] Hobbled, Morgan Stanley had no choice but to argue that Perelman was too savvy an investor to have fallen for their transparent tricks.[38] After a five-week trial, the jury deliberated for two days, found in favor of Perelman, and awarded him $1.45 billion.[39] The damages stung particularly because Morgan Stanley passed up Perelman's offer to settle the case for $20 million.[40] Morgan Stanley maintained that the court case was improperly decided, citing the judge's decision to use Florida law over New York law and her decision to order the jury to consider Morgan Stanley guilty before the trial began.[41] In 2007, the courts of appeal reversed the judgement. The judges' declared Perelman hadn't provided any evidence showing he'd suffered any actual damage as a result of Morgan Stanley's actions. Perelman appealed,[42] but found himself shot down by the Florida Supreme Court who dismissed it in a 5–0 decision.[43] Undeterred even after that setback, Perelman went back to the trial court and asked for the case to be reopened because the hiding of email evidence was "a classic example of fraud on the court". The trial court rejected his arguments, but as of January 2009, he is beseeching Florida's 4th Circuit to reopen the case.[44]
SPAC[edit]
In 2007, Perelman filed the paperwork for a SPAC (Special Purpose Acquisition Company) called MAFS Acquisition through his holding company MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings. A SPAC is a company founded solely for the purpose of buying out another company, but without any preselected target company. In Perelman's case, the company was selling 50 million units for $10 each. The IPO was being underwritten by Citigroup,[45] but on December 12, 2008, a year after filing for an IPO, MAFS opted to withdraw their application for the "protection of investors".[46]

History[edit]
Group[edit]
MacAndrews & Forbes & Co. was founded in 1850 by Edward MacAndrews and William Forbes, a distributor of licorice extract and chocolate.[2]
In 1978, Perelman purchased a 40% stake in Cohen-Hatfield Jewelers,[3] and in 1980, Perelman, through Cohen-Hatfield Jewelers, bought MacAndrews & Forbes & Co. Through the purchase, Cohen-Hatfield Jewelers was merged into what became MacAndrews & Forbes Group Inc.[4]
Holdings[edit]
In 1983, Perelman formed MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings, Inc. to take MacAndrews & Forbes Group Inc. private. Perelman started selling bonds to acquire the remaining 66% stake in MacAndrews & Forbes Group Inc.
Also in 1983, MacAndrews acquired Technicolor Inc. The divisions were sold off and, in 1988, its core business was sold to Carlton Communications for 6.5 times the purchase price. Using the proceeds from the Technicolor division sell off, MacAndrews & Forbes purchased a 20 percent stake in Compact Video Inc., a television and film syndication company. Ownership of Compact Video Inc. was increased to 40% in 1987 after the buyout of Four Star International. Despite the bond debt, in 1984, MacAndrews & Forbes purchased Consolidated Cigar Holdings Ltd. from Gulf & Western Industries, in addition to Video Corporation of America.[4]
Revlon Group[edit]
MacAndrews next purchased Pantry Pride Inc., in June 1985. Its three retail supermarket chains were sold off within months.[4]
In 1985, Perelman also took on his biggest deal yet: The Revlon Corporation. Financed with over $700 million in junk bonds from Michael Milken's firm, Drexel Burnham Lambert, Pantry Pride Inc. offered to buy any or all of Revlon's 38.2 million outstanding shares for $47.5 per share when its street price stood at $45 per share. Initially rejected, Perelman repeatedly raised his offer until it reached $53 per share, while fighting Revlon's management every step of the way. Forstmann Little & Company swooped in and offered $56 per share. A brief public bidding war ensued, and Perelman triumphed with an offer of $58 per share. As a result, Perelman paid $1.8 billion to Revlon's shareholders, but he also paid $900 million in other costs associated with the purchase.[5]
After the acquisition, Perelman had Revlon sell four of its divisions: Two were sold for $1 billion, the Vision Care division was sold for $574 million, and, in 1988, the National Health Laboratories division became a publicly owned corporation. Additional makeup lines were purchased for Revlon: Max Factor in 1987 and Betrix in 1989 (they were later sold to Procter & Gamble, in 1991).[4] Despite Perelman's regular cleansing of upper management[6] and injecting millions of dollars into the company,[7] Revlon was unable to turn a profit for several years. As of the first quarter of 2007, it had had one profitable quarter in the previous 32.[8]
By 2012, Revlon was rebounding, and its net income had grown to $51.5 million.[9] As of April 2014, Revlon was trading at $25.45 per share, rising from a low of $1.20 per share in 2007.[10] A major cause of Revlon's financial problems was the debt load stemming from Perelman's purchase of the company.[11]
Gillette, Four Star, and the actions of the late eighties[edit]
In 1986, Ronald Perelman made several attempts on behalf of MacAndrews & Forbes to take-over Gillette Company, offering $4.12 billion, and eventually $5.7 billion. In October 1987, Perelman withdrew the last offer. In 1988, Consolidated Cigar was sold. Attempted take overs were targeted at CPC International. Ronald Perelman's controlling buyout of Compact Video was in 1986. Four Star International was purchased through a golden parachute deal that was negotiated with David Charnay and Ron Perelman after Charnay was notified of stock purchases made by Perelman. After Compact shut down, its remaining assets, including Four Star International, were folded into MacAndrews & Forbes. By the end of 1989, MacAndrews refinanced the Holding companies' junk bonds for standard bank loans.[4]
Savings and loans[edit]
Main article: Savings and Loan crisis
Perelman first entered what became known as the Savings & Loan crisis in 1988 when along with Gerald J. Ford he bought five insolvent thrifts with $12.2 billion in assets and $5.1 billion in federal aid for $315 million.[12] The five banks originally operated as a single entity named First Texas Bank, but the name changed to First Gibraltar after about a week.[13] Perelman's turn-around manifested as trimming the payroll, selling branches, and dumping of $2.5 billion of underperforming assets. In 1990, Perelman added San Antonio Savings Association and Sooner Federal to First Gibraltar for $10.1 million and $5.1 million, respectively. The purchase of San Antonio added $1.1 billion of healthy assets, $1.2 billion unhealthy assets, and a $1.3 billion government cash advance to Perelman's larder while Sooner only provided $1.2 billion in assets along with the typical government guarantees.[14][15] Sooner Federal was not only the last S&L Perelman bought, but the first he sold; In August 1992, he sold the pieces of Sooner to Bank of Oklahoma and Fourth Financial Corporation for $31.4 million.[14] The following month he sold the rest of First Gibraltar to BankAmerica for $110 million, retaining four branches in Plano, Texas and $1.2 billion of assets in the mortgage and property management sectors.[16] He renamed the four branches First Madison.[17] It's unclear how much money Perelman made from his savings & loan deals, but it's estimated that he made anywhere from $600 million to $1.2 billion with most of the profits manifesting as tax breaks elsewhere in his empire.[18] In essence, by owning First Gibraltar he was able to avoid paying hundreds of millions in federal taxes.[19]
Perelman jumped back into the savings & loan game in a big way in 1994 by buying First Nationwide from the Ford Motor Company for $664 million.[20] Ford held onto $1.8 billion of First Nationwide's assets valued at $444 million, two-thirds of which were considered troubled assets,[20] offered to buy back up to $500 million of First Nationwide's other $7.9 billion of assets that went bad in the future, and gave Perelman $50 million to cover potential severance payments.[18] Perelman quickly boosted its portfolio, adding $10 billion worth of mortgages in exchange for a $175 million payment to Resolution Trust Corporation.[21] Before 1995 ended, Perelman added two more thrifts to his collective: SFFed's $4.1 billion of assets for $250 million[22] and Home Federal Financial's $735 million of assets and $662 million of deposits for $70.6 million.[23] Just as quickly as he added assets, branches, and deposits in California, he dumped what he had elsewhere in the country. In 1995 alone he sold off 79 branches with $4.3 billion in deposits spread out across five states.[24] 1996 went a little slower, but not eventfully. He acquired California Federal Bancorp for $1.2 billion, creating the 4th largest thrift in the country with $32.3 billion in assets.[25] In 1997, another $3.3 billion in mortgages were added courtesy of WMC Mortgage but it was an otherwise quiet year for First Nationwide.[26] In 1998, Perelman negotiated a stock swap with Golden State Bancorp to create the third largest thrift in the country with $50 billion of assets. The deal left Golden State's shareholders the majority, but Perelman's camp still controlled the company.[27] Everything remained quiet until May 2002 when Citigroup announced plans to buy Golden State for $5.8 billion, but ultimately reduced the offer to $4.9 billion due to a stock drop.[28] Citigroup's final offer was 0.821 shares of Citigroup common stock and $7.47 cash for every share of Golden State exchanged, which converted Perelman's 43 million shares of Golden State into $321,210,000 in cash plus 36,124,000 shares of Citigroup. All things considered, Perelman expected to make about $2 billion off the deal, but because he had quasi-sold many of his shares in the past, he probably gained substantially less than that.[29]
Andrews Group[edit]
Andrews Group, Inc. is formed from the corporate shell of the former Compact Video. Andrews Group purchases Marvel Entertainment Group, Inc. in 1989 and later its former parent company New World Entertainment, Inc.
In 1989, Andrews Group lost $14.8 million with a negative net worth of $10 million. At this time, MacAndrews & Forbes owned 57%.
In 1991, Marvel Entertainment Group, Inc. goes public with 30% sold to the public.
Andrews Group goes on a buying spree picking up:

Fleer – September 1992
Toy Biz, Inc. – 46% Stake – 1993
SCI Television – 54% Stake – 1993
Genesis Entertainment – 50% Stake – Part of New World Entertainment.[4]

In 1994, Perelman bought four more stations from the Great American Communications Company for $360 million and four more from Argyle Television Holdings for $716 million. The purchase of Genesis and New World set up one of the spokes for the major 1994 television industry realignment in the wake of Fox's acquisition of NFL rights.[30] Rupert Murdoch bought complete control of New World Communications for $3 billion, giving Perelman a large profit from the sale.[31][32]
Meridian Sports Holdings[edit]
Also in 1989, MacAndrews & Forbes acquired The Coleman Company, Inc., maker of stoves, lanterns, and camping and other recreational equipment, for $545 million. Perelman reduced the debt for this purchase by selling the heating and air-conditioning divisions. By the end of 1990 he had sold everything except Coleman's camping equipment and boat businesses, plus added power tool and recreational vehicle businesses. Between 1993 and late 1995 he bought seven more companies for Coleman.[4] In December 1997, Perelman and Al Dunlap met in order to discuss a possible deal between Coleman and Sunbeam Products. Coleman's famous but narrow brand held less growth potential than originally thought and Ronald Perelman wanted out. Coincidentally, Al Dunlap was sitting on a financially insolvent company he wanted to dump.[33] It took until March 2 for them to finally come to an agreement: With some convincing from his banker Morgan Stanley, Perelman sold his entire stake (82%) in Coleman to Al Dunlap in exchange for $1.5 billion in cash and $680 million of Sunbeam stock.[34] They completed the deal on March 30, despite a sell-off triggering press release from March 19 that said Sunbeam would not meet sales expectations. On April 3, another press release took Sunbeam's stock from bad to worse: It would not only fall short of sales expectations for that quarter, but it would barely meet the sales expectations of two years ago. The stock went into a tail spin, falling from $54 a share to $24 a share in a matter of weeks and continued its downward spiral in the following weeks. Perelman bought control of Sunbeam in an effort to salvage the situation but it was for naught. The company had to file for bankruptcy within three years.[35]
Morgan Stanley[edit]
On February 17, 2005, Perelman filed a lawsuit against Morgan Stanley.[36] Two facts were at issue: Did Morgan Stanley know about the problems with Sunbeam and was Ronald Perelman misled? During the discovery phase, the judge became exasperated with what she perceived as deliberate stonewalling on the part of Morgan Stanley and ordered the jury to assume Morgan Stanley deliberately and knowingly defrauded Perelman.[37] Hobbled, Morgan Stanley had no choice but to argue that Perelman was too savvy an investor to have fallen for their transparent tricks.[38] After a five-week trial, the jury deliberated for two days, found in favor of Perelman, and awarded him $1.45 billion.[39] The damages stung particularly because Morgan Stanley passed up Perelman's offer to settle the case for $20 million.[40] Morgan Stanley maintained that the court case was improperly decided, citing the judge's decision to use Florida law over New York law and her decision to order the jury to consider Morgan Stanley guilty before the trial began.[41] In 2007, the courts of appeal reversed the judgement. The judges' declared Perelman hadn't provided any evidence showing he'd suffered any actual damage as a result of Morgan Stanley's actions. Perelman appealed,[42] but found himself shot down by the Florida Supreme Court who dismissed it in a 5–0 decision.[43] Undeterred even after that setback, Perelman went back to the trial court and asked for the case to be reopened because the hiding of email evidence was "a classic example of fraud on the court". The trial court rejected his arguments, but as of January 2009, he is beseeching Florida's 4th Circuit to reopen the case.[44]
SPAC[edit]
In 2007, Perelman filed the paperwork for a SPAC (Special Purpose Acquisition Company) called MAFS Acquisition through his holding company MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings. A SPAC is a company founded solely for the purpose of buying out another company, but without any preselected target company. In Perelman's case, the company was selling 50 million units for $10 each. The IPO was being underwritten by Citigroup,[45] but on December 12, 2008, a year after filing for an IPO, MAFS opted to withdraw their application for the "protection of investors".[46]

History[edit]
Group[edit]
MacAndrews & Forbes & Co. was founded in 1850 by Edward MacAndrews and William Forbes, a distributor of licorice extract and chocolate.[2]
In 1978, Perelman purchased a 40% stake in Cohen-Hatfield Jewelers,[3] and in 1980, Perelman, through Cohen-Hatfield Jewelers, bought MacAndrews & Forbes & Co. Through the purchase, Cohen-Hatfield Jewelers was merged into what became MacAndrews & Forbes Group Inc.[4]
Holdings[edit]
In 1983, Perelman formed MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings, Inc. to take MacAndrews & Forbes Group Inc. private. Perelman started selling bonds to acquire the remaining 66% stake in MacAndrews & Forbes Group Inc.
Also in 1983, MacAndrews acquired Technicolor Inc. The divisions were sold off and, in 1988, its core business was sold to Carlton Communications for 6.5 times the purchase price. Using the proceeds from the Technicolor division sell off, MacAndrews & Forbes purchased a 20 percent stake in Compact Video Inc., a television and film syndication company. Ownership of Compact Video Inc. was increased to 40% in 1987 after the buyout of Four Star International. Despite the bond debt, in 1984, MacAndrews & Forbes purchased Consolidated Cigar Holdings Ltd. from Gulf & Western Industries, in addition to Video Corporation of America.[4]
Revlon Group[edit]
MacAndrews next purchased Pantry Pride Inc., in June 1985. Its three retail supermarket chains were sold off within months.[4]
In 1985, Perelman also took on his biggest deal yet: The Revlon Corporation. Financed with over $700 million in junk bonds from Michael Milken's firm, Drexel Burnham Lambert, Pantry Pride Inc. offered to buy any or all of Revlon's 38.2 million outstanding shares for $47.5 per share when its street price stood at $45 per share. Initially rejected, Perelman repeatedly raised his offer until it reached $53 per share, while fighting Revlon's management every step of the way. Forstmann Little & Company swooped in and offered $56 per share. A brief public bidding war ensued, and Perelman triumphed with an offer of $58 per share. As a result, Perelman paid $1.8 billion to Revlon's shareholders, but he also paid $900 million in other costs associated with the purchase.[5]
After the acquisition, Perelman had Revlon sell four of its divisions: Two were sold for $1 billion, the Vision Care division was sold for $574 million, and, in 1988, the National Health Laboratories division became a publicly owned corporation. Additional makeup lines were purchased for Revlon: Max Factor in 1987 and Betrix in 1989 (they were later sold to Procter & Gamble, in 1991).[4] Despite Perelman's regular cleansing of upper management[6] and injecting millions of dollars into the company,[7] Revlon was unable to turn a profit for several years. As of the first quarter of 2007, it had had one profitable quarter in the previous 32.[8]
By 2012, Revlon was rebounding, and its net income had grown to $51.5 million.[9] As of April 2014, Revlon was trading at $25.45 per share, rising from a low of $1.20 per share in 2007.[10] A major cause of Revlon's financial problems was the debt load stemming from Perelman's purchase of the company.[11]
Gillette, Four Star, and the actions of the late eighties[edit]
In 1986, Ronald Perelman made several attempts on behalf of MacAndrews & Forbes to take-over Gillette Company, offering $4.12 billion, and eventually $5.7 billion. In October 1987, Perelman withdrew the last offer. In 1988, Consolidated Cigar was sold. Attempted take overs were targeted at CPC International. Ronald Perelman's controlling buyout of Compact Video was in 1986. Four Star International was purchased through a golden parachute deal that was negotiated with David Charnay and Ron Perelman after Charnay was notified of stock purchases made by Perelman. After Compact shut down, its remaining assets, including Four Star International, were folded into MacAndrews & Forbes. By the end of 1989, MacAndrews refinanced the Holding companies' junk bonds for standard bank loans.[4]
Savings and loans[edit]
Main article: Savings and Loan crisis
Perelman first entered what became known as the Savings & Loan crisis in 1988 when along with Gerald J. Ford he bought five insolvent thrifts with $12.2 billion in assets and $5.1 billion in federal aid for $315 million.[12] The five banks originally operated as a single entity named First Texas Bank, but the name changed to First Gibraltar after about a week.[13] Perelman's turn-around manifested as trimming the payroll, selling branches, and dumping of $2.5 billion of underperforming assets. In 1990, Perelman added San Antonio Savings Association and Sooner Federal to First Gibraltar for $10.1 million and $5.1 million, respectively. The purchase of San Antonio added $1.1 billion of healthy assets, $1.2 billion unhealthy assets, and a $1.3 billion government cash advance to Perelman's larder while Sooner only provided $1.2 billion in assets along with the typical government guarantees.[14][15] Sooner Federal was not only the last S&L Perelman bought, but the first he sold; In August 1992, he sold the pieces of Sooner to Bank of Oklahoma and Fourth Financial Corporation for $31.4 million.[14] The following month he sold the rest of First Gibraltar to BankAmerica for $110 million, retaining four branches in Plano, Texas and $1.2 billion of assets in the mortgage and property management sectors.[16] He renamed the four branches First Madison.[17] It's unclear how much money Perelman made from his savings & loan deals, but it's estimated that he made anywhere from $600 million to $1.2 billion with most of the profits manifesting as tax breaks elsewhere in his empire.[18] In essence, by owning First Gibraltar he was able to avoid paying hundreds of millions in federal taxes.[19]
Perelman jumped back into the savings & loan game in a big way in 1994 by buying First Nationwide from the Ford Motor Company for $664 million.[20] Ford held onto $1.8 billion of First Nationwide's assets valued at $444 million, two-thirds of which were considered troubled assets,[20] offered to buy back up to $500 million of First Nationwide's other $7.9 billion of assets that went bad in the future, and gave Perelman $50 million to cover potential severance payments.[18] Perelman quickly boosted its portfolio, adding $10 billion worth of mortgages in exchange for a $175 million payment to Resolution Trust Corporation.[21] Before 1995 ended, Perelman added two more thrifts to his collective: SFFed's $4.1 billion of assets for $250 million[22] and Home Federal Financial's $735 million of assets and $662 million of deposits for $70.6 million.[23] Just as quickly as he added assets, branches, and deposits in California, he dumped what he had elsewhere in the country. In 1995 alone he sold off 79 branches with $4.3 billion in deposits spread out across five states.[24] 1996 went a little slower, but not eventfully. He acquired California Federal Bancorp for $1.2 billion, creating the 4th largest thrift in the country with $32.3 billion in assets.[25] In 1997, another $3.3 billion in mortgages were added courtesy of WMC Mortgage but it was an otherwise quiet year for First Nationwide.[26] In 1998, Perelman negotiated a stock swap with Golden State Bancorp to create the third largest thrift in the country with $50 billion of assets. The deal left Golden State's shareholders the majority, but Perelman's camp still controlled the company.[27] Everything remained quiet until May 2002 when Citigroup announced plans to buy Golden State for $5.8 billion, but ultimately reduced the offer to $4.9 billion due to a stock drop.[28] Citigroup's final offer was 0.821 shares of Citigroup common stock and $7.47 cash for every share of Golden State exchanged, which converted Perelman's 43 million shares of Golden State into $321,210,000 in cash plus 36,124,000 shares of Citigroup. All things considered, Perelman expected to make about $2 billion off the deal, but because he had quasi-sold many of his shares in the past, he probably gained substantially less than that.[29]
Andrews Group[edit]
Andrews Group, Inc. is formed from the corporate shell of the former Compact Video. Andrews Group purchases Marvel Entertainment Group, Inc. in 1989 and later its former parent company New World Entertainment, Inc.
In 1989, Andrews Group lost $14.8 million with a negative net worth of $10 million. At this time, MacAndrews & Forbes owned 57%.
In 1991, Marvel Entertainment Group, Inc. goes public with 30% sold to the public.
Andrews Group goes on a buying spree picking up:

Fleer – September 1992
Toy Biz, Inc. – 46% Stake – 1993
SCI Television – 54% Stake – 1993
Genesis Entertainment – 50% Stake – Part of New World Entertainment.[4]

In 1994, Perelman bought four more stations from the Great American Communications Company for $360 million and four more from Argyle Television Holdings for $716 million. The purchase of Genesis and New World set up one of the spokes for the major 1994 television industry realignment in the wake of Fox's acquisition of NFL rights.[30] Rupert Murdoch bought complete control of New World Communications for $3 billion, giving Perelman a large profit from the sale.[31][32]
Meridian Sports Holdings[edit]
Also in 1989, MacAndrews & Forbes acquired The Coleman Company, Inc., maker of stoves, lanterns, and camping and other recreational equipment, for $545 million. Perelman reduced the debt for this purchase by selling the heating and air-conditioning divisions. By the end of 1990 he had sold everything except Coleman's camping equipment and boat businesses, plus added power tool and recreational vehicle businesses. Between 1993 and late 1995 he bought seven more companies for Coleman.[4] In December 1997, Perelman and Al Dunlap met in order to discuss a possible deal between Coleman and Sunbeam Products. Coleman's famous but narrow brand held less growth potential than originally thought and Ronald Perelman wanted out. Coincidentally, Al Dunlap was sitting on a financially insolvent company he wanted to dump.[33] It took until March 2 for them to finally come to an agreement: With some convincing from his banker Morgan Stanley, Perelman sold his entire stake (82%) in Coleman to Al Dunlap in exchange for $1.5 billion in cash and $680 million of Sunbeam stock.[34] They completed the deal on March 30, despite a sell-off triggering press release from March 19 that said Sunbeam would not meet sales expectations. On April 3, another press release took Sunbeam's stock from bad to worse: It would not only fall short of sales expectations for that quarter, but it would barely meet the sales expectations of two years ago. The stock went into a tail spin, falling from $54 a share to $24 a share in a matter of weeks and continued its downward spiral in the following weeks. Perelman bought control of Sunbeam in an effort to salvage the situation but it was for naught. The company had to file for bankruptcy within three years.[35]
Morgan Stanley[edit]
On February 17, 2005, Perelman filed a lawsuit against Morgan Stanley.[36] Two facts were at issue: Did Morgan Stanley know about the problems with Sunbeam and was Ronald Perelman misled? During the discovery phase, the judge became exasperated with what she perceived as deliberate stonewalling on the part of Morgan Stanley and ordered the jury to assume Morgan Stanley deliberately and knowingly defrauded Perelman.[37] Hobbled, Morgan Stanley had no choice but to argue that Perelman was too savvy an investor to have fallen for their transparent tricks.[38] After a five-week trial, the jury deliberated for two days, found in favor of Perelman, and awarded him $1.45 billion.[39] The damages stung particularly because Morgan Stanley passed up Perelman's offer to settle the case for $20 million.[40] Morgan Stanley maintained that the court case was improperly decided, citing the judge's decision to use Florida law over New York law and her decision to order the jury to consider Morgan Stanley guilty before the trial began.[41] In 2007, the courts of appeal reversed the judgement. The judges' declared Perelman hadn't provided any evidence showing he'd suffered any actual damage as a result of Morgan Stanley's actions. Perelman appealed,[42] but found himself shot down by the Florida Supreme Court who dismissed it in a 5–0 decision.[43] Undeterred even after that setback, Perelman went back to the trial court and asked for the case to be reopened because the hiding of email evidence was "a classic example of fraud on the court". The trial court rejected his arguments, but as of January 2009, he is beseeching Florida's 4th Circuit to reopen the case.[44]
SPAC[edit]
In 2007, Perelman filed the paperwork for a SPAC (Special Purpose Acquisition Company) called MAFS Acquisition through his holding company MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings. A SPAC is a company founded solely for the purpose of buying out another company, but without any preselected target company. In Perelman's case, the company was selling 50 million units for $10 each. The IPO was being underwritten by Citigroup,[45] but on December 12, 2008, a year after filing for an IPO, MAFS opted to withdraw their application for the "protection of investors".[46]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
