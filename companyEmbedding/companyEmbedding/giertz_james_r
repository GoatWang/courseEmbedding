The Board also appointed Giertz to Schneider's Governance Committee and the Audit Committee.  Giertz served as Chief Financial Officer of H.B. Fuller Company, a formulator, manufacturer and marketer of specialty chemical products, from 2008 until 2016, after which he became Executive Vice President of the company until his retirement in February 2017.
