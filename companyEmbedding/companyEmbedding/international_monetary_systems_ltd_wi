Testimonials




For over a decade now, I have been a member of the barter system in Peterborough.
While I have always benefited from the organization, the last 2 years have been the best
I've ever experienced.
As you are aware, barter really comes down to 3 main benefits:
1. It becomes a competitive edge to garner new and continued sales. In a market where buying trends are fickle and subject to price-sensitivity, customers that utilize their barter with us tend to stay loyal, long-term customers. We have become the supplier of choice to many barter clients. It is essential to note that each customer purchasing from Domino's Pizza does not purchase from anyone else. Market share tips in our favor.
2. Barter keeps cash in the bank or conserves cash for other projects. The ability to make use of the incremental sales that barter provides to purchases supplies and services for the stores has greatly reduced the demand on cash resources. In the last 2 years the availability of these products and services has expanded
exponentially.
3. Finally, barter has helped to make me a "hero" at home. By using barter to subtly improve our own personal lives we have enjoyed benefits that we would not have been able to otherwise. These things have included extra holiday time away, meals out or activities for the family to participate in together.

PROSPECTUS
  SUMMARY
�
This
  summary highlights information contained elsewhere in this prospectus. You
  should read this entire prospectus carefully before making an investment
  decision, including the �Risk Factors� section beginning on page�3, and the
  documents and information incorporated by reference into this prospectus. We
  refer to International Monetary Systems, Ltd. as �IMS,� the �Company,� �we,�
�our,� and �us.�
�
International
  Monetary Systems, Ltd. was incorporated in 1989 under the laws of the State
  of
  Wisconsin. The Company acquires, owns, manages and operates trade exchanges
  and
  other related businesses.
�
Trade
  exchanges, or barter networks, are financial service firms which permit
  companies and individuals to exchange goods and services utilizing an electronic
  currency known as "trade dollars", the use of which is described below.
  Currently, IMS services more than 15,000 barter customers. We have continually
  expanded our customer base, principally through enrolling new members in our
  existing markets, acquiring other barter exchanges, and by encouraging our
  members to increase their trade volume.

�
The
  Modern Barter Industry
�
The
  modern barter industry took shape in its current form in 1969 with the creation
  of the first retail barter exchange. Currently there are an estimated 250 barter
  system firms - including several with multiple licensees - operating in the
  United States and Canada. These exchanges provide services that involve an
  estimated 200,000 member companies.
�
Retail
  trade exchanges range in size from those operated by a single person from a
  small office to large firms operating out of multiple offices located over
  a
  wide area. The 35 largest commercial exchange firms handle approximately 50%
  of
  the estimated $700 million in transactions that flow through the barter system
  annually. Most trade exchanges are private companies that make extensive use
  of
  computers to track their members, match transactions, and provide necessary
  accounting.
�
The
  National Association of Trade Exchanges and the International Reciprocal Trade
  Association are the two professional associations most active in the
  industry.
�
How
  Barter Works
�
In
  a
  typical barter transaction, a member offers to sell products or services in
  return for the exchange's trade dollars, typically referenced as "T$", which
  are
  paid to the member by the purchaser in the transaction. For example, T$100
  refers to $100 worth of trade dollars that are used to acquire
  a
  product or service priced at $100 in U.S. currency. If the purchase price is
  greater than the amount of earned trade dollars in the buyer's account, the
  exchange may grant a trade dollar line of credit to the buyer. Periodically,
  each member has to account for any deficit in its trade account just as it
  would
  with a conventional loan or other credit facility.
�
As
  compensation for providing its services, the trade exchange generally charges
  a
  one-time membership fee, monthly maintenance fees and/or a percentage of the
  price of each transaction (usually 10% to 12%). These fees are typically paid
  by
  the member to the trade exchange in cash.
�
Barter
  transactions which represent sales revenue are taxable as ordinary income to
  the
  recipient of the trade dollars in the conventional dollar amount of the trade
  dollars received, and conversely are deductible as ordinary expense by a
  purchaser in the conventional dollar amount of the trade dollars paid. Members'
  barter sales are reportable by the trade exchange to the Internal Revenue
  Service on Form 1099B.
�
Advantages
  and Disadvantages
�
Barter
  offers a number of advantages to those who utilize it. A principle advantage
  to
  trade exchange members is referred to as "barter leverage". This refers to
  the
  fact that the typical barter exchange member is purchasing a product or service
  in exchange for its own product or service. Consequently, each purchase results
  in a probable sale. And since the actual cash cost of producing the product
  or
  service is typically less than its retail sale price, a person utilizing barter
  is actually purchasing for a real cash cost that is only a fraction of the
  price
  of the product or service purchased. In effect, the barter exchange member
  buys
  at wholesale, but sells its own goods or services at retail. Frequently, the
  member will charge a higher price for barter than for cash to cover the charges
  due to the trade exchange. However, the benefit to the person bartering for
  the
  product or service is still significant as a result of the purchase being
  accomplished through barter.
�






3









�
For
  example, a trade exchange member may incur a $1,000 cash cost to produce a
  product or to purchase it at wholesale. If the member then barters this product
  for a good or service priced at $1,500, representing the retail price at which
  it is normally sold, the member has effectively bought the good or service
  for a
  cost of only $1,000 in cash. Barter leverage is particularly effective in the
  case of products that have become hard to sell. Rather than write down their
  value, the producer may be able to secure full value by bartering them through
  the trade exchange. Barter leverage works most effectively when trading for
  something that is perishable, such as hotel rooms or airline tickets. Once
  the
  hotel room lies vacant or the airline seat is unfilled for a flight, its value
  is lost forever. In those cases, exchange of the room or seat in barter offers
  an effective way to gain value from something that would otherwise have been
  rendered worthless. Due to barter leverage, the value of barter to exchange
  members will more than likely offset the fees charged by the barter
  exchange.
�
Barter
  also provides an effective means by which a member may enter new markets, gain
  trial usage by potential customers, or increase market share. The member may
  well find that he can reach a customer who would not otherwise have tried his
  product or service if the full price had to be paid in cash, but who will try
  his goods or services, sometimes in large amounts or on extended terms, when
  the
  price is being paid in goods or services of the purchaser in the form of trade
  dollars. Because of the need to clear trade dollars over time, barter exchanges
  become affinity marketing networks, in which members seek out opportunities
  to
  do business with one another.
  The
  principal disadvantage of barter is that, in comparison to the general
  cash-based economy, a more limited supply of products and services is
  available.
�
International
  Monetary Systems, Ltd.
�
International
  Monetary Systems, Ltd. (IMSL) is a holding company that currently has three
  subsidiaries: Continental Trade Exchange, Ltd., doing business as International
  Monetary Systems (IMS), National Trade Association, Inc. and INLM Holdings,
  Inc.
  The IMS barter system operates in the United States and Canada.
�
The
  IMS Barter Network
�
As
  a
  leader in the barter industry, IMS has created a network of more than 16,000
  businesses that regularly trade their goods and services with each other.
  Through their participation in our barter program, these companies are provided
  with an effective revenue management tool which enables them to identify and
  capture incremental income, move surplus inventories and profitably capitalize
  on their excess capacity. IMS functions as a third-party record keeper - a
  status granted by the Internal Revenue Service - and also manages the barter
  system.
�
To
  provide clients with a flexible and effective means of trading, IMS has created
  an alternative monetary system with its own unique currency. Upon enrolling
  in
  the program, each member is assigned a barter account (much like a traditional
  bank account) through which it receives IMS trade dollars - the medium of
  exchange for the barter system. Under the T.E.F.R.A. act of 1982, we are
  required to report all barter sales to the IRS. For accounting and tax purposes,
  the IRS has ruled that trade dollars are treated the same as cash. Accordingly,
  the Company may in any period report significant revenue, profits and increases
  in net assets from transactions denominated in IMS trade dollars or other
  non-cash consideration.
�
The
  IMS
  barter system began operations in July of 1985 and has had a record of
  consistent and steady growth. This growth has been generated both internally
  and
  through the acquisition of other barter networks. As we have continued to add
  new members to the system, we have witnessed a compounded annual growth rate
  of
  approximately 15% per year for the past decade. During that same period, we
  have
  also acquired twenty two independent trade exchange operations. We believe
  that
  the barter industry, much like the banking industry, is ready for a period
  of
  substantial consolidation and, therefore, we intend to continue acquiring
  strategically located trade exchanges that we believe will enable us to achieve
  and maintain a dominant market position. We believe that a dominant position
  within a market gives us better visibility within that market, allows us to
  offer a wider range of customer products and services for the benefit of our
  clients, and ensures that we will achieve greater economies of
  scale.
�

�
Five
  of
  those acquisitions were consummated during 2006. In March 2006, IMSL acquired
  from Southern Barter Exchange the membership list of their clients located
  in
  Memphis, Tennessee. Also in March 2006 IMSL acquired the membership list and
  assets of Master Trade Barter Systems of Los Gatos, California. In April 2006,
  IMSL acquired the membership list and assets of Trade Exchange of the Rockies,
  a
  barter exchange located in Golden, Colorado. In June 2006, IMSL acquired the
  membership list and assets of Barter Indiana Group, a barter exchange located
  in
  Indianapolis, Indiana. In September 2006, IMSL entered into a Share-Exchange
  agreement for the acquisition of all outstanding shares of National Trade
  Association (d.b.a Illinois Trade Association) located in Niles, Illinois.
  With
  the addition of these five client bases, the IMS barter network now boasts
  a
  membership roster totaling over 16,000 businesses.
�
Other
  Related Businesses
�
In
  addition to expanding our IMS barter operations, we intend to acquire other
  related businesses that synergize with and enhance the barter network.

RISK
  FACTORS
�
You
  should consider the following risk factors, in addition to the other information
  presented in this prospectus and the documents incorporated by reference in
  this
  prospectus, in evaluating us, our business, and an investment in our common
  stock. Any of the following risks, as well as other risks and uncertainties,
  could seriously harm our business and financial results and cause the value
  of
  our common stock to decline, which in turn could cause you to lose all or part
  of your investment.

This
  offering and an investment in our common stock involve a high degree of risk.
  You should carefully consider the following risk factors and the other
  information in this prospectus, including our financial statements and the
  related notes, before investing in our common stock. If any of the following
  risks actually occurs, our business, operating results, prospects or financial
  condition could be seriously harmed. The trading price of our common stock
  could
  decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.

Our
  common stock trades in limited volume. We cannot guarantee that a liquid trading
  market for our common stock will develop or be sustained. 
�
While
  our
  common stock is currently quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board, we cannot provide
  definite assurance that our shares will be actively traded. The development
  and
  continuation of a trading market will depend principally upon our business,
  financial condition and operating results. Since the market price for our common
  stock is below $5.00 per share, SEC rules will impose additional requirements
  upon broker-dealers who effect transactions in our shares, principally with
  respect to (1) additional disclosures concerning the risks of investment in
  lower-priced stocks, (2) written investor-suitability determinations and (3)
  written authorization of these transactions by the proposed purchasers.
  Compliance with these rules could impede trading and adversely impact the price
  and liquidity of your shares.
�
Increased
  regulation of the barter industry could negatively affect our
  business.
�
The
  barter industry is in large part currently self-regulated. We have obtained
  all
  federal, state and local licenses, permits and bonds necessary to operate our
  business and facilities. However, we cannot assure you that the barter industry
  in general, and our company in particular, will not in the future be subject
  to
  increased and more restrictive governmental regulation. If such regulation
  restricts or limits our ability to conduct our business, or if we are required
  to pay substantial compliance costs, our business, financial condition and
  operating results could be harmed and the return on your investment in our
  common stock might be negatively affected.
�
Provisions
  in our charter documents and Wisconsin law could prevent or delay a change
  in
  control of our company and possibly reduce the amount paid for our common stock
  in the future. 
�
Provisions
  of our articles of incorporation, bylaws and Wisconsin law could, separately
  or
  together, discourage potential acquisition proposals; delay or prevent a change
  in control; and limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the
  future for shares of our common stock.
�
The
  application of these provisions could make it more difficult for a third party
  to acquire us, even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders. See
  �Description of Securities - Anti-Takeover Provisions� for a further discussion
  of statutory and other anti-takeover provisions which may affect us. Also,
  our
  board of directors has the authority to issue up to 20,000,000 shares of
  preferred stock and to determine the price, voting rights, restrictions,
  preferences and privileges of those shares without the approval of our
  stockholders. The rights of holders of common stock will be subject to, and
  may
  be impaired by, the rights of the holders of any shares of preferred stock
  that
  may be issued in the future. The issuance of preferred stock may delay, defer
  or
  prevent a change in control by making it more difficult for a third party to
  acquire a majority of our stock. In addition, the issuance of preferred stock
  could have a dilutive effect on our stockholders. We have no present plans
  to
  issue shares of preferred stock. However, even the potential issuance of
  preferred stock could reduce the price that investors are willing to pay for
  our
  common stock.
�
Neither
  our president, our chief financial officer, nor either of our vice presidents
  is
  covered by �key person� life insurance, and the loss of one or more of these key
  personnel could adversely affect our business results and the value of your
  investment.
�
Our
  future success depends upon the continued services of our management team,
  including our president, Donald F. Mardak, our treasurer, Danny W. Weibling,
  and
  our two vice presidents, Dale L. Mardak and John E. Strabley. The loss of the
  services of any one or more of these key employees could have a material adverse
  effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and, potentially,
  the value of your investment in our common stock. We do not have �key person�
life insurance policies covering any of our employees.
�

�
We
  do not intend to declare or pay dividends in the foreseeable
  future.
�
We
  currently intend to retain earnings, if any, to support our growth strategy.
  Consequently, a prospective investor who needs to receive periodic dividend
  income should probably not invest in this offering.
�
Provisions
  in our charter documents and Wisconsin law could prevent or delay a change
  in
  control of our company and possibly reduce the amount paid for our common stock
  in the future. 
�
Provisions
  of our articles of incorporation, bylaws and Wisconsin law separately or
  together may:
�






�


discourage
  potential acquisition proposals;




�






�


delay
  or prevent a change in control; and




�






�


limit
  the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for
  shares
  of our common stock.




�
The
  application of these provisions could make it more difficult for a third party
  to acquire us, even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders. See
  �Description of Securities - Wisconsin Anti-Takeover Provisions� for a further
  discussion of statutory and other anti-takeover provisions which may affect
  us.
  Also, our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 20,000,000 shares
  of preferred stock and to determine the price, voting rights, restrictions,
  preferences and privileges of those shares without the approval of our
  stockholders. The rights of holders of common stock will be subject to, and
  may
  be impaired by, the rights of the holders of any shares of preferred stock
  that
  may be issued in the future. The issuance of preferred stock may delay, defer
  or
  prevent a change in control by making it more difficult for a third party to
  acquire a majority of our stock. In addition, the issuance of preferred stock
  could have a dilutive effect on our stockholders. We have no present plans
  to
  issue shares of preferred stock. However, even the potential issuance of
  preferred stock could reduce the price that investors are willing to pay for
  our
  common stock.
�
Substantial
  sales of our common stock by existing securityholders, or even the potential
  that such sales may occur, could cause the price of our stock to
  fall.
�
Future
  sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the
  perception that such sales might occur, could cause the market price of our
  common stock to decline and could impair the value of your investment in our
  common stock and our ability to raise equity capital in the future. As of
  September 28, 2007, we had 60,090,436 shares of common stock outstanding, of
  which 24,685,673 shares are beneficially owned by our directors and executive
  officers.
�
The
  sales
  of our common stock by securityholders, or even the appearance that such holders
  may make such sales, may limit the market for our common stock or depress any
  trading market volume and price before other investors are able to sell the
  common stock. Moreover, a number of shareholders have held their investment
  for
  a substantial period of time and may desire to sell their shares, which could
  drive down the price of our common stock.
�
The
  market price of the shares may fluctuate greatly. Investors in IMS bear the
  risk
  that they will not recover their investment.
�
From
  June
24, 2002, to June 12, 2007, our common stock has traded on the OTC BB under
  the
  symbol �INLM.� Currently, trading in our common stock on the OTC BB is limited,
  and the per share price is likely to be influenced by the price at which and
  the
  amount of shares the selling securityholders are attempting to sell at any
  time
  with the possible effect of limiting the trading price or lowering the price
  to
  their offering price. Shares such as ours are also subject to the activities
  of
  persons engaged in short selling securities, which generally has the effect
  of
  driving the price down. Also, the common stock of growth companies, such as
  IMS,
  is typically subject to high price and volume volatility. Therefore, the price
  of our common stock may fluctuate widely. A full and stable trading market
  for
  our common stock may never develop in which event any holder of our common
  stock
  may not be able to sell at the time he elects or at all.

Pursuant
  to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated December 30, 2006 (�Merger
  Agreement�), on January 31, 2007, we received a $2,500,000 investment from
  Alliance Barter, Inc. and its sole shareholder, Stephen E. Webster
  (collectively, the �Selling Securityholder�), through the issuance of 3,333,333
  shares of our common stock, par value $0.0001 per share. Pursuant to Article

  of the Merger Agreement, we have agreed to file with the Securities and Exchange
  Commission this registration statement, of which this prospectus is a part,
  for
  resale of 3,333,333 of the shares of common stock issued to the Selling

�
Dividend
  Policy
�
We
  have
  not declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We intend to retain
  any future earnings to finance the growth and development of our business,
  and
  therefore do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on the common stock in
  the
  future. Our board of directors will determine any future payment of cash
  dividends depending on the financial condition, results of operations, capital
  requirements, general business condition and other relevant
  factors.
�
Transfer
  Agent and Registrar
�
We
  have
  appointed Registrar and Transfer Company, Cranford, New Jersey, as our registrar
  and transfer agent of our common stock. The mailing address of Registrar and
  Transfer is 10 Commerce Drive, Cranford, New Jersey 07016.
�
Director
  Liability and Indemnification
�
Under
  Wisconsin law and our bylaws, we are required to indemnify our officers,
  directors, employees and agents in certain situations. In some instances, a
  court must approve indemnification. As permitted by Wisconsin statutes, the
  articles of incorporation eliminate in certain circumstances the monetary
  liability of our directors for a breach of their fiduciary duties. These
  provisions do not eliminate a director�s liability for:
�



�

�


a
  willful failure to deal fairly with us or our shareholders in connection
  with a matter in which the director has a material conflict of
  interest,




�



�

�


a
  violation of criminal law unless the director had reasonable cause
  to
  believe that his or her conduct was lawful or no reasonable cause
  to
  believe that his or her conduct was
  unlawful,




�



�

�


a
  transaction from which the director derived an improper personal
  profit,
  and




�



�

�


willful
  misconduct.




�
As
  to
  indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act for directors,
  officers or persons controlling the company, we have been informed that, in
  the
  opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is against public policy and therefore
  unenforceable�
�
Shareholder
  Action
�
Under
  our
  bylaws, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of
  common stock represented at a meeting at which a quorum is present is sufficient
  to authorize, ratify or consent to any action required by the common
  shareholders, except as otherwise provided by the Wisconsin Business Corporation
  Law. Under the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law and our bylaws, our
  shareholders may also take actions by written consent without holding a meeting.
  The written consent must be signed by all of the holders of the voting power,
  except that if a different proportion of voting power is required for a specific
  action, then that proportion. If this occurs, we are required to provide prompt
  notice of any corporate action taken without a meeting to our shareholders
  who
  did not consent in writing to the action.
�
Antitakeover
  Provisions
�
Our
  articles of incorporation and the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law include
  a
  number of provisions that may have the effect of encouraging persons considering
  unsolicited tender offers or other unilateral takeover proposals to negotiate
  with our board of directors rather than pursue non-negotiated takeover
  attempts.
�
Section
  180.1150 of the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law provides that the voting
  power of shares of a �resident domestic company,� such as IMS, which are held by
  certain persons in excess of 20% of the voting power of any such corporation
  will be limited to 10% of the full voting power of such excess shares. This
  statutory voting restriction is not applicable to shares acquired directly
  from
  IMS, shares acquired prior to April 22, 1986, and under certain other
  circumstances. 
�






9









�
Section
  180.1141 of the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law provides that a �resident
  domestic corporation,� such as IMS, may not engage in a �business combination�
with an �interested stockholder� (a person beneficially owning 10% or more of
  the voting power of the outstanding common stock) for three years after the
  date
  (the "stock acquisition date") the interested stockholder acquired his 10%
  or
  greater interest, unless the business combination (or the acquisition of the
  10%
  or greater interest) was approved before the stock acquisition date by the
  corporation's board of directors. After the three-year period, a business
  combination that was not so approved can be consummated only if it is approved
  by the majority of the outstanding voting shares not held by the interested
  stockholder or is made at a specified formula price intended to provide a fair
  price for the shares held by non-interested stockholders. 
�
We
  believe that the benefits of these provisions outweigh the potential
  disadvantages of discouraging these proposals because, among other things,
  negotiation of the proposals might result in an improvement of their
  terms.
�

PLAN
  OF DISTRIBUTION
�
We
  are
  registering the shares offered by this prospectus on behalf of the selling
  securityholders. The selling securityholders, which as used herein includes
  donees, pledgees, transferees or other successors-in-interest selling shares
  of
  common stock or interests in shares of common stock received after the date
  of
  this prospectus from a selling securityholder as a gift, pledge, partnership
  distribution or other transfer, may, from time to time, sell, transfer or
  otherwise dispose of any or all of their shares of common stock or interests
  in
  shares of common stock on any stock exchange, market or trading facility on
  which the shares are traded or in private transactions. These dispositions
  may
  be at fixed prices, at prevailing market prices at the time of sale, at prices
  related to the prevailing market price, at varying prices determined at the
  time
  of sale, or at negotiated prices. To the extent any of the selling
  securityholders gift, pledge or otherwise transfer the shares offered hereby,
  such transferees may offer and sell the shares from time to time under this
  prospectus, provided that this prospectus has been amended under
  Rule�424(b)(3) or other applicable provision of the Securities Act to
  include the name of such transferee in the list of selling securityholders
  under
  this prospectus. 
�
The
  selling securityholders may use any one or more of the following methods when
  disposing of shares or interests therein:�
�




���


�
  


ordinary
  brokerage transactions and transactions in which the broker-dealer
  solicits purchasers; 




�
  

�
�



���


�
  


block
  trades in which the broker-dealer will attempt to sell the shares
  as
  agent, but may position and resell a portion of the block as principal
  to
  facilitate the transaction; 




�
  

�
�



����


�
  


purchases
  by a broker-dealer as principal and resale by the broker-dealer for
  its
  account; 




�
  

�
�



���


�
  


an
  exchange distribution in accordance with the rules of the applicable
  exchange; 




�
  

�
�



���


�
  


privately
  negotiated transactions; 




�
  

�
�



���


�
  


short
  sales; 




�
  

�
�



���


�
  


through
  the writing or settlement of options or other hedging transactions,
  whether through an options exchange or otherwise; 




�
  

�
�



���


�
  


broker-dealers
  may agree with the selling securityholders to sell a specified number
  of
  such shares at a stipulated price per share; 




�
  

�
�



���


�
  


a
  combination of any such methods of sale; and 




�
  

�
�



���


�
  


any
  other method permitted pursuant to applicable law.
  




�
The
  selling securityholders may, from time to time, pledge or grant a security
  interest in some or all of the shares of common stock owned by them and, if
  they
  default in the performance of their secured obligations, the pledgees or secured
  parties may offer and sell the shares of common stock, from time to time, under
  this prospectus, or under an amendment to this prospectus under Rule 424(b)(3)
  or other applicable provision of the Securities Act amending the list of selling
  securityholder to include the pledgee, transferee or other successors in
  interest as selling securityholder under this prospectus. 
�
In
  connection with the sale of our common stock or interests therein, the selling
  securityholders may enter into hedging transactions with broker-dealers or
  other
  financial institutions, which may in turn engage in short sales of the common
  stock in the course of hedging the positions they assume. The selling
  securityholders may also sell shares of our common stock short and deliver
  these
  securities to close out their short positions, or loan or pledge the common
  stock to broker-dealers that in turn may sell these securities. The selling
  securityholders may also enter into option or other transactions with
  broker-dealers or other financial institutions or the creation of one or more
  derivative securities which require the delivery to such broker-dealer or other
  financial institution of shares offered by this prospectus, which shares such
  broker-dealer or other financial institution may resell pursuant to this
  prospectus (as supplemented or amended to reflect such transaction).

�
The
  aggregate proceeds to the selling securityholders from the sale of the common
  stock offered by them will be the purchase price of the common stock less
  discounts or commissions, if any. The selling securityholders reserve the right
  to accept and, together with their agents from time to time, to reject, in
  whole
  or in part, any proposed purchase of common stock to be made directly or through
  agents. We will not receive any of the proceeds from this offering.

�






13









�
The
  selling securityholders also may resell all or a portion of the shares in open
  market transactions in reliance upon Rule�144 under the Securities Act of
  1933, provided that the selling securityholder meets the criteria and conform
  to
  the requirements of that rule. 
�
The
  selling securityholders might be, and any broker-dealers that act in connection
  with the sale of securities will be, deemed to be an �underwriter� within the
  meaning of Section�2(11) of the Securities Act, and any commissions
  received by such broker-dealers and any profit on the resale of the securities
  sold by them while acting as principals will be deemed to be underwriting
  discounts or commissions under the Securities Act. The selling securityholders
  have represented and warranted to the Company that they does not have any
  agreement or understanding, directly or indirectly with any an individual,
  a
  limited liability company, a partnership, a joint venture, a corporation, a
  trust, an unincorporated organization, any other entity or government or any
  department or agency thereof to distribute shares. 
�
To
  the
  extent required, the shares of our common stock to be sold, the name of the
  selling securityholder, the respective purchase prices and public offering
  prices, the names of any agents, dealers or underwriters, and any applicable
  commissions or discounts with respect to a particular offer will be set forth
  in
  an accompanying prospectus supplement or, if appropriate, a post-effective
  amendment to the registration statement that includes this prospectus.

�
In
  order
  to comply with the securities laws of some states, if applicable, the common
  stock may be sold in these jurisdictions only through registered or licensed
  brokers or dealers. In addition, in some states the common stock may not be
  sold
  unless it has been registered or qualified for sale or an exemption from
  registration or qualification requirements is available and is complied with.
  
�
We
  have
  advised the selling securityholders that the anti-manipulation rules of
  Regulation�M under the Exchange Act may apply to sales of shares in the
  market and to the activities of the selling securityholder and affiliates.
  Regulation�M�s prohibition on purchases may include purchases to cover
  short positions by the selling stockholder, and a selling securityholder�s
  failure to cover a short position at a lender�s request and subsequent purchases
  by the lender in the open market of shares to cover such short positions, may
  be
  deemed to constitute an inducement to buy shares, which is prohibited by
  Regulation�M. 
�
We
  will
  make copies of this prospectus (as it may be supplemented or amended from time
  to time) available to the selling securityholders for the purpose of satisfying
  the prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act. The selling
  securityholders may indemnify any broker-dealer that participates in
  transactions involving the sale of the shares against certain liabilities,
  including liabilities arising under the Securities Act. 
�
We
  have
  advised the selling securityholders that if a particular offer of shares is
  to
  be made on terms constituting a material change from the information described
  under a final prospectus, then, to the extent required, a supplement to the
  final prospectus must be distributed setting forth the terms and related
  information as required.
�
�����We
  have agreed to indemnify the selling securityholders against liabilities,
  including liabilities under the Securities Act and state securities laws,
  relating to the registration of the shares offer

  15. Indemnification of Directors and Officers. 
�
Section
  180.0851 of the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law (�WBCL�) requires a
  corporation to indemnify a director or officer, to the extent such person is
  successful on the merits or otherwise in the defense of a proceeding, for all
  reasonable expenses incurred in the proceeding, if such person was a party
  to
  such proceeding because he or she was a director or officer of the corporation.
  In cases where a director or officer is not successful on the merits or
  otherwise in the defense of a proceeding, a corporation is required to indemnify
  a director or officer against liability incurred by the director or officer
  in a
  proceeding if such person was a party to such proceeding because he or she
  is a
  director or officer of the corporation unless it is determined that he or she
  breached or failed to perform a duty owed to the corporation and such breach
  or
  failure to perform constitutes: (i) a willful failure to deal fairly with the
  corporation or its shareholders in connection with a matter in which the
  director or officer has a material conflict of interest; (ii) a violation of
  criminal law, unless the director or officer had reasonable cause to believe
  his
  or her conduct was lawful or no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct
  was unlawful; (iii) a transaction from which the director or officer derived
  an
  improper personal profit; or (iv) willful misconduct. 
�
Section
  180.0858 of the WBCL provides that subject to certain limitations, the mandatory
  indemnification provisions do not preclude any additional right to
  indemnification or allowance of expenses that a director or officer may have
  under a corporation's articles of incorporation or by-laws, a written agreement
  between the director or officer and the corporation or a resolution of the
  board
  of directors or the shareholders. 
�
Unless
  otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation or by-laws, or by written
  agreement between the director or officer and the corporation, an officer or
  director seeking indemnification is entitled to indemnification if approved
  in
  any of the following manners as specified in Section 180.0855 of the WBCL:
  (i)
  by majority vote of a disinterested quorum of the board of directors, or if
  such
  disinterested quorum cannot be obtained, by a majority vote of a committee
  of
  two or more disinterested directors; (ii) by independent legal counsel chosen
  by
  a quorum of disinterested directors or its committee (or if unable to obtain
  such a quorum or committee, by a majority vote of the full board of directors);
  (iii) by a panel of three arbitrators (one of which is chosen by a quorum of
  disinterested directors); (iv) by the vote of the shareholders; (v) by a court;
  or (vi) by any other method permitted in Section 180.0858 of the WBCL.

�
Reasonable
  expenses incurred by a director or officer who is a party to a proceeding may
  be
  reimbursed by a corporation, pursuant to Section 180.0853 of the WBCL, at such
  time as the director or officer furnishes to the corporation written affirmation
  of his or her good faith belief that he or she has not breached or failed to
  perform his or her duties; and written confirmation to repay any amounts
  advanced if it is determined that indemnification by the corporation is not
  required. 
�
Section
  180.0859 of the WBCL provides that it is the public policy of the State of
  Wisconsin to require or permit indemnification, allowance of expenses and
  insurance to the extent required or permitted under Sections 180.0850 to
  180.0858 of the WBCL for any liability incurred in connection with any
  proceeding involving a federal or state statute, rule or regulation regulating
  the offer, sale or purchase of securities. 
�
As
  permitted by Section 180.0858, the Registrant has adopted indemnification
  provisions in its by-laws which closely track the statutory indemnification
  provisions with certain exceptions. In particular, Registrant's by-laws, among
  other items, provides that (i) an individual shall be indemnified unless it
  is
  proved by a final judicial adjudication that indemnification is prohibited
  and
  (ii) payment or reimbursement of expenses, subject to certain limitations,
  will
  be mandatory rather than permissive.

  415 Offering.

We
  hereby
  undertake that:
�
(1)
  File,
  during any period in which it offers or sells securities, a post-effective
  amendment to this registration statement to:
�
(i)
  include any prospectus required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of
  1933; 

(ii)
  reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date
  of the registration statement (or the most recent post-effective amendment
  thereof)�which,
  individually or together, represent a fundamental change in the information
  in
  the registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or
  decrease in volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of
  securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation
  from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be
  reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule
  424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more
  than a 20% change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the
  �Calculation of Registration Fee� table in the effective registration statement;


(iii)
  include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not
  previously disclosed in the registration statement or any material change to
  such information in the registration statement;

Provided,
  however, that paragraphs (i), (ii), and (iii) do not apply if the information
  required to be included in a post-effective amendment by those paragraphs is
  contained in reports filed with or furnished to the SEC by us pursuant to
  section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act that are incorporated by reference
  in
  this registration statement, or is contained in a form of prospectus filed
  pursuant to Rule 424(b) that is part of this registration
  statement.

(2)
  For
  determining liability under the Securities Act of 1933, treat each
  post-effective amendment as a new registration statement of the securities
  offered, and the offering of the securities at that time to be the initial
  bona
  fide
  offering.

(3)
  File
  a post-effective amendment to remove from registration any of the securities
  that remain unsold at the end of the offering.
�
(4)
  For
  determining liability under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser, if
  the
  registrant is relying on Rule 430B:

(i)
  Each
  prospectus filed by the registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b)(3) shall be deemed
  to
  be part of the registration statement as of the date the filed prospectus was
  deemed part of and included in the registration statement; and
�

�
(ii)
  Each
  prospectus required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424(b)(2), (b)(5), or (b)(7)
  as
  part of a registration statement in reliance on Rule 430B relating to an
  offering made pursuant to Rule 415(a)(1)(i), (vii), or (x) for the purpose
  of
  providing the information required by section 10(a) of the Securities Act of
  1933 shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration statement
  as
  of the earlier of the date such form of prospectus is first used after
  effectiveness or the date of the first contract of sale of securities in the
  offering described in the prospectus. As provided in Rule 430B, for liability
  purposes of the issuer and any person that is at that date an underwriter,
  such
  date shall be deemed to be a new effective date of the registration statement
  relating to the securities in the registration statement to which that
  prospectus relates, and the offering of such securities at that time shall
  be
  deemed to be the initial bona
  fide
  offering
  thereof;
  provided,
  however,
  that no
  statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the
  registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated
  by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of
  the
  registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale
  prior to such effective date, supersede or modify any statement that was made
  in
  the registration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration
  statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such effective
  date.

(5)
  For
  determining liability of the undersigned registrant under the Securities Act
  of
  1933 to any purchaser in the initial distribution of the securities, the
  undersigned registrant undertakes that in a primary offering of securities
  of

�
(iii)
  the
  portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing
  material information about the undersigned registrant or its securities provided
  by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant; and 
�
���(iv)
  any
  other communication that is an offer in the offering made by the undersigned
