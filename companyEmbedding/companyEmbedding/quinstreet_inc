Internet Marketing News
A convenient summary of Internet marketing news from around the Web



Internet Marketing News Update #262, June 15, 2017 >>

Augmented reality projected to reach 40 million U.S. users this year An eMarketer study projects that 40 million people in the U.S. will engage in some form of augmented reality experience this year, up from 30.7 million last year. The bulk of this usage is expected to come from Snapchat Lenses, though it is believed Facebook Stories will become more of a factor in the future simply because it is so widely available. eMarketer
Millennials keen on sharing economy A new study highlights the sharp contrast in degrees of engagement with the sharing economy between millennials and older Americans. Some particularly strong examples: 32% of the 18-34 age group uses Uber or other ride sharing services, compared to just 12% of people 35 and up; 17% of the younger generation participate in crowdfunding, compared to 7% of the older age group. eMarketer

FTC cracks down on paid social media influencersThe FTC announced on April 19 that it sent letters to 90 social media influencers, telling them that any "material connection" (eg, compensation arrangement) between themselves and products needs to be clearly disclosed in endorsements of those products. The FTC appears to be looking for more than an abbreviated hashtag to denote sponsored content.Direct Marketing News

Internet Marketing News Update #260, April 14, 2017 >>

Marketers wary of new tech investmentWhile marketers recognize that cutting-edge tools such as 360-degree video, virtual reality, augmented reality, chartbots and beacons have potential, they are more concerned with near-term ROI. Overall, a recent survey by OnBrand Magazine found that 65% of marketers don't plan to invest in such technologies in 2017. The contrast between short-term and long-term perspectives can be seen in the fact that only 14% plan to invest in virtual reality and only 7% in augmented reality, despite the fact that 70% say they recognize the value of these tools.ClickZ
Google Home ad bothers some usersSome Google Home users reported recently that the device slipped an ad for a Disney movie into its usual greeting to customers. This rankled some users, since it represents crossing a new frontier in the invasion of advertising into private life. Google tried to finesse the situation by responding that the scripted plug-ins were not advertising, but rather "timely content."ClickZ

Internet Marketing News Update #259, March 15, 2017 >>

Automated ad placement links major brands to controversial contentTraditionally, major brands like Mercedes Benz, Sandals Resort, and Honda would never have allowed their ads anywhere near controversial content. However, a study by the Times of London found ads from a number of major brands on controversial pages due to automated placement. It is expected that brands will demand that ad platforms give them tighter control over where their promotions end up. DM News

Instagram launches new ad capabilitiesHaving seen its Stories feature attract 150 million users in just five months, Instagram is looking to cash in by introducing new advertising functions. One such function is 15-second full-screen ads, launched initially with participation by 30 different brands. Another function, called Insights for Stories, will provide advertisers with metrics on how their ads are being viewed. Search Engine Journal

Internet marketing news update #257, January 20, 2017 >>

Retail sales slump after Black Friday/Cyber MondayEven though retail sales on Black Friday and Cyber Monday set records, the holiday retail season overall is shaping up as a disappointment. Through the first five weeks of the shopping season, total dollar sales were down 3%, and retailers are resorting to unusually deep discounting. With more shopping taking place through digital channels, it appears retail shopping activity is becoming increasingly weighted toward the front end of the holiday shopping season, making early figures less representative of actual growth.Search Engine Watch

New Adwords metrics releasedGoogle provides advertisers with new data sets to ponder. The focus is on the physical shopping habits of mobile users and, with the new data, advertisers will be able to base their targeting on things like how far a customer typically is from a store when doing a related search, when physical store visits tend to peak, and how the timing of search activity correlates with related store visits.Search Engine Watch

BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 03/06/2000
            

                BBB has determined that Quinstreet, Inc. meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry

4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means
                







Tell the Truth









            Honestly represent products and services, including clear and adequate disclosures of all material terms.

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Upon request, provide BBB with all information required to evaluate compliance with BBB standards.

5. the business' return/refund policy

                            6. any recurring commitment into which the customer may be entering, including information on how future billing will occur

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by: 
1. Resolving the complaint directly with the complainant and notifying BBB, or

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines: 

                                    1. is professional,

                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed. BBB may consider a business' willingness to participate in recommended dispute resolution options in determining compliance with these standards.
                

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.
                

                    4. Cooperate with BBB in efforts to eliminate the underlying cause of patterns of customer complaints that are identified by BBB.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

                        Quinstreet, Inc. has received 3.94 out of 5 stars based on 5 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

History[edit]
QuinStreet was formed in 1999 by Doug Valenti (chairman and CEO). Bronwyn Syiek, another founding team member, is president and COO. The company was first profitable in 2002 with revenues of $13 million; by April 2009, QuinStreet reported $300 million in annual revenues and approximately 450 employees.[1][2]
In February 2015, Nielsen NetRatings named QuinStreet the eighth top advertiser, after Education Dynamics, USA & StudentsLeads, India spending $9.4 million on 1.9 billion ads viewed.[3]
QuinStreet Inc. acquired U.S. Citizens for Fair Credit Card Terms, Inc, which operated the CardRatings.com website in August 2008 for an initial cash payment of $10.4 million.[4]
In the beginning of August 2009, QuinStreet Inc. used some of its cash reserves to acquire the Internet.com division of WebMediaBrands Inc. for $18 million.[5][6] Among the sites that QuinStreet Inc gaines with the acquisition of Internet.com are InternetNews.com, Datamation.com, ServerWatch, Webopedia.com, ServerWatch.com, EnterpriseNetworkingPlanet, SmallBusinessComputing.com, LinuxPlanet.com and Developer.com.
In September 2009, QuinStreet purchased Insure.com for $16 million.[7] The company's other financial-services properties include MoneyRates.com, Get Rich Slowly, ConsumerismCommentary.com and HSH.com.[8]
An initial public offering on February 11, 2010, raised $150 million, with the shares listed on Nasdaq under the symbol QNST.[9]
In India, QuinStreet operates IndiaEducation.net, IndiaEduNews.net, and ExamResults.net,[10] which it acquired in 2011 by incorporating QuinStreet India Marketing And Media Private Limited (QSIMM.)[11][12]
In September 2011, QuinStreet acquired the IT Business Edge (ITBE) network of web publications[13]
In February 2012, the company acquired the media assets of Ziff Davis "Enterprise", which included eWeek.com, CIOInsight.com, Baseline.com, ChannelInsider.com and WebBuyersGuide.com, and others.[14]
For its second quarter of fiscal 2013, the Company reported total revenue of $71.8 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $11.2 million, or 16% of revenue.[15] For its fiscal 2016, QuinStreet reported total revenue of $297.7 million[16] Quinstreet reported first quarter fiscal 2017 revenue of $73.4 million with an EPS of $0.01, missing analyst targets.[17]
Deceptive advertising investigation and settlement[edit]
In June 2012, the company was under investigation by the Attorneys General's offices of 15 separate US states, led by the Attorney General of Kentucky, Jack Conway.[18] The company was accused of targeting military veterans with deceptive recruiting practices for its for-profit school clients.[19] QuinStreet denied wrongdoing and no determination of guilt was made.[19] The company cooperated with the attorneys general and entered into a voluntary agreement to update its websites to ensure clarity around schools advertising. In addition, the company agreed to pay $2.5 million to the states involved as part of a consumer protection settlement with what had expanded to 20 state Attorneys General, and turn over the website GIBill.com to the United States Department of Veterans Affairs to settle the civil investigation.[20]
