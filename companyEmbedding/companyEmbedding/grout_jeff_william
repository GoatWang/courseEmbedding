											Cleaning Ceramic Tile







How on earth do you clean ceramic tile and grout…and what products work best?
This was a question I was pondering while taking a shower the other day. Primarily because the grout on our shower’s ceramic floor wasn’t looking so good.
I try to keep our shower clean, but with two adults and two kids it’s pretty darn hard to maintain Mr Clean’s level of tidiness (hey, the guy has no hair and that helps a lot with keeping showers looking immaculate).
We have small 2 inch by 2 inch square tiles on our shower floor (sound familiar) and my primary goal was to determine the best way to clean them. I also wanted to see if the same solution used to clean the ceramic tile could clean the grout.
Here’s what I used

OxiClean Versatile Stain Remover ($9.47)
Eco Orange Citrus Cleaner ($80.00)
Chlorox ($1.99)

I’ve read so many articles on the awesomeness of OxiClean (oxygenated bleach) and wanted to see for myself how it would work on ceramic tile & grout.
My wife bought Eco Orange Citrus Cleaner from a salesperson in our neighborhood because it’s supposedly non-toxic and kid friendly. We’ve used it for general cleaning and it seemed like a good thought to try it on the shower, too.
And as a last resort I tried Chlorox bleach. It’s not my preference due to the noxious fumes and likelihood you’ll ruin your clothes using it.
Admittedly I hit a road block the first few times I used OxiClean. I’ll share my experience because it sheds light on the amount of OxiClean I found to have the most power. At the very least you’ll want to scroll through the pictures since I was growing my cheesy moustache to raise money for prostate cancer awareness.
Let’s get started 🙂

How Much OxiClean Powder Should be Used to Clean Ceramic Tile & Grout?
This is a great question because everyone’s ceramic tile & grout has a different level of dirtiness.
Let’s first discuss how the makers of OxiClean recommend using it for hard surfaces like tile & grout.
 

 
The directions on the OxiClean container say to fill the OxiClean scoop to line 4 and add it to 1 gallon of water. It’s also suggested that a more concentrated solution/paste may be required for surfaces like grout and I’m certainly going to discuss this point.
They then recommend applying the OxiClean & water solution to tile with a sponge or brush or by pouring it directly on top of the surface. And the final step is to let the OxiClean stand on the tile & grout for 5-30 minutes and to not let it dry out.
Okay, that’s what you’ll read on the OxiClean box.
I performed 3 different tests on my ceramic tile to see what concentration of OxiClean would work best. My hope was that I’d only have to do one experiment and POOF, I’d be be a cleaning genius.
But no such luck.
The first test I did used 1/2 cup of OxiClean added to 1 gallon of hot water. I let the solution stand on the tile & grout for 30 minutes and scrubbed for about 5 minutes. This produced somewhat cleaner grout but the tile didn’t look any better.
The second test used 1 cup of OxiClean added to 1 gallon of hot water. Again, I let the solution stand on the tile & grout for 30 minutes and scoured for 5 minutes. The results were a mixed bag. The grout was clean in some areas and dirty in others as was the tile.
The third test involved 2 cups of OxiClean added to 1 gallon of hot water. This time I let the solution stand for 60 minutes and scrubbed for 5 minutes at the beginning and end. As a result, the tile & grout looked much better. The tile in particular sparkled and some of the grime I couldn’t get off with the scrub brush in tests #1 and #2 was completely gone.
 

 
My conclusion is that 2 cups of OxiClean mixed with one gallon of hot water will defintely clean ceramic tile. I barely had to use the nylon scrub brush to get the tiles looking brand new. This concentration will also eliminate mild grout stains and dirt.
But there were still sections of discolored grout. Maybe my grout was too far gone to be cleaned by OxiClean but that doesn’t mean I gave up.
 
Why Should You Use Oxygenated Bleach to Clean Ceramic Tile?
I try to stay as healthy as possible. And one sure way to get sick is to expose yourself to harsh chemicals. Plus, my kids use the same bathroom and shower as us. So the last thing I want to do is use chlorine bleach or some other product that could harm their lungs & skin.
Oxygenated bleach contains sodium percarbonate. When oxygenated bleach is dissolved in water a chemical reaction occurs that releases hydrogen peroxide and sodium carbonate.
This reaction is non-toxic and environmentally friendly. Plus, oxygenated bleach doesn’t contain chlorine. So you don’t have to worry about it discoloring carpets or clothing while cleaning tile & grout.
(IMPORTANT, never mix vinegar with hydrogen peroxide as this reaction forms peracetic acid which can melt lead bullets. I mention this because many people might try vinegar to clean tile THEN use OxiClean, bad idea altogether!!)
Can Eco Orange or Chlorox Clean Shower Tile & Grout?
At this point in my experiment the shower tile was immaculate. The grout was driving me nuts. Even though each successive OxiClean treatment improved the grout’s look there were still discolored grout lines on some portions of the shower floor.
Enter Eco Orange Citrus Cleaner. This stuff is expensive at $80 per gallon. Like I said in the introduction we’ve used it to clean different areas of our home like sinks, bathtubs, floors, etc. It’s marketed as being safe and non-toxic which is important to us because we have 2 young daughters.
It works really well as a general cleaner (as it should for that price, holy mother of mercy).
I used 1 part Eco Orange to 2 parts water. In this case 2 cups of Eco Orange to 4 cups of warm water. Once mixed thoroughly I poured it onto the shower tile & grout and scrubbed the grout for 5 minutes with a nylon brush.
Then I rinsed the shower floor with clean water. Unfortunately the grout was still discolored. If I had to just tidy up the shower floor I’d most certainly use Eco Orange because it would do a good job eliminating superficial dirt. But grout renewer it is not.
 

 
Moving on to Chlorox bleach.
I really dislike using Chlorox bleach, but wanted to see if it could make a dent in my grout. After putting on rubber gloves, a respirator, and eye protection I mixed 3/4 cup of Chlorox with 2 cups of water.
 

 
This is super concentrated but that’s the point. I didn’t want to perform multiple experiments with bleach.
I scrubbed the tile grout for 5 minutes and let the Chlorox stand on the tile surface for another 10. Then I rinsed with clean water.
After saying a little prayer to the grout gods (just kidding, but if they existed you know I would kneel in reverence) and waiting 10 minutes, I checked on the grout.
Sorry folks, Chlorox just didn’t help in this case.
 

 
So what shall I do?
The shower tile is looking fantastic but the grout is still discolored in some areas.
 

 
I started Home Repair Tutor to share my wins and losses to help others. This is a tie 🙂
My hope was that one of these three products could have cleaned both the tile and grout in our shower. I’m confident that OxiClean can clean anyone’s ceramic tiles. And while it didn’t fully live up to my grout cleansing expectations I think you should try it since it helped brighten up about 60% of our grout lines.
It’s relatively affordable at $7.52 and worth a shot since it’s non-toxic.
I may try a few other products in order to get my tile grout looking better.

There’s something that I think is called Grout Renew or Grout Refresh. It’s available at Home Depot, Lowes, etc. I’ve seen rave reviews on various blogs. It comes in different colors, which makes me wonder if it’s a cleaner or more like a paint or resurfacer. It sounds like it’s worth a shot, though.

Thanks Jessica for the tip. I saw this product in the store. I wanted to see if I could clean the grout first but it could be an option down the road. Isn’t grout the most difficult area to keep clean? I swear it turns gray the instant you look at it 🙁

Hi Jeff.
Re tile and grout cleaning.
First if you redo a bath, choose a color of grout thats already darker, not white..half of your problem solved.
Second…hate to say it but full strength bleach has been successful for me on white grout.
Most importantly, to get the best result one has to be part chemist.
If the stains are body dirt and soap scum…ie alkyline, try vinegar.
If they are rust stains( the worst in my experience) oxy or bleach may work. Is the water hard or soft? All these aspects need to be considered to get the best result.  Ask you friendly 60 yr old who also happens to be a bath designer. ☺

I do not know about grout renew, but after going through all the machinations you have discussed with various cleaners, I did indeed paint my grout.  That works for a while.    How does reglazing work on the stains?  It sounds like that might be helpful.

I have used the mapei grout renew.  It’s amazing.  It seems as it would take less time to do it vs the various cleaning methods you’ve tried.
The beauty (I’ve used in my kitchen, laundry, and powder room so far)?  Everything beads off it!  I spilled tomato sauce on it (a full year after I applied it) and nothing!  It like it has a wax coating with just makes cleaning so much easier on a general basis. 
I found this article because we just had a brand new mast shower installed with small hex tiles and I really didn’t wanna spend the time to go over it (in the same color) with the renew because it is hard work.  But it looks like it’ll be more than worth it in the long run.

Well, Jeff, you could always do what I did in our guest bath- paint the walls soon after putting down new floor tile. Make sure you dump the can of paint when you move the ladder, because you forgot to remove the aforementioned can of paint before moving the said ladder…. 😛

Oh my gosh!! That sounds painful. We’ve all done stuff like that and it almost happens in slow motion. I’m guessing you had quite the cleanup on your hands even with a drop cloth. 
I once spilled paint all over myself when painting a ceiling. Not fun 🙁
But these make for great stories.

I have used Comet (and the Ajax brand of the same thing) to clean grout in a kitchen and it worked wonders!!!  I made a thin paste and applied it, scrubbed it, then let it sit for 30ish minutes, then scrubbed again and rinsed it away!

That’s another ingenious tip Tanya. I’ll give that a shot. I love using Comet in our kitchen sink to clean and disinfect. 
Thank you so much for providing the specific directions and letting me know how long to let the paste sit on the grout 🙂

I too use Comet for grout discoloration. However, remember that it too, as well as Ajax, both have chlorine in them…so do be careful with fumes. And sometimes when I’m lazy I just spray liquid bleach right on the grout! I put the exhaust fan on and work in short spurts…as long as I can hold my breath between spray times…;-) The truth of the matter is, once the grout is really badly discolored you’ll probably not find anything in the home cleaner line that will get it perfectly cleaned 🙁  So the trick is, clean well/clean often…Yes, it’s tough when the family uses the shower a lot.  
There are other specific grout cleaners out there as others have mentioned. I’ve never used them but would love to know how they work, if they’re reasonably priced etc. because our home now has a grouted shower…Before it was an all-in-one shower stall that was much easier to clean.

Thanks Connie for the Ajax tip. Grout is so tough to maintain and I’ve given thought to using epoxy formulas but they are tricky to apply.
I spoke with the technical support line today at Custom Building Products. They make Polyblend grout and recommended sulfamic acid to clean grout. So this might be my last resort before regrouting the shower floor.
I think it would be interesting to remove the grout and try an epoxy formula.

For literally years, I have tried every product and home recipe that I have found to try and keep my husband’s shower clean.  So far, I have found nothing that cleaned to my satisfaction.  Recently, I found a home recipe on a web site, so as usual, I mixed it up and tried it. To my utter disbelief, after the cleaning, it was as if I was looking at a new shower!  Mix this up and give it a try.  Heat 1 cup of white vinegar in the microwave for 90 seconds.  Pour the vinegar into a spray bottle.  Add one cup of BLUE Dawn dishwashing liquid. (I don’t know why it must be blue, however, that was stressed). Shake to mix.  Spray the area to be cleaned (tile, glass, fixtures) with this mixture.  It will spray on like a gel.  Let it sit for 2 hours.  After the 2 hours, scrub all surfaces (scrub if you want – I only needed to rub ), rinse and stand back and see the sparkle!  This mixture does smell really bad, but the smell dissipates fairly quickly.  Hope it does as good for you as it has done for me.

I have seen this recipe and actually a modified version that I tried just yesterday for calcified and hard water stains around the kitchen and bath faucets, as well as tub and tile.
Fill 1/2 a spray bottle with Vinegar (warm or not, although I believe warm would be better)
Add 1/4 cup of lemon juice (bottled juice is acceptable)
Add your favorite dish soap (I used Dawn “Original”)
I only wish I’d taken before and after pics of my kitchen and bath hardware to show you the difference, but you can try it for yourself. Really outstanding. I did not, however try this on my grout issues yet (I have the same one as you, Jeff). I cleaned my guest bath and shower with it yesterday, which was very clean anyway, so short of mentioning the tile & hardware having a sparkling finish, I can’t say much about the grout. If reapplication is needed for anyone after letting that solution sit for 30 minutes or more, I’d be surprised!
Recently I tried “Soft Scrub Total All Purpose With Bleach” in my master shower which is the one with the grout issues. The application is similar to the above vinegar solution in that its foamy and stays where applied.  I got some decent results, but certainly not perfection or renewal.
A while back I’d tried Tilex Root and that absolutely restored the grout better, but its just seriously awful.
My handyman directed me to a Grout Pen and that will absolutely cover and seal your grout if applied correctly, making it look pretty new again. I can’t tell you how fun it was to use that on my 1″ octagonal tiles! 😛
Thank you for your great Blog!

I agree with you on Tilex-it works by the bleachy smell is so overpowering that I don’t use it. Primarily because my wife’s asthma will be triggered.
I’ve thought about the Grout Pen and called the company that makes it. They only recommend using it on grout that won’t be exposed to water. Thus my only choice at this point is to probably regrout the shower floor.
But that should be a good post in the future 🙂

Just updating and commenting about Teresa’s post and her recipe requiring the BLUE Dawn dishwashing liquid.
I got funky and decided to try the Green Apple scented dawn because It is anti-bacterial. Although Vinegar is anti-bacterial, I thought I’d try the added anti-bacterial soap. I will say I did not find quite the same results, although fine results with a delightful apple smell. Much more appealing than the blue dawn recipe.
Thanks again for the awesome blog! Kudos on a job well done!

My husband went ballistic when I told him I sprayed vinegar on the tile and the grout, then proceeded to lecture me that vinegar is acid and will eat through the grout. He’s angry that I have “ruined” the grout, even though I haven’t, as far as I can tell, and he keeps reading articles from the internet that vinegar will burn through the grout. Can anyone who has used the vinegar and blue Dawn method confirm or deny the information about the grout and vinegar? Has anyone wrecked their grout?

Won’t the vinegar boil if it’s for 90 seconds?  I, too, have tried multiple ways of trying to clean my kitchen floor grout (very light beige, almost white) and my shower tile floor grout (also very light beige).  For the kitchen, I have used a paste made of baking soda and white vinegar.  Leave it on for at least 30 min if very dirty then use a scrub brush (I used a toothbrush) to scrub.  You might have to use a little more vinegar.  Worked pretty well but since I did not seal the floor afterwards, 3 months later it was dirty again.  Tried it in my shower but it didn’t work.  I think it is too far gone.

The most important thing to do after your hard work of scrubbing. Is to seal the floor. Otherwise you did all that hard work for nothing . You can buy any grout sealer at home depot or similar for twenty dollars. Then buy the grout sealer roll on brush for five dollars. Then follow directions on a bottle. Very simple. That or pay a company like mine to do it for fifty dollars. The sealer will protect stains for around three years, then simply redo the sealer. Most of the deep grout stains you won’t be able to remove. Its soaked all the way through. You can stain grout lines or replace the grout lines. But cleaning it will only get you so far.

Hi Theresa, the blue dawn is a grease cutter most of the time mildew grows under soap scum.  Soap scum (is grease) has to be removed first then mold and mildew can be removed easily with hydrogen peroxide.  I have been a house cleaner since 1986, I perfer bleach, it works the best.

No good results with any.  I tried the Dawn/vinegar solution as I usually would in my search for something that would do the job.  For once, something worked.  I have used it ever since with great results!

Question about the dawn and vinegar. I tried this a long time ago when it first was listed on social media, and not on grout but, do you reheat the mixture when you want to use it again?  Obviously when you make a spray bottle full or even half you’re going to have alot left. Appreciate your repsonse.

Going to make this mixture and hopefully have found a solution to ugly dirty grout.  Tried many products and gets a little here and there, but overall, still ugly.  Worst places, I have been painting.  Lasts a little while, then comes off.  Estimate for steam cleaning was $500.  Don’t want to pay that much.  Don’t know how much would cost to have regrouted.

Hi Joan,
$500 is a lot of loot. You might be able to re-grout for that price depending on the area. And certainly could re-grout it yourself for much much less. How big is your surface area? If it’s a powder room you could get it done in a weekend for sure. I’d volunteer but my wife has be doing other stuff for the next several months-LOL.

Thought I’d try the Blue Dawn and Vinegar and, when I went to mix the soution, realized I’d forgotton Dawn, BUT, I did have Cascade Complete Liquid Dishwasher Soap WITH Dawn in it.  So, I mixed one cup of that with one cup of warm vinegar. This destroyed my spray bottle, and I had to apply with a rag, but in a matter of minutes the tiles were clean and the grout looked better than it had in years!  The lowest tiles in the shower still have some residue on them, so I will reapply with the straight Blue Dawn.  Gotta say, tho, that the Cascade really is a powerful cleaner for gloss finish ceramic tiles.  Thank you SOOO much for your suggestions!  This is a great Blog…I am going to get grout sealer next!

Hello, All…yup, it really was Awesome to see the grime disappear so fast with that dishwasher soap and vinegar!  Haven’t yet done the second treatment; thought I’d compare the DAWN and vinegar with the Cascade and vinegar both on this surround AND on the shower walls downstairs which are…well, let’s just not put words to it.  Anyhow: here’s how my bottle was destroyed:  apparently there’s something in the Cascade that reacted like baking soda with the vinegar.  Rather explosive: the liquid began coming out the spray nozzle, and when I released the sprayer to stop that, there was no problem.  However, the spray trigger failed after that to work.  So, I applied by hand.  
Thanks for all the comments about grout!  I’m going to seal after I clean the final time.  I love tile too, but…in areas that offer oils and grease of any kind, maybe not the best choice?  I just put cork floors in for my yoga studio and Reiki Treatment room and love them.  The salesperson said he’d sold cork to several people for their kitchens.  Easy peasy to clean with the Bona System.  I’ll keep you posted on that….

It was so simple heat the vinegar, add the dawn, spray,  (you may want to use a mask it does smell pretty bad).  Wait 2 hours and for the most part we just use a magic eraser sponge.  After it dried you can see where you missed as it dried a white so we just went back over the area.

I think the reason that the packages warn about no skin contact is because the pads can be quite abrasive. I have learned the hard way to only use them on matte surfaces or areas where light reflections/glare won’t draw attention to the scrub marks that they leave on shiny/glossy surfaces.

Natural cleaners work great for upkeep.  It’s when upkeep isn’t done regularly that you have problems with needing to really deep clean and get out stains.  I know I’m guilty of getting behind on chores, but staying on top of things is really the key to dealing with these problems 🙂
I use vinegar to clean, and I usually use orange peel to help boost the vinegar power.  I fill a pickle jar with juicy orange peel, and pour vinegar over the peel.  I let sit for a week or so, and then re-fill my spray bottles with the home made orange cleaner.  smells better than just regular vinegar, and cleans better too.  
when I first moved into my house, though, the tile was gross.  I used clorox toilet bowl cleaner (the gel stuff in the bottle with the crooked neck) to whiten the grout.  it works wonders, though you MUST wear thick rubber gloves and safety glasses to scrub it.  open the windows and let the bathroom air out after a cleaning and be sure to rinse really well.  
I learned about toilet bowl cleaner when I worked at a family owned shop in highschool.  We had to do a big cleaning day, and they used it to clean everything in the bathrooms. Caustic, but effective.

I’ll give the toilet bowl cleaner a try today while I’m doing some pluming work around the house. If this doesn’t work I doubt anything else will do the trick, haha. It would be fantastic if such caustic products weren’t necessary and your comment on upkeep cuts straight to how we can avoid this issue problem.

I don’t have a tile bath anymore (YAY!), but when I did, I always used the toiled bowl cleaner and brush on the tile. Never had a grout problem. I liked the little hole so you could squirt it out and it would run down the grout line. And even going crosswise wasn’t bad because it is thick.  I also discovered a product that helps to keep the bath clean longer.  “Clean Shower”.  You clean your bath good, then spray that on all the surfaces. Daily, after bathing, spray again.  Really aided in “big cleaning day” because the surfaces were never as dirty! I use it still on my smooth surface bath, and it seems to prevent build up.  I used to love to clean. I’m 73 now and that is NOT my top priority!!  🙂

Well Pam I would have thought the Works or CLR could remove these rings  but apparently this isn’t the case. 
Unfortunately I don’t have any other suggestions. I wish I could be more helpful.

Pam, the “toilet Bowl Cleaner” from dollar general (Dollar General brand) works wonders on toilet bowl water rings!!!  I squirt it in there, making sure to cover all of it, then wait about 30 minutes…voila, clean!!!  I live in an apartment, and had that glorious ring in both toilets since we moved in almost a year ago….one day I saw that stuff and decided to try it, and it worked perfectly!!!

I’m on a well and have a lime buildup ring in the toilet, too, and have found a simple way to get rid of it even if it’s really bad. Flush the toilet and as the water level is at its lowest and starting to refill, pour in a quart of vinegar and make sure the toilet fills to just above the ring. Let it sit a couple of hours, then use a regular toilet scrubber to work it off. This is very easy when you do it every couple of weeks; when we were out of town three months and guests did not do the full clean it was harder. In that case when we got home I did the vinegar soak and the ring came off but there was a coating down at the bottom of the throat of the bowl that I had to use a hard plastic spatula to kind of chip off, though the vinegar softened it. Apparently, the ring is related to bacteria, though: if I drop one of those bleach cakes into the tank (after thoroughly flushing all vinegar out of the bowl!) I don’t see a ring at all until the bleach cake is nearly gone. So now that I think of it, maybe if I just poured a cup of vinegar into the bowl more often, even if I didn’t scrub it would stay ring-free without a bleach cake?

To clean the lines in a toilet, I’ve used a grey pumice stone (wear gloves since your hands are in the toilet).  It gently scrubbed off the ring that a lot of toilets get after many years of use.  It’s important that the pumice stone is grey, because red stones will scratch the toilet.  I used it with comet and was amazed at how the toilets looked like new again.

Try using something called a Pumie scouring stick.  These are pumice, will not scratch your toilet if it is porcelain and in just a few minutes your toilet will be like new – and no chemicals involved.  You can buy these at hardware stores and they are also sold on Amazon.  They have a host of other uses as well. You will be happy.

I found something similar to this idea, quite by accident. I had splashed some hair conditioner on the shower door later to find the water didn’t leave spots where the conditioner was! So after I cleaned the shower door, I rubbed conditioner all over the door.(I just used my hand actually.) It left a sort of ‘oily film’ on the door and the water didn’t bead up on it. It acted like a sort of ‘sheet’ so the water ran off more easily. And yes, we have quite hard water.  This was a glass shower door but I’m suspecting it would work as easily on a fiberglass door 🙂 
So in case you’re wondering what kind of hair conditioner it was, the semi-permanent hair color I use comes with a tube of conditioner. I have a ton of those around so I used that.  Just be careful not to get too much of the conditioner on the floor…it may cause slipperiness. Wipe the floor well, if this does happen.

I moved into an apartment where the shower tile outgrunged the average Turkish prison.  After scrubbing well with ajax powder and rinsing several times–and sobbing salty tears–I sprayed all surfaces with Tilex Mold and Mildew Spray and went outside for about an hour.  Ta-Da!  I simply had to rinse, and the yuck was gone.  Now I use the stuff regularly to clean toilets, sinks, etc., but it is wise to have good ventilation.  It’s worth trying.  Good luck.

Thanks for the Tilex tip. I tried it over the weekend and unfortunately is didn’t work. 
But I totally believe in Tilex as an upkeep product, meaning it will help prevent the type of situation I’m in now. If I’d been using it routinely our grout would look out of this world.
Where the heck was this grungy apartment that was worse than a Turkish prison? I had to ask.

I use “Bar Keeper’s Friend” Cleanser and Polish for grout maintenance. I found out about it when I bought new pots and pans and it was recommended for proper cleaning of the stainless. Had never used it before and now I wonder how I ever cleaned without it! I’ve tried it on all surfaces with wonderful results, even on RUST! My kitchen grout was really dingy looking in the traffic path so down on my knees I went with the BF and a Magic Eraser. A few swipes and the grout looked like new! I believe it has a mild acid in it which is the miracle worker (so wear gloves, though I have used it most times bare handed). It’s my go to choice for all dirty jobs. It restores most household items to a “like new” appearance!

Did you have any bad chemical reaction that created a bad vapor? I just wanted to check before moving forward.
I’d also encourage others to wear gloves when using Magic Erasers. I’ve had my skin peel around my fingernails after using them.

There is no out-gassing or reaction at all, but the BKF is very powdery, like talc, so I would be careful when sprinkling, to not be vigorous about it, so as not to inhale any resulting “poof” of the product. I have transfered the BKF to a glass, restaurant style cheese shaker (you know the one that resides in every pizza place) so that I can keep it handy on the sink and the smaller size of the bottle keeps the powder more targeted.

You know, I was looking at your pix once again and I noticed in the #2 picture (with your finger pointing) that the darker color may not be discolored grout. Have you considered that the mortar mastic, that adhered the tiles, might be showing trough? The grayish/putty color looks about right. Before the areas that you cleaned were clean, was it all the same color or was it still spotty looking? It’s entirely possible that the installer was a bit heavy handed with the adhesive and it squished through the tile spaces thereby not leaving enough depth for sufficient grout in spots. Perhaps all of your attempts at cleaning have removed the thin layer of grout over the mastic??
Just a random thought (I have a lot of those)… and if that is the case, that ain’t comin’ out honey!! =)
Perhaps SheilaG’s misadventures with paint might be the answer after all!!





 Jeff Patterson says: 

			November 15, 2012 at 6:20 AM 
The thought did cross my mind that the mortar was showing through but upon further inspection the discoloring is from residue on the surface of the grout. The area was indeed spotty looking before I cleaned with all the different products.
With that said, I did recognize the grout was a bit thin in areas. I might try to clean a bit more and see what happens. Ultimately this grout will need to be replaced and that’s an entirely different tutorial. I’m still contemplating using epoxy grout since it doesn’t stain as easily as sanded grout. It’s certainly trickier to install since it sets up quickly.
I’m up for an adventure though.

Epoxy grout is a royal b**** to install! You do have to work super fast. My husband and I worked together grouting our 4’x5′ shower and swore at the stuff. BUT! That stuff makes great grout for the floor of a shower. It is not rough and porous like sanded grout and doesn’t need any more cleaning than the tile around it, as it has a smooth finish like the tile. If we had to do it again in a future home, I might read up on some kind of release agent to coat the main surface of the tiles, so the excess epoxy is easier to remove. We had used 6×6 tiles on the floor and that turned out to be a lot of surface to clean off. It might not be such a big deal with mosaic tiles. We used a chocolate epoxy with dark brown-ish tiles so it had a blended look. Good luck if you do decide to switch to epoxy!  In the end, it is worth the work.





 Jeff Patterson says: 

			November 8, 2013 at 1:17 PM 
Hi Valerie, I did end up using epoxy grout and it was a lot easier than I anticipated. I only used it because I’ve grouted tile before and don’t mind trying new products. I definitely had to work fast but overall am very happy with the results. You’re right, epoxy grout stays way cleaner than sanded or un-sanded and doesn’t look bad. I’m sold on it.

My bathroom tiles were disgusting! I had tried so many different products that it would have bankrupt a small country. None of which did much if anything except wear me out, smell up the house, and/or ruin my clothing.
Finally, one day while washing my husband’s greasy, grimy work clothes I realized how clean my washer was after washing them with Simple Green so I decided to try it on my tiles.
I mixed a solution of 2oz. cleaner to 10oz. water. sprayed the cleaner on, let it soak for an hour (re-wet if it dries out). At the end of the hour I scrubbed with a stiff brush. When I wiped away the suds and dirty water the tiles & grout were white for the first time in 15 yrs+, before I moved into this house. I rinsed the tiles and grout twice and then went to the store to get grout sealer. I figured it’s easier to keep the tiles clean than keep tiles & grout clean.
I still officially HATE tile in a shower!

The acid that’s in Bar Keeper’s Friend is muric acid. It eats through organic stuff like rust and blood and it’s only mildly abrasive. But, best to wear gloves. 
Magic erasers don’t have anything caustic in them. It’s the abrasive nature that is hurting your skin. I hear they are hell on false fingernails.
I blogged about magic erasers here: http://diyhomestagingtips.blogspot.com/2011/08/the-truth-about-magic-erasers-are-they.html

Unfortunately tile has always been very difficult to clean after being soiled.  I have found that preventive medicine works the best,  I tiled several area in my home and to prevent having issues with grout staining I would liberally apply grout sealer the soonest possible time after grouting.  This seams to prevent the grout from staining and makes for easy clean-up when there are normal spills.  Unfortunately paint and and the like will always make for difficult clean-up.  
I believe the real remedy for cleaning grout would be to remove the old grout if it has been stained badly then seal it before use.

Good idea Keith to liberally apply grout sealer to grout. I would go a step further and recommend reapplying sealer every 6 months.
We have new grout and tiles in our kitchen behind the stove. As you can imagine there are a lot of splashes (meatball sauce explosions 😀 happen) and the grout still looks fantastic. 
Sealers are super important.

Hi you were definitely on to something with the Oxiclean. I used it as a paste and it cleaned my grout back to its ORIGINAL clean white finish. I left it on the grout for about 2hrs.  (my grout was really dirty. we dont think the people that laid the tile sealed it. AND the tile is in the kitchen….thats how dirty it was, the grout is now brown) then i scrubbed it w a brush and went over it with our carpet cleaner that sucks up the dirty water. I only tested the grout around one tile because i didnt want to waste time and money in case it didnt work.  Using it as a thick paste will use alot of product but the results are DEFINITELY worth it.

Sure! I don’t see where I can add the pics and my phone isn’t letting me copy.  Do you have an email address I can send to? I also think one could get even BETTER results if they wet the tile before adding the oxiclean paste.  Letting it sit overnight may be an option too.

Two words… GROUT MAGIC.  There.. I said it.
I bought this product at Floor and Decor tile outlets in my area, and I swear, hands down this product was awesome.  I used it on my basement bathroom floor tile, which was disgustingly filthy when I moved in.  Simply squirt on the liquid and let it sit on the grout for no more than ten minutes, wipe off with a damp sponge, and done! I’d be lying if it didn’t look brand new, but you do need to reseal if you use this product.
You can hear it bubbling up when it activates, and all the gunk gets released.  Not a day to day cleaner for sure, but use for those heavy duty jobs.

Hi Jeff, 
I didn’t read all the responses so maybe someone already suggested this but my mom has a regular cleaning person and she shared this trick. The best thing for stubborn grout stains is Lysol or Chlorox toilet cleaner. It’s great because its a gel so it does a good job of not just running down the drain. It does have the potential for staining effects and health concerns. I’ve used it for the past few years and it works like a charm. If it’s really terrible just put it on the night before and scrub/rinse the next day. We moved into an older home and one shower was seriously hideous. I used the Chlorox one for a while and it only went so far. Then I switched to Lysol and it reacted to this orange layer of some kind of hard water build-up and it disappeared forever more!  Good luck!

I have a Shark steamer that I use for most everything.  I have parrots and chemical cleaners of ANY type are strictly forbidden.  When I moved into my apartment I opened the shower doors to reveal the most funktastic layer of crud I had ever seen in my life.  Seriously, I wasn’t sure if I should attempt cleaning or just cordon off with police caution tape and call it a loss.  Remembering my Nana telling me about the super powers of white vinegar, I grabbed a bottle and filled it with warmed white vinegar and some lemon juice, sprayed onto my tile and grout, let stand for about 10 minutes, and then stormed in with my steamer like it was some sort of battle armor.  I watched as years of someone else’s filth just washed down the drain.  
Parrots can be champion food-flingers.  If it were an Olympic sport, I would be sharing my home with three gold medalists.  There is nothing more pleasant than the sight of pomegranate or fresh beets being flung onto your tan walls and tan carpeting surrounding the cage.  The vinegar/steamer combo has removed the toughest stains from my walls and carpeting…even the ever dreaded papaya skidmark.  Note: do not walk barefooted around a ginormous parrot cage without paying close attention to what you will inevitably step/slide on.

Hey y’all!!!  I just had tile with white grout installed in all of my bedrooms and bathrooms.  I have four cats and two dogs so the carpet had to go.  Anyway, I read somewhere that an enzymatic cleaner applied to the grout line and then covered in Saran Wrap until dry works wonders to bring back the white.  And thankfully, it works!!!  I have to sometimes reapply the cleaner and Saran but usually within 24 hours, the stain is gone.  And there is ZERO elbow grease used.  I’ve also had great results with straight vinegar.   This application has worked well with any stain that has come up.

I just wanted to say I would recommend applying a smount of oxyclean directly to the stained area, put a rag that is good and wet over the oxyclean and let sit.  I don’t know how long, how ever long your comfortable waiting as you will have to do small patches at a time.  The longer the better as long as your rag doesn’t dry all the way, then scrub.  I don’t guarantee it will work but I can promise you this-it is the only way to remove chocolate ice cream stains from white clothing so I give it a LOT of credit!

When you regrout your tiles, don’t forget to use grout sealant, it will also make it watertight and and prevent mold and mildew, and what’s not. many homes does not have the grout sealants, and which they should have especially there’s water involved. You can get them at home depot or other hardware stores that sell tiles and supplies.

After seeing the comments I figure I’d just explain and solve all grout discolorjng for everyone. Grout discolor happens because it soaks through the grout all the way through. No cleaner, steam or anything will solve this discoloring when it has soaked through. Options are regrouting, which isn’t that expensive, or a little trick I picked up over the years is to simple rub sandpaper over the grout lines” that’s if it hasn’t soaked through” or you can stain the grout lines by simple using a water base paint, or they have specific paint just for grout. Hope this has helped.

Hey, Jeff!  I just got a tip on how to maintain white grout from a guy in the plumbing department at Home Depot.  I’m not sure how he got there because his history is in tile installation.  He said to mop the floor two times a month with a 50:50 mixture of bleach and water.  And DON’T air dry it.  If u do it more frequently it will yellow the grout.  I tried it and will say that the smell is overwhelming, so opening the windows and making fast work of it is a must.  And it takes a few days for that bleachy smell to dissipate.  Time will tell if it works.

Hey, Jeff, from ultra muggy TN!
The fantastic part about this maintenance ritual is that you DON’T dry the floor.  I consider it soggy after I guess,”swab”, the floor.  I just leave a fan blowing on it and let the mixture soak in and slowly air dry.  It really doesn’t take long.  
I would recommend keeping the pets out.  They wil track the bleach mixture onto your couch or carpet.
The results are like new grout!

I used lime away toilet cleaner and a scrub brush and toothbrush. I put it in the grout lines and let sit till I had all grout filled and started scrubbing with the scrub brush. When I finished scrubbing I let it sit 10 mins. Rinsed and any spot that it didn’t work I repeated with a toothbrush. Works amazing.

I use Chlorox bleach mixed with water in a spray bottle and spray it on the tiles and grout and let it dry. The grout turns white! Last about a month. Nothing else works as well and as cheap. Just vent the room for a few hours. No mask necessary in my case. One part bleach to 5 parts or so of water. Good luck!  Steve

Scrubbing power is often more important than cleanser power. I like for things to be very clean with little chemical presence and with minimal effort. Some brain storming lead me to making a drill scrub brush. I’m sure I’m not the first person to think of this. Total cost was about $2.50. I wouldn’t use bleach with it as it will splatter, but oxy clean worked great. Drill hole in round scrub brush, screw in a bolt and fasten with a lock washer and hex nut. I used a 3/8″. Insert into drill. Destroy grime in one of the manliest ways possible. Laziness is the mother of invention.
My kitchen floor grout is amazing! And it allowed me to do as little work as possible. I’m 9 month pregnant and my little life hack allowed me to clean my entire kitchen floor!

I was wondering if you have put Borax to the test against mildew. I have used it on multiple surfaces including the grout I the shower. I make a paste, scrub it in, and let it sit while I clean the rest of the bathroom. I don’t time the “sitting”, just wipe and do a quick rinse when I get back to the shower. I have grout that is porous instead of the latex or nice smooth stuff in most tile baths. (I feel the wise guy who put this kind of grout – think grout around a pool – needs to be visited by the mildew fairy on a daily basis!)

I read through all the posts and decided to try the vinegar and Dawn ( blue ) method of cleaning my shower tiles. I know I need to reseal them, but I have to clean them first. When you see the photos, please don’t judge…I have 4 boys that play muddy sports and a 70 yr. old claw foot tub with a lot of worn off enamel….I sprayed the mixture and let it set 2 hours as instructed.
 1 cup white vinegar heated for 90 seconds and added it to 1 cup blue dawn in a spray bottle. It really worked well to take the soap residue off the tiles and chrome, not so much on the grout. I scrubbed with a brush and rinsed with hot water. Then as others suggested I used toilet bowl cleaner ( I had Lysol max on hand ) others used clorox. I let that sit 20 minutes, and lightly scrubbed with a brush and rinsed. Pleased with the results, and off to buy the sealer. I will email the photos to Jeff to add, I don’t know how to add them here.

This method reminds me of something Tim Allen would do on his show, Home Improvement, but it worked very well.  Last summer, I had my pressure washer out doing the outside of my house and for some reason I though I might try running a long hose through our bedroom window into the bathroom shower.  With a bathing suit on I started with the lowest setting and worked my way up one step which worked well.  Except for a couple of spots in two corners, it was all gone, no chemicals at all and not much of a mess.  As a caveat, we have epoxy grout which is pretty tough and it was sealed as well.  This might not work for everyone.  Just thought I would throw it out.

In my 10 year plus battle with shower grout the only thing that gets shower grout to look like new is NEW GROUT. Bleach works for awhile (no dilution) but then it starts to yellow the grout. Basically what I’ve learned is that once it’s colored it’s done. Anything you do to try to clean it just destroys it more. Just read on a blog that you’ve got to dry your shower with a towel after each “wetting” to keep new grout looking clean.  Good Luck!

Great site – Thanks everyone! Today I did a side by side comparison of quite a few methods, most recommended, some elsewhere. Lots of mildew, mold, and scum in an old shower with tiled walls, a glass block wall and tiled floor, so lots of grout! Mostly white, except the floor which is beige grout. For my purposes, I wanted something that would work within an hour or less, if possible (impatient? Maybe!). All applied, then used a toothbrush to rub them in (why so many old ones lying around??) 
Rank ordering of the results:
1a Clorox Clean-up (has bleach) –  a spray, quick to work and the whitest, cleanest results. This is weak bleach plus other materials. Odor was not overpowering like straight bleach, but definitely there .
1b Blanco Cleaner (no bleach), it is a stainless steel cleaner and polisher, probably like Bar Keepers Friend, but in liquid form.  This was very close to the Clorox, no bleach smell, easy to apply with a toothbrush and fast acting.
2. Comet cleanser. Also very good, probably due to the bleach and abrasive, but less convenient to apply than the other two. 
3. Stainz-R-Out Grout Spotter  — It has a dabber/scrubber atop the bottle which is supposed to help. But it actually makes it almost impossible to contact the grout due to the shoulders of the glass blocks, especially. When I squeezed some onto the toothbrush and applied it, it was pretty effective, but third place.
4. Sunlight dishwasher powder. Fairly good, but not convenient. 
5. The vinegar & Dawn solution. Much worse than the others. Easy to use, worked fine of soap scum, glass, etc, but very little effect on the mould in the grout. NOt, not Blue Dawn, only had purple!)
6.Same as the above but also added some bicarbonate of soda. This one was the most fun – reminded me of my daughter’s volcano experiment in grad school science project days! Great visual effects, but not so much on the cleaning. 
Hope this helps others! Thanks again!

To get hair dye off anything. As quickly as you see it use peroxide, you can even try after it’s been there a while. If no luck with that get bleach (for bleaching hair). Be careful, wear gloves and make sure you have good ventilation too. I know this was a long time ago but I have a lot of experience with this and thought I would share.

We have just put in a new bathroom complete with tile and grout on the walls because my husband thought it would make for better resale down the road. He put some kind of grout protector in the grout before he layered it. We wipe it down with a squeegee (getting old and it has only been a week!!) each time but my question is what can I use to keep it clean and white that won’t strip any of the good stuff out of the grout? Would the Dawn Vinegar mix work as an every week cleaner? Or is there something not toxic that is better?

Hi,
   I tried everything including the super tile cleaner from Loew’s, but it was with the two cups of powdered Oxiclean in a gallon of hot H2o that did a great job of removing all the darkened soap stains from all the tiles and grout in our shower floor. It took about a two hour time period with intervals of scrubbing with a wooden scrub brush on a pole and rewetting with the mixture about every 15 minutes. It looks as good as it did 5 years ago when it was brand new. Thanks for not only a great solution, but for a solution that really works great.

Hi, I was looking for tips on how to get shower tile clean but my tiles are on the walls so I couldn’t use your method since such a solution would simply not “sit” on the tiles. However, I wanted to share my method of getting the grout clean in between the tiles.
I mix baking soda with bleach. Ratio about 4:1 so I get a paste. It’s not rocket science, I just mix it until I feel that it’s thick enough not to run off but not too thick to make it difficult to apply. I then cover the grout with it and let it sit overnight, about 24 hours.
I then scrub with a wet small wire brush and it comes out  white.
I have looked for something for a long time and I found this tips on the internet somewhere and figured I’d try it. I was amazed at the result. It’s the only method that has really worked to clean up at least 5 years worth of discoloration.
I also use it on the discolored caulking between the tub and the walls but of course I use a soft brush in that area. It doesn’t come out as good but it’s sure a lot better than before.

Hi, Jeff!
     Love, love,love the help and suggestions!  You have great…commenters!
     I have more of a preventative idea we used for flooring, but could relate to bathroom and kitchen tile.  Years ago I was watching a TV show where they were showcasing a lady’s house in Arizona where the dirt is that beautiful red color.  She had tile floors and the grout she had put in was the exact color of the red dirt.  I never forgot her quote:  “Use grout that is the color of dirt.”  It’s such a time and energy saver!!
     About five years ago we had slate floors put in (real slate, not manufactured…lots of different shades natural colors).  I picked grout that is “the color of dirt,” a medium gray color.  They sealed the floor with an oil-based sealer.  Looks great.  Easy to clean.  Not worried about the gray ever getting darker in some areas because it would blend right in.
     On the other hand, we had epoxy grout put in in our tiled kitchen counters.  We have big tiles with small grout lines.  Even epoxy grout gets dirty because the grout sits the smallest fraction of an inch below the tiles and is not perfectly smooth.  I’m going to try the Oxi Clean and blue Dawn on concoction on the tiles with a brush.  Unfortunately, I didn’t get “grout the color of dirt” because I was told epoxy grout doesn’t stain.  It does, however, get dirty over time.  Thankfully, my tile is a sort of mottled beigy, grayish, pale brownish color, so the dirty grout blends in with the tiles (the tile is prettier than my description).
     Just remember, “grout the color of dirt.”
     P.S.  As an aside, oil-based sealer for a slate floor is more expensive and apparently sold in smaller quantities than water-based sealer, but the end result is worth it.  We compared two 4’x4′ patches on the floor.  The oil-based sealer added a richness and depth to the floor that the water-based sealer couldn’t touch.  I imagine oil based lasts longer, too.
     Thanks again for all you do!

Judie, thank you so much for your comment.
I love the idea of getting a grout color the same as dirt, it would help out a lot with cleaning. 
Thanks also for your suggestion about the oil based sealer. I love oil based products because they are so resilient and last a long time. And a lot of questions come up with regard to slate. So this is perfect.
Keep me posted on your progress 🙂

The miracle I have found to clean grout was a cheap toilet bowl cleaner called The Works . $1.50 a bottle . All the dirt foams up from grout an wipes up. Smell is a bit strong an use gloves.  But I have been amazed.  Please dont try this on fine line grout but the bigger floor tile grout.

Thanks Crystal, I’ve seen other people recommend The Works as well. It’s helped clean their grout as well.
I stayed away from it because of the strong odor, my wife has really bad asthma. The other concern I had was how it would react with the tile.
But there’s no reason not to test it on a small section of tile and grout 🙂

I cleaned stained bathroom floor grout with a stuff brush and a tube of Crest complete ‘extra whitening’ toothpaste. Just added a dollop as needed to grout lines and gave a good scrub.  Immediate results.  Smelled good too.  Try it!

Hi Jeff and everyone who wants to clean their grout,
I also have tried everything on the store shelves that promise to clean my grout including an acid wash.  Needless to say nothing worked enough to make my grout look consistently clean and the same color throughout until one day I was cleaning my stove top with a white magic bar and I thought why not give it a try on my kitchen floor grout.  Here is where the angels sing, the rainbow is above my house and the birds are singing a beautiful song….the magic bar truly worked like magic!   My grout looks brand new.   You will go through quite a few so buy a dozen or more (they are inexpensive and worth it).  Wet the bar and scrub the grout.   I did it in sections and had a clean bucket of water and sponge which I used to wipe off the dirt and whatever chemicals are in the magic bar.   Once the grout dries it looks great.   But you are not done yet.   You must seal your now clean and dry grout with grout sealer.  Home Depot and Lowe’s sell a sealer that comes in a bottle with a brush on the top.    I use a steamer at least once a week to wash my floor and I now only have to deep clean my grout once a year using the process above.

Our 15 month old accidentally got into our pantry cupboard and dropped a jar of lemon juice which broke and spilled all over the floor. We weren’t able to get to it to clean it up for about 20 minutes and when we wiped it up our VERY dirty grout changed to perfectly white. No scrubbing! We only wiped it up with paper towels- and an added bonus is that our kitchen smelled nice and lemony. Now I’m thinking about spilling it purposefully all over the rest of our floor.

I just cleaned a shower we haven’t used in years with baking soda and water mixed into a paste about like peanut butter.  Applied into the grout and let sit for 30-45 mins and then use a wet tooth brush to work paste into grout and rinse. You will need to rinse a few times to remove baking soda. Repeat on tough grout stains as needed. Talk about cheap & non toxic…Merry Christmas

I’m not sure if I should reveal such tricks of the trade, but by now it’s probably already been mentioned. As a professional house cleaner, I use “the works” toilet bowl cleaner to clean showers which have disgusting tile and grout filled with soap scum and mold.  The reason this works is because it uses muriatic acid instead of bleach.  I also have a truck mounted tile and grout cleaner and when we clean tile and grout, we use…guess what…muriatic acid.
It’s the stuff they clean pools with.  We charge between 40 and 22 cents per sq ft so 500 for that lady to get her floors steam cleaned is about average.  But it’s not something you can’t do yourself.  The acid can be combined in a sprayer with equal part water and scrubbed with a stiff bristle brush, but sometimes just pouring it on does the trick.  I’ve splashed it on my skin, it stings but it washed right off.  Never ever try to smell it, but the 50 to 50 water combo takes the edge off to a very tolerable level. Onc the grout is clean you just mop it off.  Doing this in small sections is easy and i don’t even need safety equipment.

Jeff, we been trying a lot of different things to clean the grout but we found this works very well, take a mixture of Baking Soda and add some (hydrogen peroxide) available in the drug store,  to it to make a paste then apply it to the grout, it also cleaned up along the caulk lines and inside the shower door tracks. I used an old toothbrush but you can use some other type of brush. let it set about 5-7 min then scrub with toothbrush and rinse, It worked great, i also used it on my shower doors (we also have hard water) and cleaned them right up.
hope this help others.

Jeff,
My parents has this problem in their shower.  I used two products each one day apart.  they both have a strong odor so maybe do it when your wife is out of the house for the day.  Make sure you have a great deal of ventilation.  There is a product called ZEP if works wonders.  I ordered it from Amazon. spray and leave on and come back in 30 minutes and wipe.  This should clean it all.  If you still have issues get kaboom and spray the following day leave for 30 minutes and the grout should be clean.  After doing all of this hard work be sure to seal the grout after it has dried

As part of my job as House Steward at Chamounix Mansion International Youth Hostel, I do a good part of the housekeeping and supervise the others who do it.  We have had a chronic problem with shower tile grout, and I am interested in trying the Dawn Blue recipe.  Other products and combinations of products throughout the blog on this issue have been tried in the past with so-so results.  One thing that you may want to investigate in your own homes is whether or not you have rust or iron in your water.  We do.  It’s apparant in some places (like clean water outlet around rim of toilet bowl) where you will see pink to orange stains.  Iron/rust is a different ball of wax.  However, on the grout, the usual rust stain removers (Lime Away, for one, which works great on other rust stains) do not work on porous, unsealed grout.  I do not have an answer to the problem, and maybe the Dawn Blue recipe will work.  I just wanted to throw that out there as a possible roadblock to grout getting any cleaner.  If anyone has had experience with this problem and knows of a successful method of tackling, please do tell.  I am bored to tears trying to get that grout clean!  Thanks!

We adopt the grannies’ solutions in Italy, which are eco-friendly and not too expensive as well. Here is one of these alternatives.
* Potato starch  and hydrogen peroxide (phase 1) plus water and white vinegar (phase 2) – The starting paste-mixture is simple and composed three coffee-spoons of starch and one table-wine glass of  hydrogen peroxide. Time after time, get ready as much as paste as you need. Use a teeth-brush to spread generously the mixture on the surface to be cleaned and leave it work for one hour. Then get ready a liquid-mixture with one liter hot water and  one glass vinegar. Use this mixture and a sponge to rinse the surface out. Then rinse the surface again with water and wipe the surface.
P.S.: The vinegar smells a little indeed but this won’t last long -about thirty minutes. Moreover, vinegar is a powerful anti-limescale and somehow disinfectant too.

I have a septic system that I have to keep alive so I can’t use bleach or any other toxic chemical that will kill the bacteria in the system so I had to find something different.  I found pouring coke on the tile/grout shower floor, swooshing it around so it is evenly distributed, and then walking away to do something else for 10 minutes works for me.  When I return to scrub, it’s a quick scrub with a hand brush (not much effort at all) and then rinse it all down the drain.  Good thing is, it doesn’t cost that much to try it and decide for yourself.

I’ve used Pert shampoo and it worked for me, plus it’s not so hazardous on the lungs. Spread the Pert shampoo directly on the tile and grout (don’t dilute it with water), then use a scrub sponge to spread it more evenly and work it in. Cleans up the grout and the tile. I also use it on the faucets, mirrors and our acrylic tub.

Thank you so much for your video, ideas, and all the comments.  Black yucky grout in the shower has been driving me crazy for a while, and I’m going to try several of these ideas and see what works.
Got a good tip from Pinterest for maintenance:  make some of the Dawn/vinegar solution and put it in one of those scrubby dish things (the ones where you put the soap in the handle.)  Keep it in your shower, and each day scrub a small area while you’re in there showering.  I’m not too good at cleaning grout on a regular basis, but I can do a minute or two per day while I’m in there anyway.  Seems like a good way to do upkeep… now if I can just get it “deep cleaned”!

Don’t forget to re-seal your grout after all that hard scrubbing or it will stain faster that it did in the first place and will probably not get as clean the second time around. (Someone may have said this, but I didn’t read all the responses…..) 🙂

I found a perfect solution. 
1. Get a box of Brillo brand soaped steel wool (biodegradable / all natural). Wet one and scrub. For glass, scrub, and then wipe with a damp paper towel. For tile / tub, scrub until you see a grey stain on smoother parts of the tub, then rinse or wipe with paper towel.
2. Get a package of Bon Ami (all natural powder, also Eco-friendly – basically baking soda plus some other minerals). Get a tooth brush for the grout, and a larger brush for the tub. Scrub with the brushes until the stains are out. Rinse
3. Repeat if necessary
This method is completely Eco-friendly and requires a lot less effort when scrubbing than with bleach and other products.

hi everyone.  thank you for all of your super-helpful tips and info.  i, too, try to keep the cleaning products as natural as possible. Last month, however, we were moved out of our apartment and had a nice security deposit depending on the results of the cleaning.  Needless to say, I seriously relaxed my reluctance to use chemical.  I tried all of the usual methods but the shower grout was still nasty in that corner by the faucets and around the fixtures – you know, the parts that never really get totally clean.  What finally worked was the Clorox “Pen” grout cleaner. I worked wonders.  It is easy to apply because you just hold it like a pen and squeeze it on the grout.  It is a thick gel so it stays where you put it, it stays wet, it doesn’t get all over you, and it doesn’t smell – unless you put it right up to your face so don’t do that, ok :).  I put it on and left it for as long as it took me to clean the floor and it wasn’t enough time.  I put on some more and then got distracted and forgot about it so it sat for maybe 90 min or so.and when I came back I just rinsed it with the shower hose and to my suprise and delight the grout was sparkly clean.  It did cost a couple bucks but it did not require any elbow grease and one pen was enough to do most of one wall of my tub shower and it probably could have done more but I really put it on thick.  Sorry if someone already mentioned this, I only read about half of the comments but they were so helpful I wanted to share what worked for me.  Thank you and be well.

Just in case this helps anyone – for the bathroom mirror – after I clean it I use Rain-X anti-fog (it is for the inside of the car windshield.  it comes in a liquid and wipes.  the liquid is easier but the wipes work too).  It keeps the mirror from fogging up from the shower steam which keeps hubby from wiping it “clean” with his hand or towel after he showers so that he can shave.  The mirror stays super clean for a week or so.  Then I windex and rain-x and we’re good to go for another week.  And I get to look like a magical wizard.

If your grout is in tact and just stained, you might want to try the Polyblend Grout Renew Product. You can get it in numerous different colors. It has the color and a sealer in it. My bathroom floor had to be re-grouted due to cracks and crevices but the wrong color was used, so I used this product and it brought the Bright White color back but did not fill in the cracks and crevices as I had hoped. That’s another story. I am going to re-grout the whole floor to fix that. One warning with this stuff is to stay in the grout lines as much as possible and don’t let it dry fully before you get the excess off the tiles themselves. With the sealer in the mix it takes a lot of cleaning to get it off the tiles. It is a good product when used properly and brings back the new look in the grout lines.

I read some of your comments, because I had the same problem.  I tried about everything available on the market, but nothing made the grout spotless, no matter how much I scrubbed. So I decided to try the clothing steamer ????, just the steam without any detergent.  Wow, now the grout looks brand new.  The steam melts and washes away everything.  I will purchase the multipurpose  steamer, because it can be used to clean and disinfect almost everything.  Try it, you will not be disappointed.

After reading all of this, I headed off to the store to buy an assortment of supplies to try these various recipes that might help me clean my grout.  The first mixture I tried was hydrogen peroxide and baking soda, mixed in a ratio that gave me a slightly liquid toothpaste texture.  I COULD NOT BELIEVE HOW WELL THIS WORKED!  I wish I could load the pictures I took to show the results!  I just mixed up a small batch made from these two items, total cost of about 25 cents, and used an old toothbrush to scrub the grout on my bathroom floor.  In a matter of seconds it started working and went from a tan/brown color to almost pristine white.  I wiped it down with a rag soaked in hot water, and that was it.  The tile in my bathroom is the original ceramic tile from when the house was built in 1957; about 4 inch squares.  It will be a tedious task to scrub all of this by hand, but as inexpensive as the homemade cleaner is, and as well as it worked, I will put the time in to do it.  It has made a huge difference.

Mix baking soda with water to make a paste. In a spray bottle mix a cup of white vinegar and a cup of water. Apply the baking soda paste to the grout you want to clean. After you have all the paste on (it doesn’t matter if some gets on the tile) spray on the water/vinegar solution. Put enough on so you can see the baking soda bubbling. Let sit for 15 minutes or so – then use a stiff bristle brush like a large toothbrush and scrub. You will literally see brownish gunk coming off. Scrub all your grout this way – and then wipe down a couple of times with water to get all the baking soda off. You might have to do this twice in some areas. I did two bathrooms and a kitchen this way after having 5 years of renters and the tile and grout look almost new.

my inexperienced 2 cents– sigh.
I live in a “pre-war” NYC studio apartment. translation- old!
with a typical, window-less bathroom.
tile & grout is original.. uh, 1918? white & black, small, amazingly strong but does not look new–
the best cleanser I have ever used- ZERO elbow grease/scrubbing necessary is called KABOOM tile cleaner. cartoon-purple liquid in a spray bottle. truly, ZERO scrubbing necessary. amazing.
sadly, it is scary to use, because, even I, with no history of asthma or lung weakness, get a constricted upper chest and the smell persists for a few days– worrisome. I decided to err on the side of caution and not use it anymore. (so hard to give up the ‘no scrubbing’ though!)
instead, I now use a terrific cleanser already mentioned on this thread, Bar Keeper’s Friend. I buy both the powder and the liquid. it’s not as powerful as some- and it involves more work- both scrubbing and significant rinsing- sigh. but it’s safe and does not smell badly.

If you like over the counter “oxy cleaner”.  Then you should try stain solver.  You can view the videos and information at stainsolver.com.  I’ve used this to remove years of grime on the grout in the kitchen and dining room (and then sealed it).  Sorry no pictures as we lost that house in a tornado in 2013.  But after the tornado immediately ordered to replace it.  It removed mold and blood from carpet and clothes.  Removed mystery stains from the carpet at the place we were renting while rebuilding.  The owner was amazed because she had even paid a professional to come in and clean the carpet.  I have nothing to do with the company, just know that t works.  And is stronger than the OTC brand.

Just tried the Dawn & vinegar approach on my black and white ceramic tile tub/shower.  Never again.  It did hardly anything for the grout, so I made a vinegar & baking soda paste, which helped.  However, I wouldn’t ever attempt this unless you have a way to spray or flood the area.  That little direction, “rinse”, is about impossible when using Dawn.  Vinegar & baking soda are easier to rinse away.

I just tried BKF on the badly yellowed grout lines in my shower and it did a better job than everything else I’ve tried using, including the hot vinegar with Dawn. The original grout was 17 years old when I bought the house and developed the same yellow color a few years later. Getting the grout back to white was impossible so I cut it out and regrouted with some acrylic liquid added that was supposed to keep mildew from growing on the grout. I believe that the acrylic is reacting with something to cause it to yellow because each time I remove the slight yellow hue it returns within a year. I use a mixture of vinegar and borax to clean my tiled showers and floors. One shower that I regrouted the same way hasn’t yellowed a bit yet it’s in the bathroom that has the most cosmetics and personal care products used. The yellowed bath sees little use except as a restroom.
The tile and grout lines in it are squeaky clean so I’m just going to use some grout paint and be done with it.

A friend told me to use oven cleaner. So I purchased the ticket  fumeless  kind. Sprayed a section, let stand 30 min and used a scrubber to clean up the grout. Did great for me.

I used Cascade Liquid Gel. Put Cascade all over the floor of your shower and leave it overnight. The following morning, water your shower using a broom to get rid of the cascade Gel and your tile grout will be white again. Be careful not to use blue or orange cascade gel or any colored one. use the white or transparent one.

For the mildewed grout in our shower tile, I unrolled cotton balls and soaked them in bleach and applied them to the grout. I left them on for hours. It took a while to apply them and I did it in sections but all my grout looks new again! It even worked on the mildewed caulk.

I have used a paste of baking soda and bleach. Using a cheap brush from the Dollar store and an old plastic small container i added baking soda to 1/2 cup liquid bleach making a paste consistency. Brushed it on and let it set for 30 minutes. WOW!!! clean bright white grout again..Try it…

I discovered inadvertently while at a customer’s home, (I do home cleaning for a living), that your best bet on grout if harsh doesn’t bother you,  is to use “The Works” original toilet bowl formula. Get that on the floor or even tile walls, scrub two or three minutes on each area in succession and be sure to rinse as you go. This stuff is very harsh, but it works. On the slightly less unhealthy side I recommend mixing Bar-keepers Friend powder with Simple Green and that solution will really remove almost any dirt, grime, mildew, soap scum or stain at all, besides things like paint or gum or things like that  which are best reserved for “goof off”. Also, if you go the route of “The Works”, avoid getting it on any fixtures for any length of time, as it will discolor and ruin the appearance of them, especially stainless steel.

Thanks Jen for the tips. Yah, the Works is potent. My wife couldn’t take the fumes, hence my experimentation. Thank you 🙂

We recently put in a tile shower and were told by the tile guy (in business for more than 40 years) to ABSOLUTELY NOT USE HARSH CHEMICALS it will break down your grout and it will need to be replaced.  He recommended a quick spray with a vinegar solution and quick wipe down after each use.  I use 50/50 white vinegar and water with a couple droppers of lemon essential oil.  The smell goes away in no time.

Jeff,  I found your site while looking for an answer on how to clean some dirty commercial ceramic tile.  
This time of year I often help my brother out by cleaning the floors at some of the many commercial accounts in which his company provides service for. He recently mentioned he could not get the ceramic tile at one of his accounts to come perfectly clean.  
I also have recently been testing oxy clean on a number of different hard surfaces, although I never had tried it for cleaning ceramic tile and grouting.  I have also has some luck with this product on some other surfaces, so I think I should give it a try with one minor change.
  I own a window cleaning and soft washing company and  use what is called deionized water to clean and rinse glass.  I think this water could help you and possibly my brother yield perfect results when cleaning ceramic tile.  
In my industry the water is used to avoid having to squeegee the glass while still providing perfect spotless results.  I know it sounds too good to be true.  But it most definitely is not.  Me being the curious type, I wanted to know why it worked.  After doing some reading about D.I. water online and talking with an expert on D.I. water I think I have the answer.  In a nutshell, and the way I understand it is, the D.I. water helps release a molecular  bond between the dirt and the surface in which you are cleaning it from.  I know this water  is harder for someone who is not from my industry to come by, so this week when I help my brother clean the problem ceramic tile at one of his accounts, I will test the D.I. water with the oxy clean in conjuction with a hot water extraction unit.  In theory the extraction unit will spray the tile with a light pressure and mimic the light scrubbing.  I will let you know how it fairs.

Jeff, the results from my testing are as follows.  It appears that when I did a test of D.I. water, D.I. water and dish soap, and D.I. water with oxy clean that the D.I water alone had descent results but when combined with oxyclean it had near perfect results.  This was some rearly old and hard to clean tile. I attempted to leave a url but I believe it was removed. If you are interested in the pictures that clearly show the results please don’t hesitate to ask.

Hi Jeff, just stumbled across your blog. I run a sorority – 47 active young ladies use our showers on a daily basis. Dirty, discolored grout is definitely an issue! About two years ago, I discovered the power of Oxi Clean and you’re right, there’s a trick to it. I’ve found that if you dampen the floor slightly then sprinkle straight Oxi on it (being sure to cover the grout with a nice layer), spray a little water over it so that it becomes damp and pasty all over, then wait overnight and scrub with a stiff brush even the worst stains will come out.

Wow! Never have seen so many “remedies” for cleaning tile and grout in showers and bath rooms! Be aware that both tile and grout are porous and absorb water. For tile and grout we spray Fantastic on a section, leave it for 10 seconds and use a nylon brush to scrub the area…do a section at a time. Then just wipe down with paper toweling..no rinsing after. Mold on grout is a fungus and has roots that are below the visual surface. Get a tile grout brush, sized for the job. Mix up Clorox according to directions. Use a floor fan to ventilate, and a window exhaust fan if necessary. Scrub grout with this solution. Wait 5 minutes. Then, using a larger nylon brush, go over the section and rinse with a damp sponge.
If no improvement is made you can buy  a Dremel tool and get a carbide tapered bit with a 1/16″ tip and remove 1/16″ of the stained grout surface area. Wear hearing protection and a dust mask. Then regrout with an epoxy formulated  type. Then, get a good sealer and apply to the tile and the grout. You want to make sure that where the tile walls of a shower meet the floor to use a waterproof grout that will NOT crack. I use GE II silicone on that perimeter and it will NOT get mildew for 10 years according to GE. So, epoxy grout on the shower floor and the GE on the perimeter. On the walls, if you regrout, you can use Red Devil premixed tile grout that is excellent as it is a very fine sand type. Seal regrouted  areas. The Spray and Forget product is good and you can mix up that for maintainence to control shower mildew. That’s about all I can say; hope it helps.

I know this seems weird, but Clorox Toilet Bowl Cleaner with Bleach. use the handy angled head to lightly fill the grout, wait 5 to 10 min and rinse with water. you can wipe vigourously with a washcloth if needed…but I’ve done my entire house and haven’t had to “scrub” too many areas.  If you do this on tile that doesn’t have an easy rinse availablility, use a damp washcloth to wipe up.

yep, the mixture of 1 cup blue Dawn dish soap and 1 cup vinegar worked on the tile for me and the glass is sparkling. BUT, how does one get rid of the heavy, heavy thick amount of soap afterwards? I would have liked to have had a power washer in there to help….say, how would a power washer be on the tile?:)

 Jeff Patterson says: 

			July 12, 2017 at 4:46 AM 
Wouldn’t recommend a powerwasher inside the house. It’ll get messy and there’s no way to know if the subfloor is waterproofed, e.g. with DITRA. Heavy rinsing the old fashioned way with a bucket of water would be a good option.
Have you tried Softscrub? It’s also a good option.

Hi Jeff – I have light grey colored grout in my shower area (walls and floor).  I tried to read through all the comments but there are a lot!  Do you know if OxiClean would strip the color?  I know I can do a test spot first, but wondering if you have used it on colored grout.
Thanks
