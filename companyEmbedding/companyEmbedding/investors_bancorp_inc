SHORT HILLS, N.J., July 27, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Investors Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ:    ISBC) ("Company"), the holding company for Investors Bank ("Bank"), reported net income of $39.6 million, or  $0.14 per diluted share, for the three months ended June 30, 2017, compared to $46.0 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, for the three months ended March 31, 2017, and $45.1 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, for the three months ended June 30, 2016.  








For the six months ended June 30, 2017, net income totaled $85.7 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, compared to $89.8 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, for the six months ended June 30, 2016. 
Kevin Cummings, President and CEO commented, "Our core business remains strong, however, this quarter's results were impacted by a $7.2 million increase in professional fees primarily related to BSA/AML remediation efforts.  Resolving these matters continues to be a top priority."  
Mr. Cummings continued, "We continue to grow and diversify our loan portfolio and were pleased with deposit growth, which helped to improve our loan to deposit ratio." Mr Cummings also commented on the quarter's increase in non-accrual loans, "Over 50% of the increase in non-accrual loans is attributed to a previously disclosed $48 million single relationship that is well-secured."
The Company also announced today that its Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.08 per share to be paid on August 25, 2017 for stockholders of record as of August 10, 2017.
Performance Highlights

Total assets increased $427.4 million, or 1.8%, to $24.32 billion at June 30, 2017, from $23.89 billion at March 31, 2017. 
Net loans increased $359.9 million, or 1.9%, to $19.62 billion at June 30, 2017 from $19.26 billion at March 31, 2017. During the three months ended June 30, 2017, we originated $962.4 million in loans. 
Total deposits increased $666.0 million, or 4.3%, from $15.38 billion at March 31, 2017 to $16.04 billion at June 30, 2017. Core deposits (savings, checking and money market) represented approximately 80% of total deposits as of June 30, 2017 compared to 78% at June 30, 2016. 
Net interest income for the three months ended June 30, 2017 was $167.1 million, a 6.2% increase compared to the three months ended June 30, 2016. 
During the three months ended June 30, 2017, the Company repurchased 1.8 million shares of its outstanding common stock for approximately $24.6 million. As of June 30, 2017, the Company had approximately 20 million shares remaining under its current repurchase plan. 


Financial Performance Overview - Second Quarter 2017
For the second quarter of 2017, net income totaled $39.6 million, a decrease of $6.4 million as compared to the first quarter of 2017 and a decrease of $5.5 million as compared to the second quarter of 2016.  The changes in net income on both a sequential and year over year quarter basis are highlighted below.
The net interest margin decreased 8 basis points to 2.87% for the three months ended June 30, 2017 from 2.95% for the three months ended March 31, 2017, primarily driven by increased deposit and borrowing costs. Net interest margin in the first quarter of 2017 included a TruPS security liquidation which positively impacted the first quarter margin by approximately 3 basis points.
Net interest income was consistent with the first quarter of 2017.  Changes within interest income and expense categories are as follows:

An increase in total interest expense of $5.5 million primarily attributable to rising deposit and borrowing costs, as well as an increase in the average balance of total interest-bearing liabilities of $536.1 million, or 3.0% to $18.43 billion. The weighted average cost of interest-bearing liabilities for the three months ended June 30, 2017 increased 9 basis points to 1.05%. 
An increase in interest and dividend income of $5.4 million, or 2.6%, to $215.5 million as compared to the first quarter of 2017 primarily attributed to commercial loan growth, as well as a 3 basis point increase of the weighted average loan yield to 3.98%, primarily driven by higher average yields on new loan origination volume, partially offset by the increase in non-accrual loans. 
Prepayment penalties, which are included in interest income, totaled $3.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017 as compared to $3.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017.

On a year over year basis, net interest income increased by $9.8 million, or 6.2%, in the second quarter of 2017, as compared to the second quarter of 2016 due to:

An increase in interest and dividend income of $20.5 million, or 10.5%, to $215.5 million as a result of a $2.23 billion increase in the average balance of net loans from continued loan origination growth, partially offset by the weighted average yield on net loans decreasing 12 basis points to 3.98% with prepayment penalty declines and the impact of the increase in non-accrual loans. 
Prepayment penalties, which are included in interest income, totaled $3.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017, as compared to $5.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016. 
An increase in total interest expense of $10.8 million was primarily attributed to an increase in the average balance of total borrowed funds of $1.37 billion, or 38.0%, to $4.98 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits of $1.05 billion, or 8.4%, to $13.45 billion. The weighted average cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 11 basis points to 1.05% for the three months ended June 30, 2017.

The net interest margin decreased 17 basis points year over year to 2.87% for the three months ended June 30, 2017 from 3.04% for the three months ended June 30, 2016 with approximately 5 basis points of the decrease being driven by lower prepayment penalties. 
Total non-interest income decreased by $383,000 to $9.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017 primarily driven by a decrease in gain on securities transactions of $1.2 million, partially offset by an increase in income on bank owned life insurance of $441,000.  
Compared to the second quarter of 2016, total non-interest income decreased $2.1 million primarily driven by a decrease in gain on securities transactions of $1.6 million. 
Total non-interest expenses were $106.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017, an increase of $6.7 million, or 6.7%, as compared to the first quarter of 2017.  For the three months ended June 30, 2017, professional fees increased $7.2 million, largely attributable to our bank secrecy act and anti-money laundering ("BSA") remediation efforts.  Excluding the impact of BSA-related professional fees, non-interest expenses totaled $96.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017 compared to $96.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017.  Advertising and promotional expenses increased $2.4 million due to our current advertising campaigns.  These increases were partially offset by compensation and fringe benefits which decreased $3.4 million due to lower incentive and pension accruals in the second quarter of 2017 as compared to the first quarter of 2017 as well as lower medical costs.  
Compared to the second quarter of 2016, total non-interest expenses increased $15.3 million, or 16.8%, year over year. For the three months ended June 30, 2017, professional fees increased $9.8 million largely attributable to our BSA remediation efforts. Excluding the impact of BSA-related professional fees, non-interest expenses increased 6.3% for the three months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2016. Additionally, advertising and promotional expenses increased $2.1 million due to our current advertising campaigns.  
Income tax expense was $24.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017, $27.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and $27.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016.
Financial Performance Overview - Six Months of 2017 
Net income decreased by $4.2 million year over year to $85.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017.  The change in net income year over year is the result of the following:
Net interest income increased by $22.3 million, or 7.2%, as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2016 due to:

Total interest and dividend income increased by $38.5 million, or 10.0%, to $425.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017 as compared to the six months of 2016, primarily attributed to growth in the commercial loan portfolio. This increase was partially offset by a 15 basis point decrease of the weighted average loan yield to 3.96% impacted partially by the decrease in prepayment penalties. 
Prepayment penalties, which are included in interest income, totaled $6.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017, as compared to $10.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016. 
Total interest expense increased by $16.2 million, or 21.6%, to $91.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017, as compared to the six months of 2016. The increase was primarily attributed to an increase in the average balance of total interest-bearing liabilities of $2.33 billion, or 14.7%, to $18.16 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2017. In addition, the weighted average cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 6 basis points to 1.01% for the six months ended June 30, 2017.

The net interest margin decreased 14 basis points to 2.91% for the six months ended June 30, 2017 from 3.05% for the six months ended June 30, 2016, with approximately 4 basis points of the decrease being driven by lower prepayment penalties. 
Total non-interest income was $19.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017, a decrease of $1.2 million, or 5.7%, as compared to the six months of 2016 primarily driven by a decrease of $1.8 million in gain on securities transactions for the six months ended June 30, 2017. 
Total non-interest expenses were $205.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017, an increase of $27.7 million, or 15.5%, as compared to the six months of 2016.  Professional fees increased $13.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017 as compared to the six months of 2016, largely attributable to BSA  remediation efforts and the continued risk management infrastructure enhancements.  Excluding the impact of BSA-related professional fees, total non-interest expenses totaled $193.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017.  Compensation and fringe benefits increased $5.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017 as a result of additions to our staff to support continued growth and infrastructure, especially in our risk management area, as well as normal merit increases, partially offset by lower incentive and pension accruals in the second quarter of 2017 as well as lower medical costs.  Advertising and promotional expenses increased $2.5 million due to our current advertising campaigns.  Federal insurance premiums increased $2.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017.  
Income tax expense was $51.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to $54.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016.  
Asset Quality
Our provision for loan losses was $6.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017, compared to $4.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and $5.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016.  For the three months ended June 30, 2017, net charge-offs were $6.9 million compared to $1.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and $1.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016.  Our provision for loan losses was $10.0 million for both the six months ended June 30, 2017 and the six months ended June 30, 2016.  For the six months ended June 30, 2017, net charge-offs were $8.3 million compared to $8.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016.
Our provision for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2017 is primarily a result of continued organic growth in the loan portfolio, specifically the multi-family, commercial real estate and commercial and industrial portfolios; the inherent credit risk in our overall portfolio, particularly the credit risk associated with commercial real estate lending and commercial and industrial lending; and the level of non-accrual loans and charge-offs.
Our accruing past due loans and non-accrual loans discussed below exclude certain purchased credit impaired ("PCI") loans, primarily consisting of loans recorded in the Company's acquisitions.  Under U.S. GAAP, the PCI loans (acquired at a discount that is due, in part, to credit quality) are not subject to delinquency classification in the same manner as loans originated by the Bank.
Total non-accrual loans increased to $177.4 million, or 0.89% of total loans, at June 30, 2017 compared to $87.1 million, or 0.45% of total loans, at March 31, 2017 and $94.3 million, or 0.50% of total loans, at December 31, 2016.  Of the $90.3 million increase, 85% of this increase was driven by three commercial relationships.  Approximately $48.1 million of the increase was attributed to a single relationship that is well-secured, which was previously disclosed as a potential problem loan.  We continue to proactively and diligently resolve our troubled loans.
At June 30, 2017, there were $47.9 million of loans deemed as troubled debt restructured loans ("TDRs"), of which $27.2 million were residential and consumer loans, $18.9 million were commercial real estate loans, $1.6 million were commercial and industrial loans and $243,000 were multi-family loans.  TDRs of $11.7 million were classified as accruing and $36.2 million were classified as non-accrual at June 30, 2017. 
The following table sets forth non-accrual loans and accruing past due loans (excluding PCI loans and loans held for sale) on the dates indicated as well as certain asset quality ratios.

During the six months ended June 30, 2017, we originated $814.1 million in multi-family loans, $471.9 million in commercial real estate loans, $328.2 million in commercial and industrial loans, $231.8 million in residential loans, $210.4 million in construction loans and $64.8 million in consumer and other loans.  This increase in loans reflects our continued focus on generating multi-family loans, commercial real estate loans and commercial and industrial loans, which was partially offset by pay downs and payoffs of loans.  Our loans are primarily on properties and businesses located in New Jersey and New York.
In addition to the loans originated for our portfolio, our mortgage subsidiary, Investors Home Mortgage Co., originated residential mortgage loans for sale to third parties totaling $83.4 million during the six months ended June 30, 2017.
The allowance for loan losses increased by $1.7 million to $230.0 million at June 30, 2017 from $228.4 million at December 31, 2016.  The increase in our allowance for loan losses is due to the growth of the loan portfolio and the credit risk in our overall portfolio, particularly the inherent credit risk associated with commercial real estate lending as well as commercial and industrial loans, and the level of non-accrual loans and charge-offs.  Future increases in the allowance for loan losses may be necessary based on the growth and composition of the loan portfolio, the level of loan delinquency and the economic conditions in our lending area.  At June 30, 2017, our allowance for loan losses as a percent of total loans was 1.16%.
Securities increased by $83.6 million, or 2.4%, to $3.50 billion at June 30, 2017 from $3.42 billion at December 31, 2016.  This increase was a result of purchases partially offset by paydowns and sales.  
Deposits increased by $761.2 million, or 5.0%, from $15.28 billion at December 31, 2016 to $16.04 billion at June 30, 2017.  Checking accounts increased $406.0 million to $6.50 billion at June 30, 2017 from $6.09 billion at December 31, 2016.  Core deposits (savings, checking and money market) represented approximately 80% of our total deposit portfolio at June 30, 2017. 
Borrowed funds increased by $336.1 million, or 7.4%, to $4.88 billion at June 30, 2017 from $4.55 billion at December 31, 2016 to help fund the continued growth of the loan portfolio.  
Stockholders' equity increased by $31.7 million to $3.15 billion at June 30, 2017 from $3.12 billion at December 31, 2016.  The increase is primarily attributed to net income of $85.7 million and share-based plan costs of $17.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017.  These increases were partially offset by cash dividends of $0.16 per share totaling $49.6 million and the repurchase of 1.9 million shares of common stock for $24.6 million during the six months ended June 30, 2017.  The Company remains significantly above FDIC "well capitalized" standards, with Tier 1 Leverage Ratio of 11.57% at June 30, 2017.

Forward Looking Statements
Certain statements contained herein are "forward looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  Such forward looking statements may be identified by reference to a future period or periods, or by the use of forward looking terminology, such as "may," "will," "believe," "expect," "estimate," "anticipate," "continue," or similar terms or variations on those terms, or the negative of those terms.  Forward looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, as described in the "Risk Factors" disclosures included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, as supplemented in quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, including, but not limited to, those related to the real estate and economic environment, particularly in the market areas in which the Company operates, competitive products and pricing, fiscal and monetary policies of the U.S. Government, changes in government regulations affecting financial institutions, including regulatory fees and capital requirements, changes in prevailing interest rates, acquisitions and the integration of acquired businesses, credit risk management, asset-liability management, the financial and securities markets and the availability of and costs associated with sources of liquidity.
The Company wishes to caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward looking statements, which speak only as of the date made.  The Company wishes to advise readers that the factors listed above could affect the Company's financial performance and could cause the Company's actual results for future periods to differ materially from any opinions or statements expressed with respect to future periods in any current statements.  The Company does not undertake and specifically declines any obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions that may be made to any forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We believe that providing certain non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with information useful in understanding our financial performance, our performance trends and financial position.  We utilize these measures for internal planning and forecasting purposes.  We believe that our presentation and discussion, together with the accompanying reconciliations, provides a complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business and allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to management.  These non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for GAAP basis measures and results, and we strongly encourage investors to review our consolidated financial statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.  Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names.

BUCYRUS, Ohio, July 28, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Community Investors Bancorp, Inc. (OTC-PINK: CIBN), parent company of First Federal Community Bank of Bucyrus, reported net income of $461,000 or $.58 per common share for the year ended June 30, 2017, representing a decrease of $440,000 (48.8%), compared to the net earnings of $901,000, or $1.13 per common share reported for the year ended June 30, 2016. The decrease in earnings reflects an increase in general, administrative and other expenses (SGA) of $285,000 (5.5%). SGA expenses increased due to increases in technology consulting, core processing, salaries and wages and professional expenses. Other income saw a small drop for the year, although the quarter ended June 30, 2017 reflected recovery of loan volumes in the secondary market as well as improved gains-net of loan originator commissions. Provision for loan loss increased by $290,000 (68.7%) reflecting final resolution of three large compromised loan relationships recognized during the fiscal year. Net interest income remained relatively unchanged, but an increase in the cost of funds resulted in a slight reduction of $31,000 (.6%).








Community Investors Bancorp, Inc. reported total assets at June 30, 2017, of $143.3 million (increase of $3.0 million or 2.1% from June 30, 2016) including gross loans of $107.0 million (increase of $1.2 million or 1.1% from June 30, 2016). Investments decreased by $.4 million (2.8%), while the allowance for loan loss decreased by $170,000 (12.6%) since June 30, 2016. Total assets classified as nonaccrual were $1.7 million compared to $2.8 million at June 30, 2016. Deposits increased by $8.7 million (9.6%) from June 30, 2016. Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings decreased by $5.5 million (15.6%). Total liabilities were $130.8 million for an increase of $2.8 million (2.2%) from June 30, 2016). Total stockholders' equity increased by $158,000 to $12.5 million. Book value per share is at $15.67 per share.   
The past year was disappointing. Our loan losses were increased by the frustrating, extended process of recovering real estate loan collateral which deteriorated as we were forced to wait on the process. Our SGA expenses climbed as we contended with increased regulations, required cybersecurity vigilance, technology improvements as well as increased loan administration and collection efforts. Going into the new fiscal year, we have reduced classified assets by more than $2.1 million over the prior year. Though challenges remain, our increased collection and credit monitoring have reduced our 30-89 days past due loans by more than $1.2 million compared to June 30, 2016, to the lowest level in more than 10 years. We are encouraged by improving local economic conditions even as we plan to focus more resources on the vibrant economy in and around our Marysville location. We plan to expand our mortgage loan origination operations and derive better efficiencies within that segment of our non-interest income. Finally, our management team has identified specific expenses which we expect to reduce in the next year as we continue to review our operations for potential increased efficiencies. However, we will not compromise safety, service or regulatory compliance. Although it will take some lead time to see the results of our efforts, the quarter ended June 30, 2017 reflected a small decrease in SGA expenses relative to the quarter ended June 30, 2016. Non-interest income for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 also improved by $118,000 from the quarter ended June 30, 2016. The Bank's goals are challenging but achievable in the upcoming months and years. We are confident that we will meet the challenges to achieve success for our shareholders, employees, customers and community.

BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
