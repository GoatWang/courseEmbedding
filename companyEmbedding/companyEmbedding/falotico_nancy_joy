 Revelation is a 24-week Joy of Living Bible study course that explores the depths of Revelation verse-by-verse and brings to life the mysteries of this highly symbolic book. In some ways the scariest book in the Bible, Revelation is also one of the most comforting, reassuring, and exhilarating books. It is vibrant, alive and profoundly applicable to the times in which we live. Joy of Living courses are suitable for both formal and informal meetings, as well as for personal study. Each lesson contains a commentary and a weeks worth of personal application and study questions, leading readers to discover fresh insights into Gods Word. Historical background and maps are included.

Our ladies Bible Study is now doing the Joy of Living Hebrews study, which is equally fantastic!  Great commentary with each unit/chapter, & great questions which force you to dig deeper.

Cookon August 28, 2014Format: Spiral-bound|Verified PurchaseWe are just now starting this study, but I do want to make others aware that you should order all your books at one time from one supplier, and make sure they are all from the same printing.  Most of my friends have a 4th printing and I got stuck with a 2nd printing.  Which means when I say which paragraph I am talking about, it does not always match up with their books.Read more0Comment|

Seeking Him










Few of us experience the joy of personal revival. Our time spent with God is short and hurried, and we miss out on the intimacy He desires. To change this, we need to seek the Lord for contagious revival that begins in us and spreads to others. In Seeking Him, Nancy Leigh DeMoss and Tim Grissom show believers how to deepen their relationship with the Lord and enjoy a dynamic, intimate walk with Him.

Commentary by Nancy J. Collins. Study questions by Kathy Rowland.
Following 1 & 2 Samuel, 1 Kings continues the history of Israel’s monarchy in light of God’s covenants. During the period of 1 Kings, the kingdom of Israel was divided between Israel in the north and Judah to the south. There were evil rulers such as Ahab and Jezebel…
read more
…and godly rulers such as Solomon and Jehoshaphat. Many prophets were sent by God to Israel during this period, notably Elijah. In spite of Judah’s failure to serve the Lord wholeheartedly, and of Israel’s kings to serve Him at all, we will see God continue to carry out His covenant plan for His people.

Commentary by Nancy J. Collins, study questions by Kathy Rowland
The book of 1 Samuel covers a period of about 115 years, and is a pivotal point in the history of Israel. The long period of the rule of the judges ended under the prophet Samuel, and royal history began with the anointing of Saul and later David.
read more
The history and lessons of this book are presented to us in the form of biography of Samuel’s, Saul’s and David’s early years. As with other books of the Bible, 1 Samuel records man’s failure and God’s faithfulness. Within its pages we see God’s long-suffering with those in rebellion against Him, and we see what God can do in and through those who are committed to serving Him.

Commentary by Nancy J. Collins, study questions by Kathy Rowland
Second Samuel continues the narrative begun in 1 Samuel, with David being acclaimed king in Israel. He makes Jerusalem his royal city and brings the Ark of the Lord there. We see the glory and success of David’s reign, as well as his weaknesses and failures.
read more
Within the pages of 2 Samuel God uncovers David’s humanity. You will discover that this “man after God’s own heart” (see Acts 13:22) was a sinful human, like us all, who had to depend on God’s mercy and faithfulness.

Each lesson contains historical background, commentary, and a week’s worth of personal application questions, leading readers to discover fresh insights into God’s Word.
Nehemiah takes place almost 100 years after many Jews had returned to Jerusalem from captivity in Babylon. They had restored the temple under the leadership of Ezra, but could not rebuild the rest of Jerusalem because their enemies made it impossible.
read more
Nehemiah held a high position in the king’s court in Persia, but he could not forget his people, Israel. With the king’s permission and authority, Nehemiah returned to Jerusalem to rebuild the city. At first glance Nehemiah seems to be merely the story of the rebuilding of the walls of Jerusalem, but a closer look reveals the story of God’s faithfulness to His people and His ability to restore not only a wall, but people to a place of blessing. The message of Nehemiah is one of hope and restoration.

The book of Psalms for the most part is a book of prayer and praise. It is a collection of independent pieces of many kinds, written by King David and many other authors over the course of centuries.

The Psalms are impassioned and vivid poetry; among them are prayers of both individuals and the community, praise for God’s saving help, hymns in praise of God’s majesty, and confessions of confidence in God’s care. We learn much about God and our relationship to Him, and we find prophetic references to our Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, written many years before He came to earth.
