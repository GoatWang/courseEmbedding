Article excerpt

The names are as familiar by now as those of tennis stars: Dennis
Kozlowski, former chief executive officer of Tyco International;
Richard Scrushy, former boss of HealthSouth; and Bernard Ebbers,
former CEO of WorldCom.
All are on trial for corporate crimes, getting news coverage each
day, and prompting a few serious questions: Have American business
leaders lost their moral compass? Were too few taught the Ten
Commandments? Did parents and firms forget to teach ethics rules -
or are executives simply targets of greater scrutiny?
Scandals have tripped up so many companies it's hard to keep
track of them - from banks (Citigroup, Bank of America, Riggs) to
mutual funds (Putnam, Janus Capital Group, Alliance Capital
Management, and others). Mutual funds have paid more than $2.5
billion to settle charges. Marsh & McLennan Cos., a huge insurance
broker, agreed last week to pay $850 million to avoid going to trial
for fraud. If the annual revenues of companies tainted by scandal
were assembled into a gross corruption product, it would top $1
trillion. "We have been through a tsunami in terms of ethics," says
Keith Darcy, head of the Ethics Officer Association in Waltham,
Mass.
Why so many business people got caught up in illegal practices
remains something of a mystery. Some experts in business ethics say
the problem has always been there.
"People are people and human nature is human nature," says David
Gebler, president of Working Values Ltd. in Sharon, Mass. "I don't
think the level of personal integrity is higher or lower than it
ever has been."
Nonetheless, experts point to some factors that may have thrown
temptation in the path of company officials, causing business
scandal to spread. For example:
* The combination of corporate stock options and a stock-market
boom in the late 1990s prompted a wave of get-rich-quick thinking,
stimulating avarice.
* The media and Wall Street have painted CEOs as heroes or bums,
depending on how their companies' stock has performed. This has
pressured many CEOs to overemphasize regular earnings growth to
please shareholders, while distorting accounting and paying
insufficient attention to other corporate stakeholders, such as
employees and customers. The cult of personality can also leave some
CEOs with a sense of being invulnerable, even if they misbehave.
"There are huge relentless pressures," says Martin Taylor, vice
president of the Institute for Global Ethics in Camden, Maine.
* Top executives have become too separated from the rank and
file, with poor communication between these groups. …

David Francis






Leader: Creating Commissioned CommunitiesMost Bible study groups become inwardly focused over time, so they must be intentional about focusing outward. In this third book of the "3 Roles" series, David Francis, Allan Taylor, and Ken Braddy discuss outreach and evangelism-what may be the most neglected aspects of the role of a group leader. In 48 information-packed pages, the authors look at practices, principles, and perspectives that are foundational for a group to establish, reestablish, or maintain a focus on outreach and evangelism. How To Get Your Copy and Training MaterialsPrint Version $2ebook FREEPDF Download FREELeader Supplement (ZIP file)Spanish PDF Download FREEThe Leader Supplement ZIP file listed above was developed to help church leaders train Bible study leaders in their church.The following items are included in the free Leader Supplement:PDF version of Leader:Creating Commissioned CommunitiesConference plans for conducting training with leaders of all ages and by age-groupingHandouts to support selected conference plansPresentations that support the conference plansConversation points for initiating informal dialogue about key ideas from the bookBackgrounds for creating your own presentations and digital announcementsClip Art to create announcements and other promotional resourcesPlease consult your computer user documentation on the best method for extracting these files.

Francis David  Guilty of Innovation 




Francis David  Guilty of Innovation

Based on information in Unitarian Universalism: A Narrative History by David E. Bumbaugh (Chicago: Meadville Lombard Theological School Press, 2000). 
Note: David is pronounced, "Da-VEED."
For a short time, religious toleration was the rule of the land in 16th-century Transylvania. When his mother died, the newly crowned King John Sigismund found himself ruling a country divided religiously among Roman Catholics, Calvinists and Lutherans. Among the king's advisors were George Biandrata, a Polish physician and skilled politician, and court preacher David Ferencz, known in the west as Francis David.  
In the heady times of the 16th century, Christian doctrine was the subject of great debate. King John Sigismund, realizing there was no possibility of compromise among the various interpreters of proper doctrine, issued an edict that each person was free to support their chosen understanding of Christian doctrine. The edict allowed advisor Biandrata, and court preacher David, both members of the Reformed (Calvinist) tradition, to begin to explore questions concerning the doctrine of the Trinity and the deity of Jesus. Their exploration and unorthodox interpretations of Christian doctrine caused considerable concern among other members of the Reformed clergy. 
In those days, doctrinal matters in Transylvania were fully aired by convening a formal debate. King John Sigismund scheduled such an event for March 3, 1568. He invited believers in the "Unity of God" position to debate the Trinitarians. The debate lasted ten days, beginning at 5 a.m. each day. Francis David represented the Unitarian position and relied on scripture to buttress his arguments. At the conclusion of the debate, David's arguments were seen as stronger, and many in Transylvania embraced Unitarianism. A second debate the following year led the King to declare that he himself was Unitarian and there should be religious toleration in the land. By 1571, Unitarianism was given legal recognition in what would turn out to be King John Sigismund's last public act. He died two months later as a result of an accident, and left no heir to the throne. 
John Sigismund was succeeded by a Catholic named Stephen Bathori, who dismissed most of the Unitarians at court, while retaining Biandrata as one of his advisors. Stephen Bathori reaffirmed a policy of toleration for those Christian religions named in the 1571 decree, but declared that he would not allow any further religious innovation.
Unitarianism gained more converts in Transylvania during that period, despite the prohibition against doctrinal changes, and an ecclesiastical organization was developed. By 1577, restrictions were placed on Unitarians, but the organization continued to thrive. Francis David, by now the Unitarian Bishop, was still driven toward reform of doctrine rather than development of church organization. He explored questions having to do with the doctrine of the Lord's Supper, infant baptism, predestination and the worship of Jesus, questioning doctrine in all four areas. Biandrata, more concerned with the health of the church than with matters of doctrine, urged David to keep silent. But this was not Francis David's way.
Francis David began to preach his heretical ideas from the pulpit. Biandrata, concerned for the survival of the
Unitarian Church
, reported David's activities to the ruler. David continued to preach after the Prince ordered him to stop, and Francis David was arrested and tried for the crime of "innovation," questioning and challenging religious doctrine. The prosecutor at trial was Giorgio Biandrata, who dissembled when asked about his own earlier involvement in questioning religious doctrine. Francis David was found guilty of innovation and condemned to prison for the remainder of his life. He died in the royal dungeon in the castle at Deva on November 15, 1579. Biandrata went on to push the Unitarian church toward more conservative theological positions. By the time he died in 1588, very little remained of his former influence in the Transylvanian Unitarian movement. The
Unitarian Church
 itself was forced into a position of doctrinal stagnation that lasted more than 200 years.
