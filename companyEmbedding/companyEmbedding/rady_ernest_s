Philanthropists Evelyn and Ernest Rady Commit $100 Million to Benefit the Rady School of Management at UC San Diego

Commitment recognizes school’s growing recognition, impact on technology entrepreneurship and economic development
The Rady Family Foundation has made a $100 million commitment to help recruit and retain faculty and fund strategic priorities at the Rady School of Management at UC San Diego. More than 200 Rady School supporters, alumni, students and business leaders attended a press conference Tuesday at the Rady School’s J.R. Beyster auditorium and a reception following the announcement. UC San Diego Chancellor Pradeep K. Khosla, Rady School Dean Robert S. Sullivan, philanthropist Ernest Rady and distinguished Rady School alumni Ashley Van Zeeland and Pierre Sleiman, and patient advocate Gay Grossman all spoke at the event.
With a $30 million lead gift in 2004, Evelyn and Ernest Rady and the Rady Family Foundation helped establish the Rady School of Management, UC San Diego’s world-class, entrepreneurial business school. They also contributed $5 million toward the expansion of the business school’s campus, and gave other significant gifts to ensure excellence at the school.

“What a magnificent first 10 years—and the school is just getting started,” said Ernest Rady. “Dean Sullivan and other leaders within the community held a vision of a business school in a symbiotic relationship with the innovative culture of our region. The school is already exceeding expectations and there is so much more to come.”
UC San Diego Chancellor Khosla said, “The Rady School is an integral part of UC San Diego and a vital, entrepreneurial component to San Diego’s science and technology communities. The generous commitment from Evelyn and Ernest Rady and the Rady Family Foundation allows the school to continue its tradition of success and impact.”
For Ernest Rady, one of San Diego’s most prominent philanthropists and business leaders, this recent commitment to the Rady School is driven by his “Return on Life (ROL)” philosophy. “We want the resources that we’ve been fortunate enough to accumulate to go to help other people,” he explained. That help could be for a student who receives a fellowship to attend the region’s top business school. Or success for a start-up whose founders learned how to turn ideas into opportunities. Or saving a child through technology and science developed by a Rady graduate.
“The Rady School has had an impressive first decade as measured by quality of faculty and successes of its entrepreneurial alumni. However, the best and most significant impact is on the horizon,” said Dean Sullivan. “The transformational support from Evelyn and Ernest Rady is the largest single commitment in history to a business school of Rady’s size and youth and will continue to propel the Rady School on its meteoric rise — enabling the recruitment of world-class faculty, attracting the best and brightest students, and pioneering with creative new academic initiatives.”
The past decade has held many accomplishments for UC San Diego’s Rady School of Management, including the prestigious accreditation from the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB International), the launch of more than 80 sustaining companies and 100 “intrepreneurial” products and services by students and alumni, the construction of the Rady School campus, and the recognition of outstanding faculty research through national and international publications. Recently Bloomberg Businessweek ranked the school as the No. 1 MBA program in the U.S. for Intellectual Capital.

Since its founding a decade ago, the Rady School of Management at UC San Diego has distinguished itself as a pioneer in a new model of business education. The school’s concentration in innovation, entrepreneurship and collaboration has led to rapid success—borne out by outstanding achievements of its students, faculty and alumni.
Rady School alumni have had an economic impact on the local and state economy. Over the past decade, Rady students and alumni have created 82 companies that are operational today—hiring employees, launching products that save energy, providing goods and services, and improving and saving lives. Last year, Rady alumni-founded companies contributed an estimated $2 billion to the regional economy.
One such local impact was realized through the work of Ashley Van Zeeland, Ph.D., a 2012 Rady alumna and co-founder and CEO of Cypher Genomics, Inc. This leading genome informatics company helps people like Lilly Grossman, a local 16-year-old, who had experienced a mysterious form of muscle weakness and seizure-like fits since infancy. She and her parents were desperate for a cure. Thanks to genomic sequencing built on technology developed by Van Zeeland and Cypher Genomics, Lilly’s medical team identified two suspicious gene mutations. This discovery improved her doctors’ understanding of the disease, and is now guiding the treatment protocol. With renewed hope, Lilly is now visiting universities and looking forward to life as a college student.
“My UC San Diego Rady experience was instrumental in providing me the knowledge, tools and network to translate science into a meaningful business,” commented Van Zeeland. “The experience has enabled me to define our value proposition and secure partnerships that have catapulted our growth and impacted many lives.”
In addition to supporting UC San Diego’s Rady School of Management, Evelyn and Ernest Rady are deeply involved in helping community organizations that include Rady Children’s Hospital, Scripps Health and the Salk Institute for Biological Studies. Ernest Rady is an active businessman and has founded and headed several San Diego companies. He founded Insurance Company of the West and Westcorp in 1971. In 2011, Rady formed American Assets Trust to succeed to the real estate business of American Assets, Inc, a privately held corporation founded in 1967 with over 40 years of experience in real estate management and development. Rady serves as the chief investment officer and managing member at American Assets Investment Management, LLC.  He has also shared his business expertise through his role as chair of the Dean’s Advisory Council at the Rady School of Management.
“My close relationship with the Rady School of Management has enriched my life,” added Rady. “I didn’t truly appreciate the speed or depth of impact that this program could have on a single individual and the multiplier effect that individual could have on others. I expect to see results compound and the graduates have an even greater impact in the future. For me that is the best ROL of all.”

Family and fortune: Rady clan earns money and ire

Peter RoweContact Reporter




Eight siblings were squabbling over millions of dollars — a great fortune back in 1951. All agreed that one brother has ensured the entire clan’s prosperity. Yet some insisted he owed them more of the family fortune.One sibling disagreed. She was Rose Rady.Sixty years later, seven cousins and their uncle squabble over hundreds of millions of dollars — a great fortune, even by 21st century standards. All agree that the uncle has ensured the entire clan’s prosperity. Yet they insist he owes them more of the family fortune.The uncle disagrees. He’s Rose’s son, Ernest Rady.

For generations, the Rady family has made money, shared money, fought over money. The latest battle culminated in San Diego Superior Court last month, with seven of Ernest Rady’s nieces and nephews accusing him of “reneging” on a deal that would have netted each cousin tens of millions. Rady blasted them as ingrates, noting they were all wealthy thanks to his guidance of the family’s company, American Assets.On March 21, a jury unanimously ruled that Rady owed nothing to his disgruntled relatives. On March 26, Rady and a larger family group — the original seven plaintiffs, plus three others — privately settled a separate action over American Assets’ $500 million balance.In San Diego, these courtroom dramas ran counter to Rady’s image as a generous civic leader. The 74-year-old La Jolla investor and his wife, Evelyn, have made eight-figure donations to Rady Children’s Hospital and UC San Diego’s Rady School of Management. Why was he in the midst of this family implosion?“Whenever people say it’s not about money,” said Steven Strauss, one of Rady’s lawyers, “it’s about money.”

Dollars, though, don’t tell the entire story. These lawsuits opened a window onto one of North America’s wealthiest clans. This family tree includes Canadian horse-traders, whiskey-peddlers who thrived in Prohibition-era America and Rady himself, a go-getter who made a fortune in real estate, car loans and banking, before losing more than $1 billion in the recession.“My Uncle Ernest,” Linda Blankstein said, “is — in our family — a bit of a legend.”Horses or drinks?Most weeknights, Ernest Rady leaves his office and arrives home around 6 p.m., where he is met by Evelyn.On Feb. 6, 2007, he was met by a gunman.The intruder already had bound Evelyn and a housekeeper with duct tape. The thief trussed Rady, then ransacked the couple’s La Jolla mansion. He finally left around 10 p.m. with only $43 in cash, having rejected the contents of Rady’s wallet: Canadian dollars.These foreign bills were mementos of a sad journey. Two days before the robbery, Rady had been in Winnipeg to bury a brother-in-law.Winnipeg, the capital city of Manitoba, the Canadian province bordering North Dakota, is Rady’s hometown. This is where his late parents are memorialized by the Rose and Max Rady Jewish Community Centre. This is where his sisters — Mindel Olenick and Marjorie Blankstein, both in their 80s — live.The family’s Canadian roots extend to 1891, when Rady’s grandparents moved from Russia. Ekiel Bronfman supported his large family by peddling fuel, frozen fish and horses. One of Bronfman’s eight children, Sam, noted that horse sales were often celebrated at a nearby tavern.“The bar makes more profits than we do, father,” the boy noted, according to “Samuel Bronfman,” a 1991 biography by Michael R. Marrus. “Instead of selling horses we should be selling the drinks.”In 1928, Sam Bronfman bought Joseph E. Seagram & Sons. During Prohibition, the company’s whiskeys — Dewars, Calvert, Seven Crown — were popular in U.S. speak-easies. Bronfman always denied smuggling booze into the States. Not everyone is convinced. In “Last Call,” a 2010 history of Prohibition, Daniel Okrent dryly noted that the spirits didn’t appear “through transubstantiation.”Charismatic and fiercely competitive, Sam looked out for his siblings — to a point. Proposing to divide the family’s spoils in 1951, Sam gave himself the largest amount of cash and Seagram’s stock.Several siblings protested, but sister Rose came to Sam’s defense: “Sam is being modest about his own share, and generous to all of us.”Unequal shares were something of a family tradition. In 1948, Rose used $1 million in Seagram’s shares to establish a company to hold and invest her children’s money. She gave each daughter 30 percent of the company; her son, Ernest, 40 percent.After a stroke felled Rose’s husband, Max, management of this company fell to 16-year-old Ernest. Through college, law school and years as a Manitoba barrister, Rady acted as the family’s chief financial officer. He enjoyed spectacular results — especially after leaving the law and Canada for San Diego. His first local investment, in an El Cajon apartment complex, quickly earned a profit. So did investments in office buildings and malls. Later, he prospered in automobile finance and banking.Early in 2008, Forbes magazine named Rady the world’s 743rd richest person. American Assets was worth $1.8 billion.Big mistakesSam Bronfman, the Seagram’s tycoon, died in 1971. Some of his progeny would squander fortunes on high living, messy divorces, misguided business ventures. Perhaps the low point came in 1976 when a grandson allegedly plotted his own kidnapping to pocket a $2.3 million “ransom.”Rose Rady’s offspring, though, lived quietly — although a dearth of scandals did not mean a shortage of money. On frequent trips to Canada, Rady huddled with family members to discuss American Assets and other investment opportunities.Although wealthy thanks to American Assets, niece Carol McArton declined one of those other offers. Soon afterward, Rady cornered her at a family party to inform her that she had made a mistake.“I opened my mouth to tell him what went into my decision.” McArton recalled. “He turned on his heel and walked away. He felt I should have invested that money and I didn’t do it and I was stupid.”But another niece enjoyed a playful relationship with Rady. “I called him Uncle Furnace, because he was full of hot air,” said Dr. Gail Wagner, now a hematologist/oncologist in the Bay Area. “And I was Gail the Pail because I was all wet.”In September 2007, Rady informed Wagner and her cousins that he was thinking about buying out American Assets’s shareholders. He wouldn’t live forever, he noted, just seven months after his brother-in-law’s death and his harrowing encounter with an armed burglar. He laid out what each person would receive.At then-current market values, the amounts ranged from $21.5 million to $36 million each.

From Kenya, where Wagner runs a clinic, she emailed: “Thanks for the generous offer.”But as Rady’s lawyers successfully argued in court, this was no “offer,” just something Rady was considering. Something that became impossible as the recession struck.By mid-2008, American Assets had lost more than $1 billion. As the largest shareholder, Rady took the biggest hit. “I remember going to an ATM that rejected my card,” he said. “I was struggling to survive — it was the most difficult time of my life.”He appeared in another Forbes article. The headline: “America’s Biggest Billionaire Losers of 2008.”Despite these losses, Rady was still wealthy. But he was soon besieged from another quarter. In October 2009, Wagner and a nephew, Dan Blankstein, sued Uncle Ernest. By late 2011, five more relatives joined in; their lawyers included Gail’s husband, Arne Wagner.In court, family ties seemed to have totally unraveled.“Your sister Mindel,” said Arne Wagner, cross-examining Rady, “is about 86?”“Well, she’s your mother-in-law,” Rady shot back. “I think you’d know she’s 87.”What do you think?Share your thoughts in the comments below.When the trials’ first phase ended, nieces and nephews flew home to Winnipeg, Vancouver, Oakland.“It’s still incredibly painful to me,” Gail Wagner said. “To lose him, to lose that branch of the family, has been horrible.”Her “Uncle Furnace” had similar thoughts: “Even though I won the case, I feel like I lost. I lost my family.”
