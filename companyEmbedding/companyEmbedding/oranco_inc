	Organization and Charter Amendments.






	     Oranco,  Inc., (the "Company") was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada, on June 10, 1977. The purposes for which the corporation was organized were: (1) to engage in any lawful business from time to time authorized by the board of directors, (2) to act as principal, agent, partner or joint venturer or in any other capacity in any transaction, (3) to do business anywhere in the world, and (4) to have and exercise all rights and powers from time to time granted to the corporation by law. From 1977 until 1981 the Company was dormant and undertook no activities. Beginning in 1982 the Company explored the option of entering into a joint venture to develop a mercury mining property at Mercury Mountain, Nevada. As a part of these activities the Company, through the sale of its common stock, raised funds to engage the services of an independent mining engineer to prepare a report on the feasibility of the project. By late 1983 it had been determined that the project did not warrant any further investment. From that time until 1997 the Company's activities concentrated on maintaining its corporate existence and looking for other opportunities for the Company. In May of 1997 new management was appointed, a shareholders' meeting was held, amendments to the Company's articles of incorporation were approved, and additional effort was made by new management to make the Company a viable merger candidate. These efforts included engaging the services of a certified Public Accounting firm to audit the Company's financial statements, obtaining an Opinion of Counsel as to the tradability of the Company's outstanding shares, preparation of the information required by Rule 15c2-11, and applying to the OTC Bulletin Board for trading on the medium.





	     By September of 1999, no viable acquisitions or merger candidates had been located for the Company and management became aware that the Company would be required to register its shares under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in order to maintain its stock on the OTC Bulletin Board. Management determined that the Company needed new management which might be better positioned to find a suitable acquisition or merger candidate and which would be in a position of funding the upcoming expenses of the Company. On September 1, 1999 management of the Company resigned and Claudio Gianascio was appointed as sole director and officer. On November 9, 1999 the Company sold 700,000 of its common stock to Mr. Gianascio for $.05 per share, netting a total of $35,000. On November 18, 1999 the Company filed a registration statement on Form 10SB which became effective sixty days thereafter.





	     The Company had an initial authorized  capital of $25,000  consisting  of 100,000 shares of $.25 par value common stock. On June 10, 1997 the shareholders approved an amendment to the Articles of Incorporation of The Company changing the authorized capital to 100,000,000 shares at a par value of $.001 and providing for a 10 to 1 share forward split of the outstanding shares. The Articles of Amendment were filed with the State of Nevada on August 6, 1998.





	     In the summer of 2000, the Company completed a private placement of 2,500,000 units for which it received $250,000 Each unit consisted of one share of common stock; one "a" warrant giving the holder thereof the right to purchase, upon a minimum of 60 days prior notice of exercise, one share of common stock at $.10 per share within two years of the date of issuance; and one "b" warrant giving the holder thereof the right to purchase, upon a minimum of 60 days prior notice of exercise, one share of common stock at $.25 per share within two years of the date of issuance. Both "a" & "b" warrants expired without exercise.

	Business.






	     Other than the  above-referenced  matters  and  seeking  and  investigating potential  assets,  properties or businesses to acquire,  the Company has had no business  operations  since  inception. To provide revenue on an interim basis, the Company has held its funds in interest bearing bank accounts, made short term loans to reputable unaffiliated corporations, and funded the pursuit of one lawsuit.





	     To the extent that the  Company  intends to continue  to seek the  acquisition  of assets,  property  or  business  that may benefit the Company and its  stockholders,  it is  essentially  a "blank  check" company.  Because  the  Company has  limited  assets and  conducts no  business, management  anticipates  that any such  acquisition  would  require  it to issue shares of its common stock as the sole  consideration for the acquisition.  This may result in substantial  dilution of the shares of current  stockholders.  The Company's  Board of  Directors  shall  make the final  determination  whether to complete any such  acquisition;  the approval of stockholders will not be sought unless  required by  applicable  laws,  rules and  regulations,  its Articles of Incorporation  or Bylaws,  or contract.  The Company makes no assurance that any future enterprise will be profitable or successful.





	     The Company is not currently engaging in any substantive business activity and has no plans to engage in any such activity in the foreseeable future.  In its present form, the Company may be deemed to be a vehicle to acquire or merge with a business or company.  The Company does not intend to restrict its search to any particular business or industry, and the areas in which it will seek out acquisitions,  reorganizations  or mergers may include,  but will not be limited to, the fields of high technology,  manufacturing,  natural resources,  service, research and development, communications,  transportation, insurance, brokerage, finance and all medically related fields,  among others.  The Company recognizes that the number of suitable potential business ventures that may be available to it may be extremely limited, and may be restricted to entities who desire to avoid what these entities may deem to be the adverse factors related to an initial public offering ("IPO").  The most prevalent of these factors include substantial time requirements, legal and accounting costs, the inability to obtain an underwriter who is willing to publicly offer and sell shares, the lack of or the inability to obtain the  required financial  statements  for such an undertaking,  limitations  on the  amount of  dilution  to public  investors  in comparison to the stockholders of any such entities, along with other conditions or requirements  imposed by various federal and state securities laws, rules and regulations.  Any of these types of entities,  regardless of their  prospects, would require the Company to issue a substantial  number of shares of its common stock to  complete  any such  acquisition,  reorganization  or  merger,  usually amounting to between 80 and 95 percent of the outstanding shares of the Company following the completion of any such transaction;  accordingly,  investments in any such private  entity,  if available,  would be much more  favorable than any investment in the Company.





	     In the event that the Company engages in any transaction resulting in a change of control of the Company  and/or the  acquisition  of a  business,  the Company will be required to file with the Commission  a Current  Report on Form 8-K within the time periods provided for.  A filing on Form 8-K also requires the filing of audited financial statements of the business acquired, as well as pro forma financial information  consisting of a pro forma condensed balance sheet, pro forma statements of income and accompanying explanatory notes.





	     Management intends to consider a number of factors  prior to making any decision as to whether to participate in any specific business endeavor, none of which may be determinative  or provide  any  assurance  of  success.  These


	may include, but will not be limited to an analysis of the quality of the entity's management  personnel;  the  anticipated  acceptability  of any new  products or marketing concepts;  the merit of technological  changes;  its present financial condition,  projected  growth potential and available  technical,  financial and managerial  resources;  its working  capital,  history of operations  and future prospects;  the nature of its present and expected competition;  the quality and experience  of its  management  services  and the depth of its  management;  its potential  for  further  research,  development  or  exploration;  risk  factors specifically  related to its  business  operations;  its  potential  for growth, expansion and profit;  the  perceived  public  recognition  or acceptance of its products,  services,  trademarks  and name  identification;  and numerous  other factors  which are  difficult,  if not  impossible,  to properly  or  accurately analyze, let alone describe or identify, without referring to specific objective criteria.




	5











	     Regardless, the results of operations of any specific entity may not necessarily be indicative of what may occur in the future, by reason of changing market  strategies,  plant or product  expansion,  changes in product  emphasis, future management  personnel and changes in innumerable other factors.  Further, in the case of a new  business  venture  or one  that  is in a  research  and development mode, the risks will be substantial,  and there will be no objective criteria to examine the  effectiveness or the abilities of its management or its business  objectives.  Also, a firm market for its products or services may yet need to be established, and with no past track record, the profitability of any such entity will be unproven and cannot be predicted with any certainty.





	     Management  will  attempt  to  meet  personally  with  management  and  key personnel  of the entity  sponsoring  any business  opportunity  afforded to the Company,  visit and inspect material facilities,  obtain independent analysis or verification  of  information   provided  and  gathered,   check  references  of management  and key  personnel  and conduct other  reasonably  prudent  measures calculated to ensure a reasonably  thorough  review of any  particular  business opportunity;  however,  due to time constraints of management,  these activities may be limited.





	     The Company is unable to predict the time as to when and if it may actually participate in any specific  business  endeavor.  The Company  anticipates  that proposed  business  ventures  will  be made  available  to it  through  personal contacts  of  directors,   executive   officers  and   principal   stockholders, professional advisors, broker dealers in securities,  venture capital personnel, members  of the  financial  community  and others  who may  present  unsolicited proposals.  In certain cases,  the Company may agree to pay a finder's fee or to otherwise  compensate  the persons who submit a potential  business  endeavor in which  the  Company  eventually  participates.  Such persons  may  include  the Company's directors,  executive officers, beneficial owners or their affiliates. In this  event,  such  fees may  become a factor  in  negotiations  regarding  a potential acquisition and,  accordingly,  may present a conflict of interest for such individuals.



	     Although the Company has not identified any potential  acquisition  target, the possibility  exists that the Company may acquire or merge with a business or company in which the Company's executive officers, directors,  beneficial owners or their affiliates may have an ownership interest.  Current Company policy does not prohibit such  transactions.  Because no such transaction is currently contemplated, it is impossible to estimate the potential  pecuniary benefits to these persons.





	     Further, substantial fees are often paid in connection with the completion of these types of acquisitions, reorganizations or mergers, ranging from a small amount to as much as $250,000. These fees are usually divided among promoters or founders,  after deduction of legal,  accounting and other related expenses, and it is not  unusual  for a  portion  of  these  fees  to be paid  to  members  of management or to principal  stockholders as consideration for their agreement to retire a portion of the shares of common stock owned by them.  In the event that such fees are paid,  they may  become a factor in  negotiations  regarding  any potential acquisition by the Company and, accordingly, may present a conflict of interest for such individuals.







	Principal Products and Services




	.







	     The limited  business  operations  of the  Company,  as now  contemplated, involve those of a "blank check" company. The only activities to be conducted by the  Company  are to  manage  its  current  limited  assets  and to seek out and investigate the  acquisition of any viable business  opportunity by purchase and exchange for securities of the Company or pursuant to a reorganization or merger through which securities of the Company will be issued or exchanged.







	6









	Distribution Methods of the Products or Services.






	     Management will seek out and  investigate  business  opportunities  through every reasonably available fashion, including personal contacts,  professionals, securities broker dealers,  venture capital personnel,  members of the financial community and others who may present unsolicited proposals; the Company may also advertise its  availability as a vehicle to bring a company to the public market through a "reverse" reorganization or merger.






	Status of any Publicly Announced New Product or Service.






	     None; not applicable.






	Competitive Business Conditions.






	     Management  believes  that there are  literally  thousands of "blank check" companies engaged in endeavors similar to those engaged in by the Company;  many of  these  companies  have   substantial current  assets  and  cash  reserves. Competitors  also  include  thousands  of other  publicly-held  companies  whose business  operations  have proven  unsuccessful,  and whose only viable business opportunity is that of providing a publicly-held vehicle through which a private entity may have access to the public capital markets. There is no reasonable way to predict the  competitive  position of the Company or any other  entity in the strata of these endeavors;  however, the Company, having limited assets and cash reserves,  will no doubt be at a  competitive  disadvantage  in  competing  with entities which have recently  completed  IPO's,  have significant cash resources and have recent operating  histories when compared with the complete lack of any substantive operations by the Company for the past several years.







	Sources and Availability of Raw Materials and Names of Principal Suppliers


	.





	     None; not applicable.






	Dependence on One or a Few Major Customers.






	     None; not applicable.








	Patents, Trademarks, Licenses, Franchises, Concessions, Royalty Agreements


	or Labor Contracts.






	     None; not applicable.






	Need for any Governmental Approval of Principal Products or Services.






	     Because the Company currently produces no products or services, it is not presently subject to any governmental


	regulation in this regard. However, in the event that the Company  engages in a merger or acquisition  transaction  with an entity  that  engages  in  such  activities,  it  will  become  subject  to  all governmental  approval  requirements to


	which the merged or acquired  entity is subject.

	Cost and Effects of Compliance with Environmental Laws.






	    None; not applicable.  However,  environmental  laws, rules and regulations may have an adverse  effect on any business  venture viewed by the Company as an attractive  acquisition,  reorganization or merger candidate,  and these factors may further  limit the number of potential  candidates  available to the Company for acquisition, reorganization or merger.

	     None.









	Item 1A.   Risk Factors



	     The Company's business is subject to numerous risk factors, including the following.






	     The Company has had very limited operating history and no revenues or earnings from operations.

	The Company has no significant assets or financial resources. The Company will, in all likelihood, sustain operating expenses without corresponding revenues, at least until the consummation of a business combination. This may result in the Company incurring a net operating loss which will increase continuously until the Company can consummate a business combination with a target company. There is no assurance that the Company can identify such a target company and consummate such a business combination.






	     Going Concern.

	As shown in the accompanying financial statements, the Company incurred a net loss of $28,152 during year ended December 31, 2016 and accumulated losses of $359,065 since inception at in 1977. The Company's current liabilities exceed its current assets by $4,897 at December 31, 2016. These factors create an uncertainty as to the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the success of raising additional capital through the issuance of common stock, borrowing from existing shareholders, and/or the ability to generate sufficient operating revenue.






	     Our proposed business plan is speculative in nature.

	  The success of the Company's proposed plan of operation will depend to a great extent on the operations, financial condition and management of the identified target company. While management will prefer business combinations with entities having established operating histories, there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in locating candidates meeting such criteria. In the event the Company completes a business combination, of which there can be no assurance, the success of the Company's operations will be dependent upon management of the target company and numerous other factors beyond the Company's control.






	     The Company is and will continue to be an insignificant participant in the business of seeking mergers with and acquisitions of business entities.

	A large number of established and well-financed entities, including venture capital firms, are active in mergers and acquisitions of companies which may be merger or acquisition target candidates for the Company. Nearly all such entities have significantly greater financial resources, technical expertise and managerial capabilities than the Company and, consequently, the Company will be at a competitive disadvantage in identifying possible business opportunities and successfully completing a business combination. Moreover, the Company will also compete with numerous other small public companies in seeking merger or acquisition candidates.






	     The Company has no current agreement or understanding with respect to engaging in a merger with or acquisition of a specific business entity. However, it continues to evaluate various possibilities and have discussions with various parties.

	There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in identifying and evaluating suitable business opportunities or in concluding a business combination. Management has not identified any particular industry or specific business within an industry for evaluation by the Company. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to negotiate a business combination on terms favorable to the Company. The Company has not established a specific length of operating history or a specified level of earnings, assets, net worth or other criteria which it will require a target company to have achieved, or without which the Company would not consider a business combination with such business entity. Accordingly, the Company may enter into a business combination with a business entity having no significant operating history, losses, limited or no potential for immediate earnings, limited assets, negative net worth or other negative characteristics.




	8












	     Our management has limited time to devote to our business.

	  While seeking a business combination, management anticipates devoting only a limited amount of time per month to the business of the Company. The Company's sole officer has not entered into a written employment agreement with the Company and he is not expected to do so in the foreseeable future. The Company has not obtained key man life insurance on its officer and director. Notwithstanding the combined limited experience and time commitment of management, loss of the services of this individual would adversely affect development of the Company's business and its likelihood of continuing operations.






	     The Company's officer and directors participate in other business ventures which may compete directly with the Company.

	Additional conflicts of interest and non-arms length transactions may also arise in the future.  Management has adopted a policy that the Company will not seek a merger with, or acquisition of, any entity in which any member of management serves as an officer, director or partner, or in which they or their family members own or hold any ownership interest.






	     Reporting requirements may delay or preclude an acquisition.

	  Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") requires companies subject thereto to provide certain information about significant acquisitions including certified financial statements for the company acquired covering one or two years, depending on the relative size of the acquisition. The time and additional costs that may be incurred by some target companies to prepare such financial statements may significantly delay or essentially preclude consummation of an otherwise desirable acquisition by the Company. Acquisition prospects that do not have or are unable to obtain the required audited statements may not be appropriate for acquisition so long as the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act are applicable.






	     The Company has neither conducted, nor have others made available to it, market research indicating that demand exists for the transactions contemplated by the Company.

	Even in the event demand exists for a merger or acquisition of the type contemplated by the Company, there is no assurance the Company will be successful in completing any such business combination.






	     The Company's proposed operations, even if successful, will in all likelihood result in the Company engaging in a business combination with only one business entity.

	Consequently, the Company's activities will be limited to those engaged in by the business entity which the Company merges with or acquires. The Company's inability to diversify its activities into a number of areas may subject the Company to economic fluctuations within a particular business or industry and therefore increase the risks associated with the Company's operations.






	     Potential for being classified an Investment Company.

	  Although the Company will be subject to regulation under the Exchange Act, management believes the Company will not be subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, insofar as the Company will not be engaged in the business of investing or trading in securities. In the event the Company engages in business combinations which result in the Company holding passive investment interests in a number of entities, the Company could be subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940. In such event, the Company would be required to register as an investment company and could be expected to incur significant registration and compliance costs. The Company has obtained no formal determination from the Securities and Exchange Commission as to the status of the Company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and, consequently, any violation of such Act could subject the Company to material adverse consequences.




	9












	     A business combination involving the issuance of the Company's common stock will, in all likelihood, result in shareholders of a target company obtaining a controlling interest in the Company.

	Any such business combination may require shareholders of the Company to sell or transfer all or a portion of the Company's common stock held by them. The resulting change in control of the Company will likely result in removal of the present officer and director of the Company and a corresponding reduction in or elimination of his participation in the future affairs of the Company.  Currently, there are no pending acquisitions, business combinations or mergers.






	     The Company's primary plan of operation is based upon a business combination with a business entity which, in all likelihood, will result in the Company issuing securities to shareholders of such business entity.

	The issuance of previously authorized and unissued common stock of the Company would result in reduction in percentage of shares owned by the present shareholders of the Company and would most likely result in a change in control or management of the Company.






	     Federal and state tax consequences will, in all likelihood, be major considerations in any business combination the Company may undertake.

	Currently, such transactions may be structured so as to result in tax-free treatment to both companies, pursuant to various federal and state tax provisions. The Company intends to structure any business combination so as to minimize the federal and state tax consequences to both the Company and the target company; however, there can be no assurance that such business combination will meet the statutory requirements of a tax-free reorganization or that the parties will obtain the intended tax-free treatment upon a transfer of stock or assets. A non-qualifying reorganization could result in the imposition of both federal and state taxes which may have an adverse effect on both parties to the transaction.






	     Management of the Company will request that any potential business opportunity provide audited financial statements.

	One or more attractive business opportunities may choose to forego the possibility of a business combination with the Company rather than incur the expenses associated with preparing audited financial statements. In such case, the Company may choose to obtain certain assurances as to the target company's assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses prior to consummating a business combination, with further assurances that audited financial statements would be provided after closing of such a transaction.  Closing documents relative thereto may include representations that the audited financial statements will not materially differ from the representations included in such closing documents.






	     Our stock is subject to the Penny Stock rules, which impose significant restrictions on the Broker-Dealers and may affect the resale of our stock

	.   Our stock is subject to Penny

	 

	Stock trading rules, and investors will experience resale restrictions and a lack of liquidity. A penny stock is generally a stock that:








	·




	is not listed on a national securities exchange or Nasdaq;





	 


	 





	·




	is listed in "pink sheets" or on the NASD OTC Bulletin Board;





	 


	 





	·




	has a price per share of less than $5.00; and





	 


	 





	·




	is issued by a company with net tangible assets less than $5 million.








	     The penny stock trading rules impose additional duties and responsibilities upon broker-dealers and salespersons effecting purchase and sale transactions in common stock and other equity securities, including:








	·




	determination of the purchaser's investment suitability;





	 


	 





	·




	delivery of certain information and disclosures to the purchaser; and





	 


	 





	·




	receipt of a specific purchase agreement from the purchaser prior to effecting the purchase transaction.










	10








	     Due to the Penny Stock rules, many broker-dealers will not effect transactions in penny stocks except on an unsolicited basis.  When our common stock becomes subject to the penny stock trading rules,








	·




	such rules may materially limit or restrict the ability to resell our common stock, and





	 


	 





	·




	the liquidity typically associated with other publicly traded equity securities may not exist.









	     It is possible that a liquid market for our stock will never develop and you will not be able to sell your stock.

	  There is no assurance a market will be made in our stock.  If no market exists, you will not be able to sell your shares publicly, making your investment of little or no value.












	Item 2.  Description of Property.






	     The Company has no assets, property or any physical business office or other facilities. Its principal executive office address is the business office  address  of its transfer agent, Interwest Transfer Co., Inc., which, as a courtesy to its clients, provides mail forwarding services  Because the Company has had no  business,  its  activities  will be limited to keeping itself in good standing in the State of Nevada, seeking out acquisitions,   reorganizations   or  mergers  and   preparing  and  filing  the appropriate  reports  with  the  Securities  and  Exchange Commission.   These activities have consumed an insubstantial amount of management's time.













	Item 3.  Legal Proceedings.








	     

	To the knowledge  of  management,  no federal,  state or local  governmental  agency is presently  contemplating  any  proceeding  against  the  Company.  No director, executive officer or affiliate of the Company or owner of record or beneficially of more than five percent of the Company's common stock is a party adverse to the Company or has a material interest adverse to the Company in any proceeding.




	 




	PART II












	Item 5.  Market for Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters.








	Market Information






	     There is no "public market" for shares of common stock of the Company. Although the Company's shares are quoted on the OTC Markets OTCQB, the Company is aware of only a few transactions that have taken place in the previous ten years. In any event, no assurance can be given that any market for the  Company's  common stock will develop or be maintained.





	     The ability of an individual shareholder to trade their shares in a particular state may be subject to various rules and regulations of that state.  A number of states require that an issuer's securities be registered in their state or appropriately exempted from registration before the securities are permitted to trade in that state.  Presently, the Company has no plans to register its securities in any particular state.  Further, most likely the Company's  shares will be subject to the provisions of Section 15(g) and Rule 15g-9 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), commonly referred to as the "penny stock" rule.  Section 15(g) sets forth certain requirements for transactions in penny stocks and Rule 15g-9(d)(1) incorporates the definition of penny stock as that used in Rule 3a51-


	1 of the Exchange Act.




	11











	     The Commission generally defines penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions.  Rule 3a51-1 provides that any equity security is considered to be a penny stock unless that security is: registered and traded on a national securities exchange meeting specified criteria set by the Commission; authorized for quotation on The NASDAQ Stock Market; issued by a registered investment company; excluded from the definition on the basis of price (at least $5.00 per share) or the issuer's net tangible assets; or exempted from the definition by the Commission.  If the Company's shares are deemed to be a penny stock, trading in the shares will be subject to additional sales practice requirements on broker- dealers who sell penny stocks to persons other than established customers and accredited investors, generally persons with assets in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000, or $300,000 together with their spouse.





	     For transactions covered by these rules, broker-dealers must make a special suitability determination for the purchase of such securities and must have received the purchaser's written consent to the transaction prior to the purchase.  Additionally, for any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require the delivery, prior to the first transaction, of a risk disclosure document relating to the penny stock market.  A broker- dealer also must disclose the commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, and current quotations for the securities.  Finally, monthly statements must be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stocks held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks.  Consequently, these rules may restrict the ability of broker-dealers to trade and/or maintain a market in the Company's Common stock and may affect the ability of shareholders to sell their shares.





	Holders





	    The number of record holders of the Company's common stock as of the date of this Report is approximately 39.






	Dividends






	     The Company has not declared any cash dividends with respect to its common stock and does not intend to declared dividends in the foreseeable future.  The future dividend policy of the Company cannot be ascertained with any certainty, and until the Company completes any acquisition, reorganization or merger, as to which no assurance may be given, no such policy will be formulated. There are no material restrictions limiting, or that are likely to limit,  the  Company's ability to pay dividends on its common stock.

	Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis or Plan of Operation.





	 



	Plan of Operation.






	     The Company has not engaged in any material operations or had any revenues from operations since inception.  The Company's plan of operation  for the next 12  months is to  continue  to seek the  acquisition of assets,  properties  or businesses  that  may  benefit  the  Company  and  its stockholders. Management intends to focus its efforts outside the United States both because management is located in Europe and because management believes that the Company can locate superior acquisition opportunities outside the United States.  Management anticipates that to achieve any such acquisition, the Company will issue shares of its common stock as the sole consideration for such acquisition.




	12











	     During the next 12 months, the Company's only foreseeable cash requirements will relate to maintaining  the  Company in good  standing  or the  payment of expenses  associated  with  reviewing or  investigating  any potential  business venture,  which  the  Company  expects  to pay from its  cash  resources. As of December 31, 2016, it had $3,234 in cash. Management does not believe that these funds are sufficient to cover its cash needs for the next 12 months. If additional funds are required during this period, such funds may be advanced  by  management  or stockholders as loans to the Company. Because the Company has not identified any such venture as of the date of this Report, it is impossible to predict the amount of any such loan.  As of the date of this Report, the Company is not engaged in any negotiations with any person  regarding  any venture.


	 





	Results of Operations.






	     Other than restoring and maintaining its good corporate standing in the State of  Nevada,  obtaining an audit of the Company's financial statements, submitting the Company's common stock for quotation on the NASD OTC Bulleting Board, the filing of  a Form 10 Registration, the completion of a private placement and the seeking of an appropriate acquisition candidate, merger partner, or business venture, the Company has had no material business operations in the two most recent calendar years.






	Year ended December 31, 2016 compared to year ended December 31, 2015






	     Interest, for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $3 compared to $16 for the year ended December 31, 2015, a 81.3 % decrease, which is attributable to decreased interest income. The Company had no other revenue.





	     Expenses, including interest, for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $28,155 compared to $43,998 for the year ended December 31, 2015. This represents an decrease of 15,843 or 36% and is attributable to a decrease in travel and exploratory costs incurred, partially offset by increases in professional fees and regulatory costs.





	     Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $28,152 compared to a net loss of $43,982  for the year ended December 31, 2015. This loss represents an decrease of $15,830 or 36%. This increase in loss is attributable to decreased travel and exploratory costs, partially offset by increased costs associated with regulatory reporting, and increases in professional fees.






	Liquidity.






	     The Company's primary need for capital has been to pay the ongoing administrative expenses associated with being a reporting company such as legal, accounting and EDGAR filing. The Company, although more aggressively seeking an acquisition or merger partner and incurring travel and other expenses in relation thereto, does not anticipate this changing in the next 12 months, unless a suitable acquisition or merger candidate is located. However, because of the limited amount available no assurance can be given that this will be the case.





	     During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 the Company has been able to pay its expenses and costs through its cash on hand. As of December 31, 2016 the Company had $3,234 in cash compared to $16,792 in 2015 and accounts payable of $1,300 and $1,300 at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. leaving the Company without minimal working capital. The Company intends to maintain its operations in a manner which will minimize expenses but believes that present cash resources are not sufficient for its operations for the next 12 months. However, it believes that present officers and shareholders will provide any necessary funds through either the purchase of stock or loans to the Company.  However, management could be incorrect in its belief and no commitment has been made by any party to further fund the Company's operations

	Item 7a.  Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk


	.





	     Since we have no assets other than cash in banks and notes receivable and do not have any investments in eligible portfolio companies there is no quantitative information, as of the end of December 31, 2016, about market risk that has any impact on our present business. Once we begin making investments in eligible portfolio companies there will be market risk sensitive instruments and we will disclose the applicable market risk information at that time

	Item 9a.  Controls and procedures






	Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures





	     Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer/principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), as of December 31, 2016. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer/principal financial officers has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms and that our disclosure and controls are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.





	Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting





	     Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act.  The Company's internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company's management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements in accordance with United State's generally accepted accounting principles (US GAAP), including those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company, (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with US GAAP and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company, and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.




	14











	     Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  Management's assessment included an evaluation of the design of our internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.  Based on this evaluation, Management concluded the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016.





	     Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.





	Attestation Report of Registered Public Accounting Firm





	    This annual report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm, regarding internal controls over financial reporting.  Our internal control over financial reporting was not subject to such attestation as we are a smaller reporting company.





	Changes in internal controls





	     There were no significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter and year ended December 31, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM





	To the Board of Directors and Stockholders


	of Oranco, Inc.





	We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Oranco, Inc. (a Nevada corporation) as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2016. Oranco, Inc.'s management is responsible for these financial statements. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.





	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.





	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Oranco, Inc. as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2016 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.





	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern.  As disclosed in Note 7 to the financial statements, the Company incurred a net loss of $28,152, and $43,982, respectively, during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, and of December 31, 2016, the Company's current liabilities exceeded its current assets by $4,897.  These factors create an uncertainty as to the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.  The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon additional capital contributions from the sale of stock and the ability to generate operating revenue.  The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

	NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS









	1.


	 



	Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies








	a.             



	Summary of Business







	The Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on June 16, 1977.  The Company has been in the business of the development of mineral deposits. During 1983 all activities were abandoned and the Company has remained inactive since that time. The Company has not commenced principal operations. The Company is looking to pursue business opportunities.





	                b.             Basis of Presentation





	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") as promulgated in the United States of America.






	c.            



	Cash Flows







	For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash or cash equivalents.






	d.            



	Net Loss per Share







	The net loss per share calculation is based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period.






	e.            



	Use of Estimates







	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures.  Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates.






	f.             



	Fair Value of Financial Instruments




	 


	ASC 820-10 requires entities to disclose the fair value of financial instruments, both assets and liabilities recognized and not recognized on the balance sheet, for which it is practicable to estimate fair value. ASC 820-10 defines the fair value of a financial instrument as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the carrying value of certain   financial  instruments   approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of such instruments.

	At December 31, 2016, and 2015, the Company had net deferred tax assets of $121,640 and $112,510, respectively. Due to uncertainties surrounding the Company's ability to generate future taxable income to realize these assets, a full valuation has been established to offset the net deferred tax asset.





	   The provision for income tax consists of the following components at December 31, 2016 and 2015:

	Notes to Financial Statements -




	Continued







	The Company has loss carry forwards totaling $359,065 that may be offset against future federal income taxes. If not used, the carry forwards will expire 20 years after they are incurred.





	As a result of the implementation of certain provisions of ASC 740, Income Taxes, the Company performed an analysis of its previous tax filings and determined that there were no positions taken that it considered uncertain. Therefore, there was no provision for uncertain tax positions for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. Future changes in uncertain tax positions are not expected to have an impact on the effective tax rate due to the existence of the valuation allowance. The Company will continue to classify income tax penalties and interest, if any, as part of interest and other expenses in its statements of operations. The Company has incurred no interest or penalties as of December 31, 2016 and 2015.





	   The federal income tax returns of the Company for 2015, 2014 and 2013 are subject to examination by the IRS, generally for three years after they were filed.






	5.


	 



	Office Rent




	 


	The Company's board of directors approved an office rent to a former director of the Company. The amount expensed for the year-ending December 31, 2016 and 2015 amounted to $-0- and $2,850, respectively.






	6.


	 



	Travel Expense Related Party







	   In March 2015, the board of directors approved to reimburse its current board member $15,000 for travel expenses incurred related to merger and acquisition activities.






	7.


	 



	Going Concern







	As shown in the accompanying financial statements, the Company incurred a net loss of $28,152 during year ended December 31, 2016 and accumulated losses of $359,065 since inception at June 15, 1977.  The Company's current liabilities exceed its current assets by $4,807 at December 31, 2016.  These factors create an uncertainty as to the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.  The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the success of raising additional capital through the issuance of common stock and the ability to generate sufficient operating revenue.  The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

	   Management has evaluated subsequent events through April 27, 2017 the date on which the financial statements were available to be issued.

What's New
New Orenco and Division Logos on the Way!
We’re excited to introduce the updated logos we’ve developed for Orenco Systems, Orenco Composites, and Orenco Controls.
The new Orenco Systems logo reflects our corporate vision and illustrates our focus on protecting the world's water. The blue "arrows" represent our emphasis on water conservation and reuse, while the image of a globe conveys both our desire to protect the planet's resources and our experience doing business all over the world. Though the basic design elements for each division are similar, every logo contains a unique element that speaks to that division's core products.
The Composites logo features a central webbed graphic that conveys the strength of our fiberglass products.
The Controls logo includes a graphic that represents connectivity, illustrating how our panels can connect various kinds of equipment.
We'll be rolling out our new logos over the next few weeks. They’ll also be prominently featured on our new website, which we're launching in the next few months. Stay tuned for more details!

Orenco Receives Another "Top Projects" Award
For the second year in a row, we've received a "Top Projects" award from Water & Wastes Digest. This year's award-winning project is located in Vero Beach, Florida, a densely populated city next to the Indian River Lagoon on Florida's east coast. Many of the city's on-lot septic tanks and drainfields were failing, and experts believed that nitrogen, phosphorus, and bacteria from these systems were contributing to the pollution of the watershed. To address these concerns, approximately 1,500 septic systems are now being replaced with an Orenco Sewer system, at about half the cost of gravity sewer. For all the details, check out our Vero Beach Case Study.
 
Effluent Sewer Systems: Real-World Data Available
Those who work with effluent sewers know - and have demonstrated repeatedly - that they're the most cost-effective solution when looking at whole-life costs. Orenco's Terry Bounds, P.E., and Grant Denn recently wrote a paper that helps designers and engineers develop accurate cost information about effluent sewers based on facts, not conjecture.

“I’ve always liked the proactive approach that Orenco takes. I have two criteria regarding any product specifications: the product does the job and the company provides technical support. Orenco excels in both, which makes me look good and my clients happy.”
— David Monihan, Jr., P.E., RLS
