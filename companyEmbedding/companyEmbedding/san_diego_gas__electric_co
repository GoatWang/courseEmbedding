San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E) is the utility that provides natural gas and electricity to San Diego County and southern Orange County in southwestern California, United States. It is owned by Sempra Energy, a Fortune 500 energy services holding company that is based in San Diego.
SDG&E is a regulated public utility that provides energy service to 3.3 million consumers through 1.4 million electric meters and more than 840,000 natural gas meters in San Diego and southern Orange counties. The utility's area spans 4,100 square miles (10,600 square kilometers). SDG&E employs about 5,000 people.
In 2004, the California Public Utilities Commission approved SDG&E's long-term energy resource plan, which relies on a balanced mix of resources to meet the growing energy needs of San Diego. That mix includes increased emphasis on energy efficiency, more renewable energy resources, and additional baseload generation plants and transmission capacity. In 2014 SDG&E had a renewables mix of 36.4%, more than the 33% requirement by 2020.[1][2]

Interconnections[edit]
SDG&E has two 230 kV lines (Miguel-Tijuana line and the LaRosita-Imperial Valley Line) that connect the Californian transmission system with the Mexican Comisión Federal de Electricidad transmission system in Baja California. The Path 45 transmission corridor, spanning over the United States-Mexico border, has a capacity of 408 Megawatts. SDG&E has a 500 kV line connecting to Arizona Public Service. There is also a 230 kV line connecting to Imperial Irrigation District. Both of these are part of the massive Path 46 transmission system ensuring Southern California has adequate energy.
The Sunrise Powerlink 117-mile, 500,000-volt transmission line linking San Diego to Imperial Valley, one of the most renewable-rich regions in California was put into service on June 18, 2012.
Early history[edit]

Henry H. Jones, a civil, construction and electrical engineer, came to San Diego in 1910 to take the position of vice president and manager of the San Diego Consolidated Gas & Electric Company, and accepted the position as president, shortly thereafter.
Henry Harrison Jones was born at Reading, Pennsylvania, March 31, 1874, son of Richard Hall and Ellen (Hughes) Jones. After graduating from the high school of his native city in 1890 he was for a year a bookkeeper in the Second National Bank, and then entered Lehigh University to pursue a technical course. He graduated with the degree Civil Civil Engineer in 1897, following which for a year he was draftsman and assistant engineer for the Chicago, Peoria and St. Louis Railroad Company at Springfield, Illinois, then was a member of a general engineering staff of the Pennsylvania Railroad at Philadelphia until 1899, in which year he again went West and until 1903 was in Chicago as an assistant engineer of the Chicago & Northwestern Railroad. For seventeen years his work was chiefly confined to traction and electric power engineering. He was general superintendent for the Springfield^ Railway & Light Company at Springfield, Illinois, until 1909, and before coming to San Diego was manager of the Northern Idaho & Montana Power Company. In 1910 he accepted the post of vice president and manager of the San Diego Consolidated Gas & Electric Company, where he did much to extend and improve the facilities of that corporation and at the same time exerted himself with a liberal degree of public spirit in the affairs of the community in general.
There are some interesting figures that may be noted to indicate the remarkable expansion of the service of the San Diego Consolidated Gas and Electric Company during a ten-year period incidentally reflecting upon the good management and enterprise of Mr. Jones, as well as upon the general progress of San Diego and environment. By 1920 the company furnished gas and electric service to San Diego city and forty adjacent towns and districts as far north as San Juan Capistrano in Orange County, and south to the Mexican border. The service in these developments proved a remarkable boon to the ranching and rural communities adjacent to San Diego, where as a result of his management, the homes all had the advantages of lighting and power available to city communities. When Mr. Jones took the management of the company in 1910 it had less than six thousand electric customers and less than nine thousand gas customers, while the number of customers in each branch in 1920 numbered nearly twenty-seven thousand. The quantity measure of service increased in proportion, necessitating the investment of millions of dollars in new equipment and distribution systems. The company in 1920 had five hundred and thirty miles of gas main and over seven hundred miles of electric poll lines.
Mr. Jones served as a director and member of the executive committee during the Panama-California Exposition (1915), whose group was responsible for the designing, creation and building the first, original structures and buildings in Balboa Park, San Diego, California. He was associated with many of the local organizations to promote the objects of the World war, and he had some active military experience during the Spanish- American war as a member of the Fourth Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry, participating in the Puerto Rican campaign. He was a member of the United Spanish War Veterans, the Loyal Legion, is a Mason, Elk and a member of the Cuyamaca Club, San Diego Country Club, University Club of San Diego, San Diego Rowing Club, Cabrillo Club, Los Angeles Country Club, University Club of Chicago, and Masonic Club of San Francisco.
United States versus San Diego Gas & Electric[edit]
The Encanto Gas Holder was a natural gas holding station composed of over 9 miles (14 km) of underground 30-inch (760 mm) pipe on about 16 acres (65,000 m2) of land in Lemon Grove, adjacent to the city of San Diego. First brought on line in the mid-1950s, the Encanto Gas Holder was decommissioned in 2000-2001 by San Diego Gas and Electric, Sempra Energy as the agent of SDG&E, and the IT Corporation as the main contractor for the decommissioning. TriState was brought on board to abate strips of asbestos-containing pipe coating for another contractor to cut the holder bottle into 40-foot (12 m) long sections. TriState was later tasked with stripping the coating at the gas holder site despite employee and neighboring residents' concerns of friable asbestos generated as a byproduct of the gross stripping processes employed by SDG&E contractors.[3]
In 2006, SDG&E was indicted by U.S. Attorney Carol C. Lam in the Southern District of California on 5 counts constituting environmental crimes, including conspiracy, fraud, and 3 counts of mishandling regulated asbestos containing materials in violation of the National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants. Additional defendants include SDG&E's director of environmental compliance, an uncertified asbestos removal consultant, and the IT Corporation project manager.[4] Charges were dismissed without prejudice in November 2006, but the defendants were re-indicted in early 2007 on nearly identical charges, and the case was heard in San Diego's federal court in June and July 2007.[5] On July 13, 2007, 3 guilty verdicts were returned against defendants SDG&E, IT Corporation project manager Kyle Rhuebottom, and SDG&E environmental specialist David "Willie" Williamson, including false statements, failure to provide adequate notice to government agencies of regulated asbestos on the site, and violating asbestos work practice standards for the purpose of avoiding the cost of lawful environmental compliance. SDG&E environmental director Jacquelyn McHugh was found not guilty, and defense attorneys vowed an appeal for unjust prosecution.[6][7]
In late 2007 U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw ruled that SDG&E and the workers deserved a new trial. Criminal charges were dismissed against SDG&E on October 6, 2009.
Marine helicopter crash lawsuit[edit]
On September 3, 2008 a jury awarded $55.6 million to the families of four United States Marine aviators killed when their UH-1 helicopter crashed into a SDG&E 130-foot-tall utility tower at Camp Pendleton. The amount awarded included $15.2 million in compensatory damages and $40.4 million in punitive damages. The jury held SDG&E responsible for $9.48 million of the compensation amount and all of the punitive damages.[8]
During the trial, the plaintiff's attorney argued that SDG&E was negligent because of its policy of placing warning lights only on towers over 200 feet (61 m) in height. The company said the power line had been on the base for 25 years and that SDG&E would have installed lights if the Marine Corps had asked. Since the crash, the company has installed lights, said Todd Macaluso, the lawyer for the families. SDG&E said that it would appeal the judgment.[8]
2011 county-wide power outage[edit]
See also: 2011 Southwest blackout
On September 8, 2011, at 3:38 PM Pacific Standard Time, a major power outage occurred leaving all 1.4 million SDG&E's customers without power. The problems started with a fault in an Arizona Public Service substation near Yuma, Arizona. This caused widespread problems in Western Arizona and Eastern California. In time, SDG&E's system was drawing from SONGS considerably more power than was being produced, pulling it from Los Angeles, and a "safety net" system cut it off from the nuclear plant. Once this happened, SDG&E's system rapidly collapsed due to mismatch of generation and load, not being able to drop load faster than generation was lost. SDG&E implemented their system restoration plan and cautioned its customers to expect a prolonged outage.[9] The outage appears to have been caused by the actions of an employee at APS's North Gila substation in Arizona, and it is unknown why safeguards did not keep the outage limited to the Yuma area.[10]
By Friday morning on the 9th, power had been restored to all 1.4 million SDG&E customers.[11]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E) is the utility that provides natural gas and electricity to San Diego County and southern Orange County in southwestern California, United States. It is owned by Sempra Energy, a Fortune 500 energy services holding company that is based in San Diego.
SDG&E is a regulated public utility that provides energy service to 3.3 million consumers through 1.4 million electric meters and more than 840,000 natural gas meters in San Diego and southern Orange counties. The utility's area spans 4,100 square miles (10,600 square kilometers). SDG&E employs about 5,000 people.
In 2004, the California Public Utilities Commission approved SDG&E's long-term energy resource plan, which relies on a balanced mix of resources to meet the growing energy needs of San Diego. That mix includes increased emphasis on energy efficiency, more renewable energy resources, and additional baseload generation plants and transmission capacity. In 2014 SDG&E had a renewables mix of 36.4%, more than the 33% requirement by 2020.[1][2]

Interconnections[edit]
SDG&E has two 230 kV lines (Miguel-Tijuana line and the LaRosita-Imperial Valley Line) that connect the Californian transmission system with the Mexican Comisión Federal de Electricidad transmission system in Baja California. The Path 45 transmission corridor, spanning over the United States-Mexico border, has a capacity of 408 Megawatts. SDG&E has a 500 kV line connecting to Arizona Public Service. There is also a 230 kV line connecting to Imperial Irrigation District. Both of these are part of the massive Path 46 transmission system ensuring Southern California has adequate energy.
The Sunrise Powerlink 117-mile, 500,000-volt transmission line linking San Diego to Imperial Valley, one of the most renewable-rich regions in California was put into service on June 18, 2012.
Early history[edit]

Henry H. Jones, a civil, construction and electrical engineer, came to San Diego in 1910 to take the position of vice president and manager of the San Diego Consolidated Gas & Electric Company, and accepted the position as president, shortly thereafter.
Henry Harrison Jones was born at Reading, Pennsylvania, March 31, 1874, son of Richard Hall and Ellen (Hughes) Jones. After graduating from the high school of his native city in 1890 he was for a year a bookkeeper in the Second National Bank, and then entered Lehigh University to pursue a technical course. He graduated with the degree Civil Civil Engineer in 1897, following which for a year he was draftsman and assistant engineer for the Chicago, Peoria and St. Louis Railroad Company at Springfield, Illinois, then was a member of a general engineering staff of the Pennsylvania Railroad at Philadelphia until 1899, in which year he again went West and until 1903 was in Chicago as an assistant engineer of the Chicago & Northwestern Railroad. For seventeen years his work was chiefly confined to traction and electric power engineering. He was general superintendent for the Springfield^ Railway & Light Company at Springfield, Illinois, until 1909, and before coming to San Diego was manager of the Northern Idaho & Montana Power Company. In 1910 he accepted the post of vice president and manager of the San Diego Consolidated Gas & Electric Company, where he did much to extend and improve the facilities of that corporation and at the same time exerted himself with a liberal degree of public spirit in the affairs of the community in general.
There are some interesting figures that may be noted to indicate the remarkable expansion of the service of the San Diego Consolidated Gas and Electric Company during a ten-year period incidentally reflecting upon the good management and enterprise of Mr. Jones, as well as upon the general progress of San Diego and environment. By 1920 the company furnished gas and electric service to San Diego city and forty adjacent towns and districts as far north as San Juan Capistrano in Orange County, and south to the Mexican border. The service in these developments proved a remarkable boon to the ranching and rural communities adjacent to San Diego, where as a result of his management, the homes all had the advantages of lighting and power available to city communities. When Mr. Jones took the management of the company in 1910 it had less than six thousand electric customers and less than nine thousand gas customers, while the number of customers in each branch in 1920 numbered nearly twenty-seven thousand. The quantity measure of service increased in proportion, necessitating the investment of millions of dollars in new equipment and distribution systems. The company in 1920 had five hundred and thirty miles of gas main and over seven hundred miles of electric poll lines.
Mr. Jones served as a director and member of the executive committee during the Panama-California Exposition (1915), whose group was responsible for the designing, creation and building the first, original structures and buildings in Balboa Park, San Diego, California. He was associated with many of the local organizations to promote the objects of the World war, and he had some active military experience during the Spanish- American war as a member of the Fourth Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry, participating in the Puerto Rican campaign. He was a member of the United Spanish War Veterans, the Loyal Legion, is a Mason, Elk and a member of the Cuyamaca Club, San Diego Country Club, University Club of San Diego, San Diego Rowing Club, Cabrillo Club, Los Angeles Country Club, University Club of Chicago, and Masonic Club of San Francisco.
United States versus San Diego Gas & Electric[edit]
The Encanto Gas Holder was a natural gas holding station composed of over 9 miles (14 km) of underground 30-inch (760 mm) pipe on about 16 acres (65,000 m2) of land in Lemon Grove, adjacent to the city of San Diego. First brought on line in the mid-1950s, the Encanto Gas Holder was decommissioned in 2000-2001 by San Diego Gas and Electric, Sempra Energy as the agent of SDG&E, and the IT Corporation as the main contractor for the decommissioning. TriState was brought on board to abate strips of asbestos-containing pipe coating for another contractor to cut the holder bottle into 40-foot (12 m) long sections. TriState was later tasked with stripping the coating at the gas holder site despite employee and neighboring residents' concerns of friable asbestos generated as a byproduct of the gross stripping processes employed by SDG&E contractors.[3]
In 2006, SDG&E was indicted by U.S. Attorney Carol C. Lam in the Southern District of California on 5 counts constituting environmental crimes, including conspiracy, fraud, and 3 counts of mishandling regulated asbestos containing materials in violation of the National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants. Additional defendants include SDG&E's director of environmental compliance, an uncertified asbestos removal consultant, and the IT Corporation project manager.[4] Charges were dismissed without prejudice in November 2006, but the defendants were re-indicted in early 2007 on nearly identical charges, and the case was heard in San Diego's federal court in June and July 2007.[5] On July 13, 2007, 3 guilty verdicts were returned against defendants SDG&E, IT Corporation project manager Kyle Rhuebottom, and SDG&E environmental specialist David "Willie" Williamson, including false statements, failure to provide adequate notice to government agencies of regulated asbestos on the site, and violating asbestos work practice standards for the purpose of avoiding the cost of lawful environmental compliance. SDG&E environmental director Jacquelyn McHugh was found not guilty, and defense attorneys vowed an appeal for unjust prosecution.[6][7]
In late 2007 U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw ruled that SDG&E and the workers deserved a new trial. Criminal charges were dismissed against SDG&E on October 6, 2009.
Marine helicopter crash lawsuit[edit]
On September 3, 2008 a jury awarded $55.6 million to the families of four United States Marine aviators killed when their UH-1 helicopter crashed into a SDG&E 130-foot-tall utility tower at Camp Pendleton. The amount awarded included $15.2 million in compensatory damages and $40.4 million in punitive damages. The jury held SDG&E responsible for $9.48 million of the compensation amount and all of the punitive damages.[8]
During the trial, the plaintiff's attorney argued that SDG&E was negligent because of its policy of placing warning lights only on towers over 200 feet (61 m) in height. The company said the power line had been on the base for 25 years and that SDG&E would have installed lights if the Marine Corps had asked. Since the crash, the company has installed lights, said Todd Macaluso, the lawyer for the families. SDG&E said that it would appeal the judgment.[8]
2011 county-wide power outage[edit]
See also: 2011 Southwest blackout
On September 8, 2011, at 3:38 PM Pacific Standard Time, a major power outage occurred leaving all 1.4 million SDG&E's customers without power. The problems started with a fault in an Arizona Public Service substation near Yuma, Arizona. This caused widespread problems in Western Arizona and Eastern California. In time, SDG&E's system was drawing from SONGS considerably more power than was being produced, pulling it from Los Angeles, and a "safety net" system cut it off from the nuclear plant. Once this happened, SDG&E's system rapidly collapsed due to mismatch of generation and load, not being able to drop load faster than generation was lost. SDG&E implemented their system restoration plan and cautioned its customers to expect a prolonged outage.[9] The outage appears to have been caused by the actions of an employee at APS's North Gila substation in Arizona, and it is unknown why safeguards did not keep the outage limited to the Yuma area.[10]
By Friday morning on the 9th, power had been restored to all 1.4 million SDG&E customers.[11]

There are some interesting figures that may be noted to indicate the remarkable expansion of the service of the San Diego Consolidated Gas and Electric Company during a ten-year period incidentally reflecting upon the good management and enterprise of Mr. Jones, as well as upon the general progress of San Diego and environment. By 1920 the company furnished gas and electric service to San Diego city and forty adjacent towns and districts as far north as San Juan Capistrano in Orange County, and south to the Mexican border. The service in these developments proved a remarkable boon to the ranching and rural communities adjacent to San Diego, where as a result of his management, the homes all had the advantages of lighting and power available to city communities. When Mr. Jones took the management of the company in 1910 it had less than six thousand electric customers and less than nine thousand gas customers, while the number of customers in each branch in 1920 numbered nearly twenty-seven thousand. The quantity measure of service increased in proportion, necessitating the investment of millions of dollars in new equipment and distribution systems. The company in 1920 had five hundred and thirty miles of gas main and over seven hundred miles of electric poll lines.
Mr. Jones served as a director and member of the executive committee during the Panama-California Exposition (1915), whose group was responsible for the designing, creation and building the first, original structures and buildings in Balboa Park, San Diego, California. He was associated with many of the local organizations to promote the objects of the World war, and he had some active military experience during the Spanish- American war as a member of the Fourth Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry, participating in the Puerto Rican campaign. He was a member of the United Spanish War Veterans, the Loyal Legion, is a Mason, Elk and a member of the Cuyamaca Club, San Diego Country Club, University Club of San Diego, San Diego Rowing Club, Cabrillo Club, Los Angeles Country Club, University Club of Chicago, and Masonic Club of San Francisco.
United States versus San Diego Gas & Electric[edit]
The Encanto Gas Holder was a natural gas holding station composed of over 9 miles (14 km) of underground 30-inch (760 mm) pipe on about 16 acres (65,000 m2) of land in Lemon Grove, adjacent to the city of San Diego. First brought on line in the mid-1950s, the Encanto Gas Holder was decommissioned in 2000-2001 by San Diego Gas and Electric, Sempra Energy as the agent of SDG&E, and the IT Corporation as the main contractor for the decommissioning. TriState was brought on board to abate strips of asbestos-containing pipe coating for another contractor to cut the holder bottle into 40-foot (12 m) long sections. TriState was later tasked with stripping the coating at the gas holder site despite employee and neighboring residents' concerns of friable asbestos generated as a byproduct of the gross stripping processes employed by SDG&E contractors.[3]
In 2006, SDG&E was indicted by U.S. Attorney Carol C. Lam in the Southern District of California on 5 counts constituting environmental crimes, including conspiracy, fraud, and 3 counts of mishandling regulated asbestos containing materials in violation of the National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants. Additional defendants include SDG&E's director of environmental compliance, an uncertified asbestos removal consultant, and the IT Corporation project manager.[4] Charges were dismissed without prejudice in November 2006, but the defendants were re-indicted in early 2007 on nearly identical charges, and the case was heard in San Diego's federal court in June and July 2007.[5] On July 13, 2007, 3 guilty verdicts were returned against defendants SDG&E, IT Corporation project manager Kyle Rhuebottom, and SDG&E environmental specialist David "Willie" Williamson, including false statements, failure to provide adequate notice to government agencies of regulated asbestos on the site, and violating asbestos work practice standards for the purpose of avoiding the cost of lawful environmental compliance. SDG&E environmental director Jacquelyn McHugh was found not guilty, and defense attorneys vowed an appeal for unjust prosecution.[6][7]
In late 2007 U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw ruled that SDG&E and the workers deserved a new trial. Criminal charges were dismissed against SDG&E on October 6, 2009.
Marine helicopter crash lawsuit[edit]
On September 3, 2008 a jury awarded $55.6 million to the families of four United States Marine aviators killed when their UH-1 helicopter crashed into a SDG&E 130-foot-tall utility tower at Camp Pendleton. The amount awarded included $15.2 million in compensatory damages and $40.4 million in punitive damages. The jury held SDG&E responsible for $9.48 million of the compensation amount and all of the punitive damages.[8]
During the trial, the plaintiff's attorney argued that SDG&E was negligent because of its policy of placing warning lights only on towers over 200 feet (61 m) in height. The company said the power line had been on the base for 25 years and that SDG&E would have installed lights if the Marine Corps had asked. Since the crash, the company has installed lights, said Todd Macaluso, the lawyer for the families. SDG&E said that it would appeal the judgment.[8]
2011 county-wide power outage[edit]
See also: 2011 Southwest blackout
On September 8, 2011, at 3:38 PM Pacific Standard Time, a major power outage occurred leaving all 1.4 million SDG&E's customers without power. The problems started with a fault in an Arizona Public Service substation near Yuma, Arizona. This caused widespread problems in Western Arizona and Eastern California. In time, SDG&E's system was drawing from SONGS considerably more power than was being produced, pulling it from Los Angeles, and a "safety net" system cut it off from the nuclear plant. Once this happened, SDG&E's system rapidly collapsed due to mismatch of generation and load, not being able to drop load faster than generation was lost. SDG&E implemented their system restoration plan and cautioned its customers to expect a prolonged outage.[9] The outage appears to have been caused by the actions of an employee at APS's North Gila substation in Arizona, and it is unknown why safeguards did not keep the outage limited to the Yuma area.[10]
By Friday morning on the 9th, power had been restored to all 1.4 million SDG&E customers.[11]

San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E) is the utility that provides natural gas and electricity to San Diego County and southern Orange County in southwestern California, United States. It is owned by Sempra Energy, a Fortune 500 energy services holding company that is based in San Diego.
SDG&E is a regulated public utility that provides energy service to 3.3 million consumers through 1.4 million electric meters and more than 840,000 natural gas meters in San Diego and southern Orange counties. The utility's area spans 4,100 square miles (10,600 square kilometers). SDG&E employs about 5,000 people.
In 2004, the California Public Utilities Commission approved SDG&E's long-term energy resource plan, which relies on a balanced mix of resources to meet the growing energy needs of San Diego. That mix includes increased emphasis on energy efficiency, more renewable energy resources, and additional baseload generation plants and transmission capacity. In 2014 SDG&E had a renewables mix of 36.4%, more than the 33% requirement by 2020.[1][2]

Interconnections[edit]
SDG&E has two 230 kV lines (Miguel-Tijuana line and the LaRosita-Imperial Valley Line) that connect the Californian transmission system with the Mexican Comisión Federal de Electricidad transmission system in Baja California. The Path 45 transmission corridor, spanning over the United States-Mexico border, has a capacity of 408 Megawatts. SDG&E has a 500 kV line connecting to Arizona Public Service. There is also a 230 kV line connecting to Imperial Irrigation District. Both of these are part of the massive Path 46 transmission system ensuring Southern California has adequate energy.
The Sunrise Powerlink 117-mile, 500,000-volt transmission line linking San Diego to Imperial Valley, one of the most renewable-rich regions in California was put into service on June 18, 2012.

Henry H. Jones, a civil, construction and electrical engineer, came to San Diego in 1910 to take the position of vice president and manager of the San Diego Consolidated Gas & Electric Company, and accepted the position as president, shortly thereafter.
Henry Harrison Jones was born at Reading, Pennsylvania, March 31, 1874, son of Richard Hall and Ellen (Hughes) Jones. After graduating from the high school of his native city in 1890 he was for a year a bookkeeper in the Second National Bank, and then entered Lehigh University to pursue a technical course. He graduated with the degree Civil Civil Engineer in 1897, following which for a year he was draftsman and assistant engineer for the Chicago, Peoria and St. Louis Railroad Company at Springfield, Illinois, then was a member of a general engineering staff of the Pennsylvania Railroad at Philadelphia until 1899, in which year he again went West and until 1903 was in Chicago as an assistant engineer of the Chicago & Northwestern Railroad. For seventeen years his work was chiefly confined to traction and electric power engineering. He was general superintendent for the Springfield^ Railway & Light Company at Springfield, Illinois, until 1909, and before coming to San Diego was manager of the Northern Idaho & Montana Power Company. In 1910 he accepted the post of vice president and manager of the San Diego Consolidated Gas & Electric Company, where he did much to extend and improve the facilities of that corporation and at the same time exerted himself with a liberal degree of public spirit in the affairs of the community in general.
There are some interesting figures that may be noted to indicate the remarkable expansion of the service of the San Diego Consolidated Gas and Electric Company during a ten-year period incidentally reflecting upon the good management and enterprise of Mr. Jones, as well as upon the general progress of San Diego and environment. By 1920 the company furnished gas and electric service to San Diego city and forty adjacent towns and districts as far north as San Juan Capistrano in Orange County, and south to the Mexican border. The service in these developments proved a remarkable boon to the ranching and rural communities adjacent to San Diego, where as a result of his management, the homes all had the advantages of lighting and power available to city communities. When Mr. Jones took the management of the company in 1910 it had less than six thousand electric customers and less than nine thousand gas customers, while the number of customers in each branch in 1920 numbered nearly twenty-seven thousand.

United States versus San Diego Gas & Electric[edit]
The Encanto Gas Holder was a natural gas holding station composed of over 9 miles (14 km) of underground 30-inch (760 mm) pipe on about 16 acres (65,000 m2) of land in Lemon Grove, adjacent to the city of San Diego. First brought on line in the mid-1950s, the Encanto Gas Holder was decommissioned in 2000-2001 by San Diego Gas and Electric, Sempra Energy as the agent of SDG&E, and the IT Corporation as the main contractor for the decommissioning. TriState was brought on board to abate strips of asbestos-containing pipe coating for another contractor to cut the holder bottle into 40-foot (12 m) long sections. TriState was later tasked with stripping the coating at the gas holder site despite employee and neighboring residents' concerns of friable asbestos generated as a byproduct of the gross stripping processes employed by SDG&E contractors.[3]
In 2006, SDG&E was indicted by U.S. Attorney Carol C. Lam in the Southern District of California on 5 counts constituting environmental crimes, including conspiracy, fraud, and 3 counts of mishandling regulated asbestos containing materials in violation of the National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants. Additional defendants include SDG&E's director of environmental compliance, an uncertified asbestos removal consultant, and the IT Corporation project manager.[4] Charges were dismissed without prejudice in November 2006, but the defendants were re-indicted in early 2007 on nearly identical charges, and the case was heard in San Diego's federal court in June and July 2007.[5] On July 13, 2007, 3 guilty verdicts were returned against defendants SDG&E, IT Corporation project manager Kyle Rhuebottom, and SDG&E environmental specialist David "Willie" Williamson, including false statements, failure to provide adequate notice to government agencies of regulated asbestos on the site, and violating asbestos work practice standards for the purpose of avoiding the cost of lawful environmental compliance. SDG&E environmental director Jacquelyn McHugh was found not guilty, and defense attorneys vowed an appeal for unjust prosecution.[6][7]
In late 2007 U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw ruled that SDG&E and the workers deserved a new trial. Criminal charges were dismissed against SDG&E on October 6, 2009.
Marine helicopter crash lawsuit[edit]
On September 3, 2008 a jury awarded $55.6 million to the families of four United States Marine aviators killed when their UH-1 helicopter crashed into a SDG&E 130-foot-tall utility tower at Camp Pendleton. The amount awarded included $15.2 million in compensatory damages and $40.4 million in punitive damages. The jury held SDG&E responsible for $9.48 million of the compensation amount and all of the punitive damages.[8]
During the trial, the plaintiff's attorney argued that SDG&E was negligent because of its policy of placing warning lights only on towers over 200 feet (61 m) in height. The company said the power line had been on the base for 25 years and that SDG&E would have installed lights if the Marine Corps had asked. Since the crash, the company has installed lights, said Todd Macaluso, the lawyer for the families. SDG&E said that it would appeal the judgment.[8]

San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E) is the utility that provides natural gas and electricity to San Diego County and southern Orange County in southwestern California, United States. It is owned by Sempra Energy, a Fortune 500 energy services holding company that is based in San Diego.
SDG&E is a regulated public utility that provides energy service to 3.3 million consumers through 1.4 million electric meters and more than 840,000 natural gas meters in San Diego and southern Orange counties. The utility's area spans 4,100 square miles (10,600 square kilometers). SDG&E employs about 5,000 people.
In 2004, the California Public Utilities Commission approved SDG&E's long-term energy resource plan, which relies on a balanced mix of resources to meet the growing energy needs of San Diego. That mix includes increased emphasis on energy efficiency, more renewable energy resources, and additional baseload generation plants and transmission capacity. In 2014 SDG&E had a renewables mix of 36.4%, more than the 33% requirement by 2020.[1][2]

Interconnections[edit]
SDG&E has two 230 kV lines (Miguel-Tijuana line and the LaRosita-Imperial Valley Line) that connect the Californian transmission system with the Mexican Comisión Federal de Electricidad transmission system in Baja California. The Path 45 transmission corridor, spanning over the United States-Mexico border, has a capacity of 408 Megawatts. SDG&E has a 500 kV line connecting to Arizona Public Service. There is also a 230 kV line connecting to Imperial Irrigation District. Both of these are part of the massive Path 46 transmission system ensuring Southern California has adequate energy.
The Sunrise Powerlink 117-mile, 500,000-volt transmission line linking San Diego to Imperial Valley, one of the most renewable-rich regions in California was put into service on June 18, 2012.
Early history[edit]

Henry H. Jones, a civil, construction and electrical engineer, came to San Diego in 1910 to take the position of vice president and manager of the San Diego Consolidated Gas & Electric Company, and accepted the position as president, shortly thereafter.
Henry Harrison Jones was born at Reading, Pennsylvania, March 31, 1874, son of Richard Hall and Ellen (Hughes) Jones. After graduating from the high school of his native city in 1890 he was for a year a bookkeeper in the Second National Bank, and then entered Lehigh University to pursue a technical course. He graduated with the degree Civil Civil Engineer in 1897, following which for a year he was draftsman and assistant engineer for the Chicago, Peoria and St. Louis Railroad Company at Springfield, Illinois, then was a member of a general engineering staff of the Pennsylvania Railroad at Philadelphia until 1899, in which year he again went West and until 1903 was in Chicago as an assistant engineer of the Chicago & Northwestern Railroad. For seventeen years his work was chiefly confined to traction and electric power engineering. He was general superintendent for the Springfield^ Railway & Light Company at Springfield, Illinois, until 1909, and before coming to San Diego was manager of the Northern Idaho & Montana Power Company. In 1910 he accepted the post of vice president and manager of the San Diego Consolidated Gas & Electric Company, where he did much to extend and improve the facilities of that corporation and at the same time exerted himself with a liberal degree of public spirit in the affairs of the community in general.
There are some interesting figures that may be noted to indicate the remarkable expansion of the service of the San Diego Consolidated Gas and Electric Company during a ten-year period incidentally reflecting upon the good management and enterprise of Mr. Jones, as well as upon the general progress of San Diego and environment. By 1920 the company furnished gas and electric service to San Diego city and forty adjacent towns and districts as far north as San Juan Capistrano in Orange County, and south to the Mexican border. The service in these developments proved a remarkable boon to the ranching and rural communities adjacent to San Diego, where as a result of his management, the homes all had the advantages of lighting and power available to city communities. When Mr. Jones took the management of the company in 1910 it had less than six thousand electric customers and less than nine thousand gas customers, while the number of customers in each branch in 1920 numbered nearly twenty-seven thousand. The quantity measure of service increased in proportion, necessitating the investment of millions of dollars in new equipment and distribution systems. The company in 1920 had five hundred and thirty miles of gas main and over seven hundred miles of electric poll lines.
Mr. Jones served as a director and member of the executive committee during the Panama-California Exposition (1915), whose group was responsible for the designing, creation and building the first, original structures and buildings in Balboa Park, San Diego, California. He was associated with many of the local organizations to promote the objects of the World war, and he had some active military experience during the Spanish- American war as a member of the Fourth Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry, participating in the Puerto Rican campaign. He was a member of the United Spanish War Veterans, the Loyal Legion, is a Mason, Elk and a member of the Cuyamaca Club, San Diego Country Club, University Club of San Diego, San Diego Rowing Club, Cabrillo Club, Los Angeles Country Club, University Club of Chicago, and Masonic Club of San Francisco.
United States versus San Diego Gas & Electric[edit]
The Encanto Gas Holder was a natural gas holding station composed of over 9 miles (14 km) of underground 30-inch (760 mm) pipe on about 16 acres (65,000 m2) of land in Lemon Grove, adjacent to the city of San Diego. First brought on line in the mid-1950s, the Encanto Gas Holder was decommissioned in 2000-2001 by San Diego Gas and Electric, Sempra Energy as the agent of SDG&E, and the IT Corporation as the main contractor for the decommissioning. TriState was brought on board to abate strips of asbestos-containing pipe coating for another contractor to cut the holder bottle into 40-foot (12 m) long sections. TriState was later tasked with stripping the coating at the gas holder site despite employee and neighboring residents' concerns of friable asbestos generated as a byproduct of the gross stripping processes employed by SDG&E contractors.[3]
In 2006, SDG&E was indicted by U.S. Attorney Carol C. Lam in the Southern District of California on 5 counts constituting environmental crimes, including conspiracy, fraud, and 3 counts of mishandling regulated asbestos containing materials in violation of the National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants. Additional defendants include SDG&E's director of environmental compliance, an uncertified asbestos removal consultant, and the IT Corporation project manager.[4] Charges were dismissed without prejudice in November 2006, but the defendants were re-indicted in early 2007 on nearly identical charges, and the case was heard in San Diego's federal court in June and July 2007.[5] On July 13, 2007, 3 guilty verdicts were returned against defendants SDG&E, IT Corporation project manager Kyle Rhuebottom, and SDG&E environmental specialist David "Willie" Williamson, including false statements, failure to provide adequate notice to government agencies of regulated asbestos on the site, and violating asbestos work practice standards for the purpose of avoiding the cost of lawful environmental compliance. SDG&E environmental director Jacquelyn McHugh was found not guilty, and defense attorneys vowed an appeal for unjust prosecution.[6][7]
In late 2007 U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw ruled that SDG&E and the workers deserved a new trial. Criminal charges were dismissed against SDG&E on October 6, 2009.
Marine helicopter crash lawsuit[edit]
On September 3, 2008 a jury awarded $55.6 million to the families of four United States Marine aviators killed when their UH-1 helicopter crashed into a SDG&E 130-foot-tall utility tower at Camp Pendleton. The amount awarded included $15.2 million in compensatory damages and $40.4 million in punitive damages. The jury held SDG&E responsible for $9.48 million of the compensation amount and all of the punitive damages.[8]
During the trial, the plaintiff's attorney argued that SDG&E was negligent because of its policy of placing warning lights only on towers over 200 feet (61 m) in height. The company said the power line had been on the base for 25 years and that SDG&E would have installed lights if the Marine Corps had asked. Since the crash, the company has installed lights, said Todd Macaluso, the lawyer for the families. SDG&E said that it would appeal the judgment.[8]
2011 county-wide power outage[edit]
See also: 2011 Southwest blackout
On September 8, 2011, at 3:38 PM Pacific Standard Time, a major power outage occurred leaving all 1.4 million SDG&E's customers without power. The problems started with a fault in an Arizona Public Service substation near Yuma, Arizona. This caused widespread problems in Western Arizona and Eastern California. In time, SDG&E's system was drawing from SONGS considerably more power than was being produced, pulling it from Los Angeles, and a "safety net" system cut it off from the nuclear plant. Once this happened, SDG&E's system rapidly collapsed due to mismatch of generation and load, not being able to drop load faster than generation was lost. SDG&E implemented their system restoration plan and cautioned its customers to expect a prolonged outage.[9] The outage appears to have been caused by the actions of an employee at APS's North Gila substation in Arizona, and it is unknown why safeguards did not keep the outage limited to the Yuma area.[10]
By Friday morning on the 9th, power had been restored to all 1.4 million SDG&E customers.[11]

Henry H. Jones, a civil, construction and electrical engineer, came to San Diego in 1910 to take the position of vice president and manager of the San Diego Consolidated Gas & Electric Company, and accepted the position as president, shortly thereafter.
Henry Harrison Jones was born at Reading, Pennsylvania, March 31, 1874, son of Richard Hall and Ellen (Hughes) Jones. After graduating from the high school of his native city in 1890 he was for a year a bookkeeper in the Second National Bank, and then entered Lehigh University to pursue a technical course. He graduated with the degree Civil Civil Engineer in 1897, following which for a year he was draftsman and assistant engineer for the Chicago, Peoria and St. Louis Railroad Company at Springfield, Illinois, then was a member of a general engineering staff of the Pennsylvania Railroad at Philadelphia until 1899, in which year he again went West and until 1903 was in Chicago as an assistant engineer of the Chicago & Northwestern Railroad. For seventeen years his work was chiefly confined to traction and electric power engineering. He was general superintendent for the Springfield^ Railway & Light Company at Springfield, Illinois, until 1909, and before coming to San Diego was manager of the Northern Idaho & Montana Power Company. In 1910 he accepted the post of vice president and manager of the San Diego Consolidated Gas & Electric Company, where he did much to extend and improve the facilities of that corporation and at the same time exerted himself with a liberal degree of public spirit in the affairs of the community in general.
There are some interesting figures that may be noted to indicate the remarkable expansion of the service of the San Diego Consolidated Gas and Electric Company during a ten-year period incidentally reflecting upon the good management and enterprise of Mr. Jones, as well as upon the general progress of San Diego and environment. By 1920 the company furnished gas and electric service to San Diego city and forty adjacent towns and districts as far north as San Juan Capistrano in Orange County, and south to the Mexican border. The service in these developments proved a remarkable boon to the ranching and rural communities adjacent to San Diego, where as a result of his management, the homes all had the advantages of lighting and power available to city communities. When Mr. Jones took the management of the company in 1910 it had less than six thousand electric customers and less than nine thousand gas customers, while the number of customers in each branch in 1920 numbered nearly twenty-seven thousand. The quantity measure of service increased in proportion, necessitating the investment of millions of dollars in new equipment and distribution systems. The company in 1920 had five hundred and thirty miles of gas main and over seven hundred miles of electric poll lines.
Mr. Jones served as a director and member of the executive committee during the Panama-California Exposition (1915), whose group was responsible for the designing, creation and building the first, original structures and buildings in Balboa Park, San Diego, California. He was associated with many of the local organizations to promote the objects of the World war, and he had some active military experience during the Spanish- American war as a member of the Fourth Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry, participating in the Puerto Rican campaign. He was a member of the United Spanish War Veterans, the Loyal Legion, is a Mason, Elk and a member of the Cuyamaca Club, San Diego Country Club, University Club of San Diego, San Diego Rowing Club, Cabrillo Club, Los Angeles Country Club, University Club of Chicago, and Masonic Club of San Francisco.
United States versus San Diego Gas & Electric[edit]
The Encanto Gas Holder was a natural gas holding station composed of over 9 miles (14 km) of underground 30-inch (760 mm) pipe on about 16 acres (65,000 m2) of land in Lemon Grove, adjacent to the city of San Diego. First brought on line in the mid-1950s, the Encanto Gas Holder was decommissioned in 2000-2001 by San Diego Gas and Electric, Sempra Energy as the agent of SDG&E, and the IT Corporation as the main contractor for the decommissioning. TriState was brought on board to abate strips of asbestos-containing pipe coating for another contractor to cut the holder bottle into 40-foot (12 m) long sections. TriState was later tasked with stripping the coating at the gas holder site despite employee and neighboring residents' concerns of friable asbestos generated as a byproduct of the gross stripping processes employed by SDG&E contractors.[3]
In 2006, SDG&E was indicted by U.S. Attorney Carol C. Lam in the Southern District of California on 5 counts constituting environmental crimes, including conspiracy, fraud, and 3 counts of mishandling regulated asbestos containing materials in violation of the National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants. Additional defendants include SDG&E's director of environmental compliance, an uncertified asbestos removal consultant, and the IT Corporation project manager.[4] Charges were dismissed without prejudice in November 2006, but the defendants were re-indicted in early 2007 on nearly identical charges, and the case was heard in San Diego's federal court in June and July 2007.[5] On July 13, 2007, 3 guilty verdicts were returned against defendants SDG&E, IT Corporation project manager Kyle Rhuebottom, and SDG&E environmental specialist David "Willie" Williamson, including false statements, failure to provide adequate notice to government agencies of regulated asbestos on the site, and violating asbestos work practice standards for the purpose of avoiding the cost of lawful environmental compliance. SDG&E environmental director Jacquelyn McHugh was found not guilty, and defense attorneys vowed an appeal for unjust prosecution.[6][7]
In late 2007 U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw ruled that SDG&E and the workers deserved a new trial. Criminal charges were dismissed against SDG&E on October 6, 2009.
Marine helicopter crash lawsuit[edit]
On September 3, 2008 a jury awarded $55.6 million to the families of four United States Marine aviators killed when their UH-1 helicopter crashed into a SDG&E 130-foot-tall utility tower at Camp Pendleton. The amount awarded included $15.2 million in compensatory damages and $40.4 million in punitive damages. The jury held SDG&E responsible for $9.48 million of the compensation amount and all of the punitive damages.[8]
During the trial, the plaintiff's attorney argued that SDG&E was negligent because of its policy of placing warning lights only on towers over 200 feet (61 m) in height. The company said the power line had been on the base for 25 years and that SDG&E would have installed lights if the Marine Corps had asked. Since the crash, the company has installed lights, said Todd Macaluso, the lawyer for the families. SDG&E said that it would appeal the judgment.[8]
2011 county-wide power outage[edit]
See also: 2011 Southwest blackout
On September 8, 2011, at 3:38 PM Pacific Standard Time, a major power outage occurred leaving all 1.4 million SDG&E's customers without power. The problems started with a fault in an Arizona Public Service substation near Yuma, Arizona. This caused widespread problems in Western Arizona and Eastern California. In time, SDG&E's system was drawing from SONGS considerably more power than was being produced, pulling it from Los Angeles, and a "safety net" system cut it off from the nuclear plant. Once this happened, SDG&E's system rapidly collapsed due to mismatch of generation and load, not being able to drop load faster than generation was lost. SDG&E implemented their system restoration plan and cautioned its customers to expect a prolonged outage.[9] The outage appears to have been caused by the actions of an employee at APS's North Gila substation in Arizona, and it is unknown why safeguards did not keep the outage limited to the Yuma area.[10]
By Friday morning on the 9th, power had been restored to all 1.4 million SDG&E customers.[11]

San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E) is the utility that provides natural gas and electricity to San Diego County and southern Orange County in southwestern California, United States. It is owned by Sempra Energy, a Fortune 500 energy services holding company that is based in San Diego.
SDG&E is a regulated public utility that provides energy service to 3.3 million consumers through 1.4 million electric meters and more than 840,000 natural gas meters in San Diego and southern Orange counties. The utility's area spans 4,100 square miles (10,600 square kilometers). SDG&E employs about 5,000 people.
In 2004, the California Public Utilities Commission approved SDG&E's long-term energy resource plan, which relies on a balanced mix of resources to meet the growing energy needs of San Diego. That mix includes increased emphasis on energy efficiency, more renewable energy resources, and additional baseload generation plants and transmission capacity. In 2014 SDG&E had a renewables mix of 36.4%, more than the 33% requirement by 2020.[1][2]

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
