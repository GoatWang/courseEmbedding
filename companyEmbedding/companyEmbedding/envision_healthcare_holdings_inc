FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Disaster response
Managed transportation
Global medical services
Remote medical services

We monitor and dispatch our fleet from dozens of dispatch centers that are strategically located throughout the country, eight of which are accredited as Centers of Excellence by the National Academies of Emergency Dispatch (NAED). And, our National College of Technical Instruction (NCTI) is the largest provider of EMS clinical training and continuing education in the country.

AMR is also the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) primary emergency response contractor. The people of AMR have responded with leadership and clinical expertise at major events, natural disasters and at sites of terrorist activity. 

But it is our focus on the patients’ and customers’ needs that sets AMR apart. We continually strive to deliver safe, compassionate care to patients, while being highly responsive, consistently reliable and cost-effective for our more than 4,600 healthcare facility partners.
