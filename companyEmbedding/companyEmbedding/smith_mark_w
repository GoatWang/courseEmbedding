                    MARK W. SMITH  Download v-card
Mark W. Smith is the founder of Smith Valliere PLLC.  Having worked as a trial lawyer and business attorney for over a decade, Mr. Smith's courtroom accomplishments have captured the covers of The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, New York Law Journal and have been reported in every major media outlet.  The media calls Mr. Smith "a powerhouse lawyer," a "rising public intellectual," "a high-stakes, high-profile Wall Street litigator" and "one of the fastest rising legal stars in the country."  Mr. Smith is also a New York Times bestselling author of four books, a former professor of law, and frequently appears as an expert legal commentator throughout the national media. 

                  Mr. Smith has tried jury and bench trials in state and federal court and has litigated cases involving billions of dollars.  He has tried cases involving complex synthetic derivative financial products, real estate transactions, large corporate raiding efforts, partnership disputes and international commodity trades.  As co-counsel in a federal jury trial, Mr. Smith won a million-dollar judgment in a precedent-setting civil rights case that a cover story in The New York Times proclaimed to be the largest of its kind in New York history.  Mr. Smith tried the largest no-fault insurance trial in U.S. history for $23 million, and represented New York businesses in a multi-billion dollar challenge to New York's participation in the "cap and trade" scheme called the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.  Mr. Smith represented Texas state legislators before the United States Supreme Court and represented African-American women seeking to start a hair braiding company in a highly publicized constitutional challenge to New York state economic regulations.

                  After graduating from the New York University School of Law, Mr. Smith clerked for a federal trial court judge. Upon the completion of his clerkship, Mr. Smith joined Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP in New York City.  From there, he joined the high profile, nationally recognized law firm of Kasowitz Benson Torres & Friedman LLP where he was a full partner for several years. 

                  Mr. Smith's legal practice covers a broad spectrum of areas, including complex commercial disputes in the following: business, employment, computer software, securities, civil rights, bankruptcy, constitutional, real estate, intellectual property, medical malpractice, class actions, casinos and antitrust matters.  Mr. Smith has litigated matters involving major international companies such as Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Charles Schwab, JP Morgan Chase, Wachovia, A.I.G., Adelphia Communications Corp, Talk Miramax, FoxMeyer Drug Company, Continental Grain Company, Unilever, Salomon Smith Barney, and the U.S. Trust Company. 

                  Outside of the courtroom, Mr. Smith is often sought out as an advisor to companies and individuals seeking to avoid engaging in activities leading to costly disputes or legal liability.  Mr. Smith has provided counsel to clients engaged in a wide variety of commercial transactions and business dealings including companies doing business in China, Hong Kong, and the European Union.  Mr. Smith has advised clients in connection with matters involving employment, severance, licensing, agency, assignment, intellectual property, film financing, publishing, settlement, and secured lending agreements and arrangements.  Mr. Smith has advised creditors, debtors, and debtors-in-possession on bankruptcy issues.  He has advised magazines, pet product companies, bestselling authors, bank trustees, bloggers, music organizations, attorneys, and celebrity clients. 

                  As both a former Adjunct Professor of Law at the University of Kansas School of Law, and former editor of the Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy, Mr. Smith has been recognized as a legal expert by several publications such as Policy Experts 2003: The Insider Guide to Public Policy Experts and Organizations, The Journalist's Guide to Legal Experts, and Policy Experts 2000: A Guide to Public Policy Experts. 

                  Mr. Smith has frequently appeared as an expert legal analyst throughout the national media and appears                  regularly on CNN, the Fox News Channel, MSNBC and CNBC.  He has also been the subject of numerous articles in   The New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, the New York Post, the Weekly Standard, the Washington Times, the New York Observer, the National Law Journal, Slate, The Hill and ABC News' The Note. 

                 Mr. Smith is a member of the American Theatre Wing's Advisory Committee and a Broadway Tony Awards voter.  He is also a member of the Association of Professional Ball Players of America.

                  Mr. Smith has achieved an AV Preeminent Lawyer ranking by Martindale-Hubbell, which is the highest ranking available for an attorney.  Mr. Smith's professional and personal accomplishments earned him an Alumnus of the Year honor from the University of South Carolina's Honors College and a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Bronx, New York Conservative Committee. 

                  Born in Maryland and raised in Vermont, Mr. Smith played semi-professional baseball in the Northern League for the Saxtons River Pirates.  He then went on to receive a Bachelor's degree in Economics from the University of South Carolina where he was a member of the All American Debate Team.  He graduated Phi Beta Kappa.

FAQ
When will I get my refund?
Once your return is received by us, your refund will typically be processed within three business days. It typically takes a few business days for all credit card refunds to be processed and reflected on your statement. This means it will take a few extra days for your refund to show in your account after your return is processed. Please note: All actual shipping fees paid by Prymaxe will be deducted from your refund. This includes orders that qualified for free or subsidized shipping. Return shipping must be paid by the buyer. If you received a defective or incorrect item, please see the next question.  
What if I receive a defective or incorrect item?
If a product is defective upon arrival, or the wrong item was received, we will send you a replacement/the correct item, and all the shipping fees will be covered by us. For defective items, Prymaxe reserves the right to refuse the return if we determine the reason for the unit failing was not covered under the warranty (i.e., if the item was damaged due to user fault or error). If you feel your item was damaged in shipping, please take plenty of pictures of the damaged box and item and immediately contact us so we can open a claim with the shipping company.
Please be very diligent with testing your defective item. Be sure to try other guitars, power supplies, cables, and amps. We also request that you take a video of the item not working. If we receive your item, test it, and find it to be working, we will give you a refund minus the cost of shipping both ways.
When will I get my replacement item?
If a defective or incorrect item was sent to you, we will send out the replacement as soon as we get the defective/incorrect item back and approve/process the return (typically within three business days). If we do not have the replacement in stock, we will issue a full refund. If you need the replacement to be sent out immediately, please place a new order, and when we get the defective/incorrect item back, we will issue a full refund of the original order.
When must I ship my return?
Your return must be received by us within 45 days of the original purchase date. This means you must ship your return with enough time for us to receive the package within 45 day deadline. If it does not arrive within 45 days, we will refuse the package. If you feel you sent the package within a reasonable time frame, but it arrived late due to the shipping company’s error, please immediately contact us to make an appeal before we refuse the package.
What if I pre-ordered an item?
Even if you pre-ordered an item, we must still receive it within 45 days of your order date in order to give you a refund, so please try to only pre-order items you plan to keep. If the pre-ordered item arrives outside of the 45 day window from when you ordered it, you will have 7 days from the arrival date to send it back for store credit (minus original shipping cost) or a replacement.
Why was my package refused?
There are a number of reasons your package could be refused by us, including:

It was a new/demo item received outside of the 45-day window
It was a clearance, accessory, or other non-returnable item
The package is missing items that were included in the original shipment
The item shows signs of wear
The original product box was damaged or written on/the item was packaged in a separate shipping box

Mild Cognitive Impairment and Dementia
Definitions, Diagnosis, and Treatment
Glenn E. Smith and Mark W. Bondi

AACN Workshop Series

First compendium of all the recently released diagnostic criteria in this area
Only book on dementias with case presentations including multiple annual follow-ups and autopsy confirmation of the cases








Mild Cognitive Impairment and Dementia
Definitions, Diagnosis, and Treatment
Glenn E. Smith and Mark W. Bondi
AACN Workshop Series



Description



In 2011, National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer's Association joint task forces released proposed criteria for Alzheimer' disease diagnosis. These proposals included revisions to the nearly 30-year-old NINDS-ADRDA criteria for Alzheimer's diagnosis and added criteria for diagnosis of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer's disease. The same year the American Psychiatric Association proposed new criteria for major and minor neurocognitive disorders (the entities previously known as dementia and mild cognitive impairment, respectively). These new criteria reflect the research and clinical advances in identifying mild cognitive impairment and offer new opportunities for prevention, treatment, and management of neurodegenerative conditions. A major focus of this book is on the mild cognitive impairment prodrome of the common dementias. In addition to discussing the most common neurodegenerative conditions, many rare neurodegenerative conditions are highlighted. Most chapters include an autopsy-confirmed case presentation from the authors' files. Following the case presentation, those chapters present current diagnostic criteria, epidemiology, neuropathology/neurophysiology, genetics, neuroimaging studies as relevant, associated clinical features, differential neuropsychological features and possible interventions for each disorder. The pace of change in research and practice in the field of normal cognitive aging and dementia is increasing almost as fast as the median age of the population. The massive baby boom population bubble is currently entering the age of risk for neurodegenerative conditions. Neuropsychologists will play a major role in refining and applying these diagnoses, and in developing, testing, and refining interventions for these diagnoses, and in caring for this population. This book is intended to prepare neuropsychologists and others interested in neuropsychology to serve this fastest growing segment of our population.

Reviews and Awards


"I wanted to take a moment to publicly congratulate Glenn Smith and Mark Bondi on their text Mild Cognitive Impairment and Dementia, part of the AACN/Oxford Workshop Series. Every so often, a book comes out that represents kind of a 'hallmark' for our field: this is one such book. In my opinion, it is without rival on the topic of MCI and Dementia and it should be on the bookshelf of every neuropsychologist and their students. To me, it represents another shining example of the wonderful educational resources (e.g., conferences, workshop series of books) put forth by AACN. Congratulations to the authors and the editors!" -- Robert L Heilbronner, Assistant Professor of Clinical Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Northwestern University
