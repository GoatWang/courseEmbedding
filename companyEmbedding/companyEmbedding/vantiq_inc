Smart Systems PlatformOverviewConceptual ModelDefining Data StreamsDefining SituationsDefining Automation RulesUsing the Documentation



Smart Systems Platform
Overview
Smart Systems acquire relevant data, evaluate the real time situation represented by that data and respond to the identified situation either by taking a direct, automated action or by advising a user or another system that an action is warranted by the current situation. Such a system consists of data definitions for storing the sensor data and the situational state, logic for detecting and responding to situations, and data transport to move the data to the appropriate location for evaluation and storage.
For example, a specific situation might be defined as:

The weather is rainy and cold
The user is attending a baseball game
The game is delayed

If all these conditions are true, the desired situation is encountered and the system might notify an application that will then recommend various courses of action for the user. For example, the system might offer to bring the user hot coffee or perhaps offer to sell them a souvenir waterproof jacket.
In real time or near real time environments, processing is always better performed locally to the device under control improving response time and reliability. For example, in an industrial setting, managing the position of a materials handling system requires near real time responses within a few hundred milliseconds. Such response times cannot be guaranteed by a remote decision making system that may be delayed by 1,000âs of milliseconds if there is network congestion.
Vantiq is a high productivity, high-performance distributed system. Vantiq consists of:

Technologies for obtaining data from IoT sources and Enterprise sources, filtering the data and making it available to the automation decision engine.
Decision engine for analyzing the data in real time and making business decisions based on the results.
Technologies for sending control information to IoT devices and for notifying external systems and users of the decisions being made by the automation solution.
The solution affords the user high productivity by supporting the specification of the automation system at a much higher level than traditional service platforms. It also offers a set of tools that make the development, deployment, operation and management of the automation system as easy as possible. Since the data is externally sourced and the results must be delivered to external systems, a key to high productivity is flexible but simple integration capabilities for sources and devices.
Vantiq offers high performance by supporting a highly scalable cloud architecture incorporating a number of performance specific optimizations as well as local service deployments to support processing distributed to the network and to private data centers.
The solution is fully distributed supporting the TRANSPARENT development and optimization of automation solutions that span all layers of the distributed environment.

Conceptual Model
New events stream into the service from external data sources. If the arriving data is relevant to a particular rule, the rule is “triggered” and scheduled for execution. The rule may update the model state and, if the defined situation is detected, the corresponding actions defined by the rule are executed.
Vantiq detects specific situations as defined by rules. The rules are activated by changes to data streams that are presented to the service. In the above example, the data streams might be the weather conditions, the user’s location and the baseball game’s state.
The actions taken when a situation is detected might delivery notifications, request a recommendation or change the situational state.
Defining Data Streams
The first step in creating a solution is to define the inbound data. Multiple data streams may be defined. In the above example, three streams were defined:

Weather
User location
Game status

Each stream is represented by a type in the automation data model. The types are defined by the application developer and their definitions are only constrained by the capabilities of the data model.
Processing is initiated when an object is inserted, updated or deleted in one of the data stream types. For example, the Weather type could be defined using the JSON representation:
{
    "name": "Weather",
    "properties": {
        "location": { "type": "GeoJSON" },
        "temperature": { "type": "Integer" },
        "windSpeed": { "type": "Integer" },
        "visibility": { "type": "Integer" },
        "precipitation": { "type": "Real" },
        "overallEvaluation": { "type": "String" }
    }
}

Types, along with all other system objects, may defined using the Developer Portal, the Vantiq CLI or the Vantiq REST service. The specific Vantiq REST commands for creating types can be found in the Resource Reference Guide.
Once the automation data streams have been defined, it is the responsibility of the developer to provide the data feed to deliver objects of the stream type. Vantiq offers a  number of pre-packaged external sources that are easily configured to read a data stream from an external system. For example, a source could be defined to read the Weather from a weather service:
{
    "name": "WeatherSource",
    "type": "REMOTE",
    "direction": "SOURCE",
    "pipelineRules": ["ingestWeather"],
    "config": {
        "serverURIs": ["http://weather.arbitraryweatherdomain.com"],
        "username": "vantiq",
        "password": "vantiq",
        "queryForm": "url",
        "pollingInterval": 60
    }
}

This source will issue a GET on the URI every 60 seconds. When a response is returned the ingestWeather rule is invoked to process the inbound weather data.
Alternatively, an application might be created to obtain the relevant weather information for the user’s location. The data is then added to the stream using INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE commands from the Vantiq REST API. For example, to stream a new weather report the following INSERT could be issued:
POST https://dev.vantiq.com/api/v1/resources/types/Weather
{
    "location": {"type": "Point", coordinates: [122.3892, 37.7786]},
    "temperature": 57,
    "windSpeed": 12,
    "visibility": 1,
    "precipitation": 0.1,
    "overallEvaluation": "poor"
}

The specific REST commands for INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE on the data model can be found in the API Reference Guide.
This query might be issued every 15 minutes to update the current weather conditions.
The INSERT of the new weather condition will trigger any automation rules that have declared weather as a triggering condition.
Defining Situations
Once the automation data streams are defined, the representation of the situation itself is defined. The situation is represented by a state. Either a new type is defined that represents the situation or additional properties are added to an existing type to represent the situation. For example, a new type could be defined that identified the user and their current state at the ballpark:
{
    "name": "BallparkSituation",
    "properties": {
        "username": {"type": "String"},
        "currentLocation": {"type": "GeoJSON"},
        "currentSituation": {"type": "String"},
        "proactiveActions": {"type": "String", "multi": true}
    }
}

The current situation might be one of:

Arriving at ballpark
Actively watching (in their seat) and good conditions
Actively watching and poor weather
At concessions
Leaving ballpark

The states would be computed by the automation rules and stored in BallparkSituation.
Defining Automation Rules
With the automation data streams and the situations defined, the final step is to define the automation rules. Each rule is triggered by a change in the data streams. Once triggered, the rule is scheduled for execution. Execution involves calculating a context and then evaluating each rule against the context. If a rule’s condition is satisfied, the rule action is executed. Rule actions may cause the situation to change which may, in turn, trigger other rules. Processing continues until all rules triggered, directly or indirectly, by the initial state change are evaluated.
Automation rules are defined using the notation defined in Rule and Procedure Reference Guide and registered with the automation services using the REST API. The example ballpark application might have rules such as the following defined:
RULE uncomfortableConditions

WHEN INSERT OCCURS ON Weather:w WHERE w.location == "ballpark"

SELECT BallparkSituation

for (b in BallparkSituation) {
    if (w.temperature < 55 && w.precipitation > 0.05) {
        UPDATE BallparkSituation(currentSituation : "uncomfortably cold",
                                temperature: w.temperature)
                                WHERE _id == b._id
    }
}

This will be triggered by a new weather event and will evaluate BallparkSituations with respect to the new weather condition if the weather condition applies to the location of the ballpark. If the weather is poor, the current situation is updated. The update triggers a second situational rule to produce a recommended action.
RULE uncomfortableGuest

WHEN UPDATE OCCURS ON BallparkSituation:b

if (b.currentSituation == "uncomfortably cold") {
  PUBLISH REQUEST ON BallparkSituation WITH b
  PUBLISH { body:b } TO SOURCE guestServices
}

if (b.currentSituation == "uncomfortablly warm") {
  PUBLISH REQUEST ON BallparkSituation WITH b
  PUBLISH { body:b } TO SOURCE guestServices
}

This second rule produces possible actions to take on behalf of the guest and sends them to the guest services app presumably to produce offers for the guest delivered to their mobile device. Note that the actual implementation of the recommendations is the responsibility of the application using the automation service. The automation service simply identifies the situation of interest and, optionally, produces recommendations to be delivered to the business app.
The recommendation rule might look something like:
RULE coldGuest

WHEN request OCCURS ON BallparkSituation:b
  WHERE b.currentSituation == "uncomfortably cold"

SELECT BallparkOffers WHERE offerType == "uncomfortably cold"

FILTER offer in BallparkOffers RECOMMENDATIONS TO GuestRecommendations
UNTIL GuestRecommendations.size() < 5 DO
    MATCH
        if (offer.idealOfferTemperature > b.temperature - 5 &&
            offer.idealOfferTemperature < b.temperature + 5) {
            recommend(offer)
        }
    END
END

This will produce a list of recommendation for offers that are “optimal” for temperatures within +- 5 degrees of the current temperature.
Another Weather Rule
This example sends a notification to an external system at the endpoint specified and updates the WeatherSituation type with the newly identified situation:
RULE weatherExample

WHEN UPDATE OCCURS ON Weather

if (Weather.temperature < "50F" && Weather.windSpeed > "10MPH" &&
    Weather.precipitation > "0.1 inches") {
    PUBLISH {"body": {"situation": "poor"}} TO SOURCE weatherAdvisory
    UPDATE WeatherSituation(date: ars_currentDateTime, situation: "poor")
        WHERE location == Weather.location
}

The situation is named “weatherExample” as specified in the “RULE” clause.
The triggering condition is a change to the “Weather” type as specified in the “WHEN” clause. A change to Weather causes a re-evaluation of the current WeatherSituation.
The rule states that if the current temperature is less than 50 degrees F and the wind-speed is greater than 10 MPH and the precipitation is greater than 0.1 inches the current weather situation should be updated to “poor”. The THEN clause publishes a notification to the specified URL and stores the new situation in the WeatherSituation type.

The Democratsâ Better Way: Positive Messaging or Pandering to Trump Voters Who Are Never Coming Back?



George Washington law professor and economist praises Democrats for coming up with a message that preserves the partyâs commitment to social justice issues, rather than attempting to woo Trump voters by appealing to what Trump appealed to.

The Democratsâ Better Way: Positive Messaging or Pandering to Trump Voters Who Are Never Coming Back?



George Washington law professor and economist praises Democrats for coming up with a message that preserves the partyâs commitment to social justice issues, rather than attempting to woo Trump voters by appealing to what Trump appealed to.

ISVs + SIs – VANTIQ 














































































  
















			ISVs + SIs		


Franz Aman 


			2017-06-30T20:40:31+00:00		



VANTIQ FOR ISVS + SIS

The collaboration architecture of VANTIQ enables ISVs and SIs to easily build
systems that keep people in the loop.



Independent Software Vendors (ISVs)
and System Integrators (SIs)
VANTIQ is well-suited to meet the needs of ISVs and SIs. VANTIQ is an aPaaS (application Platform as a Service) environment. The platform allows partners to rapidly develop and offer their applications as a service in the cloud, private cloud and/or on-premises at the customer location(s). The collaboration architecture of VANTIQ enables ISVs and SIs to easily build systems that keep people in the loop. For many applications, this will offer significant competitive advantage and enable them to “set the stage” where others cannot easily follow.
VANTIQ provides modern API-based interoperability. By leveraging REST, web sockets and common messaging protocols (MQTT, AMQP), integration with external services supporting specialized functionality (modern or legacy) can be easily added to an application. Functionality developed in VANTIQ can also be called as a service.




ISVS
Independent Software Vendors
ISVs can leverage VANTIQ’s solutions to update their applications in realtime, deploy functionality incrementally and install in each customer’s distributed deployment environment without having to rewrite or update application logic. Service improvements or fixes can be rapidly deployed to all of the Cloud(s) or edge devices in a distributed environment. VANTIQ allows application logic to be placed into a configuration (a grouping of rules, procedures, types, and sources) which can be automatically distributed, turned on/off as requested, and set to run on all or a limited set of nodes. Configurations are named and can be versioned. They provide an easy way for ISVs to provide advanced capabilities to their customers, and then re-use them where appropriate.
Through VANTIQ, business opportunities can be identified in realtime with the ability to then provide highly specific content (e.g., specialized procedures, training materials) to connected users. This provides an ISV the opportunity to offer incremental, value-added services at any time.




ISVS
System Integrators
Once systems are deployed, ongoing maintenance and dynamic changes to application logic (cloud or edge) can be remotely managed to improve performance, remove defects, or respond to critical business changes. A configuration (a grouping of rules, procedures, types and sources) can be implemented, removed, and/or activated remotely to update functionality of an application. VANTIQ’s configurations and other unique capabilities enable System Integrators to provide value-added services for their customers throughout the lifecycle of an engagement. This becomes even more important with collaborative systems as improvements in human procedures and recommendations are susceptible to rapid change.
VANTIQ allows components built for a specific vertical market, such as retail or process manufacturing, to be easily reused in new systems enabling rapid deployment and higher levels of reliability. Components can be designed or reused that report on noncompliance issues (corporate, regulatory, or business process).
With VANTIQ, SIs can deliver functionality to their customers using an incremental approach. This allows revisions to business processes to occur at an appropriate speed for success. This applies to both the scale of transformation delivered and the breadth to which it is deployed. For example, when rolling out new functionality, it might make sense to automate only a few warehouses at a time. Or, allowing employees and suppliers to adapt to changes in the supply chain might dictate that a new delivery system add only one major function per month. VANTIQ supports integration and deployment flexibility to a degree that is unique in today’s environments.




Summary
VANTIQ was designed from the beginning to offer many features to enable ISVs and SIs to deliver functionality faster and with dramatically less effort. With the focus on collaboration, VANTIQ enables its partners to leap ahead of their competitors. VANTIQ is the only solution in the market to enable the collaboration between systems and people in real time as is required given the proliferation of today’s new technologies (IoT, Mobile, Cloud).

THE VANTIQ APPLICATION
PLATFORM



WHATSENSING THE WORLD ANALYZING THE WORLD ACTING ON THE WORLD RESULT









WHAT VANTIQ DOES
The VANTIQ application platform allows every company to rapidly build, deploy and run Real-time Business Applications driven by data-streams of any kind, including data from existing systems and people.
Sense, Analyze and Act
Real-time Business Applications built in VANTIQ can sense, analyze, and act on what is happening in real time to drive immediate business results by effectively utilizing and augmenting the innumerable and growing modern technologies.





Sensing the Word
Real-time Applications built with VANTIQ ingest multiple streams of data and events to continuously and accurately reflect the real world
Data streams originating in the environment such as new readings from real-time sensors, requests from mobile devices and changes in a legacy system, are continuously fed into the Sense stage of the application. This stage also translates and aggregates external data to create events within the system, and maintains an internal current state representation of the environment.













Analyzing the World
The Analyze stage identifies situations of interest where immediate action is required to solve a problem or capitalize on an opportunity
The Sense stage provides information, but lacks knowledge of what is important. The Analysis stage continuously analyzes changes in the environment by using business rules, external services, and  imported machine learning models to identify situations of interest that subsequently get resolved in the Act stage.









Acting on the World
Real-time Applications use automation
where possible and collaboration where
necessary to achieve the desired
outcomes.
As situations of interest occur, the Act stage is responsible for intelligently managing how the system responds. Applications built with VANTIQ support two modes of action: Automation and Collaboration. Automated responses may be taken directly by the application or may be forwarded to a more specialized system for implementation. Collaboration includes intelligent interaction between the system and the responsible individuals to respond to a situation.
 



The Result: Increased Business Agility
The VANTIQ platform drastically shortens time-to-value and increases agility by hiding complexity so developers building Real-time Applications can focus on delivering real-time business value, not infrastructure.

THE INNOVATION CHALLENGE
Modern technologies are breakthroughs you can use to innovate. But doing so is hard and getting harder.
Uber and Amazon are software companies. GE is becoming one. As venture capitalist Marc Andreessen famously wrote, “software is eating the world.” What about your industry? Are you safe? Are you a successful manufacturer or retailer that does not need to rapidly and dramatically change?
OK, WE ALL KNOW IT IS HAPPENING
…innovate with technology or go the way of the dodo bird. Let’s say you are a successful company. You have the capital. You have the ideas. Modern technologies like the IoT, AI, and mobile devices are breakthroughs that can be used to innovate.
But, and this is a big but, doing it with today’s software tools is hard and getting harder.









PLATFORM FOR INNOVATION
The Event-driven Applications You Build with VANTIQ Will Drive the Next Wave of Enterprise Innovation
Applications created with the VANTIQ software development platform are smart enough to know what information is important, what decisions need to be made, which people need to be involved, which actions to take as well as where and when to take them.
These applications dramatically improve customer experiences, create new business opportunities and drive unprecedented operational efficiencies.

VANTIQ Hides Complexity
One user said they would not have been able to build their system without VANTIQ. Another said their developers were an order of magnitude more productive.

FOCUS
VANTIQ’s Technology Focus




ArchitectureVANTIQ has taken a “clean sheet” approach to building its solutions, enabling a leapfrog of current products in the market. VANTIQ’s architecture allows customers to develop applications at a very high level of abstraction. The VANTIQ fully modern architecture is based on Reactive, distributed, dynamic, and collaborative capabilities.



Industry Standard TechVANTIQ’s technology and architecture is based on industry standard technologies wherever possible, such as common communications protocols (HTTP, MQTT, AMQP), languages (SQL and JavaScript), and cloud platforms (AWS and Azure).



PaaS and SaaSThe VANTIQ application platform is an integrated application Platform as a Service (aPaaS) to develop, deploy and run real-time business applications driven by data streams, existing systems and people. All applications built with VANTIQ run as Software as a Service (SaaS) in the Cloud, on the edge, on premise or in a hybrid model.



High SecuritySecurity is non-negotiable. VANTIQ interfaces to and utilizes leading security protocols and is designed to support new standards as they emerge.



Real-time MonitoringVANTIQ provides the very important, but often overlooked, management aspects associated with mission-critical systems such as provisioning, real-time monitoring, security and availability. These are complex elements in today’s distributed environments and will soon move from being nice-to-have features to market requirements.



Real-time SolutionsApplications built with VANTIQ are event-driven, asynchronous and therefore uniquely qualified to power real-time businesses. To enable this, VANTIQ solutions address performance issues such as small footprint, fast logic execution, and reduced network traffic.
