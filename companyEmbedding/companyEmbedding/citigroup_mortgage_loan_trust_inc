                          Protect Yourself from Common Loan Assistance Scams
To avoid challenges and obstacles along the path to preventing foreclosure, consider the help of a professional HUD, state, or other not for profit representatives.   
Unfortunately, there are several scam artists seeking to take advantage of homeowners in financial trouble. These people often market themselves as “foreclosure representatives” or as working for a “loan modification company”. These people may even tell you that they are acting on CitiMortgage's behalf in the loan modification process. We advise that you use caution when dealing with any third party that claims they can save your home from foreclosure or obtain a loan modification for you. 
At CitiMortgage, we are happy to work directly with you to try to find a workable solution to your situation. We independently review borrower information and process loan modifications for eligible borrowers. We never charge a fee to process a hardship loan modification. Unauthorized Third Parties often require you to pay an upfront fee or request that you make your mortgage payments directly to them. Please contact the Homeowner Support Team at 1-866-272-4749† if you have any questions or concerns about a solicitation for loan modification services.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
