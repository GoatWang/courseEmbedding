Benzinga's Top Upgrades, Downgrades For June 22, 2017 

Watch These 3 Huge Put Purchases In Wednesday Trade 

Analysts at UBS turned bullish on Magellan Midstream Partners, L.P. (NYSE: MMP), a limited partnership engaged in the transportation, storage, and distribution of crude, gasoline, and diesel fuel amid a surge in oil exports from the United States.
The firm's Shneur Gershuni upgraded Magellan Midstream's stock from Neutral to Buy with an unchanged $82 price target.
American energy companies are benefiting from a 1,600 percent surge in oil exports over the past four years after the U.S. Congress removed a four-decade old ban on crude experts, Gershuni noted in his report. Meanwhile, domestic oil production continues to ramp and companies are seeing improvements in extraction costs. This trend benefits Magellan Midstream, especially as it's evaluating opportunities in Galena Park and Pasadena Marine where it has a "firm and shadow backlog" of several attractive projects.
Magellan Midstream is expected to provide an update in its second-quarter earnings report (August 2) for information on the expansion of the BridgeTex pipeline.
Also, the next phases for Seabrook and Pasadena serve as potential catalysts for the stock but funding "could be a question" given management's history of not issuing equity.
Finally, Magellan Midstream's stock valuation as measured by 2017E EV/EBITDA and P/DCF remains a premium versus some of its peers but has contracted as of late which makes the stock more attractive at current levels, the analyst concluded.

Magellan could see financials dinged by Texas pipeline spill
Zacks Equities Research puts the company's stock at sell, pointing to the dual strains of a pipeline incident and a weak market.

July 18 (UPI) -- A spill from a Texas oil pipeline could add to pressure from a weak market and hurt the bottom line for Magellan Midstream Partners, an investment service said.
Magellan said during the weekend that repairs were made to its Longhorn pipeline system and the network was back in service less than a week after a contractor working on the pipeline struck a fitting during routine maintenance activities, causing a spill.
A similar incident caused the release of about 1,000 barrels of oil from a pipeline system operated by Magellan in Oklahoma two years ago. A report from Zacks Equities Research put Magellan (NYSE: MMP) at sell.
"We would like to inform investors that Magellan's non-fee based assets continue to be under pressure due to weak crude prices," the report read. "This may result in reduced earnings and revenues for the firm. The leakage in the Longhorn pipeline may make matters worse."
Magellan releases financial results for the second quarter Aug. 2. The company reported net income of $222.7 million for the first quarter, an improvement of 7.5 percent, or $15.6 million, from first quarter 2016. For the year, the company said it expected to spend about $600 million for the year, but lower that to $350 million next year.
The preliminary size of the release from the Longhorn pipeline was around 1,200 barrels and the spill caused the brief evacuation of 15 residences in Bastrop County, located in southeast Texas. Residents were allowed to return later on the same day as the incident.
The Longhorn system carries about 275,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day from the Permian shale basin in Texas to area refineries and southern U.S. export terminals.
The company said it had about 100 representatives on site monitoring activities. Site monitoring and clean-up operations were ongoing.
No waterways were contaminated and no injuries were reported as a result of the release.

How Risky Is Magellan Midstream Partners, L.P.?
Three key metrics suggest that this MLP is fairly low risk, though those numbers alone don’t mean this investment is risk-free.











                Matthew DiLallo
            

                (TMFmd19)



            
            Jul 18, 2017 at 10:35AM
            
            





Magellan Midstream Partners (NYSE:MMP) operates a relatively low-risk business model since the bulk of its earnings come from an extensive portfolio of fee-based pipelines and storage terminals. However, building that stable portfolio is just one of the steps the company has taken to keep risk at bay. Here's a closer look at how it stacks up against its peers and how its lower risk profile has helped the company overcome obstacles in the past so it could continue paying a growing distribution to investors.
Drilling down into the numbers
Three critical numbers for MLP investors are the percentage of cash flow underpinned by fees, the distribution coverage ratio, and the leverage ratio. Here's how Magellan Midstream Partners' metrics compare to several notable rivals:




Company


Debt-to-Adjusted EBITDA


Current Distribution Coverage Ratio


% of Cash Flow Fee-Based or Regulated 






Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE:EPD)


4.3 times


1.2 times


93%




Magellan Midstream Partners


3.5 times


1.2 times


87%




Plains All American Pipeline (NYSE:PAA)


4.8 times


1.0 times


90%




Williams Partners (NYSE:WPZ)


4.5 times


1.17 times


97%




Data source: Magellan Midstream Partners, Enterprise Products Partners, Plains All American Pipeline, and Williams Partners. 
As that chart shows, Magellan Midstream Partners has some of the most conservative metrics in its peer group. Its leverage ratio, for example, is well under 4.0 times, which is considered a safe zone for MLPs. Likewise, the company can currently cover its generous payout with room to spare since it has one of the highest coverage ratios in the group. Those two metrics, when combined with the fact that fee-based contracts underpin about 87% of its cash flow is why the company has one of the best credit ratings among MLPs, tied with Enterprise Products Partners.
That said, if there is one concern with those metrics, it's that fees only underpin 87% of cash flow, which is the lowest in the group. This factor has had an impact on the company in recent years. For example, last year distributable cash flow barely budged despite the completion of several growth projects. Meanwhile, the company was only able to reaffirm its guidance for 2017 even after securing a new contract for a recently completed project because the cash flow from that agreement would only offset the negative impact that weaker-than-expected commodity prices are having on earnings. However, with ample distribution coverage, the company has plenty of cushion to ensure that it can continue paying its distribution even if prices remain weak, which puts its payout on a much more sustainable footing than Plains All American Pipelines since it's just barely covering its distribution. Meanwhile, the company continues investing capital in building more fee-based assets that should further mute its direct exposure to commodity prices.

Risk mitigation in action
Magellan Midstream Partners' numbers suggest that it shouldn't have any problem maintaining its payout even if it runs into an unexpected issue. That has certainly been the case during the recent oil market downturn since it has been able to not only maintain its payout but has joined Enterprise Products Partners as one of the few MLPs that has continued growing its distribution. 
One reason Magellan has been able to do this is due to its top-notch balance sheet, which has proven to be a competitive advantage during the downturn because it has been able to access capital at a much cheaper rate than rivals. For example, Williams Partners had to offer a 7.85% interest rate to entice investors to buy the $1 billion of 10-year debt it was selling early last year when it needed cash for a looming debt maturity and to finance expansion. Meanwhile, Plains All American Pipeline had to offer an 8% yielding preferred to get the $1.5 billion it needed last year to fund expansion projects. Contrast those rates with the 5% that Magellan locked in when it offered $650 million of 10-year notes early last year so that it could refinance debt and fund growth projects.
Given their much higher capital costs, both Williams Partners and Plains All American Pipelines would go on to slash their payouts by double digits last year to shore up their financial situations. Meanwhile, because Magellan had no problem accessing the capital it needed, it was able to increase its payout by 10% last year and is on pace to grow it by 8% in 2017 and by the same rate in 2018. 





Investor takeaway
Magellan Midstream Partners boasts some of the most conservative financial metrics in its peer groups. Those have proven to be a crucial advantage in recent years because they've allowed the company to overcome several obstacles. That history demonstrates to investors that Magellan is a low-risk company that has the financial strength to make it through tough times.

July 17 (UPI) -- Repairs to a pipeline that ruptured last week in Texas and spilled 1,200 barrels of oil have been completed and the line is back in service, the operator said.
A handful of homes were evacuated Thursday after the release from the Longhorn pipeline system, operated by Magellan Midstream Partners. The company said a contractor working on the pipeline struck a fitting during routine maintenance activities, causing the spill.
"The release, which occurred on the morning of July 13th, was not a pipeline rupture," the company explained in an emailed statement. "It is clear that the release was caused by a contractor striking a below ground fitting on Magellan's Longhorn Pipeline with construction equipment."
In an emailed update, the company said repairs were completed and the line was returned to service late Sunday morning.
A similar incident caused the release of about 1,000 barrels of oil from a pipeline system operated by Magellan in Oklahoma two years ago. The company reported a pipeline in Iowa leaked diesel fuel in January.
All residents evacuated from the site in southeast Texas were allowed to return home on the same day as the incident last week.
The company said it had about 100 representatives on site monitoring activities. Site monitoring and clean-up operations were ongoing.
No waterways were contaminated and no injuries were reported as a result of the release.

Magellan's 275,000 barrel per day (bpd) Longhorn Pipeline, which transports crude oil from Crane, Texas to Houston, ruptured about four miles (6 km) southwest of Bastrop, a town not far from the state capital of Austin. The company shut the pipeline and isolated the affected segment, it said. People from 15 residences near the site were evacuated due to the spill but will be cleared by authorities to return home late on Thursday, the company statement said. A road shut following the spill is expected to remain closed until at least Friday, the Bastrop County Office of Emergency Management said on Twitter. The pipeline was ruptured when a contractor doing maintenance work hit a fitting, Magellan said. The line was in service at the time. The spilled oil has been contained around the site and it did not reach water, Magellan said. Around 100 representatives were involved in cleanup efforts, the company added. The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) said in an email that it had dispatched an inspector to the site. The Longhorn Pipeline transports crude oil from the prolific Permian Basin shale of West Texas to the major refining and export center in Houston, Texas. Crude oil prices in West Texas slid following news of the spill, while Houston oil prices firmed on the potential supply disruption. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) WTC-WTM at Midland, Texas, fell to about a $1.45 a barrel discount to WTI futures , off around 15 cents a barrel from Wednesday, traders said. Oil traded at the Magellan East Houston terminal rose by 10 cents to a $1.80 a barrel premium to U.S. crude futures.

An open session to assess customer interest
BridgeTex Pipeline Company launched an open session primarily to evaluate customer interest in capacity expansion and a new origin in Midland, Texas. Interested customers must submit their binding commitment by 5:00 PM CT on August 04, 2017.
BridgeTex Pipeline's expansion plans
Beginning of this year, the BridgeTex Pipeline announced plans to augment its capacity from 3,00,000 bpd (i.e. barrels per day) to 4,00,000 bpd to transport Permian Basin crude oil from Colorado City, Texas to the Houston Gulf Coast area. The increased capacity will be available in Q2 2017 after improvements in its existing pumps and related equipment. If justified by customer demand, BridgeTex would further increase its pipeline capacity to around 440,000 bpd. This plan of capacity expansion was announced after commodity trader Trafigura signed a long-term deal with Plains All American Pipeline for the off-take of 100K bpd of Permian crude and condensate to be delivered to the Gulf Coast.
Also, recently Enterprise Product Partners signed up additional shippers on its Midland, Texas, to Sealy, Texas, crude pipeline. The open session by BridgeTex could be an effort to match the capacity on the Midland to Sealy line.

		Workers clean up a site where more than 50,000 gallons of crude oil was spilled in Bastrop on July 13.



		
			Updated:  4:14 p.m. Monday, July 24, 2017 | 
		
		Posted:  3:59 p.m. Monday, July 24, 2017






On July 13, at around 9 a.m., more than 50,000 gallons of crude oil spilled out of a Magellan Midstream Partners pipeline near Bastrop and forced 15 nearby families to evacuate their homes. A contractor had accidentally punctured the line during normal maintenance. About 100 responders quickly descended on the scene, including members of state and federal agencies, emergency responders and Magellan’s own employees.Around 5 p.m. the families were cleared to return to their homes with a promise from Magellan they would be reimbursed for any costs they incurred during their evacuation. Spills like these are scary, especially for those involved — but they’re also rare.












CONTINUING COVERAGE: Ruptured pipeline spills 50,000 gallons of crude oil in Bastrop County.

In all the worry surrounding pipelines like Keystone XL or the Dakota Access Pipeline, it is easy to forget that pipelines are generally the safest and most efficient way to move oil — both environmentally and for the workers involved. Spills like the one in Texas dominate the news whenever they happen, so pipelines often appear much more accident-prone than they are. Although mistakes are inexcusable, news reports have never mentioned how almost all the oil transported that day moved without incident. Lobbying groups for oil and gas routinely laud their safety records: 99.999 percent of oil is transported safely through pipelines. In 2013, the Association of Oil Pipelines reported that 8.3 billion barrels of crude oil were moved via pipeline. That’s more than 22 million barrels a day. Brigham McCown, a former administrator of the Department of Transportation’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, argues that, “Pipelines transport the lion’s share of crude oil because they are the safest, most environmentally friendly, and least expensive way to transport large volumes of energy products.” Researchers at Canada’s Fraser Institute found that rail transportation of oil results in 2.4 fatalities each year, while trucking oil across the United States kills almost 10 people per year. By contrast, pipelines result in 1.7 fatalities per year. These differences are simple to explain. Unlike highways, pipelines and rail are far away from people. When there are pipeline accidents, there are less likely to be casualties.Not only are pipelines less likely to harm others, they also help limit the environmental impact of spills. Much of what spills out of pipelines — oil or otherwise — can be recovered. The average percentage of liquids recovered from pipeline spills from 1992 to 2011 was 40 percent. Because oil is a valuable commodity, spills are expensive and companies want to avoid them just as much as the most ardent environmentalists. The profit motive encourages companies to keep their operations safe and environmentally sound.The Bastrop spill is noteworthy because of its rarity — but also because of how well those involved appear to have responded. No one was harmed and, even though people were evacuated from their homes, they safely returned later the same day. The company is also compensating those affected. Rightfully so.
LIKE US ON FACEBOOK: Our Viewpoints page brings the latest commentaries to your feed.


Red or blue, oversight of dangerous environmental issues like oil spills is likely to be one of the few agreed-upon roles for government. In fact, many of the responders on the scene of the spill were government officials. Government can help monitor and prevent these problems and provide recourse for those harmed in the event those responsible are less than forthright and proactive when individuals are hurt. Legal rules for transporting oil should ensure those harmed have powerful avenues for recourse and must mandate companies maintain safe and clean operations. One day, pipelines will be replaced with something better — but they are currently the least bad means for oil transportation. Seeing the whole picture is integral to effective regulation. When deciding how to regulate and control crude oil, it’s vital that policymakers remember not just that the oil spilled, but that the oil moved safely.

			 By aligning the U.S. with Saudi Arabia, President Donald Trump is foolishly looking only to the short term. Iran is already the most influential country in Iraq. Its ally, Hezbollah, is the greatest force in Lebanon. Together, they are the primary reason why Bashar al-Assad is holding on in Syria. Iran is behind the rebellion in Yemen. Its influence...

How Risky Is Magellan Midstream Partners, L.P.?
Three key metrics suggest that this MLP is fairly low risk, though those numbers alone don’t mean this investment is risk-free.

Magellan Midstream Partners (NYSE:MMP) operates a relatively low-risk business model since the bulk of its earnings come from an extensive portfolio of fee-based pipelines and storage terminals. However, building that stable portfolio is just one of the steps the company has taken to keep risk at bay. Here's a closer look at how it stacks up against its peers and how its lower risk profile has helped the company overcome obstacles in the past so it could continue paying a growing distribution to investors.
Drilling down into the numbers
Three critical numbers for MLP investors are the percentage of cash flow underpinned by fees, the distribution coverage ratio, and the leverage ratio. Here's how Magellan Midstream Partners' metrics compare to several notable rivals:




Company


Debt-to-Adjusted EBITDA


Current Distribution Coverage Ratio


% of Cash Flow Fee-Based or Regulated 






Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE:EPD)


4.3 times


1.2 times


93%




Magellan Midstream Partners


3.5 times


1.2 times


87%




Plains All American Pipeline (NYSE:PAA)


4.8 times


1.0 times


90%




Williams Partners (NYSE:WPZ)


4.5 times


1.17 times


97%




Data source: Magellan Midstream Partners, Enterprise Products Partners, Plains All American Pipeline, and Williams Partners. 
As that chart shows, Magellan Midstream Partners has some of the most conservative metrics in its peer group. Its leverage ratio, for example, is well under 4.0 times, which is considered a safe zone for MLPs. Likewise, the company can currently cover its generous payout with room to spare since it has one of the highest coverage ratios in the group. Those two metrics, when combined with the fact that fee-based contracts underpin about 87% of its cash flow is why the company has one of the best credit ratings among MLPs, tied with Enterprise Products Partners.
That said, if there is one concern with those metrics, it's that fees only underpin 87% of cash flow, which is the lowest in the group. This factor has had an impact on the company in recent years. For example, last year distributable cash flow barely budged despite the completion of several growth projects. Meanwhile, the company was only able to reaffirm its guidance for 2017 even after securing a new contract for a recently completed project because the cash flow from that agreement would only offset the negative impact that weaker-than-expected commodity prices are having on earnings. However, with ample distribution coverage, the company has plenty of cushion to ensure that it can continue paying its distribution even if prices remain weak, which puts its payout on a much more sustainable footing than Plains All American Pipelines since it's just barely covering its distribution. Meanwhile, the company continues investing capital in building more fee-based assets that should further mute its direct exposure to commodity prices.

Risk mitigation in action
Magellan Midstream Partners' numbers suggest that it shouldn't have any problem maintaining its payout even if it runs into an unexpected issue. That has certainly been the case during the recent oil market downturn since it has been able to not only maintain its payout but has joined Enterprise Products Partners as one of the few MLPs that has continued growing its distribution. 
One reason Magellan has been able to do this is due to its top-notch balance sheet, which has proven to be a competitive advantage during the downturn because it has been able to access capital at a much cheaper rate than rivals. For example, Williams Partners had to offer a 7.85% interest rate to entice investors to buy the $1 billion of 10-year debt it was selling early last year when it needed cash for a looming debt maturity and to finance expansion. Meanwhile, Plains All American Pipeline had to offer an 8% yielding preferred to get the $1.5 billion it needed last year to fund expansion projects. Contrast those rates with the 5% that Magellan locked in when it offered $650 million of 10-year notes early last year so that it could refinance debt and fund growth projects.
Given their much higher capital costs, both Williams Partners and Plains All American Pipelines would go on to slash their payouts by double digits last year to shore up their financial situations. Meanwhile, because Magellan had no problem accessing the capital it needed, it was able to increase its payout by 10% last year and is on pace to grow it by 8% in 2017 and by the same rate in 2018. 





Investor takeaway
Magellan Midstream Partners boasts some of the most conservative financial metrics in its peer groups. Those have proven to be a crucial advantage in recent years because they've allowed the company to overcome several obstacles. That history demonstrates to investors that Magellan is a low-risk company that has the financial strength to make it through tough times.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
