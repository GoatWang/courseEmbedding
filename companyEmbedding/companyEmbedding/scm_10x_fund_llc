History[edit]
Founding and early acquisitions (2002–2009)[edit]
See also: MAPICS, Geac Computer Corporation, and SSA Global
Infor was founded in June 2002[11] under the name Agilsys in Malvern, Pennsylvania.[11] With 1,300 customers to start[11] and a focus on enterprise software,[10] the company was constructed through a series of acquisitions[10][11] led by private equity backers Golden Gate Capital and Summit Partners.[17] In December 2002, Agilisys International acquired Brain AG,[18] followed by the acquisition of Future Three[19] the following June.[20] Agilisys moved its headquarters to Alpharetta in the Atlanta metropolitan area,[21] and in February 2004 acquired Infor Business Solutions, a German company headquartered in Friedrichsthal (Saar), Germany.[22] Daly.commerce[23] was acquired by Agilisys in early 2004. In September 2004, Agilisys changed its name to Infor Global Solutions.[24] On October 20, 2004, Infor announced the acquisition of Lilly Software Associates[25] and its VISUAL Enterprise (now referred to as VISUAL ERP[26]) suite of products.
In February 2005, Infor acquired MAPICS for around US D$347 million,[11] and subsequently acquired GEAC ERP[11] in 2006[27] for US$1 billion.[11] After a lawsuit filed in May 2006 attempted to halt SSA Global's merger with Infor unless certain shareholder demands were met,[28] Infor later completed the purchase and integrated the company.[29] Golden Gate’s early push for acquisitions resulted in Infor having 17,500 customers by the summer of 2006.[11] Also that year, Infor began rewriting industry-specific applications into up-to-date .Net and Java-based application providers.[30]
New management and move (2010–2013)[edit]
After several acquisitions,[31][32] in October 2010, Infor’s board of directors hired a new management team composed of four senior executives from Oracle Corporation, all four of whom joined Infor on the same day. Charles Phillips was appointed CEO, Pam Murphy was appointed chief operating officer (COO), and Duncan Angove and Stephan School became co-presidents.[10] Phillips established a new strategic direction as CEO.[10] In order to gain market share on Oracle and SAP, Infor also focused on providing applications with user-friendly interfaces,[33] while continuing to rewrite applications into new code.[30] The company acquired ERP rival Lawson Software for US$2 billion in 2011.[12][13] Infor launched its Infor10 line of products in September 2011. Within the products were the ION middleware suite and a new user interface.[34]
In the summer of 2012, Infor relocated its headquarters from Alpharetta, Georgia[21] to New York City, citing the availability of engineers and designers in “Silicon Alley,”[35] investment in the technology educational sector by a consortium of universities, and the proximity to customers.[21] With several hundred employees remaining in Georgia, Infor’s new "loft-style" offices at 641 Avenue of the Americas in Manhattan were designed with the intent of promoting "collaboration and transparency."[21] Infor acquired Groupe Laurier CIM in August 2012.[36] On December 4, 2012, Infor announced it had acquired Orbis Global, which used a software as a service model for its marketing resource management software. Infor integrated Orbis Global's technology into its own customer experience product suite.[37][38]
"Micro-vertical" focus and pivot to cloud (2013–2014)[edit]
See also: CERTPOINT Systems
After the 2010 management changes,[35] Infor began specializing in "micro-verticals," purpose building its software to meet the needs of customers in niche industries. Arguing that similar businesses have similar software needs,[34] CEO Phillips explained in January 2012 that the food and beverage industry, for example, is made up of smaller "micro-verticals" such as bakers, butchers, and breweries, each of which have unique needs.[35] In contrast to many of its competitors, Infor designs software with the intent that companies can use the programs immediately, without consultation or customization.[35] As of 2013, Infor continued to rework industry-specific applications from older software languages into more widely used .Net and Java programming languages.[30] On April 2, 2013, Infor announced the acquisition of CERTPOINT Systems, a software as a service learning technologies company.[39][40] On May 16, 2013,[41] Infor acquired TDCI, Inc.,[41][42] and by late 2013, Infor had launched 300 new products[43] and hired 1,500 new engineers since 2010.[44] Among other companies, Infor acquired PeopleAnswers in January 2014.[45] Advancements in cloud computing[35] enabled Infor to integrate applications into suites for specific industries and sell them as a service.[46] Infor debuted its Infor CloudSuite product, which is delivered exclusively through Amazon Web Services (AWS), in 2014.[7] CloudSuite is designed to integrate software solutions intended for "micro-vertical" industries.[47] Infor also formed partnerships with Red Hat and EnterpriseDB to offer an open-source PostgreSQL stack that year,[9] and Infor's net income in 2014 equaled US$121.7 million.[48]
GT Nexus acquisition (2015–2016)[edit]
See also: GT Nexus


"Infor is the amalgamation of more than 40 software acquisitions brought together by private equity backers Golden Gate Capital and Summit Partners. Beginning in 2002, Golden Gate began assembling the company to provide the kind of nuts-and-bolts enterprise software that has proved one of the hottest sectors in tech. Under [CEO] Phillips, the company has surged. It now sells its wares to more than 70,000 corporations, including clients Bausch & Lomb, Ferrari, and Heineken."


— Fortune on August 15, 2015"[10]


The company saw around a 300 percent increase in service bookings in 2015, with revenue up that year up around 60 percent. New clients that year included Wyndham Hotels, Ferrari, the San Francisco Municipal Transport Agency, Hershey Entertainment and Resorts, Boskalis, EBSCO, Legacy Health, Best Western International, and Kaman Industrial Technologies, among others. By July 2015, Infor had around 45 million users signed up to use its cloud computing software.[4]
On August 11, 2015, Infor announced its upcoming acquisition of GT Nexus for $675 million. At the time, GT Nexus was the world's largest cloud-based global commerce platform,[14][49] with customers such as Nike Inc., Adidas AG, Home Depot Inc. and Procter & Gamble[50] and $100 billion of trade in direct goods conducted each year though its network.[49] Explained Bloomberg, the acquired technology allows Infor customers to "leave elaborate business-management systems that run at headquarters untouched while supplying those clients’ plants with programs specialized by industry and delivered via cloud computing."[50] Infor acquired Predictix in July 2016,[15] at which point Infor related that it had "more than 58 million users" in the "Infor cloud."[15] Active in 200 countries and territories with around 15,000 employees,[16] Infor is currently the third largest enterprise technology provider in the world.[10]
Investment by Koch Industries (2017)[edit]
In February 2017, Koch Equity Development LLC invested $2.68 billion in Infor, for a 66.67% equity ownership stake in the company. Infor is valued at $10 billion, and has $6 billion of debt, most of which is publicly-traded.[citation needed]
Software[edit]
Since CEO Charles Phillips joined Infor in 2010, the company has focused on creating applications that result in a positive user experience, among other factors such as efficiency.[12][51] Infor deploys its applications primarily on the Amazon Web Services cloud[52] and open source platforms.[53]

Infor is a multi-national privately held United States-based enterprise software company.[2] Headquartered in New York City,[3] Infor focuses on business applications for organizations and delivered via cloud computing as a service.[4] Originally focused on software ranging from financial systems and enterprise resource planning (ERP) to supply chain and customer relationship management,[5][6] in 2010 Infor began to focus on software for industry niches,[7] as well as user-friendly software design. Infor deploys its cloud applications through Amazon Web Services[7] and various open source software platforms.[8][9]

History[edit]
Founding and early acquisitions (2002–2009)[edit]
See also: MAPICS, Geac Computer Corporation, and SSA Global
Infor was founded in June 2002[11] under the name Agilsys in Malvern, Pennsylvania.[11] With 1,300 customers to start[11] and a focus on enterprise software,[10] the company was constructed through a series of acquisitions[10][11] led by private equity backers Golden Gate Capital and Summit Partners.[17] In December 2002, Agilisys International acquired Brain AG,[18] followed by the acquisition of Future Three[19] the following June.[20] Agilisys moved its headquarters to Alpharetta in the Atlanta metropolitan area,[21] and in February 2004 acquired Infor Business Solutions, a German company headquartered in Friedrichsthal (Saar), Germany.[22] Daly.commerce[23] was acquired by Agilisys in early 2004. In September 2004, Agilisys changed its name to Infor Global Solutions.[24] On October 20, 2004, Infor announced the acquisition of Lilly Software Associates[25] and its VISUAL Enterprise (now referred to as VISUAL ERP[26]) suite of products.
In February 2005, Infor acquired MAPICS for around US D$347 million,[11] and subsequently acquired GEAC ERP[11] in 2006[27] for US$1 billion.[11] After a lawsuit filed in May 2006 attempted to halt SSA Global's merger with Infor unless certain shareholder demands were met,[28] Infor later completed the purchase and integrated the company.[29] Golden Gate’s early push for acquisitions resulted in Infor having 17,500 customers by the summer of 2006.[11] Also that year, Infor began rewriting industry-specific applications into up-to-date .Net and Java-based application providers.[30]
New management and move (2010–2013)[edit]
After several acquisitions,[31][32] in October 2010, Infor’s board of directors hired a new management team composed of four senior executives from Oracle Corporation, all four of whom joined Infor on the same day. Charles Phillips was appointed CEO, Pam Murphy was appointed chief operating officer (COO), and Duncan Angove and Stephan School became co-presidents.[10] Phillips established a new strategic direction as CEO.[10] In order to gain market share on Oracle and SAP, Infor also focused on providing applications with user-friendly interfaces,[33] while continuing to rewrite applications into new code.[30] The company acquired ERP rival Lawson Software for US$2 billion in 2011.[12][13] Infor launched its Infor10 line of products in September 2011. Within the products were the ION middleware suite and a new user interface.[34]
In the summer of 2012, Infor relocated its headquarters from Alpharetta, Georgia[21] to New York City, citing the availability of engineers and designers in “Silicon Alley,”[35] investment in the technology educational sector by a consortium of universities, and the proximity to customers.[21] With several hundred employees remaining in Georgia, Infor’s new "loft-style" offices at 641 Avenue of the Americas in Manhattan were designed with the intent of promoting "collaboration and transparency."[21] Infor acquired Groupe Laurier CIM in August 2012.[36] On December 4, 2012, Infor announced it had acquired Orbis Global, which used a software as a service model for its marketing resource management software. Infor integrated Orbis Global's technology into its own customer experience product suite.[37][38]
"Micro-vertical" focus and pivot to cloud (2013–2014)[edit]
See also: CERTPOINT Systems
After the 2010 management changes,[35] Infor began specializing in "micro-verticals," purpose building its software to meet the needs of customers in niche industries. Arguing that similar businesses have similar software needs,[34] CEO Phillips explained in January 2012 that the food and beverage industry, for example, is made up of smaller "micro-verticals" such as bakers, butchers, and breweries, each of which have unique needs.[35] In contrast to many of its competitors, Infor designs software with the intent that companies can use the programs immediately, without consultation or customization.[35] As of 2013, Infor continued to rework industry-specific applications from older software languages into more widely used .Net and Java programming languages.[30] On April 2, 2013, Infor announced the acquisition of CERTPOINT Systems, a software as a service learning technologies company.[39][40] On May 16, 2013,[41] Infor acquired TDCI, Inc.,[41][42] and by late 2013, Infor had launched 300 new products[43] and hired 1,500 new engineers since 2010.[44] Among other companies, Infor acquired PeopleAnswers in January 2014.[45] Advancements in cloud computing[35] enabled Infor to integrate applications into suites for specific industries and sell them as a service.[46] Infor debuted its Infor CloudSuite product, which is delivered exclusively through Amazon Web Services (AWS), in 2014.[7] CloudSuite is designed to integrate software solutions intended for "micro-vertical" industries.[47] Infor also formed partnerships with Red Hat and EnterpriseDB to offer an open-source PostgreSQL stack that year,[9] and Infor's net income in 2014 equaled US$121.7 million.[48]
GT Nexus acquisition (2015–2016)[edit]
See also: GT Nexus


"Infor is the amalgamation of more than 40 software acquisitions brought together by private equity backers Golden Gate Capital and Summit Partners. Beginning in 2002, Golden Gate began assembling the company to provide the kind of nuts-and-bolts enterprise software that has proved one of the hottest sectors in tech. Under [CEO] Phillips, the company has surged. It now sells its wares to more than 70,000 corporations, including clients Bausch & Lomb, Ferrari, and Heineken."


— Fortune on August 15, 2015"[10]


The company saw around a 300 percent increase in service bookings in 2015, with revenue up that year up around 60 percent. New clients that year included Wyndham Hotels, Ferrari, the San Francisco Municipal Transport Agency, Hershey Entertainment and Resorts, Boskalis, EBSCO, Legacy Health, Best Western International, and Kaman Industrial Technologies, among others. By July 2015, Infor had around 45 million users signed up to use its cloud computing software.[4]
On August 11, 2015, Infor announced its upcoming acquisition of GT Nexus for $675 million. At the time, GT Nexus was the world's largest cloud-based global commerce platform,[14][49] with customers such as Nike Inc., Adidas AG, Home Depot Inc. and Procter & Gamble[50] and $100 billion of trade in direct goods conducted each year though its network.[49] Explained Bloomberg, the acquired technology allows Infor customers to "leave elaborate business-management systems that run at headquarters untouched while supplying those clients’ plants with programs specialized by industry and delivered via cloud computing."[50] Infor acquired Predictix in July 2016,[15] at which point Infor related that it had "more than 58 million users" in the "Infor cloud."[15] Active in 200 countries and territories with around 15,000 employees,[16] Infor is currently the third largest enterprise technology provider in the world.[10]
Investment by Koch Industries (2017)[edit]
In February 2017, Koch Equity Development LLC invested $2.68 billion in Infor, for a 66.67% equity ownership stake in the company. Infor is valued at $10 billion, and has $6 billion of debt, most of which is publicly-traded.[citation needed]
Software[edit]
Since CEO Charles Phillips joined Infor in 2010, the company has focused on creating applications that result in a positive user experience, among other factors such as efficiency.[12][51] Infor deploys its applications primarily on the Amazon Web Services cloud[52] and open source platforms.[53]

Infor deploys its cloud applications through Amazon Web Services[7] and various open source software platforms.[8][9]

History[edit]
Founding and early acquisitions (2002–2009)[edit]
See also: MAPICS, Geac Computer Corporation, and SSA Global
Infor was founded in June 2002[11] under the name Agilsys in Malvern, Pennsylvania.[11] With 1,300 customers to start[11] and a focus on enterprise software,[10] the company was constructed through a series of acquisitions[10][11] led by private equity backers Golden Gate Capital and Summit Partners.[17] In December 2002, Agilisys International acquired Brain AG,[18] followed by the acquisition of Future Three[19] the following June.[20] Agilisys moved its headquarters to Alpharetta in the Atlanta metropolitan area,[21] and in February 2004 acquired Infor Business Solutions, a German company headquartered in Friedrichsthal (Saar), Germany.[22] Daly.commerce[23] was acquired by Agilisys in early 2004. In September 2004, Agilisys changed its name to Infor Global Solutions.[24] On October 20, 2004, Infor announced the acquisition of Lilly Software Associates[25] and its VISUAL Enterprise (now referred to as VISUAL ERP[26]) suite of products.
In February 2005, Infor acquired MAPICS for around US D$347 million,[11] and subsequently acquired GEAC ERP[11] in 2006[27] for US$1 billion.[11] After a lawsuit filed in May 2006 attempted to halt SSA Global's merger with Infor unless certain shareholder demands were met,[28] Infor later completed the purchase and integrated the company.[29] Golden Gate’s early push for acquisitions resulted in Infor having 17,500 customers by the summer of 2006.[11] Also that year, Infor began rewriting industry-specific applications into up-to-date .Net and Java-based application providers.[30]
New management and move (2010–2013)[edit]
After several acquisitions,[31][32] in October 2010, Infor’s board of directors hired a new management team composed of four senior executives from Oracle Corporation, all four of whom joined Infor on the same day. Charles Phillips was appointed CEO, Pam Murphy was appointed chief operating officer (COO), and Duncan Angove and Stephan School became co-presidents.[10] Phillips established a new strategic direction as CEO.[10] In order to gain market share on Oracle and SAP, Infor also focused on providing applications with user-friendly interfaces,[33] while continuing to rewrite applications into new code.[30] The company acquired ERP rival Lawson Software for US$2 billion in 2011.[12][13] Infor launched its Infor10 line of products in September 2011. Within the products were the ION middleware suite and a new user interface.[34]
In the summer of 2012, Infor relocated its headquarters from Alpharetta, Georgia[21] to New York City, citing the availability of engineers and designers in “Silicon Alley,”[35] investment in the technology educational sector by a consortium of universities, and the proximity to customers.[21] With several hundred employees remaining in Georgia, Infor’s new "loft-style" offices at 641 Avenue of the Americas in Manhattan were designed with the intent of promoting "collaboration and transparency."[21] Infor acquired Groupe Laurier CIM in August 2012.[36] On December 4, 2012, Infor announced it had acquired Orbis Global, which used a software as a service model for its marketing resource management software. Infor integrated Orbis Global's technology into its own customer experience product suite.[37][38]
"Micro-vertical" focus and pivot to cloud (2013–2014)[edit]
See also: CERTPOINT Systems
After the 2010 management changes,[35] Infor began specializing in "micro-verticals," purpose building its software to meet the needs of customers in niche industries. Arguing that similar businesses have similar software needs,[34] CEO Phillips explained in January 2012 that the food and beverage industry, for example, is made up of smaller "micro-verticals" such as bakers, butchers, and breweries, each of which have unique needs.[35] In contrast to many of its competitors, Infor designs software with the intent that companies can use the programs immediately, without consultation or customization.[35] As of 2013, Infor continued to rework industry-specific applications from older software languages into more widely used .Net and Java programming languages.[30] On April 2, 2013, Infor announced the acquisition of CERTPOINT Systems, a software as a service learning technologies company.[39][40] On May 16, 2013,[41] Infor acquired TDCI, Inc.,[41][42] and by late 2013, Infor had launched 300 new products[43] and hired 1,500 new engineers since 2010.[44] Among other companies, Infor acquired PeopleAnswers in January 2014.[45] Advancements in cloud computing[35] enabled Infor to integrate applications into suites for specific industries and sell them as a service.[46] Infor debuted its Infor CloudSuite product, which is delivered exclusively through Amazon Web Services (AWS), in 2014.[7] CloudSuite is designed to integrate software solutions intended for "micro-vertical" industries.[47] Infor also formed partnerships with Red Hat and EnterpriseDB to offer an open-source PostgreSQL stack that year,[9] and Infor's net income in 2014 equaled US$121.7 million.[48]
GT Nexus acquisition (2015–2016)[edit]
See also: GT Nexus


"Infor is the amalgamation of more than 40 software acquisitions brought together by private equity backers Golden Gate Capital and Summit Partners. Beginning in 2002, Golden Gate began assembling the company to provide the kind of nuts-and-bolts enterprise software that has proved one of the hottest sectors in tech. Under [CEO] Phillips, the company has surged. It now sells its wares to more than 70,000 corporations, including clients Bausch & Lomb, Ferrari, and Heineken."


— Fortune on August 15, 2015"[10]


The company saw around a 300 percent increase in service bookings in 2015, with revenue up that year up around 60 percent. New clients that year included Wyndham Hotels, Ferrari, the San Francisco Municipal Transport Agency, Hershey Entertainment and Resorts, Boskalis, EBSCO, Legacy Health, Best Western International, and Kaman Industrial Technologies, among others. By July 2015, Infor had around 45 million users signed up to use its cloud computing software.[4]
On August 11, 2015, Infor announced its upcoming acquisition of GT Nexus for $675 million. At the time, GT Nexus was the world's largest cloud-based global commerce platform,[14][49] with customers such as Nike Inc., Adidas AG, Home Depot Inc. and Procter & Gamble[50] and $100 billion of trade in direct goods conducted each year though its network.[49] Explained Bloomberg, the acquired technology allows Infor customers to "leave elaborate business-management systems that run at headquarters untouched while supplying those clients’ plants with programs specialized by industry and delivered via cloud computing."[50] Infor acquired Predictix in July 2016,[15] at which point Infor related that it had "more than 58 million users" in the "Infor cloud."[15] Active in 200 countries and territories with around 15,000 employees,[16] Infor is currently the third largest enterprise technology provider in the world.[10]
Investment by Koch Industries (2017)[edit]
In February 2017, Koch Equity Development LLC invested $2.68 billion in Infor, for a 66.67% equity ownership stake in the company. Infor is valued at $10 billion, and has $6 billion of debt, most of which is publicly-traded.[citation needed]
Software[edit]
Since CEO Charles Phillips joined Infor in 2010, the company has focused on creating applications that result in a positive user experience, among other factors such as efficiency.[12][51] Infor deploys its applications primarily on the Amazon Web Services cloud[52] and open source platforms.[53]

Programs and divisions[edit]
Hook and Loop[edit]
Infor created Hook and Loop in 2012 as an internal creative agency of writers, designers, developers, and filmmakers, with the intent of designing user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing software.[61] The Hook & Loop agency was established in New York City with the initial goal of building a new UI to work across the Infor 10x product line. With the overhaul dubbed “SoHo,” the goal was establishing a “holistic” user experience with a unified design.[62] The agency was founded with five people, and by 2014 had 80 employees.[63]

History[edit]
Founding and early acquisitions (2002–2009)[edit]
See also: MAPICS, Geac Computer Corporation, and SSA Global
Infor was founded in June 2002[11] under the name Agilsys in Malvern, Pennsylvania.[11] With 1,300 customers to start[11] and a focus on enterprise software,[10] the company was constructed through a series of acquisitions[10][11] led by private equity backers Golden Gate Capital and Summit Partners.[17] In December 2002, Agilisys International acquired Brain AG,[18] followed by the acquisition of Future Three[19] the following June.[20] Agilisys moved its headquarters to Alpharetta in the Atlanta metropolitan area,[21] and in February 2004 acquired Infor Business Solutions, a German company headquartered in Friedrichsthal (Saar), Germany.[22] Daly.commerce[23] was acquired by Agilisys in early 2004. In September 2004, Agilisys changed its name to Infor Global Solutions.[24] On October 20, 2004, Infor announced the acquisition of Lilly Software Associates[25] and its VISUAL Enterprise (now referred to as VISUAL ERP[26]) suite of products.
In February 2005, Infor acquired MAPICS for around US D$347 million,[11] and subsequently acquired GEAC ERP[11] in 2006[27] for US$1 billion.[11] After a lawsuit filed in May 2006 attempted to halt SSA Global's merger with Infor unless certain shareholder demands were met,[28] Infor later completed the purchase and integrated the company.[29] Golden Gate’s early push for acquisitions resulted in Infor having 17,500 customers by the summer of 2006.[11] Also that year, Infor began rewriting industry-specific applications into up-to-date .Net and Java-based application providers.[30]
New management and move (2010–2013)[edit]
After several acquisitions,[31][32] in October 2010, Infor’s board of directors hired a new management team composed of four senior executives from Oracle Corporation, all four of whom joined Infor on the same day. Charles Phillips was appointed CEO, Pam Murphy was appointed chief operating officer (COO), and Duncan Angove and Stephan School became co-presidents.[10] Phillips established a new strategic direction as CEO.[10] In order to gain market share on Oracle and SAP, Infor also focused on providing applications with user-friendly interfaces,[33] while continuing to rewrite applications into new code.[30] The company acquired ERP rival Lawson Software for US$2 billion in 2011.[12][13] Infor launched its Infor10 line of products in September 2011. Within the products were the ION middleware suite and a new user interface.[34]
In the summer of 2012, Infor relocated its headquarters from Alpharetta, Georgia[21] to New York City, citing the availability of engineers and designers in “Silicon Alley,”[35] investment in the technology educational sector by a consortium of universities, and the proximity to customers.[21] With several hundred employees remaining in Georgia, Infor’s new "loft-style" offices at 641 Avenue of the Americas in Manhattan were designed with the intent of promoting "collaboration and transparency."[21] Infor acquired Groupe Laurier CIM in August 2012.[36] On December 4, 2012, Infor announced it had acquired Orbis Global, which used a software as a service model for its marketing resource management software. Infor integrated Orbis Global's technology into its own customer experience product suite.[37][38]
"Micro-vertical" focus and pivot to cloud (2013–2014)[edit]

After the 2010 management changes,[35] Infor began specializing in "micro-verticals," purpose building its software to meet the needs of customers in niche industries. Arguing that similar businesses have similar software needs,[34] CEO Phillips explained in January 2012 that the food and beverage industry, for example, is made up of smaller "micro-verticals" such as bakers, butchers, and breweries, each of which have unique needs.[35] In contrast to many of its competitors, Infor designs software with the intent that companies can use the programs immediately, without consultation or customization.[35] As of 2013, Infor continued to rework industry-specific applications from older software languages into more widely used .Net and Java programming languages.[30] On April 2, 2013, Infor announced the acquisition of CERTPOINT Systems, a software as a service learning technologies company.[39][40] On May 16, 2013,[41] Infor acquired TDCI, Inc.,[41][42] and by late 2013, Infor had launched 300 new products[43] and hired 1,500 new engineers since 2010.[44] Among other companies, Infor acquired PeopleAnswers in January 2014.[45] Advancements in cloud computing[35] enabled Infor to integrate applications into suites for specific industries and sell them as a service.[46] Infor debuted its Infor CloudSuite product, which is delivered exclusively through Amazon Web Services (AWS), in 2014.[7] CloudSuite is designed to integrate software solutions intended for "micro-vertical" industries.[47] Infor also formed partnerships with Red Hat and EnterpriseDB to offer an open-source PostgreSQL stack that year,[9] and Infor's net income in 2014 equaled US$121.7 million.[48]

"Infor is the amalgamation of more than 40 software acquisitions brought together by private equity backers Golden Gate Capital and Summit Partners. Beginning in 2002, Golden Gate began assembling the company to provide the kind of nuts-and-bolts enterprise software that has proved one of the hottest sectors in tech. Under [CEO] Phillips, the company has surged. It now sells its wares to more than 70,000 corporations, including clients Bausch & Lomb, Ferrari, and Heineken."


— Fortune on August 15, 2015"[10]

By July 2015, Infor had around 45 million users signed up to use its cloud computing software.[4]
On August 11, 2015, Infor announced its upcoming acquisition of GT Nexus for $675 million. At the time, GT Nexus was the world's largest cloud-based global commerce platform,[14][49] with customers such as Nike Inc., Adidas AG, Home Depot Inc. and Procter & Gamble[50] and $100 billion of trade in direct goods conducted each year though its network.[49] Explained Bloomberg, the acquired technology allows Infor customers to "leave elaborate business-management systems that run at headquarters untouched while supplying those clients’ plants with programs specialized by industry and delivered via cloud computing."[50] Infor acquired Predictix in July 2016,[15] at which point Infor related that it had "more than 58 million users" in the "Infor cloud."[15] Active in 200 countries and territories with around 15,000 employees,[16] Infor is currently the third largest enterprise technology provider in the world.[10]
Investment by Koch Industries (2017)[edit]
In February 2017, Koch Equity Development LLC invested $2.68 billion in Infor, for a 66.67% equity ownership stake in the company. Infor is valued at $10 billion, and has $6 billion of debt, most of which is publicly-traded.[citation needed]

History[edit]
Founding and early acquisitions (2002–2009)[edit]
See also: MAPICS, Geac Computer Corporation, and SSA Global
Infor was founded in June 2002[11] under the name Agilsys in Malvern, Pennsylvania.[11] With 1,300 customers to start[11] and a focus on enterprise software,[10] the company was constructed through a series of acquisitions[10][11] led by private equity backers Golden Gate Capital and Summit Partners.[17] In December 2002, Agilisys International acquired Brain AG,[18] followed by the acquisition of Future Three[19] the following June.[20] Agilisys moved its headquarters to Alpharetta in the Atlanta metropolitan area,[21] and in February 2004 acquired Infor Business Solutions, a German company headquartered in Friedrichsthal (Saar), Germany.[22] Daly.commerce[23] was acquired by Agilisys in early 2004. In September 2004, Agilisys changed its name to Infor Global Solutions.[24] On October 20, 2004, Infor announced the acquisition of Lilly Software Associates[25] and its VISUAL Enterprise (now referred to as VISUAL ERP[26]) suite of products.
In February 2005, Infor acquired MAPICS for around US D$347 million,[11] and subsequently acquired GEAC ERP[11] in 2006[27] for US$1 billion.[11] After a lawsuit filed in May 2006 attempted to halt SSA Global's merger with Infor unless certain shareholder demands were met,[28] Infor later completed the purchase and integrated the company.[29] Golden Gate’s early push for acquisitions resulted in Infor having 17,500 customers by the summer of 2006.[11] Also that year, Infor began rewriting industry-specific applications into up-to-date .Net and Java-based application providers.[30]
New management and move (2010–2013)[edit]
After several acquisitions,[31][32] in October 2010, Infor’s board of directors hired a new management team composed of four senior executives from Oracle Corporation, all four of whom joined Infor on the same day. Charles Phillips was appointed CEO, Pam Murphy was appointed chief operating officer (COO), and Duncan Angove and Stephan School became co-presidents.[10] Phillips established a new strategic direction as CEO.[10] In order to gain market share on Oracle and SAP, Infor also focused on providing applications with user-friendly interfaces,[33] while continuing to rewrite applications into new code.[30] The company acquired ERP rival Lawson Software for US$2 billion in 2011.[12][13] Infor launched its Infor10 line of products in September 2011. Within the products were the ION middleware suite and a new user interface.[34]
In the summer of 2012, Infor relocated its headquarters from Alpharetta, Georgia[21] to New York City, citing the availability of engineers and designers in “Silicon Alley,”[35] investment in the technology educational sector by a consortium of universities, and the proximity to customers.[21] With several hundred employees remaining in Georgia, Infor’s new "loft-style" offices at 641 Avenue of the Americas in Manhattan were designed with the intent of promoting "collaboration and transparency."[21] Infor acquired Groupe Laurier CIM in August 2012.[36] On December 4, 2012, Infor announced it had acquired Orbis Global, which used a software as a service model for its marketing resource management software. Infor integrated Orbis Global's technology into its own customer experience product suite.[37][38]
"Micro-vertical" focus and pivot to cloud (2013–2014)[edit]
See also: CERTPOINT Systems
After the 2010 management changes,[35] Infor began specializing in "micro-verticals," purpose building its software to meet the needs of customers in niche industries. Arguing that similar businesses have similar software needs,[34] CEO Phillips explained in January 2012 that the food and beverage industry, for example, is made up of smaller "micro-verticals" such as bakers, butchers, and breweries, each of which have unique needs.[35] In contrast to many of its competitors, Infor designs software with the intent that companies can use the programs immediately, without consultation or customization.[35] As of 2013, Infor continued to rework industry-specific applications from older software languages into more widely used .Net and Java programming languages.[30] On April 2, 2013, Infor announced the acquisition of CERTPOINT Systems, a software as a service learning technologies company.[39][40] On May 16, 2013,[41] Infor acquired TDCI, Inc.,[41][42] and by late 2013, Infor had launched 300 new products[43] and hired 1,500 new engineers since 2010.[44] Among other companies, Infor acquired PeopleAnswers in January 2014.[45] Advancements in cloud computing[35] enabled Infor to integrate applications into suites for specific industries and sell them as a service.[46] Infor debuted its Infor CloudSuite product, which is delivered exclusively through Amazon Web Services (AWS), in 2014.[7] CloudSuite is designed to integrate software solutions intended for "micro-vertical" industries.[47] Infor also formed partnerships with Red Hat and EnterpriseDB to offer an open-source PostgreSQL stack that year,[9] and Infor's net income in 2014 equaled US$121.7 million.[48]
GT Nexus acquisition (2015–2016)[edit]
See also: GT Nexus


"Infor is the amalgamation of more than 40 software acquisitions brought together by private equity backers Golden Gate Capital and Summit Partners. Beginning in 2002, Golden Gate began assembling the company to provide the kind of nuts-and-bolts enterprise software that has proved one of the hottest sectors in tech. Under [CEO] Phillips, the company has surged. It now sells its wares to more than 70,000 corporations, including clients Bausch & Lomb, Ferrari, and Heineken."


— Fortune on August 15, 2015"[10]


The company saw around a 300 percent increase in service bookings in 2015, with revenue up that year up around 60 percent. New clients that year included Wyndham Hotels, Ferrari, the San Francisco Municipal Transport Agency, Hershey Entertainment and Resorts, Boskalis, EBSCO, Legacy Health, Best Western International, and Kaman Industrial Technologies, among others. By July 2015, Infor had around 45 million users signed up to use its cloud computing software.[4]
On August 11, 2015, Infor announced its upcoming acquisition of GT Nexus for $675 million. At the time, GT Nexus was the world's largest cloud-based global commerce platform,[14][49] with customers such as Nike Inc., Adidas AG, Home Depot Inc. and Procter & Gamble[50] and $100 billion of trade in direct goods conducted each year though its network.[49] Explained Bloomberg, the acquired technology allows Infor customers to "leave elaborate business-management systems that run at headquarters untouched while supplying those clients’ plants with programs specialized by industry and delivered via cloud computing."[50] Infor acquired Predictix in July 2016,[15] at which point Infor related that it had "more than 58 million users" in the "Infor cloud."[15] Active in 200 countries and territories with around 15,000 employees,[16] Infor is currently the third largest enterprise technology provider in the world.[10]
Investment by Koch Industries (2017)[edit]
In February 2017, Koch Equity Development LLC invested $2.68 billion in Infor, for a 66.67% equity ownership stake in the company. Infor is valued at $10 billion, and has $6 billion of debt, most of which is publicly-traded.[citation needed]
Software[edit]
Since CEO Charles Phillips joined Infor in 2010, the company has focused on creating applications that result in a positive user experience, among other factors such as efficiency.[12][51] Infor deploys its applications primarily on the Amazon Web Services cloud[52] and open source platforms.[53]

History[edit]
Founding and early acquisitions (2002–2009)[edit]
See also: MAPICS, Geac Computer Corporation, and SSA Global
Infor was founded in June 2002[11] under the name Agilsys in Malvern, Pennsylvania.[11] With 1,300 customers to start[11] and a focus on enterprise software,[10] the company was constructed through a series of acquisitions[10][11] led by private equity backers Golden Gate Capital and Summit Partners.[17] In December 2002, Agilisys International acquired Brain AG,[18] followed by the acquisition of Future Three[19] the following June.[20] Agilisys moved its headquarters to Alpharetta in the Atlanta metropolitan area,[21] and in February 2004 acquired Infor Business Solutions, a German company headquartered in Friedrichsthal (Saar), Germany.[22] Daly.commerce[23] was acquired by Agilisys in early 2004. In September 2004, Agilisys changed its name to Infor Global Solutions.[24] On October 20, 2004, Infor announced the acquisition of Lilly Software Associates[25] and its VISUAL Enterprise (now referred to as VISUAL ERP[26]) suite of products.
In February 2005, Infor acquired MAPICS for around US D$347 million,[11] and subsequently acquired GEAC ERP[11] in 2006[27] for US$1 billion.[11] After a lawsuit filed in May 2006 attempted to halt SSA Global's merger with Infor unless certain shareholder demands were met,[28] Infor later completed the purchase and integrated the company.[29] Golden Gate’s early push for acquisitions resulted in Infor having 17,500 customers by the summer of 2006.[11] Also that year, Infor began rewriting industry-specific applications into up-to-date .Net and Java-based application providers.[30]
New management and move (2010–2013)[edit]
After several acquisitions,[31][32] in October 2010, Infor’s board of directors hired a new management team composed of four senior executives from Oracle Corporation, all four of whom joined Infor on the same day. Charles Phillips was appointed CEO, Pam Murphy was appointed chief operating officer (COO), and Duncan Angove and Stephan School became co-presidents.[10] Phillips established a new strategic direction as CEO.[10] In order to gain market share on Oracle and SAP, Infor also focused on providing applications with user-friendly interfaces,[33] while continuing to rewrite applications into new code.[30] The company acquired ERP rival Lawson Software for US$2 billion in 2011.[12][13] Infor launched its Infor10 line of products in September 2011. Within the products were the ION middleware suite and a new user interface.[34]
In the summer of 2012, Infor relocated its headquarters from Alpharetta, Georgia[21] to New York City, citing the availability of engineers and designers in “Silicon Alley,”[35] investment in the technology educational sector by a consortium of universities, and the proximity to customers.[21] With several hundred employees remaining in Georgia, Infor’s new "loft-style" offices at 641 Avenue of the Americas in Manhattan were designed with the intent of promoting "collaboration and transparency."[21] Infor acquired Groupe Laurier CIM in August 2012.[36] On December 4, 2012, Infor announced it had acquired Orbis Global, which used a software as a service model for its marketing resource management software. Infor integrated Orbis Global's technology into its own customer experience product suite.[37][38]
"Micro-vertical" focus and pivot to cloud (2013–2014)[edit]
See also: CERTPOINT Systems
After the 2010 management changes,[35] Infor began specializing in "micro-verticals," purpose building its software to meet the needs of customers in niche industries. Arguing that similar businesses have similar software needs,[34] CEO Phillips explained in January 2012 that the food and beverage industry, for example, is made up of smaller "micro-verticals" such as bakers, butchers, and breweries, each of which have unique needs.[35] In contrast to many of its competitors, Infor designs software with the intent that companies can use the programs immediately, without consultation or customization.[35] As of 2013, Infor continued to rework industry-specific applications from older software languages into more widely used .Net and Java programming languages.[30] On April 2, 2013, Infor announced the acquisition of CERTPOINT Systems, a software as a service learning technologies company.[39][40] On May 16, 2013,[41] Infor acquired TDCI, Inc.,[41][42] and by late 2013, Infor had launched 300 new products[43] and hired 1,500 new engineers since 2010.[44] Among other companies, Infor acquired PeopleAnswers in January 2014.[45] Advancements in cloud computing[35] enabled Infor to integrate applications into suites for specific industries and sell them as a service.[46] Infor debuted its Infor CloudSuite product, which is delivered exclusively through Amazon Web Services (AWS), in 2014.[7] CloudSuite is designed to integrate software solutions intended for "micro-vertical" industries.[47] Infor also formed partnerships with Red Hat and EnterpriseDB to offer an open-source PostgreSQL stack that year,[9] and Infor's net income in 2014 equaled US$121.7 million.[48]
GT Nexus acquisition (2015–2016)[edit]
See also: GT Nexus


"Infor is the amalgamation of more than 40 software acquisitions brought together by private equity backers Golden Gate Capital and Summit Partners. Beginning in 2002, Golden Gate began assembling the company to provide the kind of nuts-and-bolts enterprise software that has proved one of the hottest sectors in tech. Under [CEO] Phillips, the company has surged. It now sells its wares to more than 70,000 corporations, including clients Bausch & Lomb, Ferrari, and Heineken."


— Fortune on August 15, 2015"[10]


The company saw around a 300 percent increase in service bookings in 2015, with revenue up that year up around 60 percent. New clients that year included Wyndham Hotels, Ferrari, the San Francisco Municipal Transport Agency, Hershey Entertainment and Resorts, Boskalis, EBSCO, Legacy Health, Best Western International, and Kaman Industrial Technologies, among others. By July 2015, Infor had around 45 million users signed up to use its cloud computing software.[4]
On August 11, 2015, Infor announced its upcoming acquisition of GT Nexus for $675 million. At the time, GT Nexus was the world's largest cloud-based global commerce platform,[14][49] with customers such as Nike Inc., Adidas AG, Home Depot Inc. and Procter & Gamble[50] and $100 billion of trade in direct goods conducted each year though its network.[49] Explained Bloomberg, the acquired technology allows Infor customers to "leave elaborate business-management systems that run at headquarters untouched while supplying those clients’ plants with programs specialized by industry and delivered via cloud computing."[50] Infor acquired Predictix in July 2016,[15] at which point Infor related that it had "more than 58 million users" in the "Infor cloud."[15] Active in 200 countries and territories with around 15,000 employees,[16] Infor is currently the third largest enterprise technology provider in the world.[10]
Investment by Koch Industries (2017)[edit]
In February 2017, Koch Equity Development LLC invested $2.68 billion in Infor, for a 66.67% equity ownership stake in the company. Infor is valued at $10 billion, and has $6 billion of debt, most of which is publicly-traded.[citation needed]
Software[edit]
Since CEO Charles Phillips joined Infor in 2010, the company has focused on creating applications that result in a positive user experience, among other factors such as efficiency.[12][51] Infor deploys its applications primarily on the Amazon Web Services cloud[52] and open source platforms.[53]

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Forecasts are wrong, let’s not kid ourselves.  But let’s try to be less wrong!  Ok that’s not really a great rallying cry, but a solid demand planning foundation supported by a predictable and repeatable planning process can do wonders.  Find the weak spots, let the tools do the heavy lifting, and communicate, communicate, communicate.  That’s how SCMC does demand planning






Don’t be confined by pre-configured aggregates.  Plan at whatever level you please with IBP demand.  Seems like a small thing but it has immense implications.  Looking at the data from any angle any time you want allows the average planner to seem like an genius, and geniuses to seem extra-genius-y.






Who doesn’t love customer service?  Not us!  We also love double negatives.  But especially we love your customers.  IBP demand allows you to slice and dice data to the customer, product, region, shipping point or receiving point.  That’s the ability to target service where it has the most impact.

Rubber, Meet Road






Hope is not a Plan







Optimize it!







The Butterfly Effect







Modeling Careers







“Well I’m sure they’ll work it out at the plant”, is never a good strategy.  Look reality square in the face and deal with the capacity you have, not the capacity you wish you had.  SCMC believes that you need to make the most of your least and get ahead of the problems with eyes wide open.  That means a supply plan that is actionable, not aspirational.






As long as math still works, we love optimizers.  It’s the cold hard mistress of profit and loss shown for all the world to see.  Of course you can’t possibly model everything (…yet) but we’re trying.  And as long as we can work together to identify the data we can make it optimal.  Don’t be afraid of the optimizer; embrace its potential.






When a butterfly flaps its wings, do you know exactly where the hurricane will hit?  Probably not, but we do… well at least our optimizers do.  When you look at each supply chain challenge with the unbiased unblinking eye of an optimizer you will see the best answer, even if it’s not always apparent to us mammals.






Garbage in, garbage out.  But with our expert supply chain modeling team your garbage will smell so much better than the neighbor’s.  We love supply chains, and we love modeling them in systems.  Don’t judge, just take advantage of our latest models in IBP, APO, or whatever you bring to the table.

Inventory


Making Your Money Work for You






Predictable Disappointment







Show Me the Money!







Size (and Location) Matters







Integrated and Capital Planning







You know it’s going to be bad, but how bad?  Let’s get some perspective here.  One of the things we love about the inventory solution in IBP is the ability to predict service levels.  Yeah it’s a glass half full kind of thing, but wouldn’t you rather know ahead of time rather than scramble at the last minute?  We would, but then again, we’re planners.






 Let’s talk a language that everyone understands; cash.  With IBP inventory optimization you don’t have to focus on abstract measurements  like volume and mass, but can instead focus on dimensions that matter, like dollars and cents.  The ability to project capital requirements to support a given supply plan is a major unlock for S&OP, and business planning.  Impress your wall-street friends with your new vocabulary, courtesy of IBP and SCMC.






Now where did I put that inventory in the first place? Why, the most efficient spot imaginable of course!  With IBP inventory it’s not just the size of your stockpile, but where you put it that counts.  This means the ability to scientifically maintain service levels with the most efficient inventory plan imaginable.  Maybe it’s closer to the customer, maybe it’s in components.  Only IBP inventory knows the sweet spot to maximize your service every single time.






What happens when finance and supply chain work together on a single goal like a harmonized supply plan?  We don’t know, because it’s never happened.  But what if you just stop talking past each other and at least appreciate the other’s viewpoint?  Cordial meetings!  When supply chains can work within capital constraints and sales, finance and marketing can see the physical impact of their plans in cold hard cash.  Now we’re talking.

Response Planning


 When Planning Becomes Reacting






Dealer's Choice







Prioritize!







Quick Actions







Consistent Policies







When you only have so much love to give, don’t get all emotional about it…  Play by the house rules.  When you pre-determine a set of rules by product, customer or segment the panic room becomes a planning room.  Since you’re not reinventing the wheel each time, whenever things get tight, just play by the rules.  Response in IBP allows consistent and fair execution of those rules.  So crunch-time becomes go-time.






 I know they’re all your favorites, but you’ve got to choose!  When safety stock turns into not enough stock, you need to prioritize.  Rather than make it up on the fly, make a decision.  Prioritize by demand type, customer type, or whatever other type you need to make a decision on.  The IBP response module will peg demand to supply, show the issues and help triage.  In short, IBP response makes order out of chaos.






When reacting to customer expectations requires cat-like reflexes then it helps to have a plan in advance.  Don’t get caught flatfooted.  Jump into action with (mostly) well thought out priorities in IBP response.  How easy is it to setup?  So easy a user can use it.  The simple and easy to follow prioritization logic of IBP response allows users to support users.  React as plans change, and setup the system to follow.






Planners might actually take days off.  Sometimes they even quit or possibly even get promoted.  And then what?  Institutionalize your tribal knowledge with consistent service policies.  It’s time to take instinct out of the gut and put it into ones and zeroes.  Setting up a response plan that matches the goals of a changing organization can get everyone singing the same song, and it’s even better if that song isn’t “The Way We Were.”

S&OP


The Art of Herding Cats






Everyone in the Pool!







Side by Side







Money Talks







Stop! Collaborate and Listen







We’re all in this together, so let’s grudgingly walk into the same meeting and hash this out.  But what if we’re all working off the same data?  At the same time?  In the same system?  OK now we have your attention.  With IBP S&OP Planning you can work with sales, finance, marketing, supply and execution all looking at the same bit and bytes.  Sure, everyone has their own lens and their own graph, but at least cause and effect is shown across all groups.  Now we can all disagree on the same dataset.  Progress!






What if unicorns were real?  What if I could hold my breath for 15 minutes?  Ever wondered what if?  So do we, and with IBP you can see what those what-if’s look like in real life.  With side by side fully integrated planning, every scenario you think of can be analyzed from the perspective of the demand, supply or inventory planner.  Then the impact of those plans can be compared side by side in a virtual cage match.  Look at the impact of your decisions across the entire supply chain quickly, easily, and seamlessly with IBP.






We’re studying our Esperanto every single night.  But until that catches on, money is the universal language of business.  So we speak dollars and cents.  That means the bottom line in Every. Single. Decision. So go ahead, look at the profitability of your hunch, view the overhead of your strategy.  We’ll wait, it will all come out in the wash, and we’ll pick the obvious answer that saves us the most money (its usually option C).  Trust us… we’re executives in training.






Team work makes dreams work.  That’s our motto.  And with IBP S&OP functionality it becomes a reality.  Sharing a single database in a unified planning area allows for all teams, from demand, to supply to finance and yes, even marketing to collapse on problems like never before.  New product introductions?  Glad to meet you!  Annual planning?  Seems like only yesterday!  With IBP you can collaborate with a whole new attitude, and present your (best) plan forward.  Go Team!
