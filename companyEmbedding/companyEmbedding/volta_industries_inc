Conveyor Belting


HomeShopConveyor Belting















Conveyor Belting


Terpco Inc. offers a variety of different conveyor belting services including: wire belting, light weight belting, and heavy weight belting. Our belting services are built to last and used for many different applications including: construction, mulching, food service, paper products, metal parts production, textile manufacturing, and electronic parts manufacturing



































Lightweight Conveyor Belting



																		Terpco is able to provide your company with many different types of light-weight belting including: Teflon, PVC, Mesh, Modular, Thermalplastic, Table-Top Chain, and High Temperature Belts, plus many more. Please speak with a Terpco Representative about your options with these belts.																		
																	


























Heavy Duty Conveyor Belting



																		Terpco is able to provide your company with Heavy-Weight belting that is built to last. Our heavy-weight belting can be used in various industries from construction to mulching. Please speak with a Terpco Representative or submit a request for information concerning our heavy-weight belting.																		
																	


























Plastic Modular Belting



																		Terpco Plastic Modular Conveyor Belts are made of plastic modules and are assembled in an interlocked, bricklay pattern with full-length hinge rods — an inherently strong design. Driven and tracked by plastic sprockets, Plastic Modular Conveyor Belts have the qualities plant operators and designers look for.																		
																	


























Pull Belts



																		Terpco is able to provide your company and product line with replacement pull belts. We cover replacement belts for all major machine line brands such as Hayssen, Woodman, Rovema, and many others. We are able to customize these belts with items you need for your application, such as vacuum holes. Please speak with a Terpco representative with any questions you may have concerning our pull belts.																		
																	


























Specialty Form/Fill & Seal Belting



																		Terpco can provide specialty form/fill and seal belting per specifications. Please forward details on your application and requirements for product information.																		
																	


























Timing & Drive Belting



																		Timing belts are the perfect choice for applications where traditional belt options are unable to provide performance synchronization, and exact product placement. When precise timing is required, Timing and Drive Belts are the best solution. Timing and Drive Belts can be made to your exact dimensional needs, and customized with guides, profiles and covers to ensure your product or component is always in the right place at the right time. 
																		
																	


























Wire Belting



																		Terpco Inc. is able to offer your company various types of Wire Belting. Some of the types we typically provide are Balance Weave, Flat Wire, and Oven/Baking Bands. Please speak with a Terpco Representative concerning any questions you may have on our Wire Belting.																		
																	


























Dewatering Belts



																		Terpco’s synthetic and metal dewatering meshes are individually matched to your application as conveyor belts, filter belts or screen belts. Terpco meshes have common uses in the Agricultural and Food Processing industries.. Other areas of application includewoodprocessing, flue gas desulphurization, mining and sewage treatment sectors.
																		
																	


























Pulleys And Lagging



																		Pulley lagging increases the traction between the belt and the pulley, which in turn reduces load and wear on the drive, belt, pulleys, bearings and take-up. For efficient and economical conveyor operation, proper pulley lagging is integral detail
																		
																	


























Motorized Pulleys



																		A motorized pulley is a drum motor in which the body rotates around a stationary shaft. The rotating outer “drum” becomes thetraction surface which powers the conveyor belt. Electric power leads pass through the stationary shaft to motor terminals inside the pulley housing. Since the end shaft does not rotate, there is no need for slip rings to deliver electrical power to the motor windings.
																		
																	


























Terpco Belt Service



																		Please visit the Terpco Belt Services page for information on various services Terpco is able to provide to your belt line. Terpco is able to services belts through cleaning/scraping systems, cleat installation, sidewall fabrication, vacuum holes, plus many more. Please speak with a Terpco Representative about any specific questions you may have.																		
																	


























FDA/USDA Belting



																		Terpco is able to provide your company with food grade, FDA/USDA approved belting. These belts work great when the food product is coming into contact with the belt.																		
																	


























PTFE/Silicone Belts



																		Taconic manufactures PTFE and silicone coated fiberglass belts that offer exceptional release properties, outstanding flexibility and superior temperature resistance. By designing and delivering the best belts possible, our customers can achieve both high performance and maximum value.

About Us
Volta Belting Technology Ltd. has been a world leader in the manufacture of Thermoplastic Elastomer (TPE) belting and profiles for over 50 years.
Volta Belting’s homogeneous belts are known for their high material strength, superior dimensional exactitude and stability. The materials are cut- and wear-resistant and impervious to water, oils and other fluids. They are easy to install on-site, with a minimum of contamination to the work area, and, if damaged, can be repaired efficiently by closing tears or replacing sections.
Volta Belting’s positive drive flat belts are uniquely designed to overcome the numerous shortcomings associated with conventional conveyor belts: suitability in wet (even submerged) conditions without off-tracking and without the need for friction rollers, thereby saving on conveyor design and bringing the food processing industry closer to its goal of providing safe, affordable food for all. The food-grade belts are FDA/USDA/USDA Dairy approved and conform to EC regulations. The materials also support HACCP principles and are suited to CIP procedures.
In general industries, the belts come into their own by offering superior durability (“for a lifetime”) and savings in maintenance and downtime. Volta Belting serves specialized industries such as wood and furniture, paper and packaging production, metal processing, automotive, recycling and mechanized logistic facilities.
Volta Belting offers the largest range of round and trapezoid (V) profiles. In a number of key industries, the profiles can be used as rings to drive roller beds.
Volta Belting provides experienced sales and technical service support in more than 50 countries, covering major industrial centers throughout North and South America, Europe, Asia and Africa. On-site training is available at Volta Belting’s main fabrication centers in North America and Europe.
Volta Belting`s innovative belting technology guarantees extended productivity, lower costs of ownership and optimal operation in every installation.

Special Products
Volta Belting’s special products and custom profiles are found in many industries. All Volta Belting custom fabrications are made from the same materials as the conveyor belting, making them virtually indestructible. Thermowelding ensures superior bonding, so fabrications will not detach from the base belt.
Special Product Lines

Roller coating sleeves: reduce impact on metal rollers for ceramic tile industry or prevent bruising in food processing; available in a range of diameters; optional dedicated assembly tooling system
Coating materials: welded onto Volta Belting products to alter texture, grip and the coefficient of friction
Flights/cleats: cut to size from thicknesses up to 8mm
Based sidewalls
T-shaped base cleats
Hinge (universal) lace: castellated edge welded onto a conveyor belt for quick assembly without welding
