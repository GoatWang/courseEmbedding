GET DETAILSClickFIND A STORETwin Dilemmas: Changing Relationships Throughout The Lifespanby Klein, BarbaraThe development of how twins relate to each other and their single partners is explored through life stories and clinical examples in this telling study of twin interconnections. While the quality of a nurturing family life is crucial, Dr. Klein has found there are often issues with separation anxiety, loneliness, competition with each other, and finding friendships outside of twinship. When twin lives are entwined because of inadequate parenting and estrangement, twin loss is possible and traumatic, creating a crippling fear of expansiveness-an inability to be yourself. Therapists and twins seeking an understanding of twin relationships will find this clinically compelling book a valuable resource.Child & AdolescentCondition: --HPB condition ratingsNew: Item is brand new, unused and unmarked, in flawless condition.Fine/Like New (F): No defects, little usage.

About This Designer





In 2002 Heidi Gosman and Penny Klein launched heidi klein - the UK's first one-stop holiday shop. This Notting Hill boutique is evocative of a Hampton’s retreat in whitewashed wood adorned with palm leaves, bleached coral and driftwood, complete with the delicate scent of coconut. Upon entering, clients are instantly elevated to a sun-kissed mindset that affords the perfect ambiance for holiday shopping.

“We set out to reinvent swimwear shopping into an exciting and enjoyable experience, while providing everything our clients desired in order to look and feel gorgeous on holiday; all under one roof,” explains Heidi.

Two years later, the heidi klein collection was launched. The inspiration came from listening to clients, understanding what works and what doesn’t, and then creating a collection of exquisitely cut swimwear with an impeccable fit. Crafted with love, the collection was an immediate success and was soon distributed through key department stores, boutiques and resorts worldwide.

In 2002 Heidi Gosman and Penny Klein launched heidi klein - the UK's first one-stop holiday shop. This Notting Hill boutique is evocative of a Hampton’s retreat in whitewashed wood adorned with palm leaves, bleached coral and driftwood, complete with the delicate scent of coconut. Upon entering, clients are instantly elevated to a sun-kissed mindset that affords the perfect ambiance for holiday shopping.

“We set out to reinvent swimwear shopping into an exciting and enjoyable experience, while providing everything our clients desired in order to look and feel gorgeous on holiday; all under one roof,” explains Heidi.

Two years later, the heidi klein collection was launched. The inspiration came from listening to clients, understanding what works and what doesn’t, and then creating a collection of exquisitely cut swimwear with an impeccable fit. Crafted with love, the collection was an immediate success and was soon distributed through key department stores, boutiques and resorts worldwide.

I have worked with gifted children, their parents, and public and private schools in the greater Los Angeles area since 1986. My private practice is dedicated to assisting the special educational needs of gifted and highly gifted children.
I am also recognized as a national authority on the development of twins. My research on the twin attachment informs other issues such as the importance of genetics, the environment, and parenting. I consult with twins and parents of twins who need guidance on reducing conflicts between twins and many other twin issues.
I have written 10 books in the field of developmental psychology and education, including my latest, entitled Twin Dilemmas: Changing Relationships Throughout the Lifespan. Some of my previous works are Challenges of Gifted Children: Empowering Parents to Maximize Their Child’s Potential; Raising Gifted Kids: Everything You Need to Know to Help Your Exceptional Child Thrive; Alone in the Mirror: Twins in Therapy; and Not All Twins Are Alike.
I facilitate weekly parenting groups because I believe that parents are the most important and influential people in a young child’s life. As a young parent in the 1980s, my most outstanding contribution to the field of education was my work developing the initial parent education component for Head Start, a program developed to enhance the school readiness of economically disadvantaged preschoolers. 
I earned my undergraduate degree from the University of California at Berkeley, my Masters and Doctorate in Early Childhood Education from the University of Southern California at Los Angeles, and my Doctorate in Clinical Psychology from the California Graduate Institute in Los Angeles. I have lectured around the country and in Canada, talking about twins and gifted children.
 
The fastest way to contact me is by telephone. Thank you for reading my website.

Synopsis
About this title




The classic in the field since 1848, this extraordinary reference offers readers unsurpassed coverage of mineralogy and crystallography. The book is known for integrating complete coverage of concepts and principles with a more systematic and descriptive treatment of mineralogy. The revised edition now includes a CD-ROM to let readers see the minerals and crystals, while also viewing chemical composition, symmetry, and morphological crystallography.
"synopsis" may belong to another edition of this title.




About the Author:
                                                Dr. Cornelius Klein is the noted academic mineralogist who co-authored, and later took on the monumental task of updating, Dana's original Manual of Mineralogy. James D. Dana (1813 - 1895) graduated from Yale University in 1833. He joined a U.S. exploring expedition to the South Seas (1838 - 42), acting as a geologist and zoologist. His contributions to the American Journal of Science stimulated U.S. geologic inquiry. His research into the formation of the Earth's continents and oceans led him to believe in the progressive evolution of the Earth's physical features over time. By the end of his life he also came to accept the evolution of living things, as articulated by Charles Darwin. During his lifetime, and largely under his leadership, U.S. geology grew from a collection and classification of unrelated facts into a mature science.
