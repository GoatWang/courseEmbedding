David Morris Joins RegTek.Solutions as Product Manager - Derivsource

David Morris Joins RegTek.Solutions as Product Manager

By

             on July 19, 2017         |




Trade reporting and compliance software company RegTek.Solutions announced today that David Morris has joined their team in the role of Product Manager. Morris has more than 10 years’ experience in the specialist financial technology sector and will be based in RegTek’s London office. He was most recently at UnaVista, where he held a senior Product Management position; prior to that he was with Eze Software.
This strategic hire reflects increasing demand that RegTek.Solutions is experiencing in Europe due to impending regulatory reporting deadlines that its software addresses, such as MiFID II and the EMIR RTS Re-Write. RegTek.Solutions is the home of Report-It, the market-leading control and compliance software for global trade and transaction reporting, which includes Validate.Trade, Reportable.Trade, Load.Trade and Reconcile.Trade.
Brian Lynch, CEO of RegTek.Solutions, commented: “I am pleased to have David join the RegTek team. Our growing client base has become accustomed to both our depth of sector knowledge and our ability to provide fully-tested solutions ahead of regulatory requirement schedules. David is a key hire in the development and delivery of our growing solution set.”
David Morris said: “What impressed me when researching RegTek.Solutions is their single focus of purpose: they set out to be the best provider of reporting and compliance technology and they have remained true to their vision. They clearly have the right technology, at the right time and I am pleased to be part of the team that takes the company forward.”
Andy Green, Global Head of Business Development at RegTek.Solutions, added: “David brings a wealth of expertise from his multiple roles in the software and business development sector. I am pleased to welcome him to RegTek.”
RegTek.Solutions is unique in providing clients with a Compliance Service Level Agreement, as well as providing clients with the highest levels of control and compliance solutions in order to keep them ahead of new regulations, requirements and deadlines.
