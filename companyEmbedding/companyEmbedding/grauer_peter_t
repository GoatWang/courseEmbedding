Supports K@W's Leadership Content 


When Peter Grauer’s daughter was six, she sweet-talked him into taking horseback riding lessons in New York’s Westchester County, where the family lived. Grauer didn’t mind, because it gave him a good opportunity to have some Saturday morning bonding time with her.
At the corral, Grauer met a congenial man who also had a young girl taking lessons. The two struck up a friendship as they waited through their daughters’ sessions. “Our daughters became inseparable, and we were happy about that,” Grauer recalled during a speech at the 2013 Wharton Leadership Conference, noting the other man had started a business that had just become successful when the pair met in 1989. “One of us would bring the bagels and the other the coffee. We would talk about business and sports and families, the usual stuff.”
Then one day, when the girls were in their teens, the other dad decided to go into politics and wanted to cast off his CEO job. “It was Christmas of 2001 and he asked me, even though I had never worked in the media, to be his [company’s] CEO,” said Grauer of his Saturday morning stable buddy, Michael Bloomberg. “I tell people that you never know where you will make your connection. I was fortunate, and I have had a wonderful time. I run one of the most successful U.S. companies, and I owe it all to my daughter’s desire to ride horses.”







In truth, Grauer was qualified to take the job at global media company Bloomberg LP, having worked in high-level executive positions for Bank of America and Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. According to Grauer, leadership cannot be boiled down to one or two attributes, and, even if it could, those attributes would necessarily seem a bit contradictory. At Bloomberg, he noted, when his executives go on one of their frequent retreats, they always come to the conclusion that the best leaders are those who exemplify a line from Walt Whitman’s “Song of Myself”: “Do I contradict myself? … I am large, I contain multitudes.”
“Instead of just being the best big-picture thinker, someone may be the best at that and also detail oriented,” said Grauer. “They can give direction on little things and also encourage big ideas. They can be loyal to our company and also put the customer first. We call it the ‘and factor,’ and at Bloomberg we consider it the definition of leadership qualities.” 
Grauer does not rule out anyone becoming a leader based solely on his or her background. In fact, he said, his early years would certainly not be inspiring on a resume. At 15, he considered life to be a series of three things — sports, girls and fun — “I was pretty good at the first and last, not so much the middle one,” he joked.
Eventually, Grauer realized that he needed to change his focus. He convinced his parents to send him to boarding school for a chance at a fresh start. Grauer enrolled at The Hotchkiss School and went from being a “C” student to president of the student body and captain of the football team. But before he achieved those honors, school officials would only admit him if he repeated the 10th grade.


Knowledge@Wharton High School






“No one wants to repeat a grade in high school, but I knew I had to do it,” Grauer noted, adding that he was lucky to get the opportunity to change course. He ended up going to the University of North Carolina. Grauer is constantly awed by the Harvard, Princeton and Yale types Bloomberg often hires, he said, but the large state-school environment was what he needed. He learned to negotiate big crowds and home in on what he wanted.
Grauer graduated from UNC in 1968 and the Harvard University Graduate School of Business Program for Management Development in 1975. “Life is a lot of being in the moment, saying, ‘How am I going to get out of here?'” he said. “God knows where my maturity eventually came from.”
Induce and Reflect
It is important, Grauer noted, for a leader to assert himself or herself, but even more vital is to have a good streak of humility. “When I started my career, I had that Wall Street swagger. I certainly thought I was the smartest guy in the room,” he recalled. “Then in 1984, a miraculous thing happened: I had a deal that turned into a big fiasco.
“At that stage of my career, I lost whatever I had [in terms of] a reputation for being a deal maker,” Grauer said. “After it fell apart, I took a hard look at my skills. From that moment on, my approach was that I would take on every challenge with humility. I would never be too proud to ask for help. At Bloomberg, we call that ‘constructive paranoia.’ We are constantly preparing for someone smarter than us to take us on. I love the idea that people at our company do not think they are as good as they really are.” 
Grauer’s talk at Wharton was titled, “The ‘And’ Factor: Embracing Contradictions to Develop Great Leaders.” One of his “and” criteria is that a leader should have the ability to both induce action and stand back and reflect. For example, while running Microsoft, Bill Gates would often travel to a remote place and take only some articles he had put off reading, Grauer noted. Gates’s only interruption would be that he would have someone bring out meals; otherwise, he would spend his time reading and jotting down ideas. “Some would lead to a new product or a project for his foundation. Others would be small and fleeting. But each one would give him more perspective. We need to take time to step back from the day-to-day and be alone with our thoughts.”
According to Grauer, the ability to reflect is a key skill he tries to instill in executives during Bloomberg retreats, particularly in the case of younger employees who may not have learned to value it yet. “I have asked them to spend time outside of work with a clear sheet of paper and make brutal self-assessments,” he noted. “They can choose to share them with me or not, but most have. It set a framework for them about their strengths and weaknesses going forward. I believe that a career is a long reflection [on] self-improvement.”
Above all other qualities, Grauer said, a leader must establish a sense of intimacy with employees and customers. He or she must, as best as possible, learn something about every employee and relate to them on a personal level, because a leader can never be sure what trait will make an employee a future leader. His own first big interview brought that point home to him. “The head of college recruiting at Citibank took a chance on me at my first big job,” he noted. “I was woefully under-qualified. On that first day, there were MBAs from Harvard, Wharton and Columbia, but someone took a chance on something I had said or done — [something] that maybe I didn’t know I could do well myself.
“When I address a group, I try to look everyone in the eye and shake hands,” Grauer continued. “I want them to know they are important to me. At some moment in the future, I am going to ask people to do something hard…. They will walk over hot coals for a leader who they believe has their interests in [mind].”
Working without a Playbook
Prior to joining Bloomberg, Grauer was a managing partner at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette from 1992-2000. He served as managing director and senior partner of CSFB Private Equity until March 2002, when he joined Bloomberg full-time. Grauer had been a member of the media and financial data company’s board since 1996 and has served as its chairman since 2001.
Co-founded in 1982 by New York Mayor Bloomberg, the media company, which provides financial analytics and data through the eponymous Bloomberg Terminal, has grown to more than 15,000 employees in 192 locations across the globe. The privately held firm generated $7.9 billion in revenue in 2012, up from $7.6 billion in 2011, according to Forbes.
During Grauer’s tenure, Bloomberg completed acquisitions of BusinessWeek and the Bureau of National Affairs. Last May, the company purchased Dublin-based software firm PolarLake in an effort to launch a new data management service. 
While speaking at Wharton, Grauer recalled a trip to Japan that he took soon after the devastating earthquake and tsunami in 2011. He had business to do, but realized that circumstances also made it an opportunity to show leadership through intimacy. “I arrived at 6 a.m., and Narita Airport [in Tokyo] was deserted. The roads were empty when we made our way to the office. It was pretty scary,” Grauer noted. “When we arrived at our offices, the building was still shaking with aftershocks.”
But, to Grauer’s amazement, nearly all of the employees were in the office working. They came, he noted, because it was important to them to check in on colleagues, and to feel a sense of normalcy. “I stopped at every desk, shook hands and told them how important they were to us,” said Grauer. “I told them that as a company, we would never leave Japan. There are a lot of moments in one’s career where there is no playbook. But when you approach it with humanity, the rest will work.”

Bloomberg LP is serious about increasing its footprint in India. On Monday, the global financial news and data provider inaugurated its new swanky office in Mumbai. Peter T Grauer, chairman, spoke to Varada Bhat about why the Indian market is important, their investment plans here and the changing landscape of the news business. Edited excerpts:
India is one of the key emerging markets, apart from Brazil, Russia and China, that Bloomberg has identified for growth. What are your plans for India across all your businesses?
We started here 15 years ago, with small base. And now, for the first time in Bloomberg's history, we have an India-specific five-year plan. This business plan has five main elements. One is news, in which we intend to improve and expand our coverage across all asset classes that Indian and global investors care about. Two, equity markets where we are already the preferred weapon of choice. We want to maintain our market leadership position in the cash and the derivatives equity market in India. The third objective is to capture and grow our presence in the Indian fixed income markets. Four, we are aggressively entering the forex market in India, which till now we never really tapped. Finally, we want to focus sharply on providing systems for the Indian domestic asset management community. The message we want to send is, Bloomberg is a local product with a local service, which is why we are growing our staff. In our new office in Mumbai, we have increased the headcount to 90. Our overall staff strength in India is 130-150 people.
How much is the contribution from Indian markets compared with that in other emerging markets?
Currently, our India revenues are very modest, but in the next five years, we are optimistic about its growth.
What about investments?





We plan to invest here in terms of human capital and broaden our product portfolio. We think the Indian market holds a great growth opportunity. And, as the market evolves and develops more broadly, similar to some of the developed markets around the world, most of the Bloomberg capabilities will be available here. What we are very excited about is that we have listened to a lot of our customers, and many of them like to be serviced locally by locals.
One decision we have made is to put in one of the most important departments, our analytics desk, for customers in Mumbai. So, the Indian customers will be able to talk directly to Indian staff about the Indian domestic market and all the markets they want to.
You have taken a 16 per cent stake in UTV, given it the Bloomberg name and the content. Are you pleased with how the joint venture has shaped up?
We are happy with the progress. We think the partnership has been very successful and will exceed our expectation. In the past, we have had very few of such relationships and this is largely because we have always chosen to go on our own as a 100 per cent shareholder. But this is a market where we can’t do that. We spent probably two years looking for the right partner. Ultimately, we got engaged with the UTV team.
Do you plan to raise your stake 26 per cent, as that is within permissible limit?
At present, we have no such plans. For Bloomberg, more than business, the TV channel is a vehicle to build the brand. We made a decision just over two years ago to restructure Bloomberg television, by getting out of local language programming. We used to be in a position where we produced English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese and Japanese-language business television for Bloomberg. But we decided to move away from that model and focus on a model that will give us a global channel and much more leverage in producing the highest quality content and the best distribution.
How does BusinessWeek fit into your portfolio?
BusinessWeek (BW) covers a market which we essentially do not cover so well. Our ultimate aim is is to be the most influential news organisation in the world for the financial markets and the business community; the BW acquisition is a logical extension for us to be able to achieve that. We believe the BW acquisition will yield huge benefits for users of the Bloomberg Professional Service, for Bloomberg News, and for our television, Internet and other multimedia properties. While Bloomberg customers are primarily financial professionals, BW is read by CEOs, CFOs, deal lawyers, investment banks, product managers, and high government officials. So, BW will expand our audience.
Considering you have huge plans in India, do you plan to distribute your content and products in Indian languages as well?
At present, we are not looking at it as most of our subscribers here communicate in English. Basically in all the countries we operate in, English is the most preferred medium. Only in Japan 80 per cent of subscribers use the Japanese service.
What do you think about the changing landscape of news business. Do you see web as potential threat?
Yes. As a result of that, we have services and products that allow to access Bloomberg service from any Internet connected desk top and also through mobiles. We have customised applications for Blackberry, iPad, iPhone, Androids and select Nokia devices.

HONG KONG —  The chairman of Bloomberg L.P. said in a speech here on Thursday that the company should have reconsidered articles that deviated from its core of coverage of business news, because they jeopardized the huge sales potential for its products in the Chinese market.The comments by the chairman, Peter T. Grauer, represented the starkest acknowledgment yet by a senior Bloomberg executive that the ambitions of the news division should be assessed in the context of the business operation, which provides the bulk of the company’s revenue. They also signaled which of those considerations might get priority.Acknowledging the vast size of the Chinese economy, the world’s second-biggest after that of the United States, Mr. Grauer, said, “We have to be there.”“We have about 50 journalists in the market, primarily writing stories about the local business and economic environment,” Mr. Grauer said in response to questions after a speech at the Asia Society. “You’re all aware that every once in a while we wander a little bit away from that and write stories that we probably may have kind of rethought — should have rethought.”

Bloomberg, the financial data and news company, relies on sales of its terminals, which are ubiquitous on bankers’ desks around the world, for about 82 percent of its $8.5 billion in revenue. But sales of those terminals in China declined after the company published an article in June 2012 on the family wealth of Xi Jinping, at that time the incoming Communist Party chief. After its publication, officials ordered state enterprises not to subscribe to the service. Mr. Grauer did not specifically mention the article about Mr. Xi or any other articles.

Mr. Grauer’s comments on Bloomberg’s journalistic priorities in China reflect what some Bloomberg employees say is a re-emphasis on financial news, and skepticism from the business side about whether investigative journalism is worth the potential problems it could create for terminal sales.A Bloomberg spokesman in New York said the company would have no comment on Mr. Grauer’s remarks.A day earlier, Justin B. Smith, the chief executive of the Bloomberg Media Group, outlined an ambitious growth strategy for the news unit that would require expansion and increased investment. In a memorandum posted on the website Medium, he wrote: “Bloomberg Media is setting out to build a leading digitally led, multiplatform media company for global business. We want to become the indispensable source of information for the world’s most influential people.”Bloomberg, controlled by the billionaire Michael R. Bloomberg, who returned to the company at the beginning of this year after 12 years as mayor of New York City, employs about 125 people in mainland China across its businesses, which also include providing data about the country’s currency and bond futures markets.

“Being in China is very much a part of our long-term strategy and will continue to be so going forward,” Mr. Grauer said. “It occupies a lot of our thinking — Dan Doctoroff, our C.E.O.; me; Mike; and other members of our senior team.”After the article about the Xi family’s wealth was published, Chinese officials also blocked Bloomberg’s website on Chinese servers, and the company has been unable to get residency visas for new journalists. Other news organizations have come under similar pressure. The websites of The New York Times, including a new Chinese-language edition, were blocked when it published an article in October 2012 on the family wealth of Wen Jiabao, then the prime minister. Like Bloomberg, The Times has not received residency visas for new journalists.In November, several news outlets, including The New York Times, published reports quoting unidentified Bloomberg employees saying that top editors at the company, led by Matthew Winkler, editor in chief of Bloomberg News, did not publish an investigative article because of fears the company would be expelled from China. Mr. Winkler denied that the article had been killed.

A reporter who was the co-writer of the unpublished investigative article — and who had been a lead reporter on the Xi family wealth article in 2012 — left Bloomberg News shortly after reports of the controversy were published in November. He joined The New York Times in January.Some current and former Bloomberg journalists, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they had hoped the controversy surrounding Bloomberg’s China reporting would prompt the company to reaffirm its support for investigative efforts. Mr. Grauer’s comments were met with dismay, particularly because he is regarded as close to Mr. Bloomberg and would be unlikely to voice views that were not broadly accepted at the top of the company.

In his comments on Thursday, Mr. Grauer did not provide figures for the size of Bloomberg’s business in China. One former executive said in November that the company had about 2,000 to 2,500 terminals in mainland China, out of 300,000 terminals worldwide.Mr. Grauer said the company was investing aggressively in fast-growing emerging markets, including China and dozens of other countries. Such nations account for about 12 percent of people who use Bloomberg terminals, but 30 percent of its sales in the year to date, he said.“Our approach is pretty much to tune out all the news about weaknesses in the emerging markets,” Mr. Grauer said. “We’re investing full speed ahead.”In recent weeks, Mr. Bloomberg has taken up residence on the fifth floor of his company’s New York headquarters, which primarily houses the television operation of Bloomberg News. The glass of a small conference room has been frosted since he arrived, and he uses it to take Spanish lessons, an employee said. His influence within the editorial unit has also increased since he left city hall, said people with knowledge of the operation, who insisted on anonymity in discussing internal operations.Bloomberg has moved swiftly to put behind it a scandal in which its journalists were found to have used data from the terminals, like contact information, to help report stories. Reporters have been instructed in meetings, employees said, to avoid the use of proprietary information and to identify themselves clearly as from the news division. The aim, said one person present, has clearly been to assure terminal customers that their information is safe.

Peter T. Grauer on Bloomberg’s Commitment to Africa






 





April 9, 2015 




On April 8, Peter T. Grauer spoke at a Meeting of the President’s Advisory Council on Doing Business in Africa, emphasizing Bloomberg’s commitment to the region. Grauer announced the establishment of a grant to the Financial Services Volunteer Corps and reinforced our continuing commitment to providing training via our terminal to African central bankers, securities regulators, and the private sector. He also announced that Bloomberg will host a business and economic summit in Africa in early 2016.
His full remarks below:  
Thank you Ed, Secretary Pritzker, the Department of Commerce and Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee, and Council members for your continued dedication to Africa and your commitment to developing trade and investment strategies on the continent. 
As you know, Africa has developed into a global economic force and Bloomberg is fully committed to an advanced economic partnership between the U.S. and Africa. We have 8 physical offices in 6 countries in Africa, but our presence extends to more than 45 countries – employing over a 160 people on our payroll and another 200 people as stringers producing content for our Bloomberg news service. We are growing and will continue to grow and invest for the future. We work closely with Africa’s financial institutions, private companies, and central bankers to help them maximize efficiency, mitigate risk and increase capital flows. This helps the local financial markets and helps attract more foreign investment.
Bloomberg is currently working on several securities market development initiatives in Africa. For example, we collaborated with a local regulator in Nigeria to create a Nigerian bond trading platform and market surveillance system to bring a more transparent, liquid and efficient bond market to Nigeria. We also recently collaborated with the African Development Bank to create an African Bond Index. We saw a clear need for a transparent and objective benchmark for sovereign debt in Africa. 
Consistent with Bloomberg’s efforts to strengthen Africa’s financial markets, I am pleased to offer a recommendation for our subcommittee that is focused on attracting investment and access to capital by making Africa’s capital markets more robust. Africa’s capital markets are undergoing significant change that, over time, will facilitate an increased interest in the trading of all types of financial instruments throughout the continent. Africa’s Securities Commissions and exchanges are increasingly requesting the expertise of public and private sector experts with securities market development issues. African securities markets range from very developed to nascent with no legislative or regulatory frameworks in place. 
To that end, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has a technical assistance program that utilizes SEC and industry officials, as well as other seasoned practitioners, to provide training and capacity building to regulatory officials all over the world. 
However, the program is very limited on resources and essentially has no funding. This is why we recommend that the U.S. government and private sector explore ways to provide the program with the funding necessary to be successful throughout the African continent.  We also recommend private sector participation in training to bolster these markets and provide expertise necessary for development of trading infrastructure.
To advance these goals and show our commitment to developing capital markets, it is my pleasure to announce this morning that Bloomberg is establishing a grant to the Financial Services Volunteer Corps to sponsor a technical assistance program in Africa. The FSVC is a not-for-profit, private-public partnership that helps to build sound financial systems in emerging market countries. This grant will fund a training and capacity building program on the continent in an effort to strengthen securities markets. The new initiative will have a positive impact on investment opportunities and African governments alike.
In addition to funding the grant, we will continue our commitment at Bloomberg to providing training via our terminal to African central bankers, securities regulators, and the private sector, and we will also continue developing trading infrastructure. Similarly, I would like to encourage other companies to share their expertise with those on the continent as well.
Finally, I am delighted to announce that Bloomberg has committed to hosting a business and economic summit in Africa in early 2016. The summit, tapping Bloomberg’s editorial and analytical resources on the continent and beyond, will convene top executives and policy makers for a deeper look at Africa’s domestic economies and an exploration of their roles in changing the global economy. Bloomberg journalists will lead conversations focused on issues including energy, technology, infrastructure, the opportunities and risks of doing business in the region, and strengthening of Africa’s capital markets. Thank you.

Personal life and education[edit]
Grauer was born in Philadelphia, PA in 1945.[3] He graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1968 with a BA in English, and Harvard Business School, Program for Management Development in 1975. Prior to Chapel Hill, Peter graduated from Hotchkiss School.[4]
Grauer is a member of the Board of the USA Cycling Development Foundation and a member of the Board of the Prostate Cancer Foundation.[5] He also serves as President of the Board of Trustees of the Inner City Scholarship Fund in New York City.[6]
In June 2013, Grauer was appointed an Independent Non-Executive Director of Glencore plc, later rising to Senior Independent Non-Executive Director in May 2014.[7]
In 2014, Grauer became the founding chairman of the American chapter of the 30% Club, an international organization aimed at increasing women’s representation on corporate boards.[8]
Grauer was named to the Global Advisory Board of Out Leadership, which partners with senior executives to advance LGBT equality, in late 2014.[9] OutStanding and the Financial Times named Grauer #4 in their 2015 list of Leading LGBT & Ally Executives, citing his active commitment to LGBT workplace inclusion in Bloomberg LP’s global offices.[10]
Grauer sits on the boards of several prominent educational institutions. He serves as the Founding Board Chair of College Advising Corps, a national nonprofit organization that supports low-income, first generation students on the path to college.[11] He is also a member of both the Board of Trustees of Rockefeller University, a global center for scientific research and education,[12] and the Emeritus Board of literacy and education nonprofit Room to Read.[13] Grauer currently serves as the Chairman Emeritus of Big Apple Circus, an award-winning New York circus performing company and community outreach organization.[14]
Grauer is a former member of the Board of Trustees of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill[15] and Chairman of the External Advisory Board of the Undergraduate Honors Program,[16] as well as a member of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Foundation Board and the UNC Global Research Institute Board. Additionally, Grauer is the former President of the Pomfret School Board of Trustees.[17] In 2015 Grauer voted against changing the name of Saunders Hall at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill when an objection was raised concerning William Saunders's prominent Ku Klux Klan activity.[18]
Grauer also serves as an advisor to multiple global business institutions. Grauer sits on the advisory board of McKinsey & Company, a global management consulting firm.[19] He is a member of the International Advisory Board of BritishAmerican Business,[20] a transatlantic business network connecting leaders in New York and London. In June 2016, multinational investment firm Blackstone Group appointed Grauer to its board of directors.[21][22]
Professional career[edit]
Prior to his time at Bloomberg L.P., Grauer was the managing director and senior Partner of the investment bank Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette from 1992 to 2000, when DLJ was acquired by Credit Suisse First Boston. He was also the founder of DLJ Merchant Banking Partners and DLJ Investment Partners. Grauer has been a director of DaVita, Inc. a Colorado-based healthcare company since 1994 and the lead independent director since 2003.[23]
He is a member of the Executive Committee of The Business Council, starting in 2011 (still currently involved).[24]
Bloomberg[edit]
Grauer met the Founder of Bloomberg L.P., Michael Bloomberg, during equestrian shows both their daughters participated in.[25] It was not until 1996 that Grauer was asked to become a member of the Bloomberg L.P. board of directors where he was later named Chairman of the Board in March 2001, succeeding Michael Bloomberg.[23]
Despite the economic downturn in 2007, Grauer has been credited with bolstering the workforce at Bloomberg L.P., adding nearly 1,000 employees in 2009. Additionally, while Chairman of Bloomberg L.P, Grauer led the company to purchase BusinessWeek from McGraw-Hill being quoted as saying he would like Bloomberg to become, ‘the most influential source of news for the financial and business community.”[26][27]
In July 2011, Daniel L. Doctoroff was promoted to Bloomberg L.P.’s chief executive officer and assumed majority responsibility of the company from Grauer, who remained chairman and to whom Doctoroff continued to report.[1] Following Doctoroff’s departure from the company in September 2014, Mike Bloomberg resumed overall leadership of Bloomberg L.P., with support from Grauer and Tom Secunda.[28]

In 2014, Grauer became the founding chairman of the American chapter of the 30% Club, an international organization aimed at increasing women’s representation on corporate boards.[8]
Grauer was named to the Global Advisory Board of Out Leadership, which partners with senior executives to advance LGBT equality, in late 2014.[9] OutStanding and the Financial Times named Grauer #4 in their 2015 list of Leading LGBT & Ally Executives, citing his active commitment to LGBT workplace inclusion in Bloomberg LP’s global offices.[10]
Grauer sits on the boards of several prominent educational institutions. He serves as the Founding Board Chair of College Advising Corps, a national nonprofit organization that supports low-income, first generation students on the path to college.[11] He is also a member of both the Board of Trustees of Rockefeller University, a global center for scientific research and education,[12] and the Emeritus Board of literacy and education nonprofit Room to Read.[13] Grauer currently serves as the Chairman Emeritus of Big Apple Circus, an award-winning New York circus performing company and community outreach organization.[14]

Professional career[edit]
Prior to his time at Bloomberg L.P., Grauer was the managing director and senior Partner of the investment bank Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette from 1992 to 2000, when DLJ was acquired by Credit Suisse First Boston. He was also the founder of DLJ Merchant Banking Partners and DLJ Investment Partners. Grauer has been a director of DaVita, Inc. a Colorado-based healthcare company since 1994 and the lead independent director since 2003.[23]
He is a member of the Executive Committee of The Business Council, starting in 2011 (still currently involved).[24]
Bloomberg[edit]
Grauer met the Founder of Bloomberg L.P., Michael Bloomberg, during equestrian shows both their daughters participated in.[25] It was not until 1996 that Grauer was asked to become a member of the Bloomberg L.P. board of directors where he was later named Chairman of the Board in March 2001, succeeding Michael Bloomberg.[23]
Despite the economic downturn in 2007, Grauer has been credited with bolstering the workforce at Bloomberg L.P., adding nearly 1,000 employees in 2009. Additionally, while Chairman of Bloomberg L.P, Grauer led the company to purchase BusinessWeek from McGraw-Hill being quoted as saying he would like Bloomberg to become, ‘the most influential source of news for the financial and business community.”[26][27]
In July 2011, Daniel L. Doctoroff was promoted to Bloomberg L.P.’s chief executive officer and assumed majority responsibility of the company from Grauer, who remained chairman and to whom Doctoroff continued to report.[1] Following Doctoroff’s departure from the company in September 2014, Mike Bloomberg resumed overall leadership of Bloomberg L.P., with support from Grauer and Tom Secunda.[28]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
