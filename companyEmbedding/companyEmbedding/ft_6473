Resistance
The more wire you have, the greater the resistance. The following factors affect resistance.
Diameter: The thinner the wire (higher gauge number), the higher the resistance per foot. The thicker the wire (lower gauge number), the lower the resistance.
Length: The longer the wire, the higher the overall resistance. The shorter the wire, the lower the overall resistance.
Temperature: The more heat the wire generates, the more resistance it will create.
Current: Determine the current (amperage) you need to heat your wire.
