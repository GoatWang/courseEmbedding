About History
TIA was founded in 1987 by Larry K. Pitts and a team of former investment officers from American Fletcher National Bank & Trust Company (AFNB).  AFNB had merged with Bank One which is now J. P. Morgan Chase.
The team was responsible for the Trust & Asset Management Group at AFNB.  At the time of the merger, they were nationally recognized as an intermediate fixed income manager.  Their $10 billion in trust assets under management at AFNB exceeded Bank One’s entire trust assets at the date of the merger.  This fixed income expertise and proven equity process was the genesis of TIA’s Preferred Income Portfolio (PIP) introduced in 2009.
Portfolio Development
TIA launched their Value Equity Portfolio (VEP) in 1987 and its sister Income Equity Portfolio (IEP) in 1993.  These portfolios have been fully tested for decades under various stock market cycles.  The result has been reduced volatility and risk-adjusted returns.  The market conditions in the late 1990’s convinced TIA to develop the third equity style-Growth Equity Portfolio (GEP).  Our growth style is value based with a Growth at a Reasonable Price (GARP) philosophy.  TIA’s three value portfolios have different dividend yields and growth rates.  Our institutional asset allocation model utilizes all three portfolios.
For specifics on each equity portfolio, refer to the Equity Styles section.

Independent Equity ResearchIntroduction
The foundation of Trust Investment Advisor's Equity Process is the development of equity style portfolios for various asset classes and their application to individual client's portfolios.
The development of this investing philosophy is identified on the About page. The application of this approach is detailed on the Equity Styles page.
Our fundamental stock research distinguishes TIA from many other investment management firms. The client's Portfolio Manager is a member of our Investment Committee, and fully participates in our investing decisions.
Client Benefits

The relationship with the client is seamless -- from initial interview, through the specific equity styles chosen, to the actual investment decisions made.
Clients receive a monthly statement from their custodian.
Clients also receive a comprehensive quarterly review of their account. 

Past Performance
Past performance is no guarantee of future results. However, TIA has realized significant benefits from its proven investment process:

Above S&P 500 returns during the "lost decade" of 2000 to 2010
Created a new Corporate Preferred Income Portfolio for the best quality relative yields
Designed a Covered Call strategy to increase client portfolio income

As a result of TIA's innovative investment portfolio services, the client base has expanded to brokerage firms to offer these unique services to their clients.
Equity Process
TIA's process begins with a database of 14,000 stocks and TIA's investment guidelines. TIA then selects the equities which qualify for specific equity portfolios. From those, TIA selects the "undervalued" stocks. From that group, TIA selects those which best suit the equity style at this point in time.
The Sell process is just as important as the Buy process. TIA uses the following criteria for determining when to sell a stock:

Stock achieves Target Price
Fundamentals Deteriorate
Opportunity to Buy a Better Stock

TIA has a policy of staying fully invested at all times and doesn't engage in "market timing." We do reduce stock market risk by reducing the percentage allocation to equities at times of perceived risk.
Account Reviews
Our Investment Committee meets on a regular basis to manage the equity style portfolios. Each equity style is designed to meet a particular investment goal and is incorporated in an overall investment strategy for each client.
The stock selection research for each equity style has two components:

a screening to determine stocks meeting TIA's guidelines for consideration in the specific portfolio, and
a valuation matrix to determine the relative attractiveness of stocks.

The guidelines for purchase and sell decisions are identified for each equity style.
Strategies
Fundamental Research
TIA uses fundamental research analysis as its primary selection method. TIA applies its own independent and proprietary valuation techniques to determine the attractiveness of a security.
Technical Analysis
TIA uses technical analysis only as a supplement to their investment process. Technical analysis identifies past market movements and applies those patterns to the present. This can show recurring patterns of investor behavior and potentially predict future price movement.
Qualitative Analysis
TIA subjectively evaluates non-quantifiable factors such as quality of management, industry sector, management attitude towards shareholders, strength of research and development, and factors not readily subject to measurement which help predict changes to share price based on that data.

TIA is an Indianapolis-based, local independent investment advisory firm.
TIA was founded in 1987 by Larry K. Pitts who had served as Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Trust Officer for American Fletcher National Bank and Trust -- Indiana's largest independent national bank -- now J.P. Morgan Chase. Based on his leadership, the firm has developed portfolios which offer a variety of investment equity styles to clients.
100% of TIA's mission is devoted to providing outstanding client service and long term risk-adjusted investment returns. Investment advice is the only business of TIA. Our investment process has been proven for over 30 years. The TIA team is deep and with broad expertise in the field of investments. And, team members have had many years of working together. As CEO Larry Pitts says "Talented people plus a proven process equals investment performance!" 
In initial meetings with clients, TIA determines the individual or institution's objectives, time horizons, risk tolerance, and income requirements. TIA's investment strategy determines an appropriate asset allocation for the client and utilizes our equity styles. Client portfolios are reviewed and evaluated quarterly.
Call TIA today at 317-253-2000 to begin the conversation.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
