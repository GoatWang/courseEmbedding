History[edit]
WARF was founded in 1925 to manage a discovery by Harry Steenbock, who invented the process for using ultraviolet radiation to add vitamin D to milk and other foods. Rather than leaving the invention unpatented—then the standard practice for university inventions—Steenbock used $300 of his own money to file for a patent. He received commercial interest from Quaker Oats but declined the company's initial offer.
Instead, Steenbock sought a way to protect discoveries made by UW-Madison faculty, ensure use of the ideas for public benefit and bring any financial gains back to the university. His concept gained support from Harry L. Russell, dean of the College of Agriculture, and Charles Sumner Slichter, dean of the Graduate School.
Slichter began soliciting the interest and financial support of wealthy UW-Madison alumni acquaintances in Chicago and New York. He gained a substantial sum in verbal pledges from a number of alumni, nine of whom would eventually contribute $100 each.
The UW Board of Regents approved the plan on June 22, 1925, and the organization's charter was filed with the Secretary of State of Wisconsin on November 14 that same year. The organization was named the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation to reflect both its governing body of five UW–Madison alumni and its mission to promote, encourage and aid scientific investigation and research at UW-Madison.[1]
Since its founding, WARF has helped steward the cycle of research, discovery, commercialization and investment for UW–Madison. Through its patenting and licensing efforts, WARF enables university innovations to advance from the lab to the marketplace.
Each year, WARF contributes more than $70 million to fund additional UW–Madison research. The university refers to WARF's annual gifts as its "margin of excellence" funding.[2] WARF currently licenses nearly 100 UW–Madison technologies each year. As of 2014, WARF had an endowment of $2.6 billion.[3]
WARF also works in partnership with a variety of other entities including WiSys Technology Foundation, WiCell Research Institute and the Morgridge Institute for Research.
WARF inventions[edit]
From the early discoveries related to vitamin D and development of the blood thinner warfarin to the derivation of stem cells and algorithms that speed computer processing, UW–Madison inventions have changed lives.[4][5][6]
Vitamin D[edit]
In 1923, Harry Steenbock and James Cockwell discovered exposure to ultraviolet light increased the Vitamin D concentration in food. After discovering that irradiated rat food cured the rats of rickets, Steenbock sought a patent. Steenbock then assigned the patent to the newly established Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation. WARF then licensed the technology to Quaker Oats for use in their breakfast cereals. In addition, WARF licensed the technology for use as a pharmaceutical, Viosterol.[7] WARF's commercialization of Vitamin D culminated in its enrichment of milk.
By the time the patent expired in 1945, rickets was all but nonexistent.
Through continued innovations from Hector DeLuca, vitamin D remains an important part of WARF's technology portfolio.[8]
Warfarin[edit]
Warfarin, also known as Coumadin, is named for WARF, and the story of its discovery is emblematic of the "Wisconsin Idea" and the relationship of the university to the Wisconsin public. In 1933 a farmer from Deer Park showed up unannounced at the School of Agriculture and walked into a professor's laboratory with a milk can full of blood which would not coagulate. In his truck, he had also brought a dead heifer and some spoiled clover hay. He wanted to know what had killed his cow. In 1941, Karl Paul Link successfully isolated the anticoagulant factor, which initially found commercial application as a rodent-killer.[9] Warfarin is now one of the most widely prescribed medicines in the world, used in vascular and heart disease to prevent stroke and thrombosis.
Stem cells[edit]
More recently, WARF was assigned the patents for non-human primate and human embryonic stem cells. The stem cells were first isolated and purified by James Thomson in 1998.[10]
Startup companies[edit]
WARF has also helped establish more than 60 startup companies including Imago, Mirus Bio, Nimblegen, Tomotherapy, Deltanoid Pharmaceuticals, Quinntessence, Neoclone, Silatronix, Third Wave Technologies, Cambria Biosciences, and OpGen, Inc.
Patent litigation[edit]
WARF was called a "patent troll" by Business Insider, which included WARF in a list of the "most fearsome" of them. The magazine noted that while many universities could be described as "patent trolls", WARF was singled out because of the large number of patents it held. A WARF spokesperson denied that the group acted as a non-participating entity, explaining that "our whole purpose for being is to bring inventions from the university into the world into practical use."[11][12][13]
In 2014, WARF filed a lawsuit against Apple Inc., alleging that it had infringed US 5781752 , "Table based data speculation circuit for parallel processing computer", on its Apple A7 and Apple A8 system-on-chip products. In October 2015, Apple was found liable; the company could be assessed up to US$862.4 million in damages.[14]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation was established in 1925.


The Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation is the independent nonprofit technology transfer organization serving the University of Wisconsin–Madison and Morgridge Institute for Research. It provides significant research support, granting tens of millions of dollars to the university each year and contributing to the university's "margin of excellence."

History[edit]
WARF was founded in 1925 to manage a discovery by Harry Steenbock, who invented the process for using ultraviolet radiation to add vitamin D to milk and other foods. Rather than leaving the invention unpatented—then the standard practice for university inventions—Steenbock used $300 of his own money to file for a patent. He received commercial interest from Quaker Oats but declined the company's initial offer.
Instead, Steenbock sought a way to protect discoveries made by UW-Madison faculty, ensure use of the ideas for public benefit and bring any financial gains back to the university. His concept gained support from Harry L. Russell, dean of the College of Agriculture, and Charles Sumner Slichter, dean of the Graduate School.
Slichter began soliciting the interest and financial support of wealthy UW-Madison alumni acquaintances in Chicago and New York. He gained a substantial sum in verbal pledges from a number of alumni, nine of whom would eventually contribute $100 each.
The UW Board of Regents approved the plan on June 22, 1925, and the organization's charter was filed with the Secretary of State of Wisconsin on November 14 that same year. The organization was named the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation to reflect both its governing body of five UW–Madison alumni and its mission to promote, encourage and aid scientific investigation and research at UW-Madison.[1]
Since its founding, WARF has helped steward the cycle of research, discovery, commercialization and investment for UW–Madison. Through its patenting and licensing efforts, WARF enables university innovations to advance from the lab to the marketplace.
Each year, WARF contributes more than $70 million to fund additional UW–Madison research. The university refers to WARF's annual gifts as its "margin of excellence" funding.[2] WARF currently licenses nearly 100 UW–Madison technologies each year. As of 2014, WARF had an endowment of $2.6 billion.[3]
WARF also works in partnership with a variety of other entities including WiSys Technology Foundation, WiCell Research Institute and the Morgridge Institute for Research.
WARF inventions[edit]
From the early discoveries related to vitamin D and development of the blood thinner warfarin to the derivation of stem cells and algorithms that speed computer processing, UW–Madison inventions have changed lives.[4][5][6]
Vitamin D[edit]
In 1923, Harry Steenbock and James Cockwell discovered exposure to ultraviolet light increased the Vitamin D concentration in food. After discovering that irradiated rat food cured the rats of rickets, Steenbock sought a patent. Steenbock then assigned the patent to the newly established Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation. WARF then licensed the technology to Quaker Oats for use in their breakfast cereals. In addition, WARF licensed the technology for use as a pharmaceutical, Viosterol.[7] WARF's commercialization of Vitamin D culminated in its enrichment of milk.
By the time the patent expired in 1945, rickets was all but nonexistent.
Through continued innovations from Hector DeLuca, vitamin D remains an important part of WARF's technology portfolio.[8]
Warfarin[edit]
Warfarin, also known as Coumadin, is named for WARF, and the story of its discovery is emblematic of the "Wisconsin Idea" and the relationship of the university to the Wisconsin public. In 1933 a farmer from Deer Park showed up unannounced at the School of Agriculture and walked into a professor's laboratory with a milk can full of blood which would not coagulate. In his truck, he had also brought a dead heifer and some spoiled clover hay. He wanted to know what had killed his cow. In 1941, Karl Paul Link successfully isolated the anticoagulant factor, which initially found commercial application as a rodent-killer.[9] Warfarin is now one of the most widely prescribed medicines in the world, used in vascular and heart disease to prevent stroke and thrombosis.
Stem cells[edit]
More recently, WARF was assigned the patents for non-human primate and human embryonic stem cells. The stem cells were first isolated and purified by James Thomson in 1998.[10]
Startup companies[edit]
WARF has also helped establish more than 60 startup companies including Imago, Mirus Bio, Nimblegen, Tomotherapy, Deltanoid Pharmaceuticals, Quinntessence, Neoclone, Silatronix, Third Wave Technologies, Cambria Biosciences, and OpGen, Inc.
Patent litigation[edit]
WARF was called a "patent troll" by Business Insider, which included WARF in a list of the "most fearsome" of them. The magazine noted that while many universities could be described as "patent trolls", WARF was singled out because of the large number of patents it held. A WARF spokesperson denied that the group acted as a non-participating entity, explaining that "our whole purpose for being is to bring inventions from the university into the world into practical use."[11][12][13]
In 2014, WARF filed a lawsuit against Apple Inc., alleging that it had infringed US 5781752 , "Table based data speculation circuit for parallel processing computer", on its Apple A7 and Apple A8 system-on-chip products. In October 2015, Apple was found liable; the company could be assessed up to US$862.4 million in damages.[14]

In 1933 a farmer from Deer Park showed up unannounced at the School of Agriculture and walked into a professor's laboratory with a milk can full of blood which would not coagulate. In his truck, he had also brought a dead heifer and some spoiled clover hay. He wanted to know what had killed his cow. In 1941, Karl Paul Link successfully isolated the anticoagulant factor, which initially found commercial application as a rodent-killer.[9] Warfarin is now one of the most widely prescribed medicines in the world, used in vascular and heart disease to prevent stroke and thrombosis.
Stem cells[edit]
More recently, WARF was assigned the patents for non-human primate and human embryonic stem cells. The stem cells were first isolated and purified by James Thomson in 1998.[10]
Startup companies[edit]
WARF has also helped establish more than 60 startup companies including Imago, Mirus Bio, Nimblegen, Tomotherapy, Deltanoid Pharmaceuticals, Quinntessence, Neoclone, Silatronix, Third Wave Technologies, Cambria Biosciences, and OpGen, Inc.
Patent litigation[edit]
WARF was called a "patent troll" by Business Insider, which included WARF in a list of the "most fearsome" of them. The magazine noted that while many universities could be described as "patent trolls", WARF was singled out because of the large number of patents it held. A WARF spokesperson denied that the group acted as a non-participating entity, explaining that "our whole purpose for being is to bring inventions from the university into the world into practical use."[11][12][13]
In 2014, WARF filed a lawsuit against Apple Inc., alleging that it had infringed US 5781752 , "Table based data speculation circuit for parallel processing computer", on its Apple A7 and Apple A8 system-on-chip products. In October 2015, Apple was found liable; the company could be assessed up to US$862.4 million in damages.[14]

History[edit]
WARF was founded in 1925 to manage a discovery by Harry Steenbock, who invented the process for using ultraviolet radiation to add vitamin D to milk and other foods. Rather than leaving the invention unpatented—then the standard practice for university inventions—Steenbock used $300 of his own money to file for a patent. He received commercial interest from Quaker Oats but declined the company's initial offer.
Instead, Steenbock sought a way to protect discoveries made by UW-Madison faculty, ensure use of the ideas for public benefit and bring any financial gains back to the university. His concept gained support from Harry L. Russell, dean of the College of Agriculture, and Charles Sumner Slichter, dean of the Graduate School.
Slichter began soliciting the interest and financial support of wealthy UW-Madison alumni acquaintances in Chicago and New York. He gained a substantial sum in verbal pledges from a number of alumni, nine of whom would eventually contribute $100 each.
The UW Board of Regents approved the plan on June 22, 1925, and the organization's charter was filed with the Secretary of State of Wisconsin on November 14 that same year. The organization was named the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation to reflect both its governing body of five UW–Madison alumni and its mission to promote, encourage and aid scientific investigation and research at UW-Madison.[1]
Since its founding, WARF has helped steward the cycle of research, discovery, commercialization and investment for UW–Madison. Through its patenting and licensing efforts, WARF enables university innovations to advance from the lab to the marketplace.
Each year, WARF contributes more than $70 million to fund additional UW–Madison research. The university refers to WARF's annual gifts as its "margin of excellence" funding.[2] WARF currently licenses nearly 100 UW–Madison technologies each year. As of 2014, WARF had an endowment of $2.6 billion.[3]
WARF also works in partnership with a variety of other entities including WiSys Technology Foundation, WiCell Research Institute and the Morgridge Institute for Research.
WARF inventions[edit]
From the early discoveries related to vitamin D and development of the blood thinner warfarin to the derivation of stem cells and algorithms that speed computer processing, UW–Madison inventions have changed lives.[4][5][6]
Vitamin D[edit]
In 1923, Harry Steenbock and James Cockwell discovered exposure to ultraviolet light increased the Vitamin D concentration in food. After discovering that irradiated rat food cured the rats of rickets, Steenbock sought a patent. Steenbock then assigned the patent to the newly established Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation. WARF then licensed the technology to Quaker Oats for use in their breakfast cereals. In addition, WARF licensed the technology for use as a pharmaceutical, Viosterol.[7] WARF's commercialization of Vitamin D culminated in its enrichment of milk.
By the time the patent expired in 1945, rickets was all but nonexistent.
Through continued innovations from Hector DeLuca, vitamin D remains an important part of WARF's technology portfolio.[8]
Warfarin[edit]
Warfarin, also known as Coumadin, is named for WARF, and the story of its discovery is emblematic of the "Wisconsin Idea" and the relationship of the university to the Wisconsin public. In 1933 a farmer from Deer Park showed up unannounced at the School of Agriculture and walked into a professor's laboratory with a milk can full of blood which would not coagulate. In his truck, he had also brought a dead heifer and some spoiled clover hay. He wanted to know what had killed his cow. In 1941, Karl Paul Link successfully isolated the anticoagulant factor, which initially found commercial application as a rodent-killer.[9] Warfarin is now one of the most widely prescribed medicines in the world, used in vascular and heart disease to prevent stroke and thrombosis.
Stem cells[edit]
More recently, WARF was assigned the patents for non-human primate and human embryonic stem cells. The stem cells were first isolated and purified by James Thomson in 1998.[10]
Startup companies[edit]
WARF has also helped establish more than 60 startup companies including Imago, Mirus Bio, Nimblegen, Tomotherapy, Deltanoid Pharmaceuticals, Quinntessence, Neoclone, Silatronix, Third Wave Technologies, Cambria Biosciences, and OpGen, Inc.
Patent litigation[edit]
WARF was called a "patent troll" by Business Insider, which included WARF in a list of the "most fearsome" of them. The magazine noted that while many universities could be described as "patent trolls", WARF was singled out because of the large number of patents it held. A WARF spokesperson denied that the group acted as a non-participating entity, explaining that "our whole purpose for being is to bring inventions from the university into the world into practical use."[11][12][13]
In 2014, WARF filed a lawsuit against Apple Inc., alleging that it had infringed US 5781752 , "Table based data speculation circuit for parallel processing computer", on its Apple A7 and Apple A8 system-on-chip products. In October 2015, Apple was found liable; the company could be assessed up to US$862.4 million in damages.[14]

History[edit]
WARF was founded in 1925 to manage a discovery by Harry Steenbock, who invented the process for using ultraviolet radiation to add vitamin D to milk and other foods. Rather than leaving the invention unpatented—then the standard practice for university inventions—Steenbock used $300 of his own money to file for a patent. He received commercial interest from Quaker Oats but declined the company's initial offer.
Instead, Steenbock sought a way to protect discoveries made by UW-Madison faculty, ensure use of the ideas for public benefit and bring any financial gains back to the university. His concept gained support from Harry L. Russell, dean of the College of Agriculture, and Charles Sumner Slichter, dean of the Graduate School.
Slichter began soliciting the interest and financial support of wealthy UW-Madison alumni acquaintances in Chicago and New York. He gained a substantial sum in verbal pledges from a number of alumni, nine of whom would eventually contribute $100 each.
The UW Board of Regents approved the plan on June 22, 1925, and the organization's charter was filed with the Secretary of State of Wisconsin on November 14 that same year. The organization was named the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation to reflect both its governing body of five UW–Madison alumni and its mission to promote, encourage and aid scientific investigation and research at UW-Madison.[1]
Since its founding, WARF has helped steward the cycle of research, discovery, commercialization and investment for UW–Madison. Through its patenting and licensing efforts, WARF enables university innovations to advance from the lab to the marketplace.
Each year, WARF contributes more than $70 million to fund additional UW–Madison research. The university refers to WARF's annual gifts as its "margin of excellence" funding.[2] WARF currently licenses nearly 100 UW–Madison technologies each year. As of 2014, WARF had an endowment of $2.6 billion.[3]
WARF also works in partnership with a variety of other entities including WiSys Technology Foundation, WiCell Research Institute and the Morgridge Institute for Research.
WARF inventions[edit]
From the early discoveries related to vitamin D and development of the blood thinner warfarin to the derivation of stem cells and algorithms that speed computer processing, UW–Madison inventions have changed lives.[4][5][6]
Vitamin D[edit]
In 1923, Harry Steenbock and James Cockwell discovered exposure to ultraviolet light increased the Vitamin D concentration in food. After discovering that irradiated rat food cured the rats of rickets, Steenbock sought a patent. Steenbock then assigned the patent to the newly established Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation. WARF then licensed the technology to Quaker Oats for use in their breakfast cereals. In addition, WARF licensed the technology for use as a pharmaceutical, Viosterol.[7] WARF's commercialization of Vitamin D culminated in its enrichment of milk.
By the time the patent expired in 1945, rickets was all but nonexistent.
Through continued innovations from Hector DeLuca, vitamin D remains an important part of WARF's technology portfolio.[8]
Warfarin[edit]
Warfarin, also known as Coumadin, is named for WARF, and the story of its discovery is emblematic of the "Wisconsin Idea" and the relationship of the university to the Wisconsin public. In 1933 a farmer from Deer Park showed up unannounced at the School of Agriculture and walked into a professor's laboratory with a milk can full of blood which would not coagulate. In his truck, he had also brought a dead heifer and some spoiled clover hay. He wanted to know what had killed his cow. In 1941, Karl Paul Link successfully isolated the anticoagulant factor, which initially found commercial application as a rodent-killer.[9] Warfarin is now one of the most widely prescribed medicines in the world, used in vascular and heart disease to prevent stroke and thrombosis.
Stem cells[edit]
More recently, WARF was assigned the patents for non-human primate and human embryonic stem cells. The stem cells were first isolated and purified by James Thomson in 1998.[10]
Startup companies[edit]
WARF has also helped establish more than 60 startup companies including Imago, Mirus Bio, Nimblegen, Tomotherapy, Deltanoid Pharmaceuticals, Quinntessence, Neoclone, Silatronix, Third Wave Technologies, Cambria Biosciences, and OpGen, Inc.
Patent litigation[edit]
WARF was called a "patent troll" by Business Insider, which included WARF in a list of the "most fearsome" of them. The magazine noted that while many universities could be described as "patent trolls", WARF was singled out because of the large number of patents it held. A WARF spokesperson denied that the group acted as a non-participating entity, explaining that "our whole purpose for being is to bring inventions from the university into the world into practical use."[11][12][13]
In 2014, WARF filed a lawsuit against Apple Inc., alleging that it had infringed US 5781752 , "Table based data speculation circuit for parallel processing computer", on its Apple A7 and Apple A8 system-on-chip products. In October 2015, Apple was found liable; the company could be assessed up to US$862.4 million in damages.[14]

The Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation was established in 1925.


The Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation is the independent nonprofit technology transfer organization serving the University of Wisconsin–Madison and Morgridge Institute for Research. It provides significant research support, granting tens of millions of dollars to the university each year and contributing to the university's "margin of excellence."

History[edit]
WARF was founded in 1925 to manage a discovery by Harry Steenbock, who invented the process for using ultraviolet radiation to add vitamin D to milk and other foods. Rather than leaving the invention unpatented—then the standard practice for university inventions—Steenbock used $300 of his own money to file for a patent. He received commercial interest from Quaker Oats but declined the company's initial offer.
Instead, Steenbock sought a way to protect discoveries made by UW-Madison faculty, ensure use of the ideas for public benefit and bring any financial gains back to the university. His concept gained support from Harry L. Russell, dean of the College of Agriculture, and Charles Sumner Slichter, dean of the Graduate School.
Slichter began soliciting the interest and financial support of wealthy UW-Madison alumni acquaintances in Chicago and New York. He gained a substantial sum in verbal pledges from a number of alumni, nine of whom would eventually contribute $100 each.
The UW Board of Regents approved the plan on June 22, 1925, and the organization's charter was filed with the Secretary of State of Wisconsin on November 14 that same year. The organization was named the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation to reflect both its governing body of five UW–Madison alumni and its mission to promote, encourage and aid scientific investigation and research at UW-Madison.[1]
Since its founding, WARF has helped steward the cycle of research, discovery, commercialization and investment for UW–Madison. Through its patenting and licensing efforts, WARF enables university innovations to advance from the lab to the marketplace.
Each year, WARF contributes more than $70 million to fund additional UW–Madison research. The university refers to WARF's annual gifts as its "margin of excellence" funding.[2] WARF currently licenses nearly 100 UW–Madison technologies each year. As of 2014, WARF had an endowment of $2.6 billion.[3]
WARF also works in partnership with a variety of other entities including WiSys Technology Foundation, WiCell Research Institute and the Morgridge Institute for Research.
WARF inventions[edit]
From the early discoveries related to vitamin D and development of the blood thinner warfarin to the derivation of stem cells and algorithms that speed computer processing, UW–Madison inventions have changed lives.[4][5][6]
Vitamin D[edit]
In 1923, Harry Steenbock and James Cockwell discovered exposure to ultraviolet light increased the Vitamin D concentration in food. After discovering that irradiated rat food cured the rats of rickets, Steenbock sought a patent. Steenbock then assigned the patent to the newly established Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation. WARF then licensed the technology to Quaker Oats for use in their breakfast cereals. In addition, WARF licensed the technology for use as a pharmaceutical, Viosterol.[7] WARF's commercialization of Vitamin D culminated in its enrichment of milk.
By the time the patent expired in 1945, rickets was all but nonexistent.
Through continued innovations from Hector DeLuca, vitamin D remains an important part of WARF's technology portfolio.[8]
Warfarin[edit]
Warfarin, also known as Coumadin, is named for WARF, and the story of its discovery is emblematic of the "Wisconsin Idea" and the relationship of the university to the Wisconsin public. In 1933 a farmer from Deer Park showed up unannounced at the School of Agriculture and walked into a professor's laboratory with a milk can full of blood which would not coagulate. In his truck, he had also brought a dead heifer and some spoiled clover hay. He wanted to know what had killed his cow. In 1941, Karl Paul Link successfully isolated the anticoagulant factor, which initially found commercial application as a rodent-killer.[9] Warfarin is now one of the most widely prescribed medicines in the world, used in vascular and heart disease to prevent stroke and thrombosis.
Stem cells[edit]
More recently, WARF was assigned the patents for non-human primate and human embryonic stem cells. The stem cells were first isolated and purified by James Thomson in 1998.[10]
Startup companies[edit]
WARF has also helped establish more than 60 startup companies including Imago, Mirus Bio, Nimblegen, Tomotherapy, Deltanoid Pharmaceuticals, Quinntessence, Neoclone, Silatronix, Third Wave Technologies, Cambria Biosciences, and OpGen, Inc.
Patent litigation[edit]
WARF was called a "patent troll" by Business Insider, which included WARF in a list of the "most fearsome" of them. The magazine noted that while many universities could be described as "patent trolls", WARF was singled out because of the large number of patents it held. A WARF spokesperson denied that the group acted as a non-participating entity, explaining that "our whole purpose for being is to bring inventions from the university into the world into practical use."[11][12][13]
In 2014, WARF filed a lawsuit against Apple Inc., alleging that it had infringed US 5781752 , "Table based data speculation circuit for parallel processing computer", on its Apple A7 and Apple A8 system-on-chip products. In October 2015, Apple was found liable; the company could be assessed up to US$862.4 million in damages.[14]

            UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
WESTERN DISTRICT OF WISCONSIN
WISCONSIN ALUMNI RESEARCH
FOUNDATION,
Plaintiff,

Case No. 14-cv-0062

v.

DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL

APPLE INC.,
Defendant.

COMPLAINT

Plaintiff Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation, by its undersigned counsel, for its
complaint against defendant Apple Inc., states as follows, with knowledge as to its own acts, and
on information and belief as to the acts of others:
I.

INTRODUCTION
1.

This is an action for infringement of a patent awarded to computer scientists for

their work at the University of Wisconsin—Madison. The patent is owned by the plaintiff,
Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (“WARF”), the designated patent management
organization of the University of Wisconsin – Madison. WARF’s mission is to support research
and scholarship at the University. Since 1925, WARF has used the revenue from patents
developed by University researchers to support the University’s on-going educational and
research work.
2.

The patent-in-suit is United States Patent No. 5,781,752 (the “’752 patent”),

entitled “Table Based Data Speculation Circuit for Parallel Processing Computer” to Andreas
Moshovos, Scott Breach, Terani Vijaykumar, and Gurindar Sohi. The inventors are leading
researchers in the field of computer microprocessor architecture. Their work at the University of
Wisconsin—Madison, particularly the work for which they were awarded the patent-in-suit, has

significantly improved the efficiency and performance of contemporary computer processors.
This work has been recognized as a major milestone in the field of computer microprocessor
architecture/design. Indeed, Dr. Sohi, the leader of the lab that developed the ’752 patent, has
been elected to the National Academy of Engineering based on his work in the field of computer
architecture. And in 2011 he received the computer architecture community’s most prestigious
award, the Eckert-Mauchly Award, also based on his work, including specifically the work in the
’752 patent. Another inventor, Dr. Moshovos, received the prestigious Maurice Wilkes award
from the Association for Computing Machinery, for outstanding contribution to computer
architecture by an individual in the profession 20 years or less, for his work in the ’752 patent.
3.

WARF is informed and believes, and on this basis alleges, that Apple is one of the

largest makers of smart phones and tablet computers in the world.
4.

WARF is informed and believes, and on this basis alleges, that Apple’s newest

products—including the iPhone 5S, the iPad Air, and the iPad Mini with Retina Display—each
use Apple’s newest A7 processor.
5.

WARF is informed and believes, and on this basis alleges, that Apple has

incorporated the technology of WARF’s ‘752 patent into the A7 processor to achieve enhanced
efficiency and performance. WARF now asks this Court to prevent Apple’s unauthorized use of
the ‘752 patent.
II.

PARTIES
6.

Plaintiff WARF is a not-for-profit Wisconsin corporation having its principal

place of business at 614 Walnut Street, Madison, Wisconsin 53726. WARF is the designated
patent management organization of the University of Wisconsin – Madison (the “University”).
WARF’s mission is to support research at the University. WARF carries out this mission by
patenting and licensing University inventions and by returning the proceeds of that licensing to
fund additional research at the University.
7.

Apple Inc. (“Apple” or “Defendant”) is a California corporation which has its

principal place of business at 1 Infinite Loop, Cupertino, CA 95014.

2

III.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE
8.

Subject matter jurisdiction is based on 28 U.S.C. § 1338, in that this action arises

under federal statute, the patent laws of the United States (35 U.S.C. §§ 1, et seq.).
9.

The Court has personal jurisdiction over Apple pursuant to Wis. Stat. § 801.05(1)

because Apple is engaged in substantial and not isolated activities in this state and judicial
district, including maintaining a retail store and employees here. Personal jurisdiction over
Apple is also proper under Wis. Stat. § 801.05(3) because Apple has sold products that infringe
WARF’s patent rights in this state and judicial district. Personal jurisdiction over Apple is also
proper under Wis. Stat. § 801.05(4) because WARF has suffered injury within this state and
judicial district while Apple has carried on solicitation and service activities here and while
products manufactured by Apple were used here. This Court’s exercise of personal jurisdiction
over Apple comports with the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution.
10.

Venue lies in this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1391(b) and (c) and § 1400(a)

and (b). Because Apple is subject to personal jurisdiction in this district, it is thus deemed to
reside in this district under § 1391(c)(2), and thus venue is proper under § 1391(b)(1). Further,
under § 1391(b)(2), a substantial part of the events giving rise to this claim occurred in this
district, including but not limited to the development of the invention claimed in the patent that is
the subject of this action and the prosecution of that patent, and because WARF resides in this
district. Venue is also proper in this district under § 1400(a) and (b) because Apple is deemed to
reside in this district, and also under § 1400(b) because Apple has committed acts of
infringement in this district and maintains a regular and established place of business in this
district.
IV.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS
11.

On July 14, 1998, the United States Patent and Trademark Office duly and legally

issued United States Patent No. 5,781,752 (hereinafter “the ‘752 patent”) entitled "Table Based
Data Speculation Circuit for Parallel Processing Computer" to Andreas Moshovos, Scott Breach,

3

Terani Vijaykumar, and Gurindar Sohi. A true and correct copy of the ’752 patent is attached
hereto as Exhibit A.
12.

WARF is the owner of all rights, title, and interest in the ’752 patent by

assignment and thereby is authorized and has standing to bring legal action to enforce all rights
arising under the ’752 patent.
13.

In general, the ’752 patent discloses a "predictor circuit [that] permits advanced

execution of instructions depending for their data on previous instructions by predicting such
dependencies based on previous mis-speculations . . . ."
14.

The invention disclosed and claimed in the ’752 patent was the result of the labor

and ingenuity of the four named inventors of the ’752 patent, Drs. Moshovos, Breach,
Vijaykumar and Sohi, at the University of Wisconsin.
15.

The invention disclosed and claimed in the ’752 patent has been recognized by

those in the art as a major milestone in the field of computer microprocessing.
16.

Since the issuance of the ’752 patent, Apple has filed one or more patent

applications that cite the ’752 patent as relevant prior art.
17.

Apple has stated that it is the policy of the company not to accept or consider

proposals regarding licensing from outside entities like WARF for any purpose, making the
initiation of this lawsuit a necessity.
V.

COUNT ONE: INFRINGEMENT OF U.S. PATENT NO. 5,781,752
18.

WARF incorporates by reference the foregoing paragraphs of this Complaint.

19.

WARF is informed and believes, and on this basis alleges, that Defendant has

been, and currently is, making, using, selling, offering to sell, importing and/or exporting
processors that infringe claims of the ’752 patent, including the Apple A7 processor.
20.

WARF is informed and believes, and on this basis alleges, that the A7 processor is

designed by Apple, manufactured by Apple or its agents, and is sold exclusively in Apple
devices.

4

21.

WARF is informed and believes, and on this basis alleges, that Defendant, or an

agent of Defendant acting under Defendant's direction and control, has been, and currently is,
infringing the ’752 patent in violation of 35 U.S.C. § 271 and all causes of action thereunder, by
making, using, selling, offering to sell in this judicial district and elsewhere throughout the
United States, and importing into, and exporting from, the United States, without license or
authority from WARF, infringing products, including at least the A7 processor, and the iPhone
5S, the iPad Air, and the iPad Mini with Retina Display, which themselves include the A7
processor, as well as any other device that includes the A7 processor (collectively, the “Accused
Products”), to the damage and injury of WARF.
22.

WARF is informed and believes, and on this basis alleges, that Defendant has

been, and currently is, inducing infringement of the ’752 patent, in violation of 35 U.S.C.
§ 271(b), by knowingly encouraging or aiding third parties to make, use, sell, or offer to sell
infringing products in the United States, or to import infringing products into the United States,
without license or authority from WARF, including at least the Accused Products. Defendant has
been aware of the ’752 patent, as evidenced by, inter alia, Defendant's citation of the ’752 patent
in its own patent filings. WARF is informed and believes, and on this basis alleges, that despite
Defendant's awareness of the ’752 patent, and despite its awareness that the ’752 patent is
relevant to the technology disclosed in Defendant's own patent filings, Defendant has
intentionally aided and encouraged third parties (including its customers) to use Accused
Products in the United States and has intentionally aided and encouraged third parties (including
its vendors and contractors) to make Accused Products in the United States, having known that
the acts it was causing would be infringing.
23.

WARF is informed and believes, and on this basis alleges, that Defendant has

been, and currently is, contributorily infringing the ’752 patent, in violation of 35 U.S.C.
§ 271(c), by selling or offering for sale to third parties, in this judicial district and throughout the
United States, components that embody a material part of the inventions described in the ’752
patent, are known by Defendant to be especially made or especially adapted for use in

5

infringement of the ’752 patent, and are not staple articles of commodities suitable for
substantial, non-infringing use, including at least the Accused Products. Defendant has done so
without license or authority from WARF.
24.

WARF is informed and believes, and on this basis alleges, that these third parties

have infringed and will infringe the ’752 patent by using the infringing products in violation of
35 U.S.C. § 271(a).
25.

WARF is informed and believes, and on this basis alleges, that the acts of

infringement by Defendant have been, and continue to be, willful, intentional, and in conscious
disregard of WARF's rights in the ’752 patent.
26.

Unless enjoined by this Court, Defendant will continue to infringe the ’752 patent.

27.

As a direct and proximate result of Defendant's infringement of the ’752 patent,

WARF has suffered and will continue to suffer irreparable injury for which there is no adequate
remedy at law. WARF has also been damaged and, until an injunction issues, will continue to be
damaged in an amount yet to be determined.
VI.

A.

H.

Judge Orders Apple To Pay $506 Million In Patent Infringement Case
July 27, 2017 10:47 AM


Filed Under: Apple, Apple Inc., Patent Infringement, Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation















MADISON, Wis. (AP) — A judge has ordered Apple Inc. to pay more than $506 million in a patent infringement case brought by the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation after the two sides agreed on final damages.
A jury in 2015 found Apple infringed on a patent held by the foundation, which supports research at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The patent involves chip technology developed at the university. The technology was used in processors installed by Apple in a number of products.
The Wisconsin State Journal reports that last month, U.S. District Judge William Conley upheld a $234 million damage award made by the jury. He ordered the foundation and Apple to work on a final figure based on the number of units sold that contained the technology.
Cupertino-based Apple has appealed the jury’s findings.

New Inventions


Efficient In Vitro Assay for Antigen-Specific Tolerance


Building on their work, UW–Madison researchers have now developed a T cell-bound cytokine (T-CBC) assay for detecting and quantifying regulatory T cells specific to self-antigens or donor alloantigens. The new method comprises (a) culturing the subject’s T cells for 24 hours in the presence of one or more target antigens and (b) analyzing the cultured T cells for expression of a marker (EBi3; TGFβ/LAP) indicative of antigen-specific immune suppression. 
P160186US02                                                                     




Rhinovirus-C Peptide for Development of Vaccines and Antivirals


UW–Madison researchers have identified novel immunogenic peptides from RV-C that are useful targets for therapeutic antibodies.

Recent advances in microscopy enabled the researchers to determine (with atomic resolution) the structure of an RV-C strain, both in its full, infectious form and as native empty particles. The structures highlighted immunogenic surfaces that could be used to design antivirals or vaccines against RV-C. 
P160341US02                                                                     




New and More Potent UGM Inhibitors for Treating Tuberculosis, Other Microbial Infections


UW–Madison researchers have developed a new set of UGM inhibitors to fight tuberculosis and other diseases caused by microbial infections. The compounds feature an N-acylsulfonamide motif and are more potent in vitro than inhibitors previously identified by the researchers. 
P160093US02                                                                     




Compound Combination Targets Bacterial Virulence


The researchers have discovered that two lead compounds (E22/M64) can be combined to target multiple QS pathways at the same time (Rhl/Pqs), resulting in enhanced activity against P. aeruginosa and potentially other pathogens. This new cocktail approach is superior because it attenuates virulence factor production across a range of relevant environments where single compounds fail. 
P160176US02                                                                     




Inhibiting Metadherin/SND1 Interaction to Treat Cancer


UW–Madison researchers and collaborators have developed a method to fight tumor growth and metastasis using novel peptides that inhibit interaction between MTDH and a protein called SND1. 

The researchers found that MTDH-SND1 protein interaction is important for the expansion and function of prostate tumors as well as luminal and basal breast tumor initiating cells. Their work provides novel peptides that target this protein complex to help control tumor initiation, recurrence and metastasis by combating tumor initiating cells, with minimal impact on normal tissues. 
P140424US02

New Patents


Cooling Bed for Livestock


UW–Madison researchers have developed a new cooling mat for livestock that circulates chilled water through elastic conduction channels. Unlike existing systems that require an interfering layer of bedding, the new design provides greater heat exchange because the chilled surface is placed directly beneath a reclining animal. A layer of cushioning beneath the water channels provides support and comfort. 
P130304US02                                                                     




Microbes Produce High Yields of Fatty Alcohols from Glucose


UW–Madison researchers have developed a method to produce fatty alcohols such as 1-dodecanol and 1-tetradecanol from glucose using genetically engineered microorganisms. The organism, e.g., a modified E. coli strain, overexpresses several genes (including FadD and a recombinant thioesterase gene, acyl-CoA synthetase gene and acyl-CoA reductase gene). Other gene products are functionally deleted to maximize performance.   

The strain is cultured in a bioreactor in the presence of glucose. 
P140076US02                                                                     




More Potent UGM Inhibitors for Treating Tuberculosis and Other Microbial Infections


UW–Madison researchers and collaborators have identified a potent set of UGM inhibitors that may help fight tuberculosis and other diseases caused by microbial infections. The compounds contain a bicyclic triazolo thiadiazine core with diversified aromatic substituents. They were identified by virtually screening a database of nearly five million commercially available compounds. 

The molecules inhibit the growth of microorganisms that depend on UGM to incorporate Galf residues. They also diminish the virulence of pathogenic microorganisms, such as M. tuberculosis, M. smegmatis and Klebsiella pneumonia, that rely on UGM. 
P140379US02
