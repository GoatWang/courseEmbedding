 ASPEN TECHNOLOGY,INC. (NASDAQ:AZPN) Files An 8-K Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain OfficersItem 5.02.

Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.

On July 13, 2017, the board of directors and the compensation committee of the board approved an Executive Bonus Plan for fiscal 2018 for our President and Chief Executive Officer and for certain other executives designated by us, including our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and our Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary, who are named executive officers. 
The purpose of the fiscal 2018 plan is to motivate and reward performance for achieving our financial and operational objectives for fiscal 2018. Payments under the plan are based upon the achievement of predetermined annual corporate financial metrics consisting of target amounts for growth in annual spend, non-GAAP corporate operating income and free cash flow. Each of the target amounts is established by the board and is weighted at 50%, 25% and 25%, respectively, for purposes of determining each participant’s bonus. In order for any bonus to be payable with respect to a target amount, we must achieve at least 70% of the target amount.
Performance against the corporate financial metrics will be evaluated mid-year and at year-end. Each participant has the potential for a mid-year payment, in an amount not to exceed 25% of the annual bonus target, based on performance against mid-year target amounts. The year-end payment is based on annual performance against the annual performance targets, less any payment received at mid-year. 
Under the plan, the compensation committee may make a discretionary award to a participant in such amount as the compensation committee determines to be appropriate and in the best interests of our company.
A copy of the form of the Executive Bonus Plan for fiscal 2018 is included as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.

History[edit]
Founded in 1981, AspenTech was born out a joint research project between the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and US Department of Energy—an Advanced System for Process Engineering (ASPEN) Project.[1][2]
On July 15, 2004, AspenTech was required by the Federal Trade Commission to make divestitures in regard to an anti-trust ruling against its acquisition of HyproTech. This included divestment of batch and continuous simulation systems and integrated engineering software business (AXSYS).[3] In the same year, a class action lawsuit was filed against Aspen Technology and its certain officers over issuance of misleading statements and improper revenue recognition. [4]
On November 24, 2004, the company restated results for the fiscal years ended June 2000 through June 2004 after its audit committee discovered the company improperly accounted for certain software licenses.[5] On March 15, 2005, the company announced that the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors had completed its previously announced financial review and the company had restated its financials for each of the fiscal years ended June 30, 2000 through June 30, 2004.[6]
Aspen Technology was delisted from the NASDAQ on February 19, 2008 for failing to meet financial transparency guidelines of the NASDAQ exchange.[7] In February, 2010 the company was relisted on the NASDAQ exchange.[8]
Corporate Turnaround[edit]
Under former CEO Mark Fusco, AspenTech executed a corporate turnaround strategy. Examples of steps taken during this period included:[9]

Consolidating facilities with regional head offices in The America's, EMEA and Asia Pacific.
Reducing the R&D facilities from 19 to 3 globally - Process Modeling based in Burlington, Massachusetts; Manufacturing and Supply Chain Center of Excellence in Houston, Texas; Quality Assurance Center in Shanghai, China
Reorganizing the professional services business unit - new organization structure and management, and streamlining operations.

On April 30, 2013, AspenTech announced that Mark Fusco would retire as President & CEO effective September 30, 2013. On October 1, 2013, Antonio Pietri became AspenTech President & CEO. [10]

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
