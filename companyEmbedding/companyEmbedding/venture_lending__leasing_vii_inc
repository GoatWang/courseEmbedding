ORGANIZATION
AND OPERATIONS OF THE FUND




Venture Lending
& Leasing VII, Inc. (the “Fund”), was incorporated
in Maryland on June 21, 2012 as a non-diversified closed-end
management investment company electing status as a business
development company (“BDC”) under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended ("1940 Act") and is managed by
Westech Investment Advisors, LLC, (“Manager” or
“Management”).  The Fund will be dissolved on
December 31, 2022 unless an election is made to dissolve earlier by
the Board of Directors of the Fund (the "Board"). One hundred
percent of the stock of the Fund is held by Venture Lending &
Leasing VII, LLC (the “Company”).  Prior to
commencing its operations on December 18, 2012, the Fund had no
operations other than the sale to the Company of 100,000 shares of
common stock, $0.001 par value for $25,000 in July 2012.  This
issuance of stock was a requirement in order to apply for a finance
lender's license from the California Commissioner of Corporations,
which was obtained on September 20, 2012.

 

The Fund's
investment objective is to achieve a superior risk-adjusted
investment return. In the Manager's opinion, the accompanying
interim condensed financial statements (hereafter referred to as
"financial statements") include all adjustments (consisting only of
normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of
financial position and results of operations for interim periods.
Certain information and note disclosures normally included in
audited annual financial statements prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America ("GAAP") have been omitted; however, the Fund believes that
the disclosures made are adequate to make the information presented
not misleading. The interim results for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of what the
results would be for a full year. These financial statements should
be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes
included in the Fund's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2015 .

SUMMARY OF
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES




Basis of
Accounting

 

The preparation
of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires Management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period.  Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

 

Cash and
Cash Equivalents

 

Cash and cash
equivalents consist of cash on hand and money market mutual funds
with maturities of 90 days or less. Money market mutual funds held
as cash equivalents are valued at their most recently traded net
asset value.

 

Interest
Income

 

Interest income
on loans is recognized using the effective interest method
including amounts from the amortization of discounts attributable
to equity securities received as part of the loan transaction.
 Additionally, fees received as part of the transaction are
added to the loan discount and amortized over the life of the
loan.

 

Investment
Valuation Procedures

 

The Fund
accounts for loans at fair value in accordance with the
“Valuation Methods” below.  All valuations are
determined under the direction of the Manager, in accordance with
the Valuation Methods.

 

7


  


 

 

The Fund's
loans are valued in connection with the issuance of its periodic
financial statements, the issuance or repurchase of the Fund's
shares at a price equivalent to the current net asset value per
share, and at such other times as required by law.  On a
quarterly basis, Management submits to the Board a "Valuation
Report" and "Valuation Notes", which details the rationale for the
valuation of investments.

As of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 , the financial
statements include nonmarketable investments of $310.1 million and
$380.4 million , respectively (or 94% and 96% of total assets,
respectively), with fair values determined by the Manager in the
absence of readily determinable market values. Because of the
inherent uncertainty of these valuations, estimated fair values of
such investments may differ significantly from the values that
would have been used had a ready market for the securities existed,
and the differences could be material. Below is the information
used by the Manager in making these estimates.

 

Loans

 

The Fund
defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an
asset or paid to lower a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date. There is no
secondary market for the loans made by the Fund to borrowers, hence
Management determines fair value based on hypothetical markets.
Venture loans are generally held to maturity and are recorded at
estimated fair value. The determination of fair value is based on a
number of factors including the amount for which an investment
could be exchanged in a current sale, which assumes an orderly
disposition over a reasonable period other than in a forced sale.
Management also considers the fact that no ready market exists for
substantially all of the investments held by the Fund. Management
determines whether to adjust the estimated fair value of a loan
based on a number of factors including but not limited to the
borrower's payment history, available cash and “burn
rate,” revenues, net income or loss, the likelihood that the
borrower will be able to secure additional financing in the future,
as well as an evaluation of the general interest rate environment.
The amount of any valuation adjustment considers liquidation
analysis and is determined based upon a credit analysis of the
borrower and an analysis of the expected recovery from the
borrower, including consideration of factors such as the nature and
quality of the Fund's security interests in collateral, the
estimated value of the Fund's collateral, the size of the loan, and
the estimated time that will elapse before the Fund achieves a
recovery. Management has evaluated these factors and has concluded
that the effect of deterioration in the quality of the underlying
collateral, increase in the estimated time to recovery and increase
in the hypothetical market coupon rate would have the effect of
lowering the value of the current portfolio of loans.

 

Non-accrual
Loans

 

The Fund's
policy is to place a loan on non-accrual status when the portfolio
company is delinquent for three months on its monthly loan payment,
or ceases or drastically curtails its operation and Management
deems that it is unlikely that the loan will return to performing
status.  When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, all
interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed for the
quarter in which the loan was placed on non-accrual status.
 Any uncollected interest related to quarters prior to when
the loan was placed on non-accrual status is added to the principal
balance, and the aggregate balance of the principal and interest is
evaluated in accordance with the policy for valuation of loans in
determining Management's best estimate of fair value. Interest
received by the Fund on non-accrual loans will be recognized as
interest income if and when the proceeds exceed the book value of
the loans.

If a borrower
of a non-accrual loan resumes making regular payments and is deemed
by Management to have the ability to service the loan on a
sustainable basis, the loan is reclassified back to accrual or
performing status.  Interest that would have been accrued
during the non-accrual status will be added back to the remaining
payment schedule, and thus changing the effective interest
rate.

As of
September 30, 2016 , loans with a cost basis of  $31.5
million and a fair value of  $7.9 million have been classified
as non-accrual. As of December 31, 2015 loans with a cost
basis of  $10.9 million and a fair value of  $4.6 million
have been classified as non-accrual.

Warrants,
Stock and Convertible Notes

 

Warrants, stock
and convertible notes that are received in connection with loan
transactions generally will be assigned a fair value at the time of
acquisition. These securities are then distributed by the Fund to
its shareholder at the assigned value. Warrants are valued based on
a modified Black-Scholes option pricing model which takes into
account factors underlying stock value, expected term, volatility,
and the risk-free interest rate, among other factors.
 

Underlying
asset value is estimated based on information available, including
information regarding recent rounds of funding of the portfolio
company, or the publicly-quoted stock price at the end of the
financial reporting period for warrants for comparable
publicly-quoted securities.

Volatility, or
the amount of uncertainty or risk about the size of the changes in
the warrant price, is based on an index of publicly traded
companies grouped by industry and which are similar in nature to
the underlying portfolio companies issuing the warrant
(“Industry Index”). The volatility assumption for each
Industry Index is based on the average volatility
for individual public companies within the portfolio company's
industry for a period of time approximating the expected life of
the warrants. A hypothetical increase in the volatility of the
warrants used in the modified Black-Scholes option pricing model
would have the effect of increasing the value of the
warrants.

The remaining
expected lives of warrants are based on historical experience of
the average life of the warrants, as warrants are often exercised
in the event of acquisitions, mergers, or initial public offerings
and terminated due to events such as bankruptcies, restructuring
activities, or additional financings. These events cause the
expected term to be less than the remaining contractual term of the
warrants. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
September 30, 2015 , the Fund assumed the average duration of a
warrant is 3.5 years. The effect of a hypothetical increase in the
estimated initial term of the warrants used in the modified
Black-Scholes option pricing model would have the effect of
increasing the value of the warrants.

The risk-free
interest rate is derived from the constant maturity tables issued
by the U.S. Treasury Department. The effect of a hypothetical
increase in the estimated risk-free rate used in the modified
Black-Scholes option pricing model would have the effect of
increasing the value of the warrants.

The Fund
engages an independent valuation company to provide valuation
assistance including the evaluations of the Fund's valuation
methodology and the reasonableness of the assumptions used from the
perspective of a market participant. They calculate several of the
inputs used such as volatility and risk-free rate. Upon the receipt
of such data from the valuation company, a sample test is performed
to ensure the accuracy of their calculations and that the source of
data is reliable and consistent with the way in which the
calculations were made in prior periods. Such inputs are entered
into the database with a second review to ensure the accuracy of
the input information. All calculations of warrant values are
performed by one employee and reviewed by a second employee. The
inputs of the modified Black-Scholes option pricing model are
reevaluated every quarter.

 

Other Assets
and Liabilities

Other Assets
include costs incurred in conjunction with borrowings under the
Fund's debt facility and are stated at initial cost. The costs are
amortized over the term of the facility.

As of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 , the fair
values of Other Assets and Liabilities are estimated at their
carrying values because of the short-term nature of these assets or
liabilities.

As of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 , based on
borrowing rates available to the Fund, the estimated fair values of
the borrowings under the debt facility were $154.0 million and
$182.0 million , respectively.

 

Commitment
Fees

 

Unearned income
and commitment fees on loans are recognized as additional interest
on loans using the effective interest method over the term of the
loan. Commitment fees are carried as liabilities when received for
commitments upon which

 

9


  


 

 

no draws have
been made. When the first draw is made, the fee is treated as
unearned income and is recognized as described above.  If a
draw is never made, the forfeited commitment fee less any
applicable legal costs becomes recognized as other income after the
commitment expires.

 

Deferred
Bank Fees

 

Through
September 30, 2016 , the deferred bank fees and costs associated
with the debt facility have been capitalized and will be amortized
over the estimated life of the facility, which currently is through
November 7, 2017. The deferred bank fees are included in Other
Assets in the Condensed Statements of Assets and Liabilities. The
amortization of these costs is recorded as interest expense in the
Condensed Statements of Operations (see Note 7).

 

Interest
Rate Cap Agreements

 

The Fund has
entered into interest rate cap agreements which are primarily
valued on the basis of the future expected interest rates on the
notional principal balance remaining, which is comparable to what a
prospective acquirer would pay on the measurement date. Valuation
pricing models consider inputs such as forward rates, anticipated
interest rate volatility relating to the reference rate, as well as
time value and other factors underlying cap instruments. The
contracts are recorded at fair value in interest rate caps in the
Condensed Statements of Assets and Liabilities. The changes in fair
value are recorded in the Net change in unrealized gain (loss) from
hedging activities in the Condensed Statements of Operations. 
The quarterly interest received on the interest rate cap contracts,
if any, will be recorded in Net change in realized gain (loss) from
hedging activities in the Condensed Statements of Operations. Since
inception through September 30, 2016 , there has been no interest
received on interest rate cap contracts.

 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements

 

In April 2015,
the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
issued Accounting Standard Update ("ASU") 2015-03
Interest-Imputation of Interest, Simplifying the Presentation of
Debt Issuance Costs , which changes the presentation of debt
issuance costs in financial statements. Under the ASU, an entity
presents such costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from
the related debt liability rather than as an asset. Amortization of
the costs is reported as interest expense. Debt issuance costs
related to lines of credit and revolving debt facilities are not
required to be deducted from the carrying amount of that debt
liability. The amended guidance is effective for the Fund’s
interim and annual periods beginning on January 1, 2016. The
adoption of this guidance did not significantly impact the
Fund’s financial position or results of
operations.

 

Tax
Status

 

The Fund has
elected to be treated as a Regulated Investment Company ("RIC")
under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code") and
operates in a manner so as to qualify for the tax treatment
applicable to RICs. Failing to maintain at least 70% of total
assets in “qualifying assets” will result in the loss
of BDC status, resulting in losing its favorable tax treatment as a
RIC. As of September 30, 2016 , the Fund has met the BDC and RIC
requirements.

 

In order to
qualify for favorable tax treatment as a RIC, the Fund is required
to distribute annually to its sole shareholder at least 90% of its
investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code. To avoid
federal excise taxes, the Fund must distribute annually at least
98% of its ordinary income and 98.2% of net capital gains from the
current year and any undistributed ordinary income and net capital
gains from the preceding years. The Fund, at its discretion, may
carry forward taxable income in excess of calendar year
distributions and pay a 4% excise tax on this income. If the Fund
chooses to do so, all other things being equal, this would increase
expenses and reduce the amount available to be distributed to the
sole shareholder. The Fund will accrue excise tax on estimated
undistributed taxable income as required. Below is a table
summarizing the cost (on GAAP and tax basis) and the appreciation
and depreciation of the investments reported on the Schedule of
Investments in Note 3 below.

Dividends from
net investment income and distributions from net realized capital
gains are determined in accordance with U.S. federal income tax
regulations, which may differ from those amounts determined in
accordance with GAAP. These book/tax differences are either
temporary or permanent in nature. To the extent these differences
are permanent, they are charged or credited to paid-in-capital or
accumulated net realized gain (loss), as appropriate, in the period
that the differences arise. Temporary and permanent differences are
primarily attributable to differences in the tax treatment of
certain loans and the tax characterization of income and
non-deductible expenses. These differences are generally determined
in conjunction with the preparation of the Fund's annual RIC tax
return.

 

Through
September 30, 2016 , the Fund had no undistributed earnings.
Additionally, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 ,
distributions were made in excess of distributable earnings by
$29.0 million . The Fund may pay distributions in excess of its
taxable net investment income. This excess would be a tax-free
return of capital in the period and reduce the shareholder's tax
basis in its shares. As of September 30, 2016 , the Fund had no
uncertain tax positions. As of September 30, 2016 , the Fund had no
capital loss carry forwards.

 

The Fund's tax
years are open to examination by federal tax authorities for the
years 2013 and forward and California tax authorities for the years
2012 and forward.

 

Book and tax
basis differences relating to shareholder dividends and
distributions and other permanent book and tax differences are
reclassified among the Fund's capital accounts. In addition, the
character of income and gains to be distributed is determined in
accordance with income tax regulations that may differ from GAAP.

** Indicates
assets that the Fund deems “non-qualifying assets”
under Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act. Qualifying assets must
represent at least 70% of the Fund’s total assets at the time
of acquisition of any additional non-qualifying assets. As of
September 30, 2016 , 6.8% of the Fund’s assets represented
non-qualifying assets. As part of this calculation, the denominator
consists of all eligible portfolio companies as defined in Section
2(a)(46); the numerator consists of total assets less the assets
described in Section 55(a)(7).

*** Indicates
assets that are not senior loans.

Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business

Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.

BBB Rating System Overview














Customer Review Rating:









                        The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business.
                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        BuyerZone.com, LLC has received 3.68 out of 5 stars based on 6 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.
