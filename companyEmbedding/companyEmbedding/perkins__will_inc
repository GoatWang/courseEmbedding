Commitment to Your Growth
We believe continuous learning contributes to the success of our employees and achievement of our organizational goals, while maintaining the culture that has given us our competitive edge for over three quarters of a century. We offer in-house and on-line courses, including Lynda.com and Rosetta Stone.
Our Leadership Institute recognizes the importance of investing in our future leaders. This program assists the next generation in developing the skills necessary for leadership.  
Our Innovation Incubator program then fosters an invigorating culture of innovation by supporting small, focused research projects proposed by staff members through micro-grants of money and time. These micro-grants provide incentive for proactive idea exploration, technical development and design collaboration. Results of this research further our design work as well as contribute to the knowledge base of our industry.
Visit the website for our most recent Design Leadership Council competition.
Value Your Health + Wellness
At Perkins+Will, we place a high value on Employee Wellness, offering wellness fairs and free flu shots. Employees receive an annual wellness reimbursement towards a fitness program for themselves and their dependents! Discover more about our most recent Wellness Week on the Perkins+Will blog, Ideas + Buildings. We care about the environment and provide a transportation subsidy to encourage and promote public transportation.
Impact Your Community
We are committed to the 1% Solution and value social responsibility. We proudly volunteer our time across the country. During the aftermath of Katrina, we put our minds and bodies to work towards rebuilding New Orleans. You will often find an office volunteering to enrich their local community. Read more about our commitment to social purpose with our Social Responsibility Initiative Annual Report.  
Diversity + Inclusion
We embrace diversity, valuing and leveraging our differences, will make us stronger and better.  Changing demographics, globalization, and diversity will continue to have a huge influence on our clients and in our workplaces. By moving beyond barriers and stereotypes of culture, color, race, religion, age, sexuality, physical abilities, generational differences, economic settings, etc. we can form teams of talented professionals who will unleash their collective talents to create excellent work.

K-12 Education
Innovative schools that respond to the future of learning










 






More than 75 years ago, Perkins+Will gained national recognition for educational design with our first project, Crow Island Elementary School. The factors that influenced the design of Crow Island - innovation, collaboration, and sustainability—provided the foundation for our philosophy that people’s lives can be improved through the design of the built environment. Our capabilities include long-term planning, additions, renovations, programming, design, branding and graphics, feasibility studies, facility assessments, referendum support, and pre-and post-occupancy studies.
