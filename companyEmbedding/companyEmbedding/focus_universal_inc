	FOCUS UNIVERSAL INC. AND SUBSIDIARY








	NOTES TO THE CONDENSED UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED
	FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	 




	Note 1 – Organization and
	Operations



	 


	Focus Universal Inc. (the “Company”)
	was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on December 4, 2012 (“Inception”). We are a

	universal
	smart instrument developer and manufacturer, headquartered in Los Angeles, California, specializing in the development and commercialization
	of the novel and proprietary universal smart technologies and instruments. The universal smart technology is a commercial off
	the shelf technology and innovation for its soft hardware integrated platform, which provides a unique and universal solution
	for embedded design, industrial control, test and measurement. It utilizes a smartphone, computer or a mobile device as a platform
	and display, communicates and works with a group of sensors or probes manufactured by different vendors in a manner that requires
	the user to have little or no knowledge of their unique characteristics. A typical universal smart instrument consists of a reusable
	foundation component which include a smartphone, a wireless gateway (Ubiquitor), universal smart application software (app), and
	architecture-specific components: the sensor modules, which together perform the functions of traditional instruments and is designated
	to replace the traditional stand-alone instruments at a fraction of their cost.



	 



	Change in Control



	 


	On December 29, 2014, Xu Tang and Desheng
	Wang, two non-affiliate persons, acquired 5,970,000 shares of the Company’s Common Stock from the Company’s shareholders.
	This represents over 90% of the Company’s outstanding common stock and therefore represents a change in control of the Company’s
	ownership.


	 


	Effective immediately on December 29, 2014,
	Ms. Popova resigned as Chief Executive Officer and President of the Company and Ms. Ignatenko resigned as Treasurer, Secretary,
	Chief Financial Officer, principal accounting officer, and principal financial officer of the Company. Upon such resignations,
	Desheng Wang was appointed as the Chief Executive Officer and Secretary of the Company, Xu Tang was appointed as the President
	of the Company, Yan Chen was appointed as the Senior Vice President, and Messrs. Wang, Tang, and Chen accepted such appointments.


	 


	On October 21, 2015, Xu Tang entered into
	a stock purchase agreement whereby he collectively sold 3,260,000 shares of the Company’s Common Stock to eight persons using
	private funds to purchase the shares. This represents 49.5% of the Company’s outstanding common stock and represents a material
	change in control of the Company’s ownership. Buyers include Shuqin Xu (who now owns 19.7% of the Company), Tianzeng Xu and
	Youjuan Xiong (who now each own 7.5% of the Company) and five other unrelated persons. To the Company’s knowledge, there
	are no arrangements or understandings among members of both the former and new control groups and their associates with respect
	to election of directors or other matters.


	 


	Effective October 21, 2015, Xu Tang and
	Yan Chen resigned from their positions as President and Senior Vice President, respectively, of the Company. There are no disagreements
	between the Company and Messrs. Tang and Chen. Dr. Edward Lee has been appointed to serve as President of the Company.


	 


	Also effective October 21, 2015, Dr. Jennifer
	Gu and Dr. Edward Lee were appointed as directors of the Company, and Dr. Gu and Dr. Lee accepted such appointments. Thereupon,
	each of Xu Tang and Yan Chen resigned as directors of the Company. Accordingly, the entire Board of Directors consists of Dr. Desheng
	Wang, Dr. Jennifer Gu, and Dr. Edward Lee.


	 


	On December 31, 2015, we filed Articles
	of Merger with the State of Nevada and filed a Certificate of Merger with the State of California which were the result of an agreement
	entered into on December 30, 2015, with a related party, Perfecular Inc., (“Perfecular”) a California corporation and
	FCUV Acquisition Corp., a Nevada corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, pursuant to which we agreed to acquire
	all of the issued and outstanding of 587,712 shares of Perfecular’s common stock in exchange for the issuance of 27,994,706
	shares of the Company’s common stock to the shareholders of Perfecular Inc. in an exchange ratio of 47.6333 to one. This
	represents approximately 80% of the outstanding shares of the Company and represents a material change in control of the Company’s
	ownership. Mr. Desheng Wang was the majority stockholder of Perfecular.

	Note 1 – Organization and Operations (continued)



	 



	Change in Control (continued)



	 


	The Company and Perfecular were entities
	under common control; therefore, in accordance with ASC 805-50-45, the acquisition of Perfecular was accounted for as a business
	combination between entities under common control and treated similar to a pooling of interest transaction.


	 


	Perfecular Inc. was founded in September
	2009 and is headquartered in City of Industry, California, and is engaged in designing certain digital sensor products and sells
	a broad selection of horticultural sensors and filters in North America and Europe.


	 



	Change in fiscal year



	 


	On December 11, 2015, the Board of Directors
	of the Company approved a change in the fiscal year end from a fiscal year end on March 31 to a calendar year end on December 31
	effective immediately.


	 


	The Company made the fiscal year change
	on a prospective basis and did not adjust operating results for prior periods. The change to the Company’s fiscal year did
	not impact the Company’s calendar year results for the year ended December 31, 2015. While the change has had some impact
	on the prior year comparability of each of the fiscal quarters and annual periods in fiscal years prior to calendar year 2016,
	the Company believes this impact is minimal.


	 


	The Company believes this change provides
	numerous benefits, including aligning its reporting periods to be more consistent with peer companies.


	 



	Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies



	 




	Basis of Presentation




	 


	The accompanying consolidated financial statements
	include the accounts of Focus Universal Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Perfecular Inc. All intercompany balances and transactions
	have been eliminated upon consolidation. The Company’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance
	with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).


	 




	Segment Reporting




	 


	The Company currently has one operating
	segment. In accordance with ASC No. 280, Segment Reporting (“ASC 280’), the Company considers operating segments to
	be components of the Company’s business for which separate financial information is available that evaluated regularly by
	the Management in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The Management reviews financial information
	presented on a consolidated basis for purposes of allocation resources and evaluating financial performance. Accordingly, the Company
	has determined that it has a single operating and reportable segment.



	 





	Unaudited Interim Financial Information




	 


	The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated
	financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
	States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial information, and with the rules and regulations of the United
	States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do
	not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements.


	 


	The unaudited interim consolidated financial
	statements furnished reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals), which are, in the opinion of management,
	necessary to a fair statement of the results for the interim periods presented. Unaudited interim results are not necessarily indicative
	of the results for the full fiscal year. These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction
	with the consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2016 and notes thereto contained in the
	information as part of the Company’s Transition Report on the Form 10-KT, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange
	Commission.


	 




	Cash and Cash Equivalents




	 


	The Company considers all highly liquid
	investments with a maturity of three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents. At times, such investments may be in excess
	of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insurance limit.


	 




	Concentrations of Credit Risk




	 


	Financial instruments that potentially
	subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents. The Company limits its exposure
	to credit loss by investing its cash with high credit quality financial institutions.

	Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)



	 




	Fair Value of Financial Instruments




	 


	The Company follows paragraph 825-10-50-10
	of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments and paragraph 820-
	10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“Paragraph 820-10-35-37”) to measure the fair value of its
	financial instruments. Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accounting principles generally
	accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.


	 


	To increase consistency and comparability
	in fair value measurements and related disclosures, Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes
	the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three (3) broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest
	priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable
	inputs. The three (3) levels of fair value hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described below:


	 




	 



	·





	Level 1: quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.




	 


	 


	 




	 



	·





	Level
	2: pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable
	as of the reporting date.




	 


	 


	 




	 



	·





	Level 3: Pricing inputs that are generally observable inputs and not corroborated by market data.




	 


	Financial assets are considered Level 3
	when their fair values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques and at least
	one significant model assumption or input is unobservable.


	 


	The fair value hierarchy gives the highest
	priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable
	inputs. If the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within more than one level described above, the
	categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument.

	categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument.


	 


	The carrying amount of the Company’s
	financial assets and liabilities, such as cash and cash equivalent, prepaid expenses, accounts payable and accrued expenses, approximate
	their fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments.


	 


	Transactions involving related parties
	cannot be presumed to be carried out on an arm's-length basis, as the requisite conditions of competitive, free-market dealings
	may not exist. Representations about transactions with related parties, if made, shall not imply that the related party transactions
	were consummated on terms equivalent to those that prevail in arm's-length transactions unless such representations can be substantiated.


	 


	It is not however practical to determine
	the fair value of advances from stockholders, if any, due to their related party nature.


	 




	Inventories




	 


	Inventories consist primarily of electronic
	components, and are valued at the lower of cost or market.


	 




	Property and Equipment




	 


	Property and equipment are stated at cost.
	Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method. Estimated useful lives range from three to seven years on all categories
	of depreciable assets. The cost and accumulated depreciation of assets sold or retired are removed from the respective accounts
	and any gain or loss is included in earnings. Maintenance and repairs are expensed currently. Major renewals and betterments are
	capitalized.


	 


	Long-term assets of the Company are reviewed
	when circumstances warrant as to whether their carrying value has become impaired. The Company considers assets to be impaired
	if the carrying value exceeds the future projected cash flows from related operations. The Company also re-evaluates the periods
	of amortization to determine whether subsequent events and circumstances warrant revised estimates of useful lives.

	Revenue Recognition




	 


	The Company applies paragraph 605-10-S99-1
	of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for revenue recognition. The Company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable
	and earned. The Company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive
	evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) the product has been shipped or the services have been rendered to the customer, (iii)
	the sales price is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured.


	 


	The Company derives its revenues from sales
	contracts with its customer with revenues being generated upon rendering of services. Persuasive evidence of an arrangement is
	demonstrated via invoice; service is considered provided when the service is delivered to the customers; and the sales price to
	the customer is fixed upon acceptance of the purchase order and there is no separate sales rebate, discount, or volume incentive.


	 


	Perfecular reports net revenue for its
	sales to third parties in accordance to the Financial Accounting Standard Board Accounting Standards Codification 605-45, because
	its primary business functions are designing sensor products, marketing and sales of Tianjin Guanglee’s, (a related party
	product).  While Tianjin Guanglee determines the product specifications and the sales prices, and bears physical loss risks
	during shipping. Perfecular collects full amount of accounts receivable from customers through direct wire transfers or letters
	of credit and remits payments to Tianjin Guanglee for the intercompany invoices with amounts net of the sales commissions. Commission
	revenue is recognized when the sales booked by Perfecular is recognized.


	 



	Allowance for doubtful accounts



	 


	The Company provides an allowance for doubtful
	accounts equal to the estimated uncollectible amounts. The Company's estimate is based on historical collection experience and
	a review of the current status of trade accounts receivable. It is reasonably possible that the Company's estimate of the allowance
	for doubtful accounts will change. There was no allowance for doubtful accounts at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.


	 




	Advertising costs




	 


	Advertising costs are expensed as incurred.
	The Company recorded no advertising costs for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2017 and 2016.


	 




	Research and development




	 


	Research and development costs are expensed
	as incurred. Research and development costs primarily consist of efforts to refine existing product models and develop new product
	models.



	 





	Related Parties




	 


	The Company follows subtopic 850-10 of
	the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions.
	Pursuant to Section 850-10-20 the related parties include: a) affiliates of the Company; b) entities for which investments in their
	equity securities would be required, absent the election of the fair value option under the Fair Value Option Subsection of Section
	825–10–15, to be accounted for by the equity method by the investing entity; c) trusts for the benefit of employees,
	such as pension and profit-sharing trusts that are managed by or under the trusteeship of management; d) principal owners of the
	Company; e) management of the Company; f) other parties with which the Company may deal if one party controls or can significantly
	influence the management or operating policies of the other to an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented
	from fully pursuing its own separate interests; and g) other parties that can significantly influence the management or operating
	policies of the transacting parties or that have an ownership interest in one of the transacting parties and can significantly
	Influence the other to an extent that one or more of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate
	interests.

	Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting
	Policies (continued)



	 




	Related Parties (continued)




	 


	The consolidated financial statements shall
	include disclosures of material related party transactions, other than compensation arrangements, expense allowances, and other
	similar items in the ordinary course of business. However, disclosure of transactions that are eliminated in the preparation of
	consolidated financial statements is not required in those statements. The disclosures shall include: a. the nature of the relationship(s)
	involved; b. a description of the transactions, including transactions to which no amounts or nominal amounts were ascribed, for
	each of the periods for which income statements are presented, and such other information deemed necessary to an understanding
	of the effects of the transactions on the consolidated financial statements; c. the dollar amounts of transactions for each of
	the periods for which income statements are presented and the effects of any change in the method of establishing the terms from
	that used in the preceding period; and d. amounts due from or to related parties as of the date of each balance sheet presented
	and, if not otherwise apparent, the terms and manner of settlement.



	 





	Commitments and Contingencies




	 


	The Company follows subtopic 450-20 of
	the FASB Accounting Standards Codification to report accounting for contingencies. Certain conditions may exist as of the date
	the consolidated financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss to the Company but which will only be resolved when
	one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Company assesses such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently
	involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company
	or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings, the Company evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or
	unasserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein.


	 


	If the assessment of a contingency indicates
	that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated
	liability would be accrued in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potential
	material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of
	the contingent liability, and an estimate of the range of possible losses, if determinable and material, would be disclosed.


	 


	Loss contingencies considered remote are
	generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantees would be disclosed. Management does not believe,
	based upon information available at this time that these matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial
	position, results of operations or cash flows. However, there is no assurance that such matters will not materially and adversely
	affect the Company’s business, financial position, and results of operations or cash flows.


	 




	Stock Based Compensation




	 


	The Company accounts for employee and non-employee
	stock awards under ASC 718, whereby equity instruments issued to employees for services are recorded based on the fair value of
	the instrument issued and those issued to non-employees are recorded based on the fair value of the consideration received or the
	fair value of the equity instrument, whichever is more reliably measurable.


	 


	There were no outstanding stock options
	during the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016.


	 




	Income Tax Provision




	 


	Income taxes are accounted for using the
	asset and liability method. Deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences in recognizing certain income, expense
	and credit items for financial reporting purposes and tax reporting purposes. Such deferred income taxes primarily relate to the
	difference between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
	are measured by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to the future years in which deferred tax assets or liabilities
	are expected to be settled or realized. There were no material deferred tax assets or liabilities as of March 31, 2017 and December
	31, 2016.


	 


	As of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016,
	the Company did not identify any material uncertain tax positions.

	Policies (continued)



	 




	Net Income (Loss) Per Common Share




	 


	Net income (loss) per common share is computed
	pursuant to section 260-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Basic net income (loss) per common share is computed
	by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.


	 


	Diluted net income (loss) per common share
	is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and potentially outstanding
	shares of common stock during the period to reflect the potential dilution that could occur from common shares issuable through
	contingent shares issuance arrangement, stock options or warrants.


	 


	There were no potentially dilutive debt
	or equity instruments issued and outstanding at any time during the three-month periods ended March 31, 2017 and 2016.


	 




	Cash Flows Reporting




	 


	The Company adopted paragraph 230-10-45-24
	of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for cash flows reporting, classifies cash receipts and payments according to whether
	they stem from operating, investing, or financing activities and provides definitions of each category, and uses the indirect or
	reconciliation method (“Indirect method”) as defined by paragraph 230-10-45-25 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification
	to report net cash flow from operating activities by adjusting net income to reconcile it to net cash flow from operating activities
	by removing the effects of (a) all deferrals of past operating cash receipts and payments and all accruals of expected future operating
	cash receipts and payments and (b) all items that are included in net income that do not affect operating cash receipts and payments.
	The Company reports the reporting currency equivalent of foreign currency cash flows, using the current exchange rate at the time
	of the cash flows and the effect of exchange rate changes on cash held in foreign currencies is reported as a separate item in
	the reconciliation of beginning and ending balances of cash and cash equivalents and separately provides information about investing
	and financing activities not resulting in cash receipts or payments in the period pursuant to paragraph 830-230-45-1 of the FASB
	Accounting Standards Codification.


	 




	Subsequent Events




	 


	The Company follows the guidance in Section
	855-10-50 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for the disclosure of subsequent events. The Company will evaluate subsequent
	events through the date when the financial statements were issued. Pursuant to ASU 2010-09 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification,
	the Company as an SEC filer considers its financial statements issued when they are widely distributed to users, such as through
	filing them on EDGAR.

	On April
	24, 2017, Focus entered into a two-year industrial/commercial lease within a larger multi-tenant industrial complex with Walnut
	Park Business Center, LLC. We leased a 2,800-square foot warehouse with a 1,400-square foot office space inside which
	will allow us to assemble our products as well as efficiently run our administrative operations in the same building. The lease
	commenced on May 1, 2017 and will end on April 30, 2019. We will pay $3,500 per month until May 1, 2018 when the rent increased
	to $3,605 per month. The warehouse is located at 820511 East Walnut Drive North, Walnut, California. Rent expense under this lease
	will be recognized over the life of the lease term on a straight-line basis. Straight-line monthly rent expense over the life of
	the lease will be $3,553.



	 


	On March 31, 2015, Focus entered into a
	two-year industrial/commercial multi-tenant lease at 829 Lawson Street in the City of Industry, California with P.G.A. Lawson Limited
	Partnership. This lease will end on May 31, 2017. We leased a 9,745-square foot warehouse with a 2,415-square foot office
	space inside. The lease commenced on April 20, 2015 and ends on April 30, 2017. We paid $7,699 per month until May 1, 2016 when

	Narrative Description of the Business 



	 


	Focus Universal Inc. (“the Company”,
	“we”, “us” or “our”) currently conducts business as a handheld sensor systems and filters wholesaler
	to distribution platforms. We are working on developing a universal sensor node and gateway system that use the data processing
	capabilities of a smartphone to display readings of multiple probe modules. We are also researching the development of an anti-counterfeit
	authentication technology that we believe could address the problem of counterfeit production by attempting to authenticate consumer
	goods.


	 


	Through a merger with Perfecular Inc.,
	we strategically expanded our business to the manufacture and marketing of high-tech electronic devices. We realized that Internet
	marketing would not be sufficient to generate sales of our products, particularly the Ubiquitor product. We are going to focus
	on all types of marketing, particularly marketing directly to established consumer distributions retailers. For this reason, in
	2016 we decided to emphasize our sales of handheld sensors and air filters and discontinue our marketing and advertising business
	segment. Through the development and creation of our Ubiquitor device, we anticipate that sales and marketing involved with bringing
	this product to market will require us to hire a number of new employees in order to gain traction in the market as well as continue
	to expand such sales of our existing sensor and air filter products.


	 



	Our current services include:



	 




	Scientific Instrument Research and
	Development and Sales




	 


	Engineers and scientists use instrumentation
	to observe, understand, and manage real-world data and phenomena, events, and processes related to their industries or areas of
	expertise. Instrumentation systems that we are researching and developing measure and control electrical signals, such as voltage,
	current and power, as well as temperature, pressure, speed, flow, volume, torque, light sensing, and vibration for example. Common
	general-purpose instruments in our market segment include, for example, voltmeters, signal generators, oscilloscopes, data loggers,
	spectrum analyzers, cameras, and temperature and pressure monitors and controllers. Systems that perform measurement and control
	can be generally categorized as test, measurement, and embedded systems.


	 




	A New Approach to Measurement and Sensing




	 


	We offer a different approach than what
	is currently on the market because we are attempting to establish a demand for devices that link handheld devices and sensors with
	common smartphone computing power through an application on the smartphone in both IOS and Android devices. Tapping into the computing
	power of a smartphone enables a measurement device to increase its capabilities.


	 


	We also offer an array of traditional handheld
	measurement and control meters through our wholesale distribution platform.

	Filter and Handheld Meter Wholesaler




	 


	We are a wholesaler of various filtration
	products and digital meters. We source our products from manufacturers in China and then sell to a major U.S. distributor who resells
	our products directly to consumers through retail distribution channels.


	 


	Specifically, we sell the following products:


	 



	Fan Speed Adjuster device

	. We provide
	a fan speed adjuster device to retailers and distributors. Designed specifically for centrifugal fans with brushless motors, our
	adjuster device helps ensure longer life by preventing damage to fan motors by adjusting the speed of centrifugal fans without
	causing the motor to hum. These devices are rated for 350 watts max, have 120VAC voltage capacity and feature an internal, electronic
	auto-resetting circuit breaker.


	  



	Carbon filter devices

	. We also sell
	two types of carbon filter devices to distributors. These Carbon filter devices are professional grade filters specifically designed
	and used to filter air in greenhouses that might be polluted by fermenting organics. One of these filters can be attached to a
	centrifugal fan to scrub the air in a constant circle or can be attached to an exhaust line as a single pass filter, which moves
	air out of the growing area and filters unwanted odors and removes pollens, dust, and other debris in the air. The other filter
	is designed to be used with fans from 0-6000 C.F.M.


	 



	HEPA filtration device

	. We provide
	an organic air high efficiency particulate arrestance (“HEPA”) filtration device at wholesale prices to distributors
	and retailers. Manufactured, tested, certified, and labeled in accordance with current HEPA filter standards, this device is targeted
	towards greenhouses and grow rooms and designed to keep insects, bacteria, and mold out of grow rooms. We sell these devices in
	various sizes.


	 



	Digital light meter

	. We provide
	a handheld digital light meter that is used to measure luminance in fc units, or foot-candles. The meter we sell is designed to
	be full cosine corrected for the angular incidence of light (meaning if you are not holding the sensor perpendicular to the light
	source, the sensor will still read the light correctly). The meter has a built-in low battery indicator and is designed to accurately
	measure to 40,000 FC.


	 



	Quantum par meter

	. We provide a
	handheld quantum par meter used to measure photosynthetically active radiation (“PAR”). This fully portable handheld
	PAR meter is designed to measure PAR flux in wavelengths ranging from 400 to 700 nm. It is designed to measure up to 10,000 umol.


	 




	Ubiquitor Wireless Universal Sensor Device




	 


	We have fully researched and developed
	a device we call the “Ubiquitor,” which is a handheld fully modular system with a universal sensor node and gateway
	system that uses a smartphone as the output display module that displays the readings of various probe modules. We have completed
	an initial production run of 1,000 devices and intend to develop this into full-scale production as soon as possible. The Ubiquitor
	is a wireless sensor device that combines measuring tools with smartphone technology to quickly deliver sensor node data on desktop
	and mobile phone screens. The Ubiquitor’s sensor analytics system will integrate event-monitoring, storage and analytics
	software in a cohesive package that we hope will provide a holistic view of sensor data it is reading.


	 


	After sending our circuit boards to China
	for soldering at an unaffiliated manufacturing facility, we assembled the initial production run at our facilities here in the
	City of Industry. This initial production run will allow us to show large distributors and consumers the capabilities of the Ubiquitor
	which we hope will generate demand.


	 


	The physical hardware consists of:


	 




	 



	1.




	The sensor probes, which come in hundreds of different varieties of sensor instruments in the form of a USB stick, with both male and female ports; and





	 




	 



	2.




	The main hardware gateway, a small cell phone size device with integrated circuits.





	 


	This device is intended to connect up to
	2.5 kilometers of sensor instruments, and integrate data using embedded software to display the data and all analytics onto a digital
	screen (desktop or mobile displays) using multiple types of wireless connections (i.e., Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, 3G and 4G). Most types
	of probes can connect to the hardware. If the sensor size is bigger than the standard probe size, it is possible to simply use
	a USB cable to connect the probe and the hub. All data and analytics are displayed on a single screen, with tools that record and
	keep track of all measurements, and sort and display analytic information in easy to read charts.

	The Ubiquitor is a general platform that collects data in real
	time, up to 100hz per second, and thus is intended to be adapted to many industry uses.


	 


	The Ubiquitor is a multipurpose wireless
	intelligent sensor device that will be intended to achieve universal compatibility. Currently, the Ubiquitor device could simultaneously
	accommodate more than 256 different types of sensor heads. Users could use their smartphones to simultaneously operate and monitor
	over 256 kinds of sensor readings. With Perfecular’s technology, users only need to obtain the sensor heads, facilitating
	ease and convenience of use. Using a smartphone, users can collect and analyze data in real time. We have not yet started research
	and development of a second generation Ubiquitor device, but once we demonstrate the market for this product intend to begin such
	research and development.


	 




	Intellectual Property Protection




	 


	After the merger, on January 20, 2016 we
	filed provisional patent application number 62/281,104 with attorney docket number PER1.PAU.01.0 and Confirmation No. 2212. Prior
	to its expiration, on November 4, 2016, we filed a full utility patent application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (number
	15/344,041). We anticipate that the publication will be required to occur on or around July 20, 2017. We filed the trademark “Ubiquitor”
	on July 10, 2016, under

	Serial No.:  87068020.



	 




	Competitors




	 


	There are several competitors we have identified in the wireless
	sensor node industry, including traditional instruments or devices manufacturers such as Hanna Instruments or Extech Instruments.


	 


	Hach developed and launched SC1000 Multi-parameter Universal
	Controller, a probe module for connecting up to 8 SC sensors and their products are not compatible with smart phones yet and we
	believe their price-point is still prohibitive to consumers.


	 


	Monnit Corporation offers a range of wireless or remote sensors.
	Many of Monnit’s products are web-based wireless sensors usually are not portable because of the power consumption. Also,
	the sensors real-time updates are slow and we believe security of the web-based sensor data acquisition also may be a concern.
	In addition to purchasing the device, consumers usually have to pay monthly fee for using web-based services.


	 


	We are not trying to compete with traditional instruments or
	device manufacturers because we utilize our Ubiquitor universal smart device in conjunction with our generic instruments smartphone
	application, which we believe will be a completely different product category.


	 




	Market Potential




	 


	We believe that wireless universal smart technology will play
	a critical role for traditional instrument manufacturers, as it is too expensive and difficult to develop for medium or smaller
	companies. The cost factor is the first consideration when deciding whether a company wants to develop smart wireless technologies
	and implement them in their products or use them in their field testing. We also hope to play a role in academic laboratories,
	particularly with smaller academic laboratories who are sensitive to price.


	 






	Recent Developments





	 



	Recently, the China Association for Science
	and Technology (“CAST”) and the People’s government of Jilin Province, China formed a joint task force to hold
	an entrepreneurship competition called the “Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition for Overseas Talents.” The
	competition will be conducted from March 2017 through June 2017 and will aim to attract outstanding talent and help establish new
	businesses with advanced technologies in Changchun, the capital of Jilin Province. The first prize winners will receive financial
	support from the Changchun government, PE firms and venture capitals, and will be recommended to participate in the 2017 National
	Innovation and Entrepreneurship Week.


	 


	We submitted an application on April 17, 2017
	and, together with an endorsement from the Overseas Chinese Entrepreneur Alliance (“OCEA”), we were accepted to be
	one of the 30 projects to participate in the Stage Two selection at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on May 13. 2017.


	 


	There are three different stages of the competition.
	Stage One is the Preliminary Contest where companies are sponsored by OCEA and the local Chinese communities. There are 30 projects
	in our specific category that will to participate in the second stage of the competition.


	 


	The second stage is the selection stage. The
	results from this stage will be concluded before May 15th, and 50 total projects from among 90 total projects across all sub-categories
	will be selected to enter the final round of the competition. The final round of the competition is when the selection committee
	will invite the 50 projects/teams to the final contest which will be held in Changchun, and will arrange showcases and meetings
	with the sponsoring financial institutions and government officials.


	 



	Results of operations for the three
	months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016.



	 



	Revenue, cost of sales and gross profit



	 


	Our consolidated gross revenue for the
	three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, was $82,190 and $84,387, respectively. Our cost of consolidated cost of revenues for
	the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, was $20,336 and $5,730, respectively, resulting in a gross profit of $61,854 and
	$78,657 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.


	 


	Prior to the merger with Perfecular, management
	was focused on pursuing growth strategies and opportunities and outsourced the performance of Internet marketing services to third
	parties rather than performing the Internet marketing services directly. This change in strategy cost more money and generated
	less immediate revenue. Post-merger, we have been able to distribute a full range of products held as inventory by a related party,
	Tianjin Guanglee, directly to a range of businesses who have established distribution channels directly with consumers.

	Due to the merger with Perfecular Inc.
	we anticipate that for the next 12 months we will be generating cash from more diversified revenue streams as mentioned herein.

	 

	We
	believe that our cash generated from operations and cash on hand may not provide sufficient capital to fund our operations and
	meet our cash needs on a short term and long-term basis for the next twelve months.  Consequently, we intend to
	finance our internal growth with cash on hand, cash provided from operations, borrowings, debt or equity offerings, or some combination
	thereof to expand our business so that we can meet our cash needs.

	Cash Flows from Operating Activities




	 


	The net cash outflows from operating activities
	of $123,307 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, was primarily the result of our net loss of $108,715 and changes in our
	operating assets and liabilities. The net cash outflows from operating activities of $146,505 for the three months ended March
	31, 2016 was primarily the result of our net loss of $115,804, and changes in our operating assets and liabilities.


	 


	We expect that cash flows from operating
	activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors, including fluctuations in our net revenues and operating
	results, utilization of new revenue streams, collection of accounts receivable, and timing of billings and payments.


	 




	Cash Flows from Investing Activities




	 


	The net cash used in investing activities
	of $0 and $1,029 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively represents funds used to purchase property and
	equipment for the Company.


	 




	Cash Flows from Financing Activities




	 


	We repaid $0 and $82,902 related to advances
	from a related party and a shareholder respectively during the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.


	 


	Management expects to keep operating costs
	to a minimum until cash is available through financing or operating activities. Management plans to continue to seek, in addition
	to equity financing, other sources of financing (e.g. bank loan, line of credit, shareholder loan) on favorable terms; however,
	there are no assurances that any such financing can be obtained on favorable terms, if at all.   If we are unable to
	generate profits sufficient to cover our operating costs or unable to obtain additional funds for our working capital needs, we
	may need to cease or curtail operations.  Furthermore, there is no assurance the net proceeds from any successful financing
	arrangement will be sufficient to cover cash requirements during the initial stages of the Company’s operations.


	 



	Off Balance Sheet Arrangements



	 


	As of March 31, 2017, we did not have any
	off-balance-sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation SK.

	ITEM 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND
	QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.



	 


	We are a smaller reporting company as defined
	by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this item.



	 


	 







	ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES



	 



	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls



	 


	Under the supervision and with the participation
	of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we have conducted an evaluation of
	the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a15(e) and 15d15(e)
	under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, at the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, our principal
	executive officer and principal financial officer concluded as of the evaluation date that our disclosure controls and procedures
	were effective such that the material information required to be included in our Securities and Exchange Commission reports is
	recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms relating to our company,
	particularly during the period when this report was being prepared.


	 


	Our management concluded we did not maintain
	effective controls over the Company’s financial reporting. The material weaknesses in our internal control over financial
	reporting, caused principally by inadequate staffing and technical expertise in key positions, resulted in overly relying on outside
	consultants to make numerous adjustments to our financial statements. Additionally, the significant deficiencies or material weaknesses
	could result in future material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected.
	Management has concluded that the identified control deficiencies constitutes a material weakness.


	 



	Changes in internal control over financial
	reporting.



	 


	There were no changes in our internal control
	over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that materially affected, or were reasonably likely to materially
	affect, our internal control over financial reporting.


	 



	Limitations on the Effectiveness of
	Internal Controls



	 


	Disclosure controls and procedures, no
	matter how well designed and implemented, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving an entity's disclosure objectives.
	The likelihood of achieving such objectives is affected by limitations inherent in disclosure controls and procedures. These include
	the fact that human judgment in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns in internal control can occur because of human
	failures such as simple errors or mistakes or intentional circumvention of the established process.

	FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS



	 


	This Annual Report contains forward-looking
	statements. Forward-looking statements are projections of events, revenues, income, future economic performance or management’s
	plans and objectives for our future operations. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such
	as “may”, “should”, “expects”, “plans”, “anticipates”, “believes”,
	“estimates”, “predicts”, “potential” or “continue” or the negative of these terms
	or other comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other
	factors, including the risks in the section entitled “Risk Factors” and the risks set out below, any of which may cause
	our or our industry’s actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any
	future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. These
	risks include, by way of example and not in limitation:


	 





	·



	 



	the uncertainty of profitability based upon our history of losses;





	 


	 


	 





	·



	 



	risks related to failure to obtain adequate financing on a timely basis and on acceptable terms to continue as going concern;





	 


	 


	 





	·



	 



	risks related to our international operations and currency exchange fluctuations; and





	 


	 


	 





	·



	 



	other risks and uncertainties related to our business plan and business strategy.





	 


	This list is not an exhaustive list of the
	factors that may affect any of our forward-looking statements. These and other factors should be considered carefully and readers
	should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are made based on management’s
	beliefs, estimates and opinions on the date the statements are made and we undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements
	if these beliefs, estimates and opinions or other circumstances should change. Although we believe that the expectations reflected
	in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements.
	Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States, we do not intend to update any of the
	forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results.


	 


	Our financial statements are stated in United
	States dollars (US$) and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. All references
	to “common stock” refer to the common shares in our capital stock.


	 


	As used in this annual report, the terms “we”,
	“us”, “our”, the “Company” and “Focus Universal” mean Focus Universal Inc. unless
	otherwise indicated.

	universal smart technologies and instruments. We define universal smart technology as commercial technology with an integrated
	platform, which provides a unique and universal solution for test and measurement made up of off-the-shelf parts.

	We are
	working on developing a universal sensor node and gateway system that use the data processing capabilities of a smartphone to display
	readings of multiple probe modules. We are also researching the development of an anti-counterfeit authentication technology that
	we believe could address the problem of counterfeit production by attempting to authenticate consumer goods. We call this device
	the “Ubiquitor” because it can be used to wirelessly measure and test a variety of electrical and physical phenomena
	such as voltage, current, temperature, pressure, sound, light, and humidity.


	 



	The Ubiquitor,
	which we have created and have manufactured in limited quantities,

	utilizes a standard desktop computer with Mac OS, Windows
	OS, an Android-based or iOS-based smartphone, or mobile tablet device as a platform that communicates with a group of sensors or
	probes manufactured by different vendors in a manner that requires the user to have little or no knowledge of their unique characteristics.
	The data readout is displayed on the computer, smartphone, or tablet display in a program or application we intend to create. We
	are designing the application software (the “App”) to have a graphical representation of control and indicator elements
	common in real instruments such as knobs, buttons, dials, and graphs, etc. Our developers are designing and implementing a soft
	control touch screen interface which supports real-time data monitoring and facilitates instrument control and operation.


	 


	Until March 31, 2016, we offered a full range
	of web services, including web marketing services, social and viral marketing campaigns, search engine optimization consulting,
	custom web design, website usability consulting and web analytics implementation. We generate our revenue from providing these
	services to small and medium sized businesses. We focused on providing one-off services, such as development of a fully functioning
	website or creation of a marketing strategy plan, to small business clients.


	 


	Through a merger with Perfecular Inc., we have
	strategically expanded our services to the manufacture and marketing of high-tech electronic devices. We sell handheld sensor systems
	and filters wholesaler to distribution platforms and are working on developing a universal sensor node and gateway system that
	use the data processing capabilities of a smartphone to display readings of multiple probe modules. We are also researching the
	development of an anti-counterfeit authentication technology that we believe could address the problem of counterfeit production
	by attempting to authenticate consumer goods.


	 


	On December 29, 2014, Xu Tang and Desheng Wang,
	two non-affiliates, acquired over 90% equity of the Company. That same date, the current officers and directors, Ms. Tatyana Popova

	our directors, officers, and control shareholders. In 2015, we acquired Perfecular.


	 



	Scientific Instrument Research, Development and Sales




	 




	Industry Background and Overview




	 



	Through our acquisition of Perfecular Inc.,
	we entered into the scientific instrument industry, specifically the instrument sensor industry. Instrument sensors are devices
	specifically designed and constructed for sensing and measuring physical variables that are useful in: (i) industrial operations;
	(ii) environmental, commercial and medical applications; (iii) research and development in a variety of industries; and (iv) the
	daily lives of electronics consumers.


	 


	We believe that instrument sensors are important
	in modern science, having applications in both the industrial and educational fields. In recent years, significant progress has
	been made in instruments and instrumentation systems. The performance of measuring and monitoring instruments has improved considerably
	in the computer age. Analog instruments are used to indicate the magnitude of the quantity in the form of pointer movement. Digital
	instruments, on the other hand, specify the quantity in a digital format, they can be read easily, and are more accurate than the
	analog multi-meters, reducing interpolation and reading errors. Digital instruments offer significant advantages over analog devices.
	The auto-polarity function of digital devices prevents various problems. Parallax error which occurs when the pointer of an analog
	instrument is viewed from a different angle, which may cause users to see and read a different value are eliminated as well. Digital
	instruments are free from wear and potential shock failures because they have no moving parts. With the advancements in technology
	of integrated circuits, digital instruments are becoming increasingly compact and accurate. Key market players of analog and digital
	instruments include Thermo Fisher Scientific, Danaher Corporation, Mettler Toledo, Metrohm USA, Hanna Instruments, Agilent
	Technologies, and Perkin Elmer.

	Most modern instruments are digital.
	They are designed for measuring various physical quantities in objects; and consist of the following functional components:


	 





	·







	Data
	acquisition. This is the process of sampling signals that measure real world physical conditions and converting the resulting
	samples into digital numeric values that can be manipulated by a microprocessor. The components of data acquisition systems include:












	a.


	 


	Sensors, to convert physical parameters to electrical signals;





	b.






	Signal conditioning
	circuitry, to convert sensor signals into a form that can be converted to digital values;








	c.






	Analog-to-digital
	converters, to convert conditioned sensor signals to digital values. It normally operates on conditioned signals, that is, signals
	that have already been filtered and amplified by analog circuits.








	·






	Storage
	and communication components. Application-specific input/output (I/O) components. In digital instrumentation systems, the transmission
	of data between devices is realized relatively easily by using serial or parallel transmission techniques.








	·






	Ancillaries
	such as displays and power supplies and application specific software.





	 


	Traditional hardware-centered instrumentation systems are made up
	of multiple stand-alone instruments that are interconnected to carry out a determined measurement or control an operation. They
	have fixed vendor-defined functionality, are very powerful and large, expensive, and cumbersome. They also require a lot of power,
	and often have excessive amounts of features that are not user friendly. Users generally cannot extend or customize them easily.
	The knobs and buttons on the instrument, the built-in circuitry, and the functions available to the user, are specific to the nature
	of the instrument.


	 


	Instrument inter-operability and connectivity
	allow the Ubiquitor to communicate and work with other instruments manufactured by different vendors, in a manner that requires
	the user to have little or no knowledge of the unique characteristics of those instruments. Traditional instruments, including
	traditional hardware-centered instrumentations and software centered virtual instrumentations, are specifically designed, constructed
	and refined to perform one or more specific tasks. Most of the instruments on the market come with a variety of connectivity technologies
	and do not have the built-in firmware or software to support the connectivity and inter-operability of instruments without drastically
	revising the application software across instrument brands. Unfortunately, while the instrument drivers simplify software development
	and maintenance, they did not address hardware obsolescence since each manufacturer has their own drivers and application and none
	are compatible, current applications are limited only to large, expensive test and measurement instruments.


	  


	A universal instrument is a versatile device
	which combines many individual instrument functions, sensors and probes in a single unit. It has a primary purpose, but also incorporates
	other instrument’s functionalities. One instrument could perform many different measurements and control and substitute many
	other instruments. It utilizes a variety of probes to connect to the device for a wide variety of process measurement and control.
	A universal instrument offers superior sensor or probe compatibility, versatility, inter-operability, connectivity and scalability.
	Theoretically, it is feasible to design a universal instrument which is compatible with all sensors or probes on the market, and
	capable of monitoring and controlling any combination of sensors or probes.


	 


	Despite the undoubted usefulness of the universal
	instruments, one of the major obstacles that prevent the universal instruments from being adopted by end users is their cost. The
	cost of a $10 traditional instrument, which incorporates the functions of a $1000 instrument, may have to increase its cost to
	the order of $1000. The end user who just needs a $10 traditional instrument for his applications certainly does not have the motivation
	to spend $1000 for functions he does not need. Functionality always needs to be balanced against cost. The knobs and buttons on
	the instrument, the built-in circuitry, and the functions available to the user, are specific to the nature of the instrument,
	making them very expensive and hard to adapt.

	Smartphones and tablets have been considered
	recreational devices for communicating, playing games and streaming videos, but they are also one of the most powerful tools engineers
	use for designing, validating, and producing products. These ubiquitous smartphones perform better than most instrumentation in
	many fields. Because of their network connectivity, smartphones and tablets are great tools for remotely viewing measurements.
	However, their small size and processing power also makes them effective for portable measurements. The ubiquity of wireless connectivity
	combined with increasing functionality and the speed of connected devices and mobile networks will further drive consumer demand
	for more cost effective smartphone based instruments. Building an application for a smartphone or tablet and turning a smartphone
	or tablet to an instrument is not a trivial task. Many of the instrument manufacturers have limited or no expertise programming
	for mobile platforms and designing wireless hardware. To help instrument manufacturers take advantage of these smart devices, Perfecular
	Inc., has dedicated many years of research and development efforts into designing, manufacturing, marketing and promoting wireless
	smart technology and products.


	 


	Universal smart protocol focuses not only on
	the design of the hardware and software modules, but also on the design of the overall universal smart instruments system, guided
	by the structured, universal and modular principles. It is open to instrument manufacturers, software and hardware developers.


	 


	Compatibility: The compatibility in universal
	smart instrument system refers not only to the compatibility between the same types of instruments from different manufactures,
	but also to the compatibility between various instrument types. The full inter-operability and absolute instrument interchangeability
	was addressed in the protocol.


	 


	Universality: All functionalities of the traditional
	instruments are integrated into a single unit, allowing different data acquisition modules to execute on the same mobile platform.
	Thus, the interoperability between various sensors or probes can be achieved.


	 


	Upgradeability: The most traditional instrument
	interface is a unidirectional application, the instrument performs its task and transmits results to the interface device in one
	direction only. Many traditional instruments have been limited by design to unidirectional interfaces. They only perform monitoring
	tasks and share a majority of functions of the bi-directional controlling instruments, however, they cannot be upgraded to controllers.
	End users have to purchase a new controlling instrument for their applications. Taking advantage of the secure bi-directional wireless
	communications and interface supported by smartphones or mobile devices, universal smart instruments, which deliver data between
	the smartphone and sensors back and forth, can be readily modified or upgraded by adding the corresponding actuators for controlling
	applications. Sensors or probes measure the output performance of the device being controlled and give feedback to the input actuators
	that can make corrections towards the desired performance.


	 


	Expandability and Scalability: Similar to sensor
	network technology, universal smart instruments are more flexible than sensor networks. They can currently monitor and control
	a few hundreds of sensors or probes. They automatically identify and configure the corresponding graphical user interfaces. End
	users are free to add or removes sensors or probes. All communication protocols supported by smartphones are integrated in the
	software design including WI-FI, blue tooth, cellular network technology and wired form through the audio port on the smartphone.


	 


	Security: Universal smart instruments have
	the sensor security built-in data acquisition module and help companies meet sensor security requirements, preventing unauthorized
	users from accessing the sensor measurements and control. Unauthorized access of the universal smart instruments sensors is forbidden.


	 



	Our Approach to Measurement and Sensing




	 



	We offer a different approach that links handheld
	devices and sensors with common smartphone computing power through an application on the smartphone in both IOS and Android devices.
	Tapping into the computing power of a smartphone enables a measurement device to increase its capabilities.


	 


	We also offer an array of traditional handheld meters through our
	wholesale distribution platform.

	Filter and Handheld Meter Wholesaler





	 



	We are a wholesaler of various filtration products
	and digital meters. We source our products from manufacturers in China and then sell to a major U.S. distributor who resells our
	products directly to consumers through retail distribution channels. Specifically, we sell the following products:


	 



	Fan Speed Adjuster device

	. We provide
	a fan speed adjuster device to retailers and distributors. Designed specifically for centrifugal fans with brushless motors, our
	adjuster device helps ensure longer life by preventing damage to fan motors by adjusting the speed of centrifugal fans without
	causing the motor to hum. These devices are rated for 350 watts max, have 120VAC voltage capacity and feature an internal, electronic
	auto-resetting circuit breaker.


	 



	Carbon filter devices.

	We also sell
	two types of carbon filter devices to distributors. These Carbon filter devices are professional grade filters specifically designed
	and used to filter air in greenhouses that might be polluted by fermenting organics. One of these filters can be attached to a
	centrifugal fan to scrub the air in a constant circle or can be attached to an exhaust line as a single pass filter, which moves
	air out of the growing area and filters unwanted odors and removes pollens, dust, and other debris in the air. The other filter
	is designed to be used with fans from 0-6000 C.F.M.



	 




	HEPA filtration device.

	We provide an
	organic air high efficiency particulate arrestance (“HEPA”) filtration device at wholesale prices to distributors and
	retailers. Manufactured, tested, certified, and labeled in accordance with current HEPA filter standards, this device is targeted
	towards greenhouses and grow rooms and designed to keep insects, bacteria, and mold out of grow rooms. We sell these devices in
	various sizes.



	 




	Digital light meter.

	We provide a handheld
	digital light meter that is used to measure luminance in fc units, or foot-candles. The meter we sell is designed to be full cosine
	corrected for the angular incidence of light (meaning if you are not holding the sensor perpendicular to the light source, the
	sensor will still read the light correctly). The meter has a built-in low battery indicator and is designed to accurately measure
	to 40,000 FC.


	 



	Quantum par meter.

	We provide a handheld
	quantum par meter used to measure photosynthetically active radiation (“PAR”). This fully portable handheld PAR meter
	is designed to measure PAR flux in wavelengths ranging from 400 to 700 nm. It is designed to measure up to 10,000 umol.


	 




	Ubiquitor Wireless Universal Sensor Device





	 



	Our “Ubiquitor,” device will be
	a handheld fully modular system with a universal sensor node and gateway system that will use a smartphone as the output display
	module that displays the readings of various probe modules. We have initial functioning prototype devices created and intend to
	develop this into full-scale production. The Ubiquitor will be a wireless sensor device that combines measuring tools with smartphone
	technology to quickly deliver sensor node data on desktop and mobile phone screens. The Ubiquitor’s sensor analytics system
	will integrate event-monitoring, storage and analytics software in a cohesive package that provides a holistic view of sensor data
	it is reading.


	 


	The physical hardware consists of:


	 




	 



	1.




	The sensor probes, which come in hundreds of different varieties of sensor instruments in the form of a USB stick, with both male and female ports; and







	 



	2.




	The main hardware gateway, a small cell phone size device with integrated circuits.





	 


	This device can connect up to 2.5 kilometers
	of sensor instruments, and integrate data using embedded software to display the data and all analytics onto a digital screen (desktop
	or mobile displays) using a Wi-Fi connection. Most types of probes can connect to the hardware. If the sensor size is bigger than
	the standard probe size, it is possible to simply use a USB cable to connect the probe and the hub. All data and analytics are
	displayed on a single screen, with tools that record and keep track of all measurements, and sort and display analytic information
	in easy to read charts.


	 


	 


	 






	 



	5



	 







	 




	 


	The Ubiquitor is a general platform that collects
	data in real time, up to 100hz per second, and thus is intended to be adapted to many industry uses.


	 


	The Ubiquitor is a multipurpose wireless intelligent
	sensor device. Its greatest advantage is universal compatibility. Currently, the Ubiquitor device could simultaneously accommodate
	more than 256 different types of sensor heads. Therefore, users could use their smartphones to simultaneously operate and monitor
	over 256 kinds of sensor readings. With Perfecular’s technology, users only need to obtain the sensor heads, facilitating
	ease and convenience of use. Using a smartphone, users can collect and analyze data in real time.


	 


	By using the smartphone as a substitute platform,
	we believe we will achieve the following efficiencies:


	 




	 



	1.





	Cut production costs.

	Smartphone technology will advance and become more widely used than the vast majority products on the small sensor device market. By utilizing smartphone technology, the Ubiquitor will add superior functionality and performance, improve the product’s quality and cutting production costs







	 



	2.





	Reduce the effort required to develop a new sensor product.

	With the Ubiquitor, we believe that there will be no need for device manufacturers to research and develop the new monitoring and operating components because they will just need to develop new sensor heads based on our software technology.







	 



	3.





	Reduce clutter.

	It is anticipated that the Ubiquitor dispenses with the hassle of hooking up cables, since it is based on wireless transmission of data.





	 




	Strategy





	 





	Strategy and Marketing Plan




	 


	We have designed, manufactured, marketed and
	distributed our electronic measurement devices, such as temperature humidity meters, digital meters, quantum PAR meters, pH meters,
	TDS meters and CO2 monitors, for many years and have many loyal customers. The universal smart technology has been applied to our
	existing traditional devices and demonstrated functionality and hardware cost savings. We believe we have achieved hardware cost
	savings in the range of 70% to 90%. Prototypes were sent to our customers for demonstrations and evaluation. Currently, we are
	in the stage of producing a pilot manufacturing run. The first round of pilot production was completed in May, 2016. The second
	round of pilot production was completed in July 2016.


	 


	Smartphones are an integral part of our wireless
	universal smart technology system. Both wireless and wired communication connectivity are used and targeted on different applications.
	In wired connectivity, the data acquisition module is connected through the audio port in the smartphone. The smartphone is used
	to replace a traditional instrument. Compared with the wireless solution, the wireless communication module or even the power supply
	used for data acquisition module are eliminated in the design, as a consequence of this some hardware costs are saved. End users
	are not able to access the sensors or probes remotely. We believe that the instruments based on wired universal smart technology
	are not as convenient as their wireless counterparts. Currently, in the industry, however, wired instruments are cheaper.


	 


	We believe that being the first ones in the
	market provides a significant and sustained market-share advantage over later competitors. We first focus on our existing instruments
	and convert them to universal smart devices and market them to our existing customers.


	 


	We are putting together an internal sales team
	with the proceeds of the offering in order to get established for the marketing efforts.


	 


	We believe that wireless universal smart technology
	will play a critical role for traditional instrument manufacturers, as it is too expensive and difficult to develop for medium
	or smaller companies. The cost factor is the first consideration when deciding whether a company wants to develop smart wireless
	technologies and implement them in their products. There are hundreds of thousands of instrument manufacturers and trillion-dollar
	revenues for this industry in China. We plan to open a sales department in China dedicate to promoting our technologies to local
	instrument manufacturers.


	 


	 


	 






	 



	6



	 







	 




	 


	Smartphones have been seamlessly integrated
	into our daily life. A large number of functions and services have become accessible to the masses through the use of smart phones.
	The proliferation of the smartphone and its user-friendly interface, which allows access to digital information, will cause these
	devices to become a crucial part of our wireless universal smart instruments.


	 


	Our goals over the next three years include:


	 




	 



	·




	Raise capital to move to full manufacturing and production for our Ubiquitor device;







	 



	·




	Partner with manufacturers and promote the adoption of our Ubiquitor platform;







	 



	·




	Acquire a stable market share of the handheld wireless sensor device market;







	 



	·




	Continue to develop market share in our wholesale distribution of sensors and filters; and







	 



	·




	Utilize our internet marketing strategies to market our handheld sensors and filters.





	 


	In order to achieve these goals, we intend to focus on the following
	initiatives:


	 




	 



	·




	Position the Ubiquitor product as the industry standard in universal wireless sensor reading technology;







	 



	·




	Establish strategic supply chain channels to facilitate efficient production operations; and







	 



	·




	Communicate the product and service differentiation through direct networking and effective marketing.





	 




	Distribution Method




	 


	We intend to continue to engage in relationships
	with Chinese manufacturers and then distribute our products to distributors and retailers directly from the Chinese manufacturers
	and then we intend to distribute the Ubiquitor by selling directly to traditional instrument manufacturers. We believe that traditional
	instrument manufacturers will adopt this technology since the Ubiquitor device is intended to consolidate various other sensors.


	 


	We intend to manufacture and market the Ubiquitor
	and sell it directly to consumers or distributors using internet marketing and also using channels such as Amazon.com and to launch
	the product through crowdfunding sites like indiegogo and kickstarter.com. We also intend to establish a marketing department overseas
	in China.


	 




	Raw Materials





	 



	The electronic components used in the Ubiquitor
	are common and can be easily purchased. Production and assembly lines are also available worldwide.


	 




	Manufacturing and Production




	 


	We have a limited production facility in California
	where small and medium sized circuit board production can take place until we have enough sales to convert manufacturing to a large-scale
	manufacturing facility in China, where we have key strategic relationships with manufacturing facilities.

	Competitors




	 


	There are several competitors we have identified
	in the wireless sensor node industry, including traditional instruments or devices manufacturers such as Hanna Instruments or Extech
	Instruments.


	 


	Hach developed and launched SC1000 Multi-parameter
	Universal Controller, a probe module for connecting up to 8 SC sensors and their products are not compatible with smart phones
	yet and we believe their price-point is still prohibitive to consumers.


	 


	Monnit Corporation offers a range of wireless
	or remote sensors. Many of Monnit’s products are web-based wireless sensors usually are not portable because of the power
	consumption. Also, the sensors real-time updates are slow and we believe security of the web-based sensor data acquisition also
	may be a concern. In addition to purchasing the device, consumers usually have to pay monthly fee for using web-based services.


	 


	We are not trying to compete with traditional
	instruments or device manufacturers because we utilize our Ubiquitor universal smart device in conjunction with our generic instruments
	smartphone application, which we believe will be a completely different product category.



	 





	Patent, Trademark, License and Franchise
	Restrictions and Contractual Obligations and Concessions




	 


	On November 4, 2016 we filed a U.S. patent
	application number 15/344,041 with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. We hope this full patent application protects the Ubiquitor
	universal sensor device. It is anticipated that the publication will occur on July 20, 2017. We do not own, either legally or beneficially,
	any trademarks.


	 




	Research and Development Activities




	 


	Other than time spent researching our proposed
	business we have not spent any funds on research and development activities to date. We do not currently plan to spend any funds
	on research and development activities in the future.


	 




	Compliance with Environmental Laws




	 


	We are not aware of any environmental laws
	that have been enacted, nor are we aware of any such laws being contemplated for the future, that impact issues specific to our
	business.


	 




	Employees




	 


	As of the date of this Annual Report we have
	seven full-time and two part-time employees, the Company’s officers, our President Dr. Edward Lee, our Chief Executive Officer
	and Secretary Desheng Wang. Our officers and directors are responsible for planning, developing and operational duties, and will
	continue to do so throughout the early stages of our growth. Our seven full-time employees are working in the warehouse orchestrating
	the development and distribution of our handheld sensor devices as well as our filters.


	 




	Reports to Securities Holders




	 


	We provide an Annual Report that includes audited
	financial information to our shareholders. We will make our financial information equally available to any interested parties or
	investors through compliance with the disclosure rules for a small business issuer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. We
	are subject to disclosure filing requirements including filing Form 10-K annually and Form 10-Q quarterly. In addition, we will file
	Form 8-K and other proxy and information statements from time to time as required. We do not intend to voluntarily file the above
	reports in the event that our obligation to file such reports is suspended under the Exchange Act. The public may read and copy
	any materials that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, ("SEC"), at the SEC's Public Reference Room at
	100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549.


	 


	The public may obtain information on the operation
	of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC maintains an Internet site (http://www.sec.gov) that
	contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC.

	Item 1A. RISK FACTORS



	  




	We lack an operating history. There is
	no assurance our future operations will result in profitable revenues. If we cannot generate sufficient revenues to operate profitably,
	our business will fail.




	 


	We were incorporated on December 4, 2012, and
	as of December 31, 2015 have realized $53,898 in revenues, incurred $21,775 in cost of revenue and $244,216 in operating costs
	since inception (December 4, 2012). As of December 31, 2015, we had deficit accumulated during the development stage of $216,810.
	We have a limited operating history upon which an evaluation of our future success or failure can be made. Based upon current plans,
	we expect to continue generating revenues. However, our revenues may not be sufficient to cover our operating costs. We cannot
	guarantee that we will be successful in generating significant revenues in the future. Failure to achieve a sustainable sales level
	will cause us to go out of business.


	 




	We require significant funding to manufacture and market our
	Ubiquitor wireless sensor.






	 




	We may ultimately require up to $20 million
	to fund the manufacturing and marketing strategy for our product. Once we achieve this fund raising goal, we intend to position
	ourselves in the small device market, establishing the price at below a few hundred dollars. Due to superior functionality and
	low price, we expect to capture this section of the market fairly easily, while our product and service matures, and the Company
	becomes better known, we will seize the high-end market. None of this will be possible if we fail to obtain the funding we require.




	 






	We depend on key personnel.






	 




	Our future success will depend in part on the
	continued service of key personnel, particularly, Desheng Wang our Chief Executive Officer and our President Edward Lee.


	 


	If any of our directors and officers will choose
	to leave the company, we will face significant difficulties in attracting potential candidates for replacement of our key personnel
	due to our limited financial resources and operating history. In addition, the loss of any key employees or the inability to attract
	or retain qualified personnel could delay our plan of operations and harm our ability to provide services to our current customers
	and harm the market’s perception of us.




	 






	We outsourced our product manufacturing
	and procurement, decreasing quality and reliability and protectability






	 




	We have fully outsourced all manufacturing
	and have no direct control over the manufacturing processes of our products. This lack of control may increase quality or reliability
	risks and could limit our ability to quickly increase or decrease production rates. It also creates liability in that we could
	lose control of our intellectual property that is not properly protected.




	 






	Demand for our products is uncertain
	and depends on our currently unproven ability to create and maintain superior performance






	 




	Our future operating results will depend upon
	our ability to provide our products or services and to operate profitably in an industry characterized by intense competition,
	rapid technological advances and low margins. This, in turn, will depend on a number of factors, including:


	 




	 



	·




	Our ability to generate significant sales and profit margin from the Ubiquitor device;





	 



	·




	Worldwide
	market conditions and demand for web services, sensor devices and other products we may continue to add as we move forward;





	 



	·




	Our
	success in meeting targeted availability dates for our products and services;





	 



	·




	Our
	ability to develop and commercialize new intellectual property and to protect existing intellectual property;





	 



	·




	Our
	ability to maintain profitable relationships with our distributors, retailers and other resellers;





	 



	·




	Our
	ability to maintain an appropriate cost structure;





	 



	·




	Our
	ability to attract and retain competent, motivated employees;





	 



	·




	Our
	ability to comply with applicable legal requirements throughout the world; and





	 



	·




	Our
	ability to successfully manage litigation, including enforcing our rights, protecting our interests and defending claims made
	against us.







	 






	 






	 








	 



	9



	 







	 






	 




	These factors are difficult to manage,
	satisfy and influence and we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to sustain profits in the future.


	 




	Our Ubiquitor
	Product could fail to gain traction in the marketplace for a number of reasons that would adversely impact our financial results
	and cause our investors to lose money.





	 



	Future successful sales of our Ubiquitor
	entail numerous risks such as:


	 




	 



	·




	Any lack of market acceptance of the Ubiquitor;





	 



	·




	Failure to maintain acceptable arrangements with product suppliers, particularly in light of lower than anticipated volumes;





	 



	·




	Manufacturing, technical, supplier, or quality-related delays, issues or concerns, including the loss of any key supplier or failure of any key supplier to deliver high quality products on time;





	 



	·




	Competition;





	 



	·




	Potential declines in demand for sensor devices; and





	 



	·




	Risks that third parties may assert intellectual property claims against our products.





	 


	In order to compete
	successfully, we must accurately forecast demand, closely monitor inventory levels, secure quality products, continuously drive
	down costs, meet aggressive product price and performance targets, create market demand for our brand and hold sufficient, but
	not excess, inventory.




	 






	There is a risk that the market will not adapt to using the
	smartphone as a substitute platform for sensor devices, causing our products to fail in the marketplace.






	 




	There is a risk that the market will not receive
	the smartphone technology, which we will be using as our platform. The vast majority of products on the small sensor device market
	do not currently use smartphones to collect and analyze sensor data. There is no guarantee that using smartphone technology will
	cut production costs and be well received. If our platform using smartphone technology is not well received, there is a risk that
	device manufacturers will develop new monitoring and operating components that are incompatible with our current platform instead
	of developing the traditional sensors that are compatible with our technology. Updating our platform to stay compatible with new
	components could increase our costs unexpectedly.


	 




	Using wireless transmission technologies such as WI-FI and
	Bluetooth may create security risks.






	 




	There is also a risk of failure based on the
	wireless transmission of data used by our smartphone platform. If there is instability in a wireless network, Bluetooth sensor,
	or other network problems that are out of our control, our new platform may not be well received. Our smartphone platform relies
	on the wireless transmission of data through WIFI networks and Bluetooth sensors. These networks are often deemed less secure than
	a hard-wired network. The security of a wireless network is often out of our control. However, any breach of security could result
	in the market and sensor device manufacturers to fail to embrace our platform.


	 




	Our business involves the use, transmission
	and storage of confidential information, and the failure to properly safeguard such information could result in significant reputational
	harm.




	 


	We may at times collect, store and transmit
	information of, or on behalf of, our clients that may include certain types of confidential information that may be considered
	personal or sensitive, and that are subject to laws that apply to data breaches. We believe that we take reasonable steps to protect
	the security, integrity and confidentiality of the information we collect and store, but there is no guarantee that inadvertent
	or unauthorized disclosure will not occur or that third parties will not gain unauthorized access to this information despite our
	efforts to protect this information, including through a cyber-attack that circumvents existing security measures and compromises
	the data that we store. If such unauthorized disclosure or access does occur, we may be required to notify persons whose information
	was disclosed or accessed. Most states have enacted data breach notification laws and, in addition to federal laws that apply to
	certain types of information, such as financial information, federal legislation has been proposed that would establish broader
	federal obligations with respect to data breaches. We may also be subject to claims of breach of contract for such unauthorized
	disclosure or access, investigation and penalties by regulatory authorities and potential claims by persons whose information was
	disclosed. The unauthorized disclosure of information, or a cyber-security incident involving data that we store, may result in
	the termination of one or more of our commercial relationships or a reduction in client confidence and usage of our services. We
	may also be subject to litigation alleging the improper use, transmission or storage of confidential information, which could damage
	our reputation among our current and potential clients and cause us to lose business and revenue.


	 


	 


	 






	 



	10



	 







	 




	 




	Our business depends on our ability
	to keep manufacturing costs low and we may lack the expertise necessary to negotiate and maintain favorable pricing, supply, business
	and credit terms with our potential vendors.






	 




	It may be difficult
	to negotiate or maintain favorable pricing, supply, business or credit terms with our potential vendors, suppliers and service
	providers. In addition, product manufacturing costs may increase if we fail to achieve anticipated volumes. There can be no assurance
	that we will be able to successfully manage these risks. In summary, we can offer no assurance that we will be able to obtain a
	sufficient (but not excess) supply of products on a timely and cost effective basis. Our failure to do so would lead to a material
	adverse impact on our business.


	 




	The lack of public company experience
	of our management team could adversely impact our ability to comply with the reporting requirements of U.S. securities laws.




	 


	Dr. Wang lacks public company experience, which
	could impair our ability to comply with legal and regulatory requirements such as those imposed by Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
	Our CEO and CFO have never been responsible for managing a publicly traded company. Such responsibilities include complying with
	federal securities laws and making required disclosures on a timely basis. Any such deficiencies, weaknesses or lack of compliance
	could have a materially adverse effect on our ability to comply with the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act
	of 1934, as amended, which is necessary to maintain our public company status. If we were to fail to fulfill those obligations,
	our ability to continue as a U.S. public company would be in jeopardy in which event you could lose your entire investment in our
	company.


	 




	Our officers, directors, consultants
	and advisors are involved in other businesses and not obligated to commit their time and attention exclusively to our business
	and therefore they may encounter conflicts of interest with respect to the allocation of time and business opportunities between
	our operations and those of other businesses.




	 


	Our President Mr. Desheng Wang is currently
	involved in other businesses and not obligated to commit his time and attention exclusively to our business and, accordingly, he
	may encounter conflicts of interest in allocating his own time, or any business opportunities that he may encounter, between our
	operations and those of other businesses. Furthermore, if the execution of our business plan demands more time than is currently
	committed by him, he will be under no obligation to commit such additional time, and his failure to do so may adversely affect
	our ability to carry on our business and successfully execute our business plan.


	 


	Another example of a conflict of interest is
	so called “self-dealing" transactions. The director of Perfecular is dealing with himself, and may not reach an agreement
	that is fair to the company, e.g. his remuneration for serving as officer of the Company. If a conflict-of-interest transaction
	is negotiated and approved, in a manner that approximates arms-length negotiations, the transaction is accepted unless a shareholder
	proves in court that the transaction is not entirely fair to the Company. The burden is on the shareholder to show lack of entire
	fairness. Otherwise, the transaction is considered invalid if challenged, unless the director proves in court that the transaction
	is entirely fair to the company. The burden is on the director to show entire fairness.


	 


	If, as a result of before mentioned conflicts,
	we are deprived of business opportunities or information, the execution of our business plan and our ability to effectively compete
	in the marketplace may be adversely affected. If we become aware of such conflict of interests we will take an immediate action
	to resolve it. Each conflict of interest will be handled by the company based on the nature of the conflict and the individual
	involved in it.


	 


	We do not have any actual or potential conflict of interests with
	our consultants or advisors.




	 






	We do not have a majority of independent
	directors on our Board and the Company has not voluntarily implemented various corporate governance measures, in the absence of
	which stockholders may have more limited protections against interested director transactions, conflicts of interest and similar
	matters.




	 


	Federal legislation, including the Sarbanes-Oxley
	Act of 2002, has resulted in the adoption of various corporate governance measures designed to promote the integrity of the corporate
	management and the securities markets. Some of these measures have been adopted in response to legal requirements. Others have
	been adopted by companies in response to the requirements of national securities exchanges, such as the NYSE or the NASDAQ Stock
	Market, on which their securities are listed. Among the corporate governance measures that are required under the rules of national
	securities exchanges are those that address board of directors’ independence, audit committee oversight, and the adoption
	of a code of ethics. We have not yet adopted any of these other corporate governance measures and since our securities are not
	yet listed on a national securities exchange, we are not required to do so. Our Board of Directors is comprised of one individual.
	As a result, we do not have independent directors on our Board of Directors.


	 


	 


	 






	 



	11



	 







	 




	 


	We have not adopted corporate governance measures
	such as an audit or other independent committee of our Board of Directors, as we presently do not have independent directors on
	our board. If we expand our board membership in future periods to include additional independent directors, we may seek to establish
	an audit and other committee of our board of directors. It is possible that if our Board of Directors included independent directors
	and if we were to adopt some or all of these corporate governance measures, stockholders would benefit from somewhat greater assurance
	that internal corporate decisions were being made by disinterested directors and that policies had been implemented to define responsible
	conduct. For example, at present in the absence of audit, nominating and compensation committees comprised of at least a majority
	of independent directors, decisions concerning matters such as compensation packages or employment contracts to our officers are
	made by a director who has an interest in the outcome of the matters being decided.


	 


	However, as a general rule, the Board of Directors,
	in making its decisions, determines first that the terms of such transaction are no less favorable to us that those that would
	be available to us with respect to such a transaction from unaffiliated third parties. The Company executes the transaction between
	executive officers once approved by the Board of Directors.


	 


	Prospective investors should bear in mind our
	current lack of corporate governance measures in formulating their investment decisions.


	 



	We have concluded
	that we have not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting through the year ended December 31, 2016. Significant
	deficiencies and material weaknesses in our internal control could have material adverse effects on us.



	 


	It is important for
	us to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, which is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
	regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
	with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may
	not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the
	risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
	procedures may deteriorate.


	 


	For a discussion of
	our internal control over financial reporting and a description of the identified material weakness, see “Management’s
	Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting” included in Item 9A of this Report. A material weakness is a deficiency,
	or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that
	a material misstatement of the Company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely
	basis.


	 


	A material weakness
	in our internal control over financial reporting could adversely impact our ability to provide timely and accurate financial information.
	We plan to implement a number of remediation steps to address the material weakness as described in Item 9A of this Report. If
	we are unsuccessful in implementing or following our remediation plan, we may not be able to timely or accurately report our financial
	condition, results of operations or cash flows or maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures. If we are unable to report
	financial information timely and accurately or to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures, we could be subject to,
	among other things, regulatory or enforcement actions by the SEC, any one of which could adversely affect our business prospects.




	 






	We currently have identified significant
	deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that, if not corrected, could result in material misstatements of
	our financial statements.






	 




	In connection with
	the audit of our financial statements as of and for the year ended March 31, 2016, we identified significant deficiencies in our
	internal control over financial reporting and a general understanding of accounting principles generally accepted in the United
	States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). As such, there is a reasonable possibility that a misstatement of our financial statements
	will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.


	 


	As we have thus far
	not needed to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, neither we nor our independent registered public accounting firm
	has performed an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
	Act. In light of the deficiency, we believe that it is possible that certain control deficiencies may have been identified if such
	an evaluation had been performed.


	 


	 


	 






	 



	12



	 







	 




	 


	We are working to
	remediate the deficiencies or material weaknesses. We have taken steps to enhance our internal control environment and plan to
	take additional steps to remediate the material weaknesses. Specifically:


	 




	 



	·




	We have hired additional outside consultants and will fire unqualified personnel in our accounting department, especially to add an experienced accountant in a controller capacity. We will continue to evaluate the structure of the finance organization and add resources as needed;





	 




	 



	·




	We are implementing additional internal reporting procedures, including those designed to add depth to our review processes and improve our segregation of duties;





	 




	 



	·




	We are updating our systems so that we may collect the necessary information to enable us to more effectively monitor and comply with applicable filing requirements on a timely basis; and





	 




	 



	·




	We are in the process of documenting, assessing and testing our internal control over financial reporting as part of our efforts to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.





	 


	Although we plan to
	complete this remediation process as quickly as possible, we are unable, at this time to estimate how long it will take, and our
	efforts may not be successful in remediating the deficiencies or material weaknesses.




	 






	We do not have a majority of independent
	directors on our Board and the Company has not voluntarily implemented various corporate governance measures, in the absence of
	which stockholders may have more limited protections against interested director transactions, conflicts of interest and similar
	matters.




	 


	Federal legislation, including the Sarbanes-Oxley
	Act of 2002, has resulted in the adoption of various corporate governance measures designed to promote the integrity of the corporate
	management and the securities markets. Some of these measures have been adopted in response to legal requirements. Others have

	Market, on which their securities are listed. Among the corporate governance measures that are required under the rules of national
	securities exchanges are those that address board of directors’ independence, audit committee oversight, and the adoption
	of a code of ethics. We have not yet adopted any of these other corporate governance measures and since our securities are not
	yet listed on a national securities exchange, we are not required to do so. Our Board of Directors is comprised of three individuals,
	all of whom are also our executive officers. As a result, we do not have independent directors on our Board of Directors.


	 


	We have not adopted corporate governance measures
	such as an audit or other independent committee of our Board of Directors, as we presently do not have independent directors on
	our board. If we expand our board membership in future periods to include additional independent directors, we may seek to establish
	an audit and other committee of our Board of Directors. It is possible that if our Board of Directors included independent directors
	and if we were to adopt some or all of these corporate governance measures, stockholders would benefit from somewhat greater assurance

	conduct. For example, at present in the absence of audit, nominating and compensation committees comprised of at least a majority
	of independent directors, decisions concerning matters such as compensation packages or employment contracts to our senior officers
	are made by a majority of directors who have an interest in the outcome of the matters being decided.


	 


	However, as a general rule, the Board of Directors,
	in making its decisions, determines first that the terms of such transaction are no less favorable to us that those that would
	be available to us with respect to such a transaction from unaffiliated third parties.


	 


	Prospective investors should bear in mind our
	current lack of corporate governance measures in formulating their investment decisions.

	Because one of our Directors, who is
	also our sole promoter, owns over 49% of our outstanding common stock he could make and control corporate decisions that may be
	disadvantageous to other minority shareholders.




	 


	One of our Directors owns over 49% of the outstanding
	shares of our common stock as of the date of this reporting. Accordingly, Directors have a significant influence in determining
	the outcome of all corporate transactions or other matters, including mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially
	all of our assets. They also have the power to prevent or cause a change in control. The interests of our Directors may differ
	from the interests of the other stockholders and thus result in corporate decisions that are disadvantageous to other shareholders.


	 




	Our executive officers and Directors
	collectively have the power to control our management and operations, and have a significant majority in voting power on all matters
	submitted to the stockholders of the company.




	 


	Management currently beneficially owns a majority
	of our outstanding common stock. Consequently, management has the ability to influence control of the operations of the Company
	and, acting together, will have the ability to influence or control substantially all matters submitted to stockholders for approval,
	including:


	 




	 



	·




	Election of our Board of Directors;





	 



	·




	Removal of directors;





	 



	·




	Amendment to the Company’s Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; and





	 



	·




	Adoption of measures that could delay or prevent a change in control or impede a merger, takeover or other business combination.





	 


	These stockholders have complete control over
	our affairs. Accordingly, this concentration of ownership by itself may have the effect of impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover
	or other business consolidation, or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for the common stock.




	 






	You could be diluted from our future
	issuance of capital stock and derivative securities.




	 


	As of March 28, 2016, we had 34,574,706 shares
	of common stock outstanding and no shares of preferred stock outstanding. We are authorized to issue up to 75,000,000 shares of
	common stock and no shares of preferred stock. To the extent of such authorization, our Board of Directors will have the ability,
	without seeking stockholder approval, to issue additional shares of common stock or preferred stock in the future for such consideration
	as the Board of Directors may consider sufficient. The issuance of additional common stock or preferred stock in the future may
	reduce your proportionate ownership and voting power.


	 




	None of the members of our Board of Directors
	are considered audit committee financial experts. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial
	reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results. As a result, current and potential shareholders could
	lose confidence in our financial reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our stock.




	 


	Members of our Board of Directors are inexperienced
	with U.S. GAAP and the related internal control procedures required of U.S. public companies. Management has determined that our
	internal audit function is also significantly deficient due to insufficient qualified resources to perform internal audit functions.
	Finally, we have not established an Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.


	 


	We are a smaller reporting company with limited
	resources. Therefore, we cannot assure investors that we will be able to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting
	based on criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in Internal
	Control-Integrated Framework. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial
	reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company's annual or interim financial
	statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. For these reasons, we are considering the costs and benefits associated
	with improving and documenting our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls and procedures, which includes (i)
	hiring additional personnel with sufficient U.S. GAAP experience and (ii) implementing ongoing training in U.S. GAAP requirements
	for our CFO and accounting and other finance personnel. If the result of these efforts are not successful, or if material weaknesses
	are identified in our internal control over financial reporting, our management will be unable to report favorably as to the effectiveness
	of our internal control over financial reporting and/or our disclosure controls and procedures, and we could be required to further
	implement expensive and time-consuming remedial measures and potentially lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness
	of our financial reports which could have an adverse effect on our stock price and potentially subject us to litigation.

	The requirements of being a public company
	may strain our resources and distract our management.




	 


	We are required to comply with various regulatory
	and reporting requirements, including those required by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Complying with these reporting
	and other regulatory requirements is time-consuming and may result in increased costs to us and could have a negative effect on
	our business, results of operations and financial condition.


	 


	As a public company, we are subject to the
	reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley
	Act of 2002, as amended, or SOX. These requirements may place a strain on our systems and resources. The Exchange Act requires
	that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. The SOX requires that
	we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting. Compliance with these
	rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming
	or costly and increase demand on our systems and resources.


	 


	These activities may divert management’s
	attention from other business concerns, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.


	 


	In addition, changing laws, regulations and
	standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal
	and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject
	to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may
	evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding
	compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to invest
	resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative
	expenses and a diversion of management’s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities.
	If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing
	bodies due to ambiguities related to practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business
	may be harmed.


	 


	We also expect that being a public company
	and these new rules and regulations will make it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and
	we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. These factors could also
	make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our Board of Directors, particularly to serve on our audit
	committee and compensation committee, and qualified executive officers.


	 




	The Company is subject to the 15(d) reporting
	requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which does not require a company to file all the same reports and information
	as fully reporting company.




	 


	Pursuant to Section 15(d), we are required
	to file periodic reports with the SEC, such as annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports
	on Form 8-K, once our registration statement is declared effective, including the annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
	during which the registration statement is declared effective. That filing obligation will generally apply even if our reporting
	obligations have been suspended automatically under section 15(d) of the Exchange Act prior to the due date for the Form 10-K.


	  


	After that fiscal year and provided the Company
	has less than 300 shareholders, the Company is not required to file these reports. If the reports are not filed, the investors
	will have reduced visibility as to the Company and its financial condition. In addition, as a filer subject to Section 15(d) of
	the Exchange Act, the Company is not required to prepare proxy or information statements; our common stock will not be subject
	to the protection of the going private regulations; the Company will be subject to only limited portions of the tender offer rules;
	our officers, directors, and more than ten (10%) percent shareholders are not required to file beneficial ownership reports about
	their holdings in our Company; that these persons will not be subject to the short-swing profit recovery provisions of the Exchange
	Act; and that more than five percent (5%) holders of classes of your equity securities will not be required to report information
	about their ownership positions in the securities.


	 


	 


	 






	 



	15



	 







	 




	 




	We will not be required to evaluate our
	internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act until the end of the second fiscal year reported
	upon in our second annual report on Form 10-K.




	 


	The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the new
	rules subsequently implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commissions, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”)
	and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board have imposed various new requirements on public companies, including requiring
	changes in corporate governance practices.


	 


	We expect these rules and regulations to increase
	our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time-consuming and costly. These costs could affect profitability
	and our results of operations.


	 


	We are in the process of determining whether
	our existing internal controls over financial reporting systems are compliant with Section 404. We will not be required to conduct
	the evaluation of effectiveness of our internal controls until the end of the fiscal year reported upon in our second annual report
	on Form 10-K. In addition, because we are a smaller reporting company, we are not required to obtain the auditor attestation of
	management’s evaluation of internal controls over financial reporting. If we obtain and disclose such reports we could continue
	doing so at our discretion so long as we remain a smaller reporting company.


	 


	This process of internal control evaluation
	and attestation may divert internal resources and will take a significant amount of time, effort and expense to complete. If it
	is determined that we are not in compliance with Section 404, we may be required to implement new internal control procedures and
	re-evaluate our financial reporting. If we are unable to implement these changes effectively or efficiently, it could harm our
	operations, financial reporting or financial results, which could adversely affect our ability to comply with our periodic reporting
	obligations under the Exchange Act.


	 




	There is a very limited public (trading)
	market for our common stock and; therefore, our investors may not be able to sell their shares.




	 


	Our common stock is listed on the over-the-counter
	exchange, and is thinly traded. As a result, stockholders may be unable to liquidate their investments, or may encounter considerable
	delay in selling shares of our common stock. If an active trading market does develop, the market price of our common stock is
	likely to be highly volatile due to, among other things, the nature of our business and because we are a new public company with
	a limited operating history. Further, a few individual stockholders dominate our shares. The limited trading volume subjects the
	price of our common stock to manipulation by one or more stockholders and will significantly limit the number of shares that one
	can purchase or sell in a short period of time. The market price of our common stock may also fluctuate significantly in response
	to the following factors, most of which are beyond our control:


	 




	 



	·




	variations in our quarterly and annual operating results;





	 



	·




	changes in general economic conditions;





	 



	·




	changes in technologies favored by consumers;





	 



	·




	price competition or pricing changes by us or our competitors; and





	 



	·




	the addition or loss of key managerial and collaborative personnel.





	 


	The equity markets have, on occasion, experienced
	significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices for many companies' securities and that have often
	been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. Any such fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of
	our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. As a result, stockholders may be unable to sell their shares,
	or may be forced to sell them at a loss.




	 






	Our common stock has not been widely
	traded, and the price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially.




	 


	To date, there has been a limited public market
	for shares of our common stock, with limited trading. An active public trading market may not develop or, if developed, may not
	be sustained. The current market price of our common stock and any possible subsequent listing on another larger securities exchange,
	if and when we are successful in doing so, will be affected by a number of factors, including those discussed above.


	 


	 


	 






	 



	16



	 







	 




	 




	Future sales of our common stock by existing
	stockholders could cause our stock price to decline.




	 


	If our existing stockholders sell substantial
	amounts of our common stock in the public market, then the market price of our common stock could decrease significantly. The perception
	in the public market that our stockholders might sell shares of common stock also could depress the market price of our common
	stock. There are approximately 34,574,706 shares of our common stock outstanding, of which approximately 610,000 shares are currently
	freely tradable. We may in the future issue and register additional shares of our common stock that might be freely transferable
	at the time of such transaction.


	 


	A decline in the price of shares of our common
	stock might impede our ability to raise capital through the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or other equity securities.




	 






	We do not intend to pay dividends and there will be less ways
	in which you can make a gain on any investment in Focus Universal Inc.




	 


	We have never paid any cash dividends and currently
	do not intend to pay any dividends for the foreseeable future. To the extent that we require additional funding currently not provided
	for in our financing plan, our funding sources may likely prohibit the payment of a dividend. Because we do not intend to declare
	dividends, any gain on an investment in Focus Universal Inc. will need to come through appreciation of the stock’s price.


	 




	You may face significant restrictions on the resale of your
	shares due to state “blue sky” laws.




	 


	Each state has its own securities laws, often
	called “blue sky” laws, which (1) limit sales of securities to a state’s residents unless the securities are
	registered in that state or qualify for an exemption from registration, and (2) govern the reporting requirements for broker-dealers
	doing business directly or indirectly in the state. Before a security is sold in a state, there must be a registration in place
	to cover the transaction, or it must be exempt from registration. The applicable broker-dealer must also be registered in that
	state.


	 


	We do not know whether our securities will
	be registered or exempt from registration under the laws of any state. A determination regarding registration will be made by those
	broker-dealers, if any, who agree to serve as market makers for our common stock. There may be significant state blue sky law restrictions
	on the ability of investors to sell, and on purchasers to buy, our securities. You should therefore consider the resale market
	for our common stock to be limited, as you may be unable to resell your shares without the significant expense of state registration
	or qualification.


	 




	Focus Universal is an “emerging
	growth company” under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act. We cannot be certain if the reduced reporting requirements
	applicable to emerging growth companies will make our shares of common stock less attractive to investors.




	 


	Focus Universal is and will remain an "emerging
	growth company" until the earliest to occur of (a) the last day of the fiscal year during which its total annual revenues
	equal or exceed $1 billion (subject to adjustment for inflation), (b) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary
	of its initial public offering, (c) the date on which Focus Universal has, during the previous three-year period, issued more than
	$1 billion in non-convertible debt securities, or (d) the date on which Focus Universal is deemed a "large accelerated filer"
	(with at least $700 million in public float) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act”).


	 


	For so long as Focus Universal remains an "emerging
	growth company" as defined in the JOBS Act, it may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements
	that are applicable to other public companies that are not "emerging growth companies" as described in further detail
	in the risk factors below. Focus Universal cannot predict if investors will find its shares of common stock less attractive because
	Focus Universal will rely on some or all of these exemptions. If some investors find Focus Universal's shares of common stock less
	attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for its shares of common stock and its stock price may be more
	volatile.


	 


	If Focus Universal avails itself of certain
	exemptions from various reporting requirements, its reduced disclosure may make it more difficult for investors and securities
	analysts to evaluate Focus Universal and may result in less investor confidence.


	 


	 


	 






	 



	17



	 







	 






	 


	The recently enacted JOBS Act is intended to
	reduce the regulatory burden on "emerging growth companies". Focus Universal meets the definition of an "emerging
	growth company" and so long as it qualifies as an "emerging growth company," it will not be required to:


	 




	 



	·




	have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;





	 



	·




	comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (i.e., an auditor discussion and analysis);





	 



	·




	submit certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes, such as “say-on-pay” and “say-on-frequency;” and





	 



	·




	disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the CEO’s compensation to median employee compensation.





	 


	In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also
	provides that an "emerging growth company" can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B)
	of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an "emerging growth company"
	can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. However,
	Focus Universal is choosing to "opt out" of such extended transition period, and as a result, Focus Universal will comply
	with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging
	growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that its decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying
	with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.


	 


	Notwithstanding the above, we are also currently
	a “smaller reporting company”, meaning that we are not an investment company, an asset-backed issuer, or a majority-owned
	subsidiary of a parent company that is not a smaller reporting company and have a public float of less than $75 million and annual
	revenues of less than $50 million during the most recently completed fiscal year.


	 


	In the event that we are still considered a
	“smaller reporting company”, at such time are we cease being an “emerging growth company”, we will be required
	to provide additional disclosure in our SEC filings. However, similar to “emerging growth companies”, “smaller
	reporting companies” are able to provide simplified executive compensation disclosures in their filings; are exempt from
	the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requiring that independent registered public accounting firms provide
	an attestation report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting; are not required to conduct say-on-pay
	and frequency votes until annual meetings occurring on or after January 21, 2013; and have certain other decreased disclosure obligations
	in their SEC filings, including, among other things, only being required to provide two years of audited financial statements in
	annual reports. Decreased disclosures in our SEC filings due to our status as an “emerging growth company” or “smaller
	reporting company” may make it harder for investors to analyze the Company’s results of operations and financial prospects.

	to take advantage of, the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, we caution
	readers regarding certain forward-looking statements in the following discussion and elsewhere in this report and in any other
	statement made by, or on our behalf, whether or not in future filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Forward-looking
	statements are statements not based on historical information and which relate to future operations, strategies, financial results
	or other developments. Forward-looking statements are necessarily based upon estimates and assumptions that are inherently subject
	to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control and many
	of which, with respect to future business decisions, are subject to change. These uncertainties and contingencies can affect actual
	results and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by, or
	our behalf. We disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements.



	 



	Narrative Description of the Business 

	 


	 


	Focus Universal Inc. (“the Company”,
	“we”, “us” or “our”) currently conducts business as a handheld sensor systems and filters wholesaler
	to distribution platforms. We are working on developing a universal sensor node and gateway system that use the data processing

	capabilities

	of a smartphone to display readings of multiple probe
	modules. We are also researching the development of an anti-counterfeit authentication technology that we believe could address
	the problem of counterfeit production by attempting to authenticate consumer goods.


	 


	Through a merger with Perfecular Inc., we strategically
	expanded our business to the manufacture and marketing of high-tech electronic devices. We realized that Internet marketing would
	not be sufficient to generate sales of our products, particularly the Ubiquitor product. We are going to focus on all types of
	marketing, particularly marketing directly to established consumer distributions

	retailers

	.
	For this reason, during the first quarter of 2016 we decided to emphasize our sales of handheld sensors and air filters and discontinue
	our marketing and advertising business segment. Through the development and creation of our Ubiquitor device, we anticipate that
	sales and marketing involved with bringing this product to market will require us to hire a number of new employees in order to
	gain traction in the market as well as continue to expand such sales of our existing sensor and air filter products.


	 



	Our current services include:

	 



	 





	Scientific Instrument Research and Development
	and Sales



	 




	 



	Engineers and scientists use instrumentation
	to observe, understand, and manage real-world data and phenomena, events, and processes related to their industries or areas of
	expertise. Instrumentation systems that we are researching and developing measure and control electrical signals, such as voltage,
	current and power, as well as temperature, pressure, speed, flow, volume, torque, light sensing, and vibration for example. Common
	general-purpose instruments in our market segment include, for example, voltmeters, signal generators, oscilloscopes, data loggers,
	spectrum analyzers, cameras, and temperature and pressure monitors and controllers. Systems that perform measurement and control
	can be generally categorized as test, measurement, and embedded systems.

	A New Approach to Measurement and Sensing





	 



	We offer a different approach than what is
	currently on the market because we are attempting to establish a demand for devices that link handheld devices and sensors with
	common smartphone computing power through an application on the smartphone in both IOS and Android devices. Tapping into the computing
	power of a smartphone enables a measurement device to increase its capabilities.


	 


	We also offer an array of traditional handheld
	measurement and control meters through our wholesale distribution platform.


	 




	Filter and Handheld Meter Wholesaler




	 


	We are a wholesaler of various filtration products
	and digital meters. We source our products from manufacturers in China and then sell to a major U.S. distributor who resells our
	products directly to consumers through retail distribution channels.


	Specifically, we sell the following products:


	 



	Fan Speed Adjuster device

	. We provide
	a fan speed adjuster device to retailers and distributors. Designed specifically for centrifugal fans with brushless motors, our
	adjuster device helps ensure longer life by preventing damage to fan motors by adjusting the speed of centrifugal fans without
	causing the motor to hum. These devices are rated for 350 watts max, have 120VAC voltage capacity and feature an internal, electronic
	auto-resetting circuit breaker.


	 



	Carbon filter devices

	. We also sell
	two types of carbon filter devices to distributors. These Carbon filter devices are professional grade filters specifically designed
	and used to filter air in greenhouses that might be polluted by fermenting organics. One of these filters can be attached to a
	centrifugal fan to scrub the air in a constant circle or can be attached to an exhaust line as a single pass filter, which moves
	air out of the growing area and filters unwanted odors and removes pollens, dust, and other debris in the air. The other filter
	is designed to be used with fans from 0-6000 C.F.M.


	 



	HEPA filtration device

	. We provide an
	organic air high efficiency particulate arrestance (“HEPA”) filtration device at wholesale prices to distributors and
	retailers. Manufactured, tested, certified, and labeled in accordance with current HEPA filter standards, this device is targeted
	towards greenhouses and grow rooms and designed to keep insects, bacteria, and mold out of grow rooms. We sell these devices in
	various sizes.


	 



	Digital light meter

	. We provide a handheld
	digital light meter that is used to measure luminance in fc units, or foot-candles. The meter we sell is designed to be full cosine
	corrected for the angular incidence of light (meaning if you are not holding the sensor perpendicular to the light source, the
	sensor will still read the light correctly). The meter has a built-in low battery indicator and is designed to accurately measure
	to 40,000 FC.


	 



	Quantum par meter

	. We provide a handheld
	quantum par meter used to measure photosynthetically active radiation (“PAR”). This fully portable handheld PAR meter
	is designed to measure PAR flux in wavelengths ranging from 400 to 700 nm. It is designed to measure up to 10,000 umol.


	 




	Ubiquitor Wireless Universal Sensor Device




	 


	We have fully researched and developed a device
	we call the “Ubiquitor,” which is a handheld fully modular system with a universal sensor node and gateway system that
	uses a smartphone as the output display module that displays the readings of various probe modules. We have completed an initial
	production run of 1,000 devices and intend to develop this into full-scale production as soon as possible. The Ubiquitor is a wireless
	sensor device that combines measuring tools with smartphone technology to quickly deliver sensor node data on desktop and mobile
	phone screens. The Ubiquitor’s sensor analytics system will integrate event-monitoring, storage and analytics software in
	a cohesive package that we hope will provide a holistic view of sensor data it is reading.


	 


	After sending our circuit boards to China for
	soldering at an unaffiliated manufacturing facility, we assembled the initial production run at our facilities here in the City
	of Industry. This initial production run will allow us to show large distributors and consumers the capabilities of the Ubiquitor
	which we hope will generate demand.


	 


	 






	 



	21



	 







	 




	 


	The physical hardware consists of:


	 




	 



	1.




	The sensor probes, which come in hundreds of different varieties of sensor instruments in the form of a USB stick, with both male and female ports; and





	 




	 



	2.




	The main hardware gateway, a small cell phone size device with integrated circuits.





	 


	This device is intended to connect up to 2.5
	kilometers of sensor instruments, and integrate data using embedded software to display the data and all analytics onto a digital
	screen (desktop or mobile displays) using multiple types of wireless connections (i.e., Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, 3G and 4G). Most types
	of probes can connect to the hardware. If the sensor size is bigger than the standard probe size, it is possible to simply use
	a USB cable to connect the probe and the hub. All data and analytics are displayed on a single screen, with tools that record and
	keep track of all measurements, and sort and display analytic information in easy to read charts.


	 


	The Ubiquitor is a general platform that collects
	data in real time, up to 100hz per second, and thus is intended to be adapted to many industry uses.


	 


	The Ubiquitor is a multipurpose wireless intelligent
	sensor device that will be intended to achieve universal compatibility. Currently, the Ubiquitor device could simultaneously accommodate
	more than 256 different types of sensor heads. Users could use their smartphones to simultaneously operate and monitor over 256
	kinds of sensor readings. With Perfecular’s technology, users only need to obtain the sensor heads, facilitating ease and
	convenience of use. Using a smartphone, users can collect and analyze data in real time. We have not yet started research and development
	of a second generation Ubiquitor device, but once we demonstrate the market for this product intend to begin such research and
	development.


	 




	Intellectual Property Protection




	 


	On November 4, 2016 we filed a U.S. patent
	application number 15/344,041 with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. We hope this full patent application protects the Ubiquitor
	universal sensor device. It is anticipated that the publication will occur on July 20, 2017. We do not own, either legally or beneficially,
	any trademarks.


	 




	Competitors




	 


	There are several competitors we have identified in the wireless
	sensor node industry, including traditional instruments or devices manufacturers such as Hanna Instruments or Extech Instruments.


	 


	Hach developed and launched SC1000 Multi-parameter Universal Controller,
	a probe module for connecting up to 8 SC sensors and their products are not compatible with smart phones yet and we believe their
	price-point is still prohibitive to consumers.


	 


	Monnit Corporation offers a range of wireless or remote sensors.
	Many of Monnit’s products are web-based wireless sensors usually are not portable because of the power consumption. Also,
	the sensors real-time updates are slow and we believe security of the web-based sensor data acquisition also may be a concern.
	In addition to purchasing the device, consumers usually have to pay monthly fee for using web-based services.


	 


	We are not trying to compete with traditional instruments or device
	manufacturers because we utilize our Ubiquitor universal smart device in conjunction with our generic instruments smartphone application,
	which we believe will be a completely different product category.


	 




	Market Potential




	 


	We believe that wireless universal smart technology will play a
	critical role for traditional instrument manufacturers, as it is too expensive and difficult to develop for medium or smaller companies.
	The cost factor is the first consideration when deciding whether a company wants to develop smart wireless technologies and implement
	them in their products or use them in their field testing. We also hope to play a role in academic laboratories, particularly with
	smaller academic laboratories who are sensitive to price.

	Results of Operations



	 




	For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 compared to
	the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 (unaudited)




	 



	Revenue, cost of sales and gross profit



	 


	Our consolidated gross revenue for the twelve
	months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $337,496 and $17,848, respectively. Our cost of revenues for the twelve months ended
	December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $57,128 and $7,775, respectively, resulting in a gross profit of $280,368 and $10,073 for the twelve
	months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 


	 


	For the twelve months ended December 31, 2015,
	we only generated revenue from search engine optimizating consulting, internet campaign planning and social media consulting. For
	twelve months ended December 31, 2016, besides our digital marketing business, we also generated significant amount of revenue
	from sales of broad selection of garden equipment which was the primary business for Perfecular and is now our primary business.


	 


	We hired an independent third party contractor
	who performed web development beginning in the first quarter of 2015. This service was terminated on April 30, 2016 as we discontinued
	offering digital marketing services.  


	 


	The increase in revenue is primarily driven
	by the sales from Perfecular of $335,716 for twelve months ended December 31, 2016. Since the acquisition of Perfecular on December
	30, 2015, our revenues have increased and we believe that such revenues could continue to increase as we continue to market and
	sell our products.


	 


	Prior to the merger with Perfecular, management
	was focused on pursuing growth strategies and opportunities and outsourced the performance of Internet marketing services to third
	parties rather than performing the Internet marketing services directly. This change in strategy cost more money and generated
	less immediate revenue. Post-merger, we have been able to distribute a full range of products held as inventory by a related party,
	Tianjin Guanglee, directly to a range of businesses who have established distribution channels directly with consumers.

	The increase in our operating costs for twelve
	months ended December 31, 2016, compared to twelve months ended December 31, 2015, was due to an increase in expenses related
	to implementation of our business plan, research and development, officer compensation, and professional fees. General and administrative
	expenses of $257,375 represent office rent $67,700 (December 31, 2015: $25,409), employees’ salary expenses of $101,880
	(December 31, 2015: $0), and payroll tax expenses of $36,547 (December 31, 2015: $0). Officer’s compensation expenses of
	$121,385 (December 31, 2015: $0). Professional fees represent audit and accounting fees of $78,754 (December 31, 2015: $20,950)

	Due to the merger with Perfecular Inc. we anticipate
	that for the next twelve months we will be generating cash from more diversified revenue stream as mentioned under Item 1, Company
	Background. We believe that our cash generated from operations and cash on hand will provide sufficient capital to fund our operations
	and meet our cash needs on a short term and long-term basis for the next twelve months. We intend to finance our internal growth
	with cash on hand, cash provided from operations, borrowings, debt or equity offerings, or some combination thereof to expand our
	business so that we can meet our cash needs.


	 




	Cash Flows from Operating Activities




	 


	Our cash flows from operating activities represent
	the most significant source of funding for our operations. The primary use of our operating cash include funding general operating
	expenses (marketing, travel, legal and professional expenses, and office rent) and cost of revenues. Our cash provided by operating
	activities generally follows the trend in our net revenues and operating results.


	 


	Our net cash generated by operating
	activities of $(399,323) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 was primarily the result of our net loss of $440,905 largely
	offset for cash flow purposes by changes in our operating assets and liabilities. These changes include an increase in accounts
	receivable of $70,993, prepaid expense of $6,999, accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $95,511, and depreciation expense
	of $1,130; and a reduction in inventories of $53,258, customer deposits of $82,303, and deferred rent of $443. The increase in
	accounts receivable, inventories, accounts payable and accrued expense, and customer deposit was due to the merger with Perfecular
	Inc. on December 31, 2015. The increase of prepaid expenses was due to the payment of $10,000 annual fees to OTC Markets Group
	Inc. that covers a period from September 1, 2016 to August 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2016, the Company expensed a portion of
	these fees in the amount of $3,333. The increase in deposits was due to security deposits paid for sub-lease agreement with a
	tenant.


	 


	 


	 






	 



	24



	 







	 




	 


	The net cash used in operating activities of
	$81,182 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 was primarily the result of our net loss of $145,186, and changes in our
	operating assets and liabilities. These changes include an increase in customer deposit of $140,029, and accounts payable and accrued
	liabilities of $288,148; a reduction in accounts receivable to a related party of $106,889, inventories of $51,574, and deposits
	of $24,726.


	 


	We expect that cash provided by (used in) operating
	activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors including fluctuations in our net revenues and operating
	results, utilization of new revenue streams, collection of accounts receivable, and timing of billings and payments.


	 




	Cash Flows from Investing Activities




	 


	The net cash used in investing activities of
	$8,239 and $1,640 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, represents funds used to purchase furniture
	for the Company.


	  




	Cash Flows from Financing Activities




	 


	Perfecular borrowed a loan of $63,369 during
	the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, from a related party entity, Vitashower, Corp., which is under common ownership and
	management. The loan was repaid during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016.


	 


	 On December 30, 2015, the Company issued
	27,994,706 shares of common stock to shareholders of Perfecular Inc. to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of Perfecular’s
	common stock in 47.6333 to one exchange ratio. Total proceeds received from this transaction amounted to $669,433.


	  


	Management expects to keep operating costs
	to a minimum until cash is available through financing or operating activities. Management plans to continue to seek, in addition
	to equity financing, other sources of financing (e.g. bank loan, line of credit, shareholder loan) on favorable terms; however,
	there are no assurances that any such financing can be obtained on favorable terms, if at all. If we are unable to generate profits
	sufficient to cover our operating costs or unable to obtain additional funds for our working capital needs, we may need to cease
	or curtail operations. Furthermore, there is no assurance the net proceeds from any successful financing arrangement will be sufficient
	to cover cash requirements during the initial stages of the Company’s operations.


	 



	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements



	 


	We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that
	have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues
	or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to stockholders.

	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC
	ACCOUNTING FIRM



	 


	 


	To the Board of Directors and


	Stockholders of Focus Universal Inc.


	 


	We have audited the accompanying balance sheets
	of Focus Universal Inc. as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’
	equity, and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2016 and nine months ended December 31, 2015. Focus Universal Inc.’s
	management is responsible for these financial statements. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements
	based on our audits.


	 


	We conducted our audits in accordance with
	the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform
	the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The company
	is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included
	consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the
	circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over
	financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
	the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made
	by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
	basis for our opinion.


	 


	In our opinion, the financial statements referred
	to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Focus Universal Inc. as of December 31, 2016 and 2015,
	and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2016 and nine months ended December 31, 2015,
	in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

	This represents over 90% of the Company’s outstanding common stock and therefore represents a change in control of the Company’s
	ownership.


	 


	Effective immediately on December 29, 2014,
	Ms. Popova resigned as Chief Executive Officer and President of the Company and Ms. Ignatenko resigned as Treasurer, Secretary,
	Chief Financial Officer, principal accounting officer, and principal financial officer of the Company. Upon such resignations,
	Desheng Wang was appointed as the Chief Executive Officer and Secretary of the Company, Xu Tang was appointed as the President
	of the Company, Yan Chen was appointed as the Senior Vice President, and Messrs. Wang, Tang, and Chen accepted such appointments.



	 



	On October 21, 2015, Xu Tang entered into a
	stock purchase agreement whereby Mr. Tang collectively sold his entire 3,260,000 shares of the Company’s Common Stock to
	eight persons using private funds to purchase the shares. This represents 49.5% of the Company’s outstanding common stock
	and represents a material change in control of the Company’s ownership. Buyers include Shuqin Xu (who now owns 19.7% of the
	Company), Tianzeng Xu and Youjuan Xion (who now each own 7.5% of the Company) and five other unrelated persons. To the Company’s
	knowledge, there are no arrangements or understandings among members of both the former and new control groups and their associates
	with respect to election of directors or other matters.


	 


	Effective October 21, 2015, Xu Tang and Yan
	Chen resigned from their positions as President and Senior Vice President, respectively, of the Company. There are no disagreements
	between the Company and Messrs. Tang and Chen. Dr. Edward Lee has been appointed to serve as President of the Company.


	 


	Effective October 21, 2015, Dr. Jennifer Gu
	and Dr. Edward Lee were appointed as directors of the Company, and Dr. Gu and Dr. Lee accepted such appointments. Thereupon, each
	of Xu Tang and Yan Chen resigned as directors of the Company. Accordingly, the entire Board of Directors consists of Dr. Desheng
	Wang, Dr. Jennifer Gu, and Dr. Edward Lee.


	 


	On December 31, 2015, we filed Articles of
	Merger with the State of Nevada and filed a Certificate of Merger with the State of California which were the result of an agreement
	entered into on December 30, 2015, with a related party, Perfecular Inc., (“Perfecular”) a California corporation and
	FCUV Acquisition Corp., a Nevada corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, pursuant to which we agreed to acquire
	all of the issued and outstanding 587,712 shares of Perfecular’s common stock in exchange for the issuance of 27,994,706
	shares of the Company’s common stock to the shareholders of Perfecular Inc. in an exchange ratio of 47.6333 to one. This
	represents approximately 80% of the outstanding shares of the Company and represents a material change in control of the Company’s
	ownership.


	  


	Perfecular Inc. was found in September 2009
	and is headquartered in City of Industry, California, and is engaged in designing certain electronic products and sales of broad
	selection of garden equipment in North America and Europe.


	 



	Change in fiscal year



	 


	On December 11, 2015, the Board of Directors
	of the Company approved a change in the fiscal year end from a fiscal year end on March 31 to a calendar year end on December 31
	effective immediately.


	 


	The Company expects to make the fiscal year
	change on a prospective basis and will not adjust operating results for prior periods. The change to the Company’s fiscal
	year will not impact the Company’s calendar year results for the year ended December 31, 2015. While the change will have
	some impact on the prior year comparability of each of the fiscal quarters and annual periods in fiscal years prior to calendar
	year 2016 in future filings, the Company expects this impact will be minimal.

	Basis of Presentation





	 



	The accompanying consolidated
	financial statements include the accounts of Focus Universal Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Perfecular Inc. All intercompany
	balance sheet accounts, including receivable and payable have been eliminated upon consolidation. Due to the merger occurred on
	December 30, 2015, there was no business activity at Perfecular in 2015 to be consolidated since the merger. Therefore, the consolidated
	statements of operations and changes in stockholder’ equity (deficit) only reflect activities at Focus for all periods presented.
	The Company’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Please refer to Exhibit
	99.1 herein for additional information about Perfecular’s 2015 performance.


	 


	The Company filed Form 8-K dated December 11,
	2015, the Company changed its fiscal year end from March 31 to December 31. As a result, the Company is reporting a nine-month
	transition period ended December 31, 2015 in order to change its fiscal year to match the calendar year. Unaudited results for
	the nine-month period ended December 31, 2014 has been included for comparative purposes.



	 





	Cash and Cash Equivalents





	 



	The Company considers all highly liquid investments
	with a maturity of three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents. At times, such investments may be in excess of Federal
	Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insurance limit.



	 





	Concentrations of Credit Risk





	 



	Financial instruments that potentially subject
	the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents. The Company limits its exposure to
	credit loss by investing its cash with high credit quality financial institutions.



	 





	Fair Value of Financial Instruments




	 


	The Company follows paragraph 825-10-50-10
	of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments and paragraph 820-
	10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“Paragraph 820-10-35-37”) to measure the fair value of its
	financial instruments. Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value with U.S. GAAP, and expands disclosures
	about fair value measurements.



	 



	To increase consistency and comparability in
	fair value measurements and related disclosures, Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the
	inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three (3) broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest
	priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active


	markets for identical assets or liabilities
	and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three (3) levels of fair value hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37
	are described below:


	 




	 



	·




	Level 1: quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.





	 




	 



	·




	Level 2: pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date.





	 




	 



	·




	Level 3: Pricing inputs that are generally observable inputs and not corroborated by market data.





	 


	Financial assets are considered Level 3 when
	their fair values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques and at least one
	significant model assumption or input is unobservable.


	 


	The fair value hierarchy gives the highest
	priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable
	inputs. If the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within more than one level described above, the categorization
	is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument.

	Fair Value of Financial Instruments (continued)




	 


	The fair value hierarchy gives the highest
	priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable
	inputs. If the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within more than one level described above, the
	categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument.


	 


	The carrying amount of the Company’s
	financial assets and liabilities, such as cash and cash equivalent, prepaid expenses, accounts payable and accrued expenses, approximate
	their fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments.


	 


	Transactions involving related parties cannot
	be presumed to be carried out on an arm’s-length basis, as the requisite conditions of competitive, free-market dealings may not
	exist. Representations about transactions with related parties, if made, shall not imply that the related party transactions were
	consummated on terms equivalent to those that prevail in arm’s-length transactions unless such representations can be substantiated.


	 


	It is not however practical to determine the
	fair value of advances from stockholders, if any, due to their related party nature.


	 




	Inventories





	 



	Inventories consist primarily of electronic
	components, and are valued at the lower of cost or market.



	 





	Property and Equipment





	 



	Property and equipment are stated at cost.
	Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method. Estimated useful lives range from three to seven years on all categories
	of depreciable assets. The cost and accumulated depreciation of assets sold or retired are removed from the respective accounts
	and any gain or loss is included in earnings. Maintenance and repairs are expensed currently. Major renewals and betterments are
	capitalized.


	 




	Long Term Assets




	 


	Long-term assets of the Company are reviewed
	when circumstances warrant as to whether their carrying value has become impaired. The Company considers assets to be impaired
	if the carrying value exceeds the future projected cash flows from related operations. The Company also re-evaluates the periods
	of amortization to determine whether subsequent events and circumstances warrant revised estimates of useful lives.


	 




	Revenue Recognition





	 



	The Company applies paragraph 605-10-S99-1
	of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for revenue recognition. The Company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable
	and earned. The Company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive
	evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) the product has been shipped or the services have been rendered to the customer, (iii)
	the sales price is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured.


	 


	The Company derives its revenues from sales
	contracts with its customer with revenues being generated upon rendering of services. Persuasive evidence of an arrangement is
	demonstrated via invoice; service is considered provided when the service is delivered to the customers; and the sales price to
	the customer is fixed upon acceptance of the purchase order and there is no separate sales rebate, discount, or volume incentive.


	 


	Perfecular reports net revenue for its sales
	to third parties in accordance to the Financial Accounting Standard Board Accounting Standards Codification 605-45, because its
	primary business functions are marketing and sales of Tianjin Guanglee’s, (a related party) products. Perfecular does not
	carry any inventory of the products. While Tianjin Guanglee determines the product specifications and the sales prices, and bears
	physical loss risks during shipping. Perfecular collects full amount of accounts receivable from customers through direct wire
	transfers or letters of credit and remits payments to Tianjin Guanglee for the intercompany invoices with amounts net of the sales
	commissions. Commission revenue is recognized when the sales booked by Perfecular is recognized.

	Allowance for doubtful accounts




	 


	The Company provides an allowance for doubtful
	accounts equal to the estimated uncollectible amounts. The Company’s estimate is based on historical collection experience and
	a review of the current status of trade accounts receivable. It is reasonably possible that the Company’s estimate of the allowance
	for doubtful accounts will change. There was no allowance for doubtful accounts at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.


	 




	Advertising costs




	 


	Advertising costs are expensed as incurred.
	The Company recorded $3,736 and $0 advertising costs for the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.



	 





	Research and development




	 


	Research and development costs
	are expensed as incurred. Research and development costs primarily consist of efforts to refine existing product models
	and develop new product models. During 2016, our research and development costs totalled approximately $201,899,
	primarily for the research and development of the Ubiquitor device. Please refer to Exhibit 99.1 for additional information
	regarding the research and development costs incurred and recorded on Perfecular’s books.



	 





	Related Parties




	 


	The Company follows subtopic 850-10 of the
	FASB Accounting Standards Codification for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions.
	Pursuant to Section 850-10-20 the related parties include: a) affiliates of the Company; b) entities for which investments in their
	equity securities would be required, absent the election of the fair value option under the Fair Value Option Subsection of Section
	825–10–15, to be accounted for by the equity method by the investing entity; c) trusts for the benefit of employees,
	such as pension and profit-sharing trusts that are managed by or under the trusteeship of management; d) principal owners of the
	Company; e) management of the Company; f) other parties with which the Company may deal if one party controls or can significantly
	influence the management or operating policies of the other to an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented
	from fully pursuing its own separate interests; and g) other parties that can significantly influence the management or operating
	policies of the transacting parties or that have an ownership interest in one of the transacting parties and can significantly
	Influence the other to an extent that one or more of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate
	interests.


	 


	The consolidated financial statements shall
	include disclosures of material related party transactions, other than compensation arrangements, expense allowances, and other
	similar items in the ordinary course of business. However, disclosure of transactions that are eliminated in the preparation of
	consolidated financial statements is not required in those statements. The disclosures shall include: a. the nature of the relationship(s)
	involved; b. a description of the transactions, including transactions to which no amounts or nominal amounts were ascribed, for
	each of the periods for which income statements are presented, and such other information deemed necessary to an understanding
	of the effects of the transactions on the consolidated financial statements; c. the dollar amounts of transactions for each of
	the periods for which income statements are presented and the effects of any change in the method of establishing the terms from
	that used in the preceding period; and d. amounts due from or to related parties as of the date of each balance sheet presented
	and, if not otherwise apparent, the terms and manner of settlement.



	 





	Commitments and Contingencies





	 



	The Company follows subtopic 450-20 of the
	FASB Accounting Standards Codification to report accounting for contingencies. Certain conditions may exist as of the date the
	consolidated financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss to the Company but which will only be resolved when one
	or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Company assesses such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently
	involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company
	or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings, the Company evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or
	unasserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein.


	 


	 


	 






	 


	F-

	10



	 







	 




	 



	Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting
	Policies (continued)



	 


	If the assessment of a contingency indicates
	that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated
	liability would be accrued in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potential
	material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of
	the contingent liability, and an estimate of the range of possible losses, if determinable and material, would be disclosed.


	  


	Loss contingencies considered remote are generally
	not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantees would be disclosed. Management does not believe, based
	upon information available at this time that these matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial
	position, results of operations or cash flows. However, there is no assurance that such matters will not materially and adversely
	affect the Company’s business, financial position, and results of operations or cash flows.


	 




	Stock Based Compensation




	 


	The Company accounts for employee and non-employee
	stock awards under ASC 718, whereby equity instruments issued to employees for services are recorded based on the fair value of
	the instrument issued and those issued to non-employees are recorded based on the fair value of the consideration received or the
	fair value of the equity instrument, whichever is more reliably measurable.



	 



	No stock based compensation was issued or outstanding
	as of December 31, 2016 and 2015.


	 




	Income Tax Provision




	 


	Income taxes are accounted for using the asset
	and liability method. Deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences in recognizing certain income, expense and credit
	items for financial reporting purposes and tax reporting purposes. Such deferred income taxes primarily relate to the difference
	between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
	measured by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to the future years in which deferred tax assets or liabilities are
	expected to be settled or realized. There were no material deferred tax assets or liabilities as of December 31, 2016, and December
	31, 2015.


	 


	As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company
	did not identify any material uncertain tax positions. As of December 31, 2016, the Company’s returns are subject to examination
	by federal and state taxing authorities, generally for three years and four years, respectively, after they are filed.


	 


	The Company’s practice is to recognize
	interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. The Company has not filed its tax return for fiscal
	year ended March 31, 2015. Because the Company does not owe any income tax liability for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015,
	the possible penalty for late filing is immaterial to the consolidated financial statements, and the Company did not accrual for
	interest or penalties on the Company’s balance sheets at December 31, 2016 and 2015.


	 


	Perfecular has not completed a formal Section
	382 analysis regarding the limitation of net operating loss carryforwards. As such, Perfecular’s net operating loss carryforwards
	may be limited if an ownership change occurred. Perfecular plans to perform a formal Section 382 analysis if there is sufficient
	taxable income in the future years to begin utilizing its net operating loss carryforwards.


	 


	As of December 31, 2016, the cumulative federal
	and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $375,437 and $373,837 respectively. As of December 31, 2015, the cumulative
	federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $216,754 and $215,954, respectively. The cumulative operating
	loss carryforwards begin to expire in 2033.

	Net Income (Loss) Per Common Share





	 



	Net income (loss) per common share is computed
	pursuant to section 260-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Basic net income (loss) per common share is computed
	by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.


	 


	Diluted net income (loss) per common share
	is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and potentially outstanding
	shares of common stock during the period to reflect the potential dilution that could occur from common shares issuable through
	contingent shares issuance arrangement, stock options or warrants.


	 


	There were no potentially dilutive debt or
	equity instruments issued and outstanding at any time during the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.



	 





	Cash Flows Reporting





	 



	The Company adopted paragraph 230-10-45-24
	of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for cash flows reporting, classifies cash receipts and payments according to whether
	they stem from operating, investing, or financing activities and provides definitions of each category, and uses the indirect or
	reconciliation method (“Indirect method”) as defined by paragraph 230-10-45-25 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification
	to report net cash flow from operating activities by adjusting net income to reconcile it to net cash flow from operating activities
	by removing the effects of (a) all deferrals of past operating cash receipts and payments and all accruals of expected future operating
	cash receipts and payments and (b) all items that are included in net income that do not affect operating cash receipts and payments.
	The Company reports the reporting currency equivalent of foreign currency cash flows, using the current exchange rate at the time
	of the cash flows and the effect of exchange rate changes on cash held in foreign currencies is reported as a separate item in
	the reconciliation of beginning and ending balances of cash and cash equivalents and separately provides information about investing
	and financing activities not resulting in cash receipts or payments in the period pursuant to paragraph 830-230-45-1 of the FASB
	Accounting Standards Codification.


	 




	Subsequent Events





	 



	The Company follows the guidance in Section
	855-10-50 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for the disclosure of subsequent events. The Company will evaluate subsequent
	events through the date when the financial statements were issued. Pursuant to ASU 2010-09 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification,
	the Company as an SEC filer considers its financial statements issued when they are widely distributed to users, such as through
	filing them on EDGAR.



	 





	Recent Accounting Pronouncements





	 



	In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08,
	Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net).
	When another party is involved in providing goods or services to a customer, an entity is required to determine whether the nature
	of its promise is to provide the specified good or service itself (that is, the entity is a principal) or to arrange for that good
	or service to be provided by the other party (that is, the entity is an agent). An entity is a principal if it controls the specified
	good or service before that good or service is transferred to a customer. ASC 606 includes indicators to assist an entity in determining
	whether it controls a specified good or service before it is transferred to the customer. ASU 2016-08 clarifies the implementation
	guidance related to principal versus agent considerations and adds illustrative examples to assist in the application of the guidance.
	The amendments in ASU 2016-08 affect the guidance in ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which is not
	yet effective. The effective date and transition requirements in ASU 2016-08 are the same as the effective date and transition
	requirements of ASU 2014-09. ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date, defers
	the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year.

	Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting
	Policies (continued)



	 


	In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09—Compensation—Stock
	Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. The amendments in this guidance are relating
	to employee share-based compensation. Under the new guidance, we are required to recognize the tax effects of stock compensation
	as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement and treat the tax effects of exercised or vested awards as discrete items
	in the reporting period in which they occur. Excess tax benefits are required to be classified as operating activities, and shares
	we withhold on behalf of employees for tax purposes are required to be classified as financing activities. We may make an accounting
	policy election to continue to estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest or account for forfeitures when they occur.
	The threshold to qualify for equity classification permits withholding up to the maximum statutory tax rates. This guidance is
	required to be adopted in the first quarter of 2017. We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our consolidated
	financial statements.



	 



	In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15—Statement
	of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force).
	The amendments in this guidance on eight specific cash flow issues with regard to how cash receipts and cash payments are presented
	and classified in the statement of cash flows in order to clarify existing guidance and reduce diversity in practice. The guidance
	is required to be adopted in the first quarter of 2018 on a retrospective basis, unless it is impracticable to apply, in which
	case it should be applied prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating
	the impact this guidance will have on our consolidated statement of cash flows.


	 


	In January of 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01,
	“Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business.” The amendments in this guidance are clarifying
	the definition of a business to assist entities when determining whether an integrated set of assets and activities meets the definition
	of a business. The update provides that when substantially all the fair value of the assets acquired is concentrated in a single
	identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets, the set is not a business. The guidance is effective for fiscal years
	beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of this new guidance is not
	expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.


	 


	In January of 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04—Intangibles—Goodwill
	and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. The amendments in this guidance to eliminate the requirement
	to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill to measure goodwill impairment charge (Step 2). As a result, an impairment charge
	will equal the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the amount of goodwill
	allocated to the reporting unit. An entity still has the option to perform the qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine
	if the quantitative impairment test is necessary. The amendment should be applied on a prospective basis. The guidance is effective
	for goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for goodwill impairment
	tests performed after January 1, 2017. The impact of this guidance for the Company will depend on the outcomes of future goodwill
	impairment tests.


	 


	There were other updates recently issued. The
	Company does not believe that other than disclosed above, the recently issued, but not yet adopted, accounting pronouncements will
	have a material impact on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.



	 





	Use of estimates




	 


	In preparing the consolidated financial statements,
	management makes assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
	of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales
	and expenses during the reported periods. Management’s estimates are based on historical experience and on our expectations
	that are believed to be reasonable. The combination of these factors forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values
	of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from our current estimates
	and those differences may be material.


	 




	Reclassification





	 



	Certain items in December 31, 2016 and December
	31, 2015 financial statements have been reclassified to comply with the current period presentation. These reclassifications had
	no effect on previously reported net loss.

	Loan from related party




	 


	From time to time, Perfecular borrows from
	a related party entity, Vitashower Corp., which is under common ownership and management. At December 31, 2015, the outstanding
	loan and accrued interest payable to Vitashower totaled $63,369. This loan also bears an annual interest rate of 5%. This loan
	was repaid in full during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016.

	 




	 





	Sales & Purchase from related party





	 



	During 2016, Perfecular facilitated
	approximately $1,003,891 of sales to one customer, representing 90% of total annual sales. However, in accordance to the Financial
	Accounting Standard Board Accounting Standards Codification 605-45, the Company should report the net revenue of $216,186. Please
	refer to Revenue Recognition in Note 2 for additional information. 


	 


	Currently, Perfecular relies on one supplier
	in China, a related party manufacturer to supply all merchandise for its sales. Account payable to this vendor accounted
	for approximately 97% at December 31, 2016.

	Note 6 – Commitments and Contingencies




	 



	On March 31, 2015, Focus entered into a two-year
	industrial/commercial multi-tenant lease with P.G.A. Lawson Limited Partnership, whereby we leased a 9,745 square foot warehouse
	with a 2,415 square foot office space inside. The lease commenced on April 20, 2015 and ends on April 30, 2017, and is subject
	to renewal. We paid $7,699 per month until May 1, 2016 when the rent increased by 3% to $7,930 per month. The warehouse is located
	at 829 Lawson Street in the City of Industry, California. Rent expense under this lease will be recognized over the life of the
	lease term on a straight line basis. Straight-line monthly rent expense over the life of the lease will be $7,812. During twelve
	months ended December 31, 2016, the variance between the straight line rent expense and the rent paid/abated was recorded as deferred
	rent at December 31, 2016.


	 


	Focus sub-leases a portion of the property
	to Pefecular. The lease is a non-cancelable operating lease with monthly rent of $5,000. The lease commenced on May 1, 2015 and
	expires on April 30, 2017. The sublease income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 amounted to $60,000. Rental income
	and expense are eliminated on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.


	 


	Focus sub-leases a portion of the property
	to Cape Robbin Inc. The lease is a non-cancelable operating lease with monthly rent of $4,400. The lease commenced on July 1, 2016
	and expires on June 30, 2017. The sublease income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 amounted to $26,400.


	 


	Total rent expense was $67,700 and $65,409
	for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

	Item 9.  CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON
	ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE



	 


	None.



	 


	 







	Item 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES



	 



	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls




	 



	Our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial
	Officer, after evaluating the effectiveness of our "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in the Securities
	Exchange Act of 1934 Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the
	"Evaluation Date"), concluded that as of the Evaluation Date, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective
	to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange
	Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission
	rules and forms.


	 



	Changes in internal control over financial
	reporting.



	 


	There were no changes in our internal control
	over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that materially affected, or were reasonably likely to materially
	affect, our internal control over financial reporting.


	 



	Limitations on the Effectiveness of Internal
	Controls



	 


	Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter
	how well designed and implemented, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving an entity's disclosure objectives. The likelihood
	of achieving such objectives is affected by limitations inherent in disclosure controls and procedures. These include the fact
	that human judgment in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns in internal control can occur because of human failures
	such as simple errors or mistakes or intentional circumvention of the established process.


	 



	Management's Report on Internal Control
	over Financial Reporting



	 


	Our management is responsible for establishing
	and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting; as such term is defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
	Rule 13a-15(f). Our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based
	on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
	Commission ("1992 COSO Framework").


	 


	A material weakness is a deficiency or combination
	of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement
	of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.


	 


	Our management concluded
	we did not maintain effective controls over the Company’s financial reporting. The material weaknesses in our internal control
	over financial reporting, caused principally by inadequate staffing and technical expertise in key positions, resulted in overly
	relying on outside consultants to make numerous adjustments to our financial statements. Additionally, the significant deficiencies
	or material weaknesses could result in future material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements that would not be
	prevented or detected. Management has concluded that the identified control deficiency constitutes a material weakness.


	 


	This annual report does not include an attestation
	report of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management's
	report was not subject to attestation by the Company's independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the SEC
	that permit the company to provide only management's report on internal control in this annual report.


	 






	 



	26



	 







	 




	 



	Background and Remediation Plan



	 


	Management has determined
	that its processes and procedures over accounting and financial reporting are not adequate. As a result, the Company plans to implement
	a number of steps to remediate the material weakness discussed above and improve its internal control over financial reporting.
	Specifically, the following are planned: hiring additional qualified accounting personnel; reviewing all areas of the accounting
	process; strengthening controls and improving the reporting tools and quality of data used in the analysis of disclosures to review
	activities relevant to the financial reporting process.


	 


	Management believes
	that the measures described above should remediate the material weakness identified and strengthen the Company’s internal
	control over financial reporting. As the Company continues to evaluate and improve its internal control over financial reporting,
	additional measures to remediate the material weakness or modifications to certain of the remediation procedures described above
	may be necessary. The Company expects to complete the required remedial actions during 2016.

	(1) Applicable percentage of ownership is based
	on 34,574,706 shares of common stock outstanding on December 31, 2016.


	 


	Percentage ownership is determined based on
	shares owned together with securities exercisable or convertible into shares of common stock within 60 days of December 31, 2016,
	for each stockholder. Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the rules of the SEC and generally includes voting
	or investment power with respect to securities. Shares of common stock subject to securities exercisable or convertible into shares
	of common stock that are currently exercisable or exercisable within 60 days of December 31, 2016, are deemed to be beneficially
	owned by the person holding such securities for the purpose of computing the percentage of ownership of such person, but are not
	treated as outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person. Our common stock is our only
	issued and outstanding class of securities eligible to vote.


	 


	As of December 31, 2016 there were 25,400,000
	shares of common stock outstanding owned by our officers and directors.

	Advances to (from) related party





	 



	Prior to the merger, the Company granted
	advances to or from Perfecular Inc. from time to time, and the advances are non-interest bearing. Total advances from Perfecular
	amounted to $12,448 as of March 31, 2015. The entire balance was paid off in January, 2016.

	Loan from stockholders





	 



	On February 25, 2015, the Company borrowed
	$100,000 from a stockholder for working capital. The loan bears an interest rate of 5% annually. The loan is unsecured and is due
	on demand. The outstanding balance was $100,000 at March 31, 2015, with accrued interest payable of $479 as of March 31, 2015.
	The entire balance plus accrued interest was paid off in October, 2015.


	 


	From time to time, Perfecular has borrowed
	short-term loans from shareholders. At December 31, 2015, Perfecular has short-term loans payable totaled approximately $19,533.
	These loans are due upon the demand of the lender and were unsecured with annual interest rate of 0.55%. The entire balance plus
	accrued interest was paid off in February, 2016.



	 




	Loan from related party



	 


	On February 1, 2015, the Company borrowed $20,000
	from Perfecular. This loan is a demand loan payable upon the demand of the lender. The interest rate will accrue at 0.48% per annum
	and is unsecured. The outstanding balance for this loan was $20,000 and $0 at March 31,2015 and December 31, 2015, respectively.
	The entire balance plus accrued interest was paid off in June, 2016.


	 


	From time to time, Perfecular borrows from
	a related party entity, Vitashower Corp., which is under common ownership and management. At December 31, 2015, the outstanding
	loan and accrued interest payable to Vitashower totaled $63,369. This loan also bears an annual interest rate of 5 percent. The
	entire balance plus accrued interest was paid off in March, 2016.


	 


	Our management is involved in other business
	activities and may, in the future become involved in other business opportunities. If a specific business opportunity becomes available,
	such persons may face a conflict in selecting between our business and their other business interests. In the event that a conflict
	of interest arises at a meeting of our directors, a director who has such a conflict will disclose her interest in a proposed transaction
	and will abstain from voting for or against the approval of such transaction.


	 



	Director Independence



	 


	A director is not considered to be independent
	if he or she is also an executive officer or employee of the corporation.


	 


	Our director, Edward Lee, is also our President;
	our director Desheng Wang is also our Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Financial Officer. As a result, we have one independent
	director on our Board of Directors and that is Jennifer Gu.

	Perfecular, Inc. audited financial statements
	for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014




	 







	 





	 





	 



	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
	FIRM



	 


	 


	To the Board of Directors and


	Stockholders of Focus Universal Inc.


	 


	We have audited the accompanying balance sheets
	of Perfecular Inc. as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’
	equity, and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. Perfecular Inc.’s management is responsible
	for these financial statements. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.


	 


	We conducted our audits in accordance with
	the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform
	the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The company
	is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included
	consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the
	circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over
	financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
	the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made
	by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
	basis for our opinion.


	 


	In our opinion, the financial statements referred
	to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Perfecular Inc. as of December 31, 2015 and 2014,
	and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, in conformity
	with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

	NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS







	 







	Note 1 – Business operations


	 


	Perfecular, Inc. (the “Company”)
	was founded in September 2009 and is headquartered in City of Industry, California, and is engaged in designing certain electronic
	products and sales of broad selection of garden equipment in North America and Europe. Prior to November 2014, the Company was
	fully owned by a related party, Tianjin Guanglee Technologies Co., Ltd (Tianjin Guanglee), a China based manufacturer of commercial-used
	filter, tent and other electronic products.


	 



	Changes in control



	 


	On November 28, 2014, Desheng Wang, secretary
	and chief financial officer of the Company acquired the entire 100,000 shares of the Company’s Common Stock from Tianjin
	Guanglee in addition to his contribution of capital for $200,000 for additional 200,000 shares of the company’s common stock.
	Mr. Wang became the sole shareholder of the Company.


	 


	During 2015, the Company entered separate
	convertible note agreements with seven individuals and one entity, totaled $1,103,000. Prior to the merger with Focus Universal
	Inc. as discussed in the following paragraph, all aforementioned individuals and entity elected to exercise their rights to convert
	a total of $1,027,812 of the combined notes to 287,712 shares of common stock of the Company and forgave approximately total $72,687
	of loan balance. A remaining balance of $2,501 was paid off subsequently.


	 


	On December 30, 2015, the Company entered
	into a merger and equity exchange agreement with a related party, Focus Universal, Inc. (“Focus”). The entire common
	shares of the Company were exchanged for common shares of Focus at a ratio of 1:47.6333. Upon execution of the merger and equity
	exchange agreement, Perfecular became a wholly owned subsidiary of Focus.


	 



	Note 2 – Summary of significant
	accounting policies



	 



	Basis of presentation



	 


	The Company’s financial statements
	have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).


	 



	Revenue recognition



	 


	The Company applies paragraph 605-10-S99-1
	of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for revenue recognition for its sales to Vitashower, an entity related by certain
	common management and control. The Company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. The Company considers

	Revenue recognition (continued)



	 


	The Company reports net revenue for its
	sales to third parties in accordance to the Financial Accounting Standard Board Accounting Standards Codification 605-45, because
	its primary business functions are marketing and sales of Tianjin Guanglee’s products. It does not carry any inventory. While
	Tianjin Guanglee determines the products specifications and the sales prices, and bears physical loss risks during shipping. During
	the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company facilitated approximately $1,045,441 and $917,363 in purchase orders from
	customers and earned commission revenue of $230,679 and $132,360, respectively. The Company collects full amount of accounts receivable
	from customers through direct wire transfers or letters of credit and remits payments to Tianjin Guanglee for the intercompany
	invoices with amounts net of the sales commissions. Commission revenue is recognized when the sales booked by the Company is recognized.


	 



	Cash and cash equivalents



	 


	The Company considers all highly liquid
	investments with a maturity of three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents.


	 



	Allowance for doubtful accounts



	 


	The Company provides an allowance for doubtful
	accounts equal to the estimated uncollectible amounts. The Company's estimate is based on historical collection experience and
	a review of the current status of trade accounts receivable. It is reasonably possible that the Company's estimate of the allowance
	for doubtful accounts will change. Accounts receivable is presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $0 and $3,239
	at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.


	 



	Inventories



	 


	Inventories consist primarily of electronic
	components, and are valued at the lower of cost or market.


	 



	Property, plant and equipment



	 


	Property and equipment are stated at cost.
	Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives ranging from three to seven years for all
	categories of depreciable assets. Leasehold improvements are stated at cost and depreciation is computed on the straight-line method
	over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated lives of the assets. Software is stated at cost and is amortized on the straight-line
	method over the estimated lives ranging from one to five years.

	–

	Summary of significant
	accounting policies (continued)



	 



	Property, plant and equipment (continued)



	 


	The cost and accumulated depreciation of
	assets sold or retired are removed from the respective accounts and any gain or loss is included in earnings. Maintenance and repairs
	are expensed currently while major renewals and betterments are capitalized.


	 



	Research and development



	 


	Research and development costs are expensed
	as incurred. Research and development costs primarily consist of efforts to refine existing product models and develop new product
	models. Research and development expenses included in operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 amounted
	to $360,926 and 219,940, respectively.


	 



	Income taxes



	 


	The Company uses the asset and liability
	method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of temporary
	differences between tax bases and financial reporting bases of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is required if, based
	on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be
	realized.


	 



	Use of estimates



	 


	The preparation of financial statements
	in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
	amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Management believes that the estimates utilized in preparing
	its financial statements are reasonable and prudent. Actual results could differ from these estimates.


	 



	Recent Accounting Pronouncements



	 


	In November 2015, the Financial Accounting
	Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of
	Deferred Taxes, which will require entities to present deferred tax assets (DTAs) and deferred tax liabilities (DTLs) as noncurrent
	in a classified balance sheet. The ASU simplifies the current guidance, which requires entities to separately present DTAs and
	DTLs as current and noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. ASU 2015-17 is effective for financial statements issued for annual
	periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. The adoption of this guidance will
	eliminate the need to present DTAs as long-term and DTLs as current liabilities.

	Recent Accounting Pronouncements (continued)



	 


	In February 2016, the Financial Accounting
	Standards Board ("FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") ASU 2016-02 – Leases. The new standard
	establishes a right-of-use (“ROU”) model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the
	balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification
	affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning
	after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating
	the effect, if any, on its financial statements.


	 


	In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08,
	Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net). ASU 2016-08
	clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations under the new revenue recognition standard. The
	guidance includes indicators to assist an entity in determining whether it controls a specified good or service before it is transferred
	to the customers. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of the provision of ASU 2016-08 on its financial statements.


	 


	There were other updates recently issued.
	The Company does not believe that other than disclosed above, the recently issued, but not yet adopted, accounting pronouncements
	will have a material impact on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.


	 



	Note 3

	–

	Related party
	transaction



	 


	Prior to the merger, the shareholder borrows
	funds from the Company occasionally. At December 31, 2014, the Company had loans and accrued interest due from the shareholder
	totaled $394,872. Interest accrued at 5 percent annual rate. In 2015, the shareholder has repaid the entire loan balance.


	 


	The Company granted advances to or from
	Focus, Inc. from time to time, and the advances are non-interest bearing. Total advances to Focus amounted to $177,749 as of December
	31, 2015.


	 


	The Company had borrowed short-term loans
	from shareholders of the Company. At December 31, 2015, the Company has short-term loans payable totaled approximately $19,533.
	These loans are due upon the demand of the lenders and were unsecured with annual interest rate of 0.55%. Subsequently to year-end,
	the entire balance of these loans was paid off with accrued interest.


	 


	The Company from time to time borrows from
	a related party entity, Vitashower Corp., which is under common ownership and management. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the outstanding
	loan and accrued interest payable to Vitashower totaled $63,369 and $344,658, respectively. This loan also bears annual interest
	rate of 5 percent. This loan was paid off subsequent to year-end.

	NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


	 


	 



	Note 6 – Income taxes



	 


	The Company has implemented accounting
	standards related to income tax positions. In examining its tax positions under the new standards, the Company will assume the
	positions that will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority, and the taxing authority will have full knowledge of all relevant
	information. The technical merits of the Company’s tax positions are derived from sources of authorities in the tax law (legislation
	and statutes, legislative intent, regulations, rulings, and case law) and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of
	the tax positions. As of December 31, 2015, the Company’s returns are subject to examination by federal and state taxing
	authorities, generally for three years and four years, respectively, after they are filed. An uncertain income tax position will
	not be recognized if it has been a 50% likelihood of being sustained. There were no unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31,
	2015 and 2014.


	 


	The Company’s practice is to recognize
	interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. The Company had no accrual for interest or penalties
	on the Company’s balance sheets at December 31, 2015 or December 31, 2014, and has not recognized interest and/or penalties
	in the statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.


	 


	The Company has not completed a formal
	Section 382 analysis regarding the limitation of net operating loss carryforwards. As such, the Company’s net operating loss
	carryforwards may be limited if an ownership change occurred. The Company plans to perform a formal Section 382 analysis if there
	is sufficient taxable income in the future years to begin utilizing its net operating loss carryforwards.


	 


	As of December 31, 2015, the cumulative federal and state net
	operating loss carryforwards of approximately $637,000 and $634,000, respectively. As of December 31, 2014, the cumulative federal
	and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $416,000 and $413,000, respectively. The cumulative operating loss
	carryforwards begin to expire in 2034.


	 



	Note 7 – Subsequent event



	 


	On February 29, 2016, the Company repaid $63,369 of loan and
	any accrued interest back to Vitashower.


	 


	On February 29, 2016, the Company also
	repaid $19,533 of loans and any accrued interest back to shareholders.


	 


	The Company has evaluated all events that
	occurred after the balance sheet date through the date when the financial statements were issued to determine if they must be reported.
	The Management of the Company determined that other than as disclosed above, there were no reportable subsequent events to be disclosed.

*See Table above

Total offering expenses are approximately $6,348.  Of the $6,955, the amounts to
be paid from the proceeds for expenses of the offering are: $3,500 for audit and
accounting fees; $1,200 for filing fees; $600 for legal fees; $48 for 
registration fee; and $1,000 for transfer agent fees. We will use the rest of 
the funds (net of offering expenses) for paying off our current liabilities, 
hiring new personnel and implementation of our business plan. 

In the future, in addition to equity financing, we may rely on loans from our
Directors and officers to continue our operations; however, there are no
assurances that our Directors will provide us with any additional funds. 
Currently, we do not have any arrangements for additional financing.  If we are
not able to obtain needed financing and generate sufficient revenue from
operations, we may have to cease operations.


The online content and media market we participate in is new, rapidly evolving
and intensely competitive. Competition is expected to intensify in the future as
more companies enter the space. We compete for business on a number of factors
including return on marketing investment, price, access to targeted audiences
and quality.

Competition in the online advertising and marketing industry is also highly
fragmented. Any company that provides one or more of our core services is in
direct competition with us. Our competition includes Advertising Firms, Public
Relations Companies, Web Design Companies, Graphic Design Companies, and Search
Engine Optimization Firms.  Our competitors range in size from small, local
independent firms and individuals to very large conglomerates. Such
fragmentation can mean that a small business owner can employ more than one
advertising and marketing agency to get a needed mix of web design and online
marketing services for their desired budget. The online media marketing industry
is always evolving with thousands of new competitors entering the market every
year. It is becoming very difficult for companies to distinguish themselves in
the market and gain new customers.

In addition to competition from other firms, the number of potential customers
is decreasing as businesses begin to design their own websites and execute
inline advertising themselves. There are a large number of companies that
provide website templates that are easy to alter once purchased without the need
to hire a web design and development company. While basic coding knowledge is
needed to effectively customize a template and incorporate social management and
monitoring solutions to fit an individual business’s needs, many new businesses
are choosing to use an existing template versus paying for a new website design.


Company Description
We were formed on December 4, 2012. Focus Universal Inc. is a digital marketing
agency. We offer a full range of web services, including web marketing services,
social and viral marketing campaigns and search engine optimization (SEO)

business marketing, referrals and our primary website, www.focusuniversal.com,
which outlines our service offerings.
