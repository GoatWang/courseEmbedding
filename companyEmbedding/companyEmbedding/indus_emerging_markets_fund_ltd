Indus Capital Partners, LLC (with its affiliates, “Indus”) is an employee-owned international alternative investment management firm, offering long/short and long-only equity strategies investing primarily in the Asia Pacific region including Japan, and in emerging markets.
 
The firm was founded in 2000 by former Soros Fund Management partners who had worked together since 1995 and possess on average over 20 years’ investment experience in the Asia Pacific region.  In the aggregate, Indus manages approximately US$5.9 billion (as of April 1, 2017) for a diverse client base of over 300 investors, including foundations and university endowments, corporate and public pensions, high net worth individuals, family offices, sovereign wealth funds, and financial institutions. Indus is headquartered in New York, with offices in London, Hong Kong, Tokyo, San Francisco and Stamford. The firm currently has over 90 employees, over a third of whom are investment and trading professionals.
 
Indus aims to deliver high risk-adjusted annual returns throughout the investment cycle, capturing most of the upside in strong markets and preserving capital in difficult markets. Indus believes that stock picking based on rigorous fundamental analysis helps to generate positive returns over time. The investment team applies intensive analysis and research to exploit the inherent inefficiency of the markets in which it operates. Indus seeks to identify mispriced investment opportunities, and select uncorrelated and liquid investments that are chosen for their potential to generate alpha. Portfolio construction strategies endeavor to dampen the impact of market volatility. Risk management is an integral part of the firm’s investment philosophy, and involves both systems and culture.
 
Indus is registered as an investment adviser with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the U.S. and the Central Bank of Ireland - Financial Institutions and Funds Authorization. Overseas affiliates are regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority in the U.K., the Securities and Futures Commission in Hong Kong, the Central Bank of Ireland - Financial Institutions and Funds Authorization, and the Financial Services Agency in Japan.

 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fund’s annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate.

Important Disclosure

Unless otherwise stated, portfolio facts and statistics are shown for Class A shares; other classes may have different characteristics.

†NAV: Unless you are eligible for a waiver, the public offering price you pay when you buy Class A shares of the Fund is the Net Asset Value (NAV) of the shares plus an initial sales charge. The initial sales charge varies depending upon the size of your purchase.  No sales charge is imposed where Class A or Class C shares are issued to you pursuant to the automatic investment of income dividends or capital gains distributions. It is the responsibility of the financial intermediary to ensure that the investor obtains the proper “breakpoint” discount. Class C, Class I and Class Y do not have an initial sales charge; however, Class C does charge a contingent deferred redemption charge.  See the 
        
    prospectus and summary prospectus for more information.
1Van Eck Associates Corporation (the “Adviser”) has agreed to waive fees and/or pay Fund expenses to the extent necessary to prevent the operating expenses of the Fund (excluding acquired fund fees and expenses, interest expense, trading expenses, dividends and interest payments on securities sold short, taxes and extraordinary expenses) from exceeding 1.60% for Class A, 2.50% for Class C, 1.00% for Class I, and 1.10% for Class Y of the Fund’s average daily net assets per year until May 1, 2018. During such time, the
        expense limitation is expected to continue until the Board of Trustees acts to discontinue all or a portion of such expense limitation.

The Fund is subject to risks associated with investments in debt securities, derivatives, commodity-linked instruments, illiquid securities, asset-backed securities, CMOs and small or mid-cap companies. The Fund is also subject to inflation risk, short-sales risk, market risk, non-diversification risk and leverage risk. Please see the 
        
    prospectus and summary prospectus for information on these and other risk considerations.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The MSCI India Index (NDEUSIA) is designed to measure the performance of the large- and mid-capitalization segments of the Indian market, covering approximately 85% of companies in the Indian equity securities market.  One cannot invest directly in an Index.

If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95%.  The Fund’s Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with the Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse the Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

THE EVOLUTION

WHY INVEST?

HOW TO INVEST?
3 of 3













The Evolution of Emerging Markets

                The Emerging Market landscape has evolved significantly over the past few decades, creating a broader set of potential opportunities for investors.
            









Emerging Markets Defined





An Emerging Market economy is often defined as an economy with low to middle per capita income that is generally fast-growing. We believe a closer look at Emerging Markets reveals unexpected and distinctive characteristics.














 

 















 
 
 







Why Invest in Emerging Markets?

                We believe Emerging Markets offer the potential for competitive returns over the long term, across a variety of countries and industries, and represent an important diversifier for investor portfolios.
            









The Appeal of Emerging Markets





Emerging Markets possess a number of attractive attributes that we believe may contribute to strong future growth. Here are some of the reasons we find Emerging Markets compelling for the long-term investor.










Robust Debt Market



In our view, Emerging Market countries are better positioned today to withstand increasing funding costs of debt as a result of improved external imbalances and a more stable debt profile. As an example, public debt levels in some Emerging Market countries look favorable when compared to Developed Markets.

GDP Growth in Emerging Markets Outpaces Developed Markets



Emerging Markets have consistently demonstrated higher gross domestic product (GDP) growth than developed countries through past market cycles.





Source: IMF, 2016.






Diverse Emerging Market Equity Universe



The MSCI Emerging Markets Index has evolved since its 1988 inception. Today, it includes companies from 23 countries and 11 different sectors, providing investors with access to a robust opportunity set.

Growing Middle Class



Historically, a growing middle class has been a strong indicator of a country’s future economic growth. As the middle class expands, companies may benefit from growing consumer purchasing power and shifts in spending patterns.

Improving Education



In our view, as education standards across Emerging Market countries rise and access to education improves, productivity, employment and competition may also increase. This could further drive income and economic growth, consumption and expansion of the middle class.

Advances in Technology



We believe the advances in and the availability of new technologies are transforming the business models of companies across Emerging Markets and creating new potential opportunities for investors.

Growing Emerging Market Consumption



We believe rising wage growth, a large concentration of the Millennial population, access to higher-quality education and the proliferation of and access to technology are creating a new consumer market driven by mobility and connectivity.

Capture the Growth of Emerging Markets in Your Portfolio





Despite signs of strength in Emerging Markets, we believe many investors are under allocated to the asset class--potentially missing out on long-term opportunities.










Emerging Market Exposure



Many investors have a heavy home-country bias, meaning they tilt their allocations towards what's familiar. However, this bias may result in them missing out on a world of potential opportunity.

Emerging Market Equity



We believe many investors are under allocated to this asset class, despite the fact that Emerging Market economies contribute nearly one third of global GDP. This means that investors may be missing out on returns over the long term.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
