Rates, Fees & Our $1,000 Guarantee
We don't charge any lender fees, because you shouldn't have to pay to get a mortgage.
The only fee you would ever pay to RP Funding is rate discount costs, and only if You decide you want to buydown to an even lower interest rate.   Many clients will use the money they would have spent on Fees with other lenders and use it to buydown to an even lower interest rate.  Your credit manager can discuss all of these options with you and help you make the best decision.

How do we offer the Best Mortgage Rates in Florida?
We get asked this question often; it really comes down to business philosophy.  Most mortgage loan officers and brokers only close 1 - 2 loans per month, so to make a living they need to make thousands of dollars in commissions on each loan they close.  These commissions are earned through a combination of charging upfront fees and higher interest rates to earn "kick backs".  Not at RP Funding! Our loan officers are paid a base + bonus and they close 15 - 20 loans each month.  So instead of paying thousands of dollars in commissions on each loan, we only pay hundreds of dollars in salaries - and we pass this savings onto you in the form of the best mortgage rates possible and no lender fees.
Now you may be worried that you won't get as good of service from a loan officer who closes 10 - 15 times the industry average, but this isn't true (read more about why RP funding service is fast and great here).  We have found that 15 - 20 closings per month per credit manager is the optimal number to keep our costs and rates the lowest without sacrificing customer service.
 Our efficiency helps us offer the lowest rates. While other companies waste time and money shipping files all over the country, we do everything locally. You can read more about the differences this makes here.
Shopping for a mortgage can be hard work and confusing because of the numerous combinations of mortgage rates and fees and loan programs.  We set our mortgage rates low to make your decision easy. When you can get  Florida's best mortgage rates and fees from a local, Direct Mortgage Lender, why would you go anywhere else?

$1,000 Guarantee
While we are confident that our published rates and no lender fees are the most competitive in the industry, we do find rare instances where a competitor offers a better deal.  Our promise to you at RP Funding is that we will never let rates or fees stand in the way of you being able to work with your local Direct Mortgage Lender and take advantage of all the other benefits we offer.  If you receive a legitimate offer from a competitor that is lower, our promise to you is that we will match it, and if we can't we will give you $1,000.
Unfortunately we have found in most cases, when a competitor does offer a lower rate, it is part of a bait and switch.  Some unscrupulous companies will quote you anything over the phone and then when it comes time to give you the real figures (usually AFTER you have spent your hard earned money on an appraisal) the deal suddenly changes.  With RP Funding you can get the Best Deal on a Florida Mortgage and avoid any "bait and switch" or games.
In most cases the client came back to us when the "Bait and Switch" Occurred, or in some cases they were too far into the process and were stuck with a higher rate and fees because the "Bait and Switch" happened so far in the process they could not back out.
So beware when dealing with some unknown voice on the phone. If they do make a better offer than RP Funding, send us a copy and we will do our best to beat it.  If we can't beat it, we'll give you $1,000 when you actually close on their mortgage as disclosed - but from our experience, when we can't match it, it's just too good to be true.
Come down to our office, you can see that we are real people and a legitimate operation. Unfortunately the mortgage crises happened for a reason, and some of the people involved are still in our industry.  There are mortgage companies out there taking advantage of borrowers; working from home and ready to shut down and reopen under a new name when things start to catch up with them.  Our $1,000 Guarantee allows you to work with a local, reputable company that cares about this community, without missing out on the best possible deal.
As your Local Direct Mortgage Lender, our reputation in this community is important. While other "Discount" lenders may hit you with hidden fees and other last minute surprises... Not at RP Funding.

Rules and Restrictions for the $1,000 Guarantee

				HARP (Home Affordable Refinance Program), Freddie Mac RELIEF, and HomePath loans are not eligible for the $1,000 Guarantee.
			

No Adjustable Rate Mortgages. There are too many different variations of Indexes, Margins, Adjustment Periods and Rate Caps, we just could never offer them all.  So our $1,000 Guarantee only applies to Fixed Rate Mortgages.  Adjustable rate mortgages make up less than 5% of total Mortgage Volume, so our Guarantee applies to most mortgages.
			
* &dollar;1,000 Mortgage Challenge/Guarantee requires minimum &dollar;100,000 loan amount, but does not include Jumbo Loans, which are loans for &dollar;424,100 or larger, and applies to Fixed Rate Loans Only. Does not apply if borrower is declined by RP Funding for not meeting credit or income program guidelines. Borrower must provide Loan Estimate Disclosure to RP Funding from competing lender on the same day the competitor's terms were offered. Loan program offered by competitor must be a program RP Funding offers. Does not apply to prior locks or terms. RP Funding must have an opportunity to beat the terms. In the event that RP Funding is unable to beat the terms of the competing lender, borrower must provide the final executed Closing disclosure, the first page of mortgage note after closing and funding, and the lock-in agreement dated the same day terms were presented to RP Funding, all of which will be used to verify competing lender's terms have not changed at closing. The $1,000 Mortgage Challenge/Guarantee is not applicable if the loan closes on terms different than those detailed in the Loan Estimate Disclosure provided to RP Funding. Change in terms  include, but are not limited to, changes in loan amount, loan program, fees, discounts, lender credits, rate, APR, buydowns, years of term, origination, down payment, seller or any interested party credits, and within the time of the competitors initial lock in, or any other material loan changes not specifically mentioned here.

* $1,000 Mortgage Challenge/Guarantee requires a minimum loan amount of $100,000 and applies to Fixed Rate Loans only. This Challenge/Guarantee is not applicable to Jumbo Loans, which are loans for $424,100 and greater, and does not apply if borrower is declined by R P Funding for not meeting credit or income program guidelines.

Loan program offered by competitor must be a program R P Funding currently offers. This offer does not apply to prior locks or terms, and R P Funding must have an opportunity to beat the terms. In the event that R P Funding is unable to beat the terms of the competing lender, borrower must provide the final executed Closing disclosure, the first page of mortgage note after closing and funding, and the lock-in agreement dated the same day terms are presented to R P Funding, all of which will be used to verify competing lender's terms have not changed at closing. The $1,000 Mortgage Challenge/Guarantee is not applicable if the loan closes on terms different than those detailed in the Loan Estimate Disclosure provided to R P Funding. Change in terms include, but are not limited to, changes in loan amount, loan program, fees, discounts, lender credits, rate, APR, buy-downs, years of term, origination, down payment, seller or any interested party credits, and within the time of the competitor's initial lock in, or any other material loan changes not specifically mentioned here.

Raw Shorts – Florida Funders



























































Raw Shorts

Explainer videos & marketing animation are booming in popularity. Businesses recognize the power of these videos but find that producing high quality content is difficult, expensive & time consuming. Raw Shorts solves this problem with a DIY cloud-based explainer video builder. By eliminating those barriers to production businesses can start thinking about video beyond the “30 second promo spot” & instead how they can use video to communicate with their customers or employees throughout various touchpoints (top of the funnel, mid-funnel, lower funnel videos). In addition to the builder the company offers a creative marketplace that connects buyers with animators.

A time to be selective in the energy sector
    We believe a selective approach to the energy sector is important now, but do not advocate broad exposure across the industry in the current environment.

Data quoted is past performance and current performance may be lower or higher. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate, and shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.Risk Factors: The value of the Fund's shares will change, and you could lose money on your investment. An investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Investing in companies involved in one specified sector may be more risky and volatile than an investment with greater diversification. Investing in the energy sector can be riskier than other types of investment activities because of a range of factors, including price fluctuation caused by real and perceived inflationary trends and political developments, and the cost assumed by energy companies in complying with environmental safety regulations. These and other risks are more fully describe in the fund's prospectus. Not all funds or fund classes may be offered at all broker/ dealers.Index Description: S&P 1500 Energy Sector is an unmanaged index comprised of securities that represent the energy sector of the stock market. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.Performance results for some funds may include the effect of expense reduction arrangements. If those arrangements had not been in place, the performance results would have been lower.High recent returns are attributable, in part, to unusually favorable market conditions and may not be repeated or consistently achieved in the future.Fee Waiver and/or Expense Reimbursement: Through April 30, 2018, Ivy Investment Management Company (IICO), the Portfolio’s investment manager, Ivy Distributors, Inc. (IDI), the Portfolio’s distributor, and / or Waddell & Reed Services Company, doing business as WI Services Company (WISC), the Portfolio’s transfer agent, have contractually agreed to reimburse sufficient management fees, 12b-1 fees and / or shareholder servicing fees to cap the total annual ordinary portfolio operating expenses at 1.13%. Prior to that date, the expense limitation may not be terminated by WRIMCO, Waddell & Reed, WISC or the Board of Trustees.Pricing: All prices and year-to-date returns are based on closing quotes unless noted, as supplied to the NASDAQ by 6:00 p.m. Eastern time. YTD Prices can be updated 3 to 4 hours after the Daily Pricing information which can result in mismatching data.Style Analysis: The Morningstar Style Box reveals a fund's investment style. For equity funds the vertical axis shows the market capitalization of the stocks owned and the horizontal axis shows investment style (value, blend, or growth). For fixed-income funds, the vertical axis shows the credit quality of the bonds owned and the horizontal axis shows interest rate sensitivity as measured by a bond's effective duration. Morningstar seeks credit rating information from fund companies on a periodic basis (e.g., quarterly). In compiling credit rating information, Morningstar instructs fund companies to only use ratings that have been assigned by the following Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations (NRSROs): Moody's, Standard & Poor's, Fitch, and Egan-Jones. If two NRSROs have rated a security, fund companies are to report the lowest rating; if three or more NRSROs have rated the same security differently, fund companies are to report the rating that is in the middle. For example, if NRSRO X rates a security AA-, NRSRO Y rates the same security an A and NRSRO Z rates it a BBB+, the fund company should use the credit rating of 'A' in its reporting to Morningstar. PLEASE NOTE: Morningstar, Inc. is not itself an NRSRO nor does it issue a credit rating on the fund. An NRSRO rating on a fixed-income security can change from time-to-time. For credit quality, Morningstar combines the credit rating information provided by the fund companies with an average default rate calculation to come up with a weighted-average credit quality. The weighted-average credit quality is currently a letter that roughly corresponds to the scale used by a leading NRSRO. Bond funds are assigned a style box placement of "low", "medium", or "high" based on their average credit quality. Funds with a low credit quality are those whose weighted-average credit quality is determined to be less than "BBB-"; medium are those less than "AA-", but greater or equal to "BBB-"; and high are those with a weighted-average credit quality of "AA-" or higher. When classifying a bond portfolio, Morningstar first maps the NRSRO credit ratings of the underlying holdings to their respective default rates (as determined by Morningstar's analysis of actual historical default rates). Morningstar then averages these default rates to determine the average default rate for the entire bond fund. Finally, Morningstar maps this average default rate to its corresponding credit rating along a convex curve. For interest-rate sensitivity, Morningstar obtains from fund companies the average effective duration. Generally, Morningstar classifies a fixed-income fund's interest-rate sensitivity based on the effective duration of the Morningstar Core Bond Index (MCBI), which is currently three years. The classification of Limited will be assigned to those funds whose average effective duration is between 25% to 75% of MCBI's average effective duration; funds whose average effective duration is between 75% to 125% of the MCBI will be classified as Moderate; and those that are at 125% or greater of the average effective duration of the MCBI will be classified as Extensive. For municipal bond funds, Morningstar also obtains from fund companies the average effective duration. In these cases static breakpoints are utilized. These breakpoints are as follows: (i) Limited: 4.5 years or less; (ii) Moderate: more than 4.5 years but less than 7 years; and (iii) Extensive: more than 7 years. In addition, for non-US taxable and non-US domiciled fixed income funds static duration breakpoints are used: (i) Limited: less than or equal to 3.5 years; (ii) Moderate: greater than 3.5 and less than equal to 6 years; (iii) Extensive: greater than 6 years.Unsubsidized yields reflect what the yield would have been without the effect of reimbursements and waivers. The adviser and its affiliates have or may voluntarily waive a portion of their fees (including, but not limited to, distribution and service (12b-1) fees) and reimburse certain expenses. There is no guarantee that the fund will avoid a negative yield. Such undertaking may be amended or withdrawn at any time. 12-Month Trailing Distribution Yield: at NAV refers to the 12-month historical cash flow paid over the past 12 months in dividends, divided by the past months ending NAV. Alpha, Beta, R-Squared, Standard Deviation, Sharpe Ratio and Capture Ratio are 5 year statistics. Alpha is a measure of a fund's actual returns and expected performance, given its level of risk (as measured by beta). Beta reflects the sensitivity of the fund's return to fluctuations in the market index. R-squared indicates how much of a fund's fluctuations were attributable to movements in the fund's benchmark. Standard deviation is a measure of how volatile a fund's returns are. Sharpe ratio is a measure of a fund's risk-adjusted performance. Capture ratio reflects the annualized product of fund vs. index returns for all months in which the index had a positive return (upside capture) or negative return (downside capture).The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance, and does not include the effects of sales charges. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.  © 2017 Morningstar, Inc.
