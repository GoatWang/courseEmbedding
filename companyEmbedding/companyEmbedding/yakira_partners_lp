HedgeZ Fund Profile
































Yakira
Partners, L.P.

















Fund Investment Objectives











                                        Yakira Partners, L.P. was formed in 1997 to invest in market neutral, event-driven arbitrage opportunities. The Fund invests principally in securities subject to an event where Management believes the market price does not adequately reflect the effect that such event will have on the securities valuation. The Fund invests primarily in risk arbitrage, closed-end fund restructurings, takeovers, exchange offers, liquidations and other special situations including value plays. The Fund also engages in balance sheet arbitrage, pair trading within the same industry group, short selling and other investments in securities. Management often employs strategies involving derivative securities, such as options and convertible securities, in order to establish more favorable risk reward relationships. It also uses hedging devices frequently. The Fund may utilize leverage when Management believes it is appropriate; however, it has rarely done so in the past. Since its inception, the Fund's objective has been to generate capital growth while limiting the downside risk of any individual position.

Yakira Partners, L.P. Overview
  Yakira Partners, L.P. filed as a Foreign Limited Partnership in the State of New York and is no longer active. This corporate entity was filed approximately twenty years ago on Friday, January 31, 1997 as recorded in documents filed with New York Department of State. It is important to note that this is a foreign filing. A foreign filing is when an existing corporate entity files in a state other than the one they originally filed in. This does not necessarily mean that they are from outside the United States.
