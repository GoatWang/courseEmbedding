History[edit]
See also: Rubbermaid
Newell Company[edit]
The Newell Manufacturing Company was founded by Edgar Newell in Ogdensburg, New York, in 1903 as a manufacturer of metal curtain rods.
In 1908, the company boosted profits by investing in machines that produced curtain rods better and faster than any other manufacturer.
The F. W. Woolworth retail chain became the first customer for Newell's bronze–plated curtain rods in 1916, making them the first Newell products to be distributed nationally. This marked the beginning of Newell's mass merchandising strategy. As the business grew, the company built a new 15,000-square-foot facility in Ogdensburg, N.Y.
The company purchased Barnwell Mfg. Co. of Freeport, Ill. in 1921, renaming it Western Newell Manufacturing Company. Freeport's access to railroad lines made it easier to ship products west. Kresge, the department store chain that later became Kmart, was one of Western Newell's larger accounts.
During World War II, Western Newell converted factories to assist with the war effort, earning the Army/Navy "E" award for excellence in wartime production.
Daniel C. Ferguson was named president in 1965 and developed a growth-by-acquisition strategy based on his intention to build a strong, multi-product company.
The Newell Company went public in 1972, opening on the NASDAQ at $28 per share. In 1974 they acquired EZ Paintr Corporation, then the world's largest maker of paint applicators. Newell was listed on the New York Stock Exchange with the ticker symbol NWL in 1979.
In 1979, Newell moved into its first corporate headquarters in a historic former bank building in Freeport, Ill.
In 1983 the company entered the cookware market with the purchase of Mirro. In 1987, the company acquired Anchor Hocking Corporation, a specialty manufacturer of glassware, flatware, cookware and other products. The deal included the purchase of Amerock, a maker of cabinet hardware and window components.
In 1992, they acquired Sanford, a leading manufacturer and marketer of writing instruments, including the Sharpie and Expo brands. A year later, they acquired Levolor, a leading manufacturer and marketer of window treatments. Additionally, they entered the beauty and style category by acquiring Goody hair care accessories, which included Ace men’s grooming accessories.
In 1997 the company acquired Kirsch, a leader in branded drapery hardware and custom window coverings.
In 1998 the company expanded cookware family with the purchase of Calphalon Corporation, a manufacturer of gourmet cookware marketed primarily to upscale retailers and department stores. The company also purchased Panex, the number one cookware maker in South America.
In 2016 Newell moved its corporate headquarters to Hoboken, NJ.
Criticism[edit]
Newell Rubbermaid has been criticized in the UK for systematically closing British factories, including those of Parker Pen, Berol, Record and Marples tools.[citation needed]
Mergers[edit]
Rubbermaid[edit]
In 1999, Newell Company acquired the Rubbermaid and Graco brand names in a megamerger deal worth $5.8 billion, and later renamed the combined firm Newell Rubbermaid. This was an acquisition ten times as big as the last biggest acquisition Newell had made before. This nearly doubled the company's size, and significantly increased Newell's portfolio of brands. According to the November 10, 2004 Frontline documentary series' "Is Wal-Mart Good for America?" episode, Newell's chance to buy the Rubbermaid brand resulted from the original Rubbermaid corporation's bankruptcy and fire sale-style liquidation of its remaining assets. The original Rubbermaid had risen to enormous market share and profits by making Wal-Mart the near-sole distributor of its products — shifting away from a previous, years-long policy of diversifying its product distribution by using multiple retailers. After it had become dependent upon Wal-Mart for almost all of its sales, Rubbermaid claimed that it needed to raise the retail price of its products by a small, single-digit percentage. Rubbermaid said that this price increase was needed to keep pace with operational costs and inflation, without sacrificing its legendary product quality. Despite Rubbermaid's insistence that it couldn't afford to stay in business without it, Wal-Mart — citing its strict commitment to its "everyday low price" (EDLP) policy, and language in their contract with Rubbermaid allowing it to control pricing — refused Rubbermaid's request. Rubbermaid's business collapsed shortly thereafter. Most of its physical assets had to be sold off at discount prices to satisfy its creditors; its biggest remaining asset was the Rubbermaid brand name.[citation needed]
However, the merger in 1999 was dubbed as the "merger from hell" by Businessweek magazine.[4] Newell shareholders lost 50 percent of their value in the two years following the closing and Rubbermaid shareholders lost 35 percent. In 2002, Newell wrote off $500 million in goodwill.
Other mergers[edit]
In 2000, Newell Rubbermaid acquired the world’s broadest assortment of writing products with the purchase of Gillette's stationery products business, including the Paper Mate, Parker, Waterman and Liquid Paper brands.
In 2002, they acquired American Tool Companies, adding the globally recognized and powerful Irwin, Vise-Grip, and Marathon brands to their portfolio.
In 2003, Newell Rubbermaid acquired American Saw and Manufacturing Company, a leading manufacturer of linear-edge power tool accessories, hand tools and band saw blades marketed under the Lenox brand.
In 2005, the company acquired DYMO, a global leader in designing, manufacturing and marketing on-demand labeling solutions. The company expanded its presence in this market with the 2006 purchases of CardScan business card scanners and Mimio interactive whiteboard products along with the 2007 acquisition of postage leader Endicia and its Picture-it-Postage brand. In 2005, Mark Ketchum was named president and CEO and the company transformed their focus toward consumer-driven innovation and marketing. The company added the slogan of "Brands That Matter" to their logo to emphasize the change.
In February 2008, Newell Rubbermaid acquired Aprica Kassai, a Japanese maker of strollers, car seats and other children’s products and Technical Concepts, a leader in the away-from-home restroom market. The company created a global headquarters in the Atlanta metropolitan area to consolidate numerous brands and functions under one roof for greater collaboration and a common culture. In July 2011 Michael B. Polk joined the company as president and CEO. After eight years at Unilever, he had a record of successfully instituting change, enhancing performance and delivering improved financial results.[5]
On July 21, 2014, Newell Rubbermaid announced a $308 million acquisition of Ignite Holdings, a Chicago-based maker of reusable water bottles and thermal mugs.[6]
On October 5, 2015, Newell Rubbermaid announced that it would acquire Elmer's Products, the makers of Elmer's glue, Krazy Glue, and X-Acto, amongst other brands, for $600 million. The company also announced plans to divest its window covering brands Levolor and Kirsch.[7]
On December 14, 2015, Newell Rubbermaid announced that it would acquire Jarden for over $15 billion of cash and stock. The combined company will be known as Newell Brands, and 55% will be owned by Newell's shareholders. The combined company will have an estimated annual sales of $16 billion.[8][9]

History[edit]
See also: Rubbermaid
Newell Company[edit]
The Newell Manufacturing Company was founded by Edgar Newell in Ogdensburg, New York, in 1903 as a manufacturer of metal curtain rods.
In 1908, the company boosted profits by investing in machines that produced curtain rods better and faster than any other manufacturer.
The F. W. Woolworth retail chain became the first customer for Newell's bronze–plated curtain rods in 1916, making them the first Newell products to be distributed nationally. This marked the beginning of Newell's mass merchandising strategy. As the business grew, the company built a new 15,000-square-foot facility in Ogdensburg, N.Y.
The company purchased Barnwell Mfg. Co. of Freeport, Ill. in 1921, renaming it Western Newell Manufacturing Company. Freeport's access to railroad lines made it easier to ship products west. Kresge, the department store chain that later became Kmart, was one of Western Newell's larger accounts.
During World War II, Western Newell converted factories to assist with the war effort, earning the Army/Navy "E" award for excellence in wartime production.
Daniel C. Ferguson was named president in 1965 and developed a growth-by-acquisition strategy based on his intention to build a strong, multi-product company.
The Newell Company went public in 1972, opening on the NASDAQ at $28 per share. In 1974 they acquired EZ Paintr Corporation, then the world's largest maker of paint applicators. Newell was listed on the New York Stock Exchange with the ticker symbol NWL in 1979.
In 1979, Newell moved into its first corporate headquarters in a historic former bank building in Freeport, Ill.
In 1983 the company entered the cookware market with the purchase of Mirro. In 1987, the company acquired Anchor Hocking Corporation, a specialty manufacturer of glassware, flatware, cookware and other products. The deal included the purchase of Amerock, a maker of cabinet hardware and window components.
In 1992, they acquired Sanford, a leading manufacturer and marketer of writing instruments, including the Sharpie and Expo brands. A year later, they acquired Levolor, a leading manufacturer and marketer of window treatments. Additionally, they entered the beauty and style category by acquiring Goody hair care accessories, which included Ace men’s grooming accessories.
In 1997 the company acquired Kirsch, a leader in branded drapery hardware and custom window coverings.
In 1998 the company expanded cookware family with the purchase of Calphalon Corporation, a manufacturer of gourmet cookware marketed primarily to upscale retailers and department stores. The company also purchased Panex, the number one cookware maker in South America.
In 2016 Newell moved its corporate headquarters to Hoboken, NJ.
Criticism[edit]
Newell Rubbermaid has been criticized in the UK for systematically closing British factories, including those of Parker Pen, Berol, Record and Marples tools.[citation needed]
Mergers[edit]
Rubbermaid[edit]
In 1999, Newell Company acquired the Rubbermaid and Graco brand names in a megamerger deal worth $5.8 billion, and later renamed the combined firm Newell Rubbermaid. This was an acquisition ten times as big as the last biggest acquisition Newell had made before. This nearly doubled the company's size, and significantly increased Newell's portfolio of brands. According to the November 10, 2004 Frontline documentary series' "Is Wal-Mart Good for America?" episode, Newell's chance to buy the Rubbermaid brand resulted from the original Rubbermaid corporation's bankruptcy and fire sale-style liquidation of its remaining assets. The original Rubbermaid had risen to enormous market share and profits by making Wal-Mart the near-sole distributor of its products — shifting away from a previous, years-long policy of diversifying its product distribution by using multiple retailers. After it had become dependent upon Wal-Mart for almost all of its sales, Rubbermaid claimed that it needed to raise the retail price of its products by a small, single-digit percentage. Rubbermaid said that this price increase was needed to keep pace with operational costs and inflation, without sacrificing its legendary product quality. Despite Rubbermaid's insistence that it couldn't afford to stay in business without it, Wal-Mart — citing its strict commitment to its "everyday low price" (EDLP) policy, and language in their contract with Rubbermaid allowing it to control pricing — refused Rubbermaid's request. Rubbermaid's business collapsed shortly thereafter. Most of its physical assets had to be sold off at discount prices to satisfy its creditors; its biggest remaining asset was the Rubbermaid brand name.[citation needed]
However, the merger in 1999 was dubbed as the "merger from hell" by Businessweek magazine.[4] Newell shareholders lost 50 percent of their value in the two years following the closing and Rubbermaid shareholders lost 35 percent. In 2002, Newell wrote off $500 million in goodwill.
Other mergers[edit]
In 2000, Newell Rubbermaid acquired the world’s broadest assortment of writing products with the purchase of Gillette's stationery products business, including the Paper Mate, Parker, Waterman and Liquid Paper brands.
In 2002, they acquired American Tool Companies, adding the globally recognized and powerful Irwin, Vise-Grip, and Marathon brands to their portfolio.
In 2003, Newell Rubbermaid acquired American Saw and Manufacturing Company, a leading manufacturer of linear-edge power tool accessories, hand tools and band saw blades marketed under the Lenox brand.
In 2005, the company acquired DYMO, a global leader in designing, manufacturing and marketing on-demand labeling solutions. The company expanded its presence in this market with the 2006 purchases of CardScan business card scanners and Mimio interactive whiteboard products along with the 2007 acquisition of postage leader Endicia and its Picture-it-Postage brand. In 2005, Mark Ketchum was named president and CEO and the company transformed their focus toward consumer-driven innovation and marketing. The company added the slogan of "Brands That Matter" to their logo to emphasize the change.
In February 2008, Newell Rubbermaid acquired Aprica Kassai, a Japanese maker of strollers, car seats and other children’s products and Technical Concepts, a leader in the away-from-home restroom market. The company created a global headquarters in the Atlanta metropolitan area to consolidate numerous brands and functions under one roof for greater collaboration and a common culture. In July 2011 Michael B. Polk joined the company as president and CEO. After eight years at Unilever, he had a record of successfully instituting change, enhancing performance and delivering improved financial results.[5]
On July 21, 2014, Newell Rubbermaid announced a $308 million acquisition of Ignite Holdings, a Chicago-based maker of reusable water bottles and thermal mugs.[6]
On October 5, 2015, Newell Rubbermaid announced that it would acquire Elmer's Products, the makers of Elmer's glue, Krazy Glue, and X-Acto, amongst other brands, for $600 million. The company also announced plans to divest its window covering brands Levolor and Kirsch.[7]
On December 14, 2015, Newell Rubbermaid announced that it would acquire Jarden for over $15 billion of cash and stock. The combined company will be known as Newell Brands, and 55% will be owned by Newell's shareholders. The combined company will have an estimated annual sales of $16 billion.[8][9]

Criticism[edit]
Newell Rubbermaid has been criticized in the UK for systematically closing British factories, including those of Parker Pen, Berol, Record and Marples tools.[citation needed]
Mergers[edit]
Rubbermaid[edit]
In 1999, Newell Company acquired the Rubbermaid and Graco brand names in a megamerger deal worth $5.8 billion, and later renamed the combined firm Newell Rubbermaid. This was an acquisition ten times as big as the last biggest acquisition Newell had made before. This nearly doubled the company's size, and significantly increased Newell's portfolio of brands. According to the November 10, 2004 Frontline documentary series' "Is Wal-Mart Good for America?" episode, Newell's chance to buy the Rubbermaid brand resulted from the original Rubbermaid corporation's bankruptcy and fire sale-style liquidation of its remaining assets. The original Rubbermaid had risen to enormous market share and profits by making Wal-Mart the near-sole distributor of its products — shifting away from a previous, years-long policy of diversifying its product distribution by using multiple retailers. After it had become dependent upon Wal-Mart for almost all of its sales, Rubbermaid claimed that it needed to raise the retail price of its products by a small, single-digit percentage. Rubbermaid said that this price increase was needed to keep pace with operational costs and inflation, without sacrificing its legendary product quality. Despite Rubbermaid's insistence that it couldn't afford to stay in business without it, Wal-Mart — citing its strict commitment to its "everyday low price" (EDLP) policy, and language in their contract with Rubbermaid allowing it to control pricing — refused Rubbermaid's request. Rubbermaid's business collapsed shortly thereafter. Most of its physical assets had to be sold off at discount prices to satisfy its creditors; its biggest remaining asset was the Rubbermaid brand name.[citation needed]
However, the merger in 1999 was dubbed as the "merger from hell" by Businessweek magazine.[4] Newell shareholders lost 50 percent of their value in the two years following the closing and Rubbermaid shareholders lost 35 percent. In 2002, Newell wrote off $500 million in goodwill.
Other mergers[edit]
In 2000, Newell Rubbermaid acquired the world’s broadest assortment of writing products with the purchase of Gillette's stationery products business, including the Paper Mate, Parker, Waterman and Liquid Paper brands.
In 2002, they acquired American Tool Companies, adding the globally recognized and powerful Irwin, Vise-Grip, and Marathon brands to their portfolio.
In 2003, Newell Rubbermaid acquired American Saw and Manufacturing Company, a leading manufacturer of linear-edge power tool accessories, hand tools and band saw blades marketed under the Lenox brand.
In 2005, the company acquired DYMO, a global leader in designing, manufacturing and marketing on-demand labeling solutions. The company expanded its presence in this market with the 2006 purchases of CardScan business card scanners and Mimio interactive whiteboard products along with the 2007 acquisition of postage leader Endicia and its Picture-it-Postage brand. In 2005, Mark Ketchum was named president and CEO and the company transformed their focus toward consumer-driven innovation and marketing.

History[edit]
See also: Rubbermaid
Newell Company[edit]
The Newell Manufacturing Company was founded by Edgar Newell in Ogdensburg, New York, in 1903 as a manufacturer of metal curtain rods.
In 1908, the company boosted profits by investing in machines that produced curtain rods better and faster than any other manufacturer.
The F. W. Woolworth retail chain became the first customer for Newell's bronze–plated curtain rods in 1916, making them the first Newell products to be distributed nationally. This marked the beginning of Newell's mass merchandising strategy. As the business grew, the company built a new 15,000-square-foot facility in Ogdensburg, N.Y.
The company purchased Barnwell Mfg. Co. of Freeport, Ill. in 1921, renaming it Western Newell Manufacturing Company. Freeport's access to railroad lines made it easier to ship products west. Kresge, the department store chain that later became Kmart, was one of Western Newell's larger accounts.
During World War II, Western Newell converted factories to assist with the war effort, earning the Army/Navy "E" award for excellence in wartime production.
Daniel C. Ferguson was named president in 1965 and developed a growth-by-acquisition strategy based on his intention to build a strong, multi-product company.
The Newell Company went public in 1972, opening on the NASDAQ at $28 per share. In 1974 they acquired EZ Paintr Corporation, then the world's largest maker of paint applicators. Newell was listed on the New York Stock Exchange with the ticker symbol NWL in 1979.
In 1979, Newell moved into its first corporate headquarters in a historic former bank building in Freeport, Ill.
In 1983 the company entered the cookware market with the purchase of Mirro. In 1987, the company acquired Anchor Hocking Corporation, a specialty manufacturer of glassware, flatware, cookware and other products. The deal included the purchase of Amerock, a maker of cabinet hardware and window components.
In 1992, they acquired Sanford, a leading manufacturer and marketer of writing instruments, including the Sharpie and Expo brands. A year later, they acquired Levolor, a leading manufacturer and marketer of window treatments. Additionally, they entered the beauty and style category by acquiring Goody hair care accessories, which included Ace men’s grooming accessories.
In 1997 the company acquired Kirsch, a leader in branded drapery hardware and custom window coverings.
In 1998 the company expanded cookware family with the purchase of Calphalon Corporation, a manufacturer of gourmet cookware marketed primarily to upscale retailers and department stores. The company also purchased Panex, the number one cookware maker in South America.
In 2016 Newell moved its corporate headquarters to Hoboken, NJ.
Criticism[edit]
Newell Rubbermaid has been criticized in the UK for systematically closing British factories, including those of Parker Pen, Berol, Record and Marples tools.[citation needed]
Mergers[edit]
Rubbermaid[edit]
In 1999, Newell Company acquired the Rubbermaid and Graco brand names in a megamerger deal worth $5.8 billion, and later renamed the combined firm Newell Rubbermaid. This was an acquisition ten times as big as the last biggest acquisition Newell had made before. This nearly doubled the company's size, and significantly increased Newell's portfolio of brands. According to the November 10, 2004 Frontline documentary series' "Is Wal-Mart Good for America?" episode, Newell's chance to buy the Rubbermaid brand resulted from the original Rubbermaid corporation's bankruptcy and fire sale-style liquidation of its remaining assets. The original Rubbermaid had risen to enormous market share and profits by making Wal-Mart the near-sole distributor of its products — shifting away from a previous, years-long policy of diversifying its product distribution by using multiple retailers. After it had become dependent upon Wal-Mart for almost all of its sales, Rubbermaid claimed that it needed to raise the retail price of its products by a small, single-digit percentage. Rubbermaid said that this price increase was needed to keep pace with operational costs and inflation, without sacrificing its legendary product quality. Despite Rubbermaid's insistence that it couldn't afford to stay in business without it, Wal-Mart — citing its strict commitment to its "everyday low price" (EDLP) policy, and language in their contract with Rubbermaid allowing it to control pricing — refused Rubbermaid's request. Rubbermaid's business collapsed shortly thereafter. Most of its physical assets had to be sold off at discount prices to satisfy its creditors; its biggest remaining asset was the Rubbermaid brand name.[citation needed]
However, the merger in 1999 was dubbed as the "merger from hell" by Businessweek magazine.[4] Newell shareholders lost 50 percent of their value in the two years following the closing and Rubbermaid shareholders lost 35 percent. In 2002, Newell wrote off $500 million in goodwill.
Other mergers[edit]
In 2000, Newell Rubbermaid acquired the world’s broadest assortment of writing products with the purchase of Gillette's stationery products business, including the Paper Mate, Parker, Waterman and Liquid Paper brands.
In 2002, they acquired American Tool Companies, adding the globally recognized and powerful Irwin, Vise-Grip, and Marathon brands to their portfolio.
In 2003, Newell Rubbermaid acquired American Saw and Manufacturing Company, a leading manufacturer of linear-edge power tool accessories, hand tools and band saw blades marketed under the Lenox brand.
In 2005, the company acquired DYMO, a global leader in designing, manufacturing and marketing on-demand labeling solutions. The company expanded its presence in this market with the 2006 purchases of CardScan business card scanners and Mimio interactive whiteboard products along with the 2007 acquisition of postage leader Endicia and its Picture-it-Postage brand. In 2005, Mark Ketchum was named president and CEO and the company transformed their focus toward consumer-driven innovation and marketing. The company added the slogan of "Brands That Matter" to their logo to emphasize the change.
In February 2008, Newell Rubbermaid acquired Aprica Kassai, a Japanese maker of strollers, car seats and other children’s products and Technical Concepts, a leader in the away-from-home restroom market. The company created a global headquarters in the Atlanta metropolitan area to consolidate numerous brands and functions under one roof for greater collaboration and a common culture. In July 2011 Michael B. Polk joined the company as president and CEO. After eight years at Unilever, he had a record of successfully instituting change, enhancing performance and delivering improved financial results.[5]
On July 21, 2014, Newell Rubbermaid announced a $308 million acquisition of Ignite Holdings, a Chicago-based maker of reusable water bottles and thermal mugs.[6]
On October 5, 2015, Newell Rubbermaid announced that it would acquire Elmer's Products, the makers of Elmer's glue, Krazy Glue, and X-Acto, amongst other brands, for $600 million. The company also announced plans to divest its window covering brands Levolor and Kirsch.[7]
On December 14, 2015, Newell Rubbermaid announced that it would acquire Jarden for over $15 billion of cash and stock. The combined company will be known as Newell Brands, and 55% will be owned by Newell's shareholders. The combined company will have an estimated annual sales of $16 billion.[8][9]

Criticism[edit]
Newell Rubbermaid has been criticized in the UK for systematically closing British factories, including those of Parker Pen, Berol, Record and Marples tools.[citation needed]
Mergers[edit]
Rubbermaid[edit]
In 1999, Newell Company acquired the Rubbermaid and Graco brand names in a megamerger deal worth $5.8 billion, and later renamed the combined firm Newell Rubbermaid. This was an acquisition ten times as big as the last biggest acquisition Newell had made before. This nearly doubled the company's size, and significantly increased Newell's portfolio of brands. According to the November 10, 2004 Frontline documentary series' "Is Wal-Mart Good for America?" episode, Newell's chance to buy the Rubbermaid brand resulted from the original Rubbermaid corporation's bankruptcy and fire sale-style liquidation of its remaining assets. The original Rubbermaid had risen to enormous market share and profits by making Wal-Mart the near-sole distributor of its products — shifting away from a previous, years-long policy of diversifying its product distribution by using multiple retailers. After it had become dependent upon Wal-Mart for almost all of its sales, Rubbermaid claimed that it needed to raise the retail price of its products by a small, single-digit percentage. Rubbermaid said that this price increase was needed to keep pace with operational costs and inflation, without sacrificing its legendary product quality. Despite Rubbermaid's insistence that it couldn't afford to stay in business without it, Wal-Mart — citing its strict commitment to its "everyday low price" (EDLP) policy, and language in their contract with Rubbermaid allowing it to control pricing — refused Rubbermaid's request. Rubbermaid's business collapsed shortly thereafter. Most of its physical assets had to be sold off at discount prices to satisfy its creditors; its biggest remaining asset was the Rubbermaid brand name.[citation needed]
However, the merger in 1999 was dubbed as the "merger from hell" by Businessweek magazine.[4] Newell shareholders lost 50 percent of their value in the two years following the closing and Rubbermaid shareholders lost 35 percent. In 2002, Newell wrote off $500 million in goodwill.
Other mergers[edit]
In 2000, Newell Rubbermaid acquired the world’s broadest assortment of writing products with the purchase of Gillette's stationery products business, including the Paper Mate, Parker, Waterman and Liquid Paper brands.
In 2002, they acquired American Tool Companies, adding the globally recognized and powerful Irwin, Vise-Grip, and Marathon brands to their portfolio.
In 2003, Newell Rubbermaid acquired American Saw and Manufacturing Company, a leading manufacturer of linear-edge power tool accessories, hand tools and band saw blades marketed under the Lenox brand.
In 2005, the company acquired DYMO, a global leader in designing, manufacturing and marketing on-demand labeling solutions. The company expanded its presence in this market with the 2006 purchases of CardScan business card scanners and Mimio interactive whiteboard products along with the 2007 acquisition of postage leader Endicia and its Picture-it-Postage brand. In 2005, Mark Ketchum was named president and CEO and the company transformed their focus toward consumer-driven innovation and marketing. The company added the slogan of "Brands That Matter" to their logo to emphasize the change.
In February 2008, Newell Rubbermaid acquired Aprica Kassai, a Japanese maker of strollers, car seats and other children’s products and Technical Concepts, a leader in the away-from-home restroom market. The company created a global headquarters in the Atlanta metropolitan area to consolidate numerous brands and functions under one roof for greater collaboration and a common culture. In July 2011 Michael B. Polk joined the company as president and CEO. After eight years at Unilever, he had a record of successfully instituting change, enhancing performance and delivering improved financial results.[5]
On July 21, 2014, Newell Rubbermaid announced a $308 million acquisition of Ignite Holdings, a Chicago-based maker of reusable water bottles and thermal mugs.[6]
On October 5, 2015, Newell Rubbermaid announced that it would acquire Elmer's Products, the makers of Elmer's glue, Krazy Glue, and X-Acto, amongst other brands, for $600 million. The company also announced plans to divest its window covering brands Levolor and Kirsch.[7]
On December 14, 2015, Newell Rubbermaid announced that it would acquire Jarden for over $15 billion of cash and stock. The combined company will be known as Newell Brands, and 55% will be owned by Newell's shareholders. The combined company will have an estimated annual sales of $16 billion.[8][9]

Directed at teenagers, the campaign also includes new print, TV, Internet and cinema advertising, extensive use of social media, and new packaging, markers and colors.

IN the early, messy old days of the typewriter, the ubiquitous user error known as a typo required a penance of labor to fix.

COMPANY NEWS

                    MAKER OF CHILDREN'S FURNITURE IS FINED $4 MILLION                
The Graco unit of Newell Rubbermaid Inc. was fined a record $4 million by the Consumer Products Safety Commission for failing to report defects promptly in more than 12 million items, some of which caused deaths and injuries to children. Under the settlement, Graco will recall 1.2 million toddler beds, sold from February 1994 to March 2001, because a child's limb can lodge in guardrails or footboards, the agency said. From 1991 through 2002, Graco and its Century brand failed to report defects that could pose risks of injury or death to young children, the agency said. A total of 919 incidents and injuries to children involved 16 different product lines, the agency said. Six deaths were associated with infant swings, the agency said.

                    Kids Cook the Darndest Things                
A BAFFLED child can be a toy inventor's best muse, as Jim Ruggiero discovered four years ago. Mr. Ruggiero, the vice president for design at the toymaker Little Tikes, was watching a preschool girl fiddle with a talking kitchen play set, one programmed to recite simple recipes for children to follow. It was reeling off instructions for spaghetti and meatballs, but the girl refused to comply: she threw a plastic hot dog in the pot in lieu of the plastic pasta. Yet the toy prattled on about how good the imaginary sauce smelled, despite the child's loud protestations that she was pursuing a more creative culinary vision.

Sharpie's new metallic ink pen writes on glass, metal and other surfaces that are usually hard to mark. The Vise-Grip Quick Adjusting Pipe Wrench from Irwin Industrial Tool wraps tightly around pipes with the push of a button. Graco's TurboBooster, a colorful, sporty car seat, can grow as a child grows. Now, a pen, a wrench and a toddler's seat might not set consumer pulses racing. But for Newell Rubbermaid, which owns those brands, they are a big deal indeed. ''We're transforming this company,'' said Joseph Galli Jr., Newell's highly enthusiastic chief executive. ''We don't just acquire existing businesses anymore. We develop new products and revitalize old ones.''

Newell Brands sells winter sports business to private equity firm Kohlberg & Company
Newell Brands Inc.  said Friday that it has sold its winter sports business to Kohlberg & Company, a private equity firm. The winter sports brands include K2, Atlas, Madshus and Dalbello. Sales from the winter sports portfolio were about $330 million in 2016. The transaction is expected to close late in the second quarter or early in the third quarter. The sale is part of an effort to streamline Newell's portfolio. Gross proceeds from the divestiture are expected to be $240 million. In a separate transaction, Newell has sold the Zoot and Squadra clothing brands. Newell shares are down 0.3% in premarket trading, but up 18.8% for the year so far. The S&P 500 index  has gained nearly 8% for 2017 to date.

UPDATED: Newell Brands shares spike after earnings beat, raised guidance and dividend
Newell Brands Inc.  shares jumped 12.3% in Monday trading after the company reported first-quarter earnings that beat expectations, and raised both its guidance and dividend. Net income was $638.5 million, or $1.31 per share, up from $40.5 million, or 15 cents per share for the same period last year. Earnings benefited from the sale of the company's tools business and cost synergies from the acquisition of Jarden and other contributions. Adjusted earnings were 34 cents, beating the 29-cent FactSet consensus. Sales were $3.27 billion, up from $1.31 billion last year, and ahead of the $3.21 billion FactSet consensus. Newell raised its full-year adjusted EPS guidance to $3.00 to $3.20 from $2.95 to $3.15. It reaffirmed it full-year sales guidance of $14.52 billion to $14.72 billion. The FactSet consensus is for adjusted EPS of $3.05 and sales of $14.71 billion. Newell also raised its dividend by 4 cents to 23 cents per share. Newell shares are up nearly 4% for the year so far while the S&P 500 index  is up 7.2% for the period.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

History[edit]
See also: Rubbermaid
Newell Company[edit]
The Newell Manufacturing Company was founded by Edgar Newell in Ogdensburg, New York, in 1903 as a manufacturer of metal curtain rods.
In 1908, the company boosted profits by investing in machines that produced curtain rods better and faster than any other manufacturer.
The F. W. Woolworth retail chain became the first customer for Newell's bronze–plated curtain rods in 1916, making them the first Newell products to be distributed nationally. This marked the beginning of Newell's mass merchandising strategy. As the business grew, the company built a new 15,000-square-foot facility in Ogdensburg, N.Y.
The company purchased Barnwell Mfg. Co. of Freeport, Ill. in 1921, renaming it Western Newell Manufacturing Company. Freeport's access to railroad lines made it easier to ship products west. Kresge, the department store chain that later became Kmart, was one of Western Newell's larger accounts.
During World War II, Western Newell converted factories to assist with the war effort, earning the Army/Navy "E" award for excellence in wartime production.
Daniel C. Ferguson was named president in 1965 and developed a growth-by-acquisition strategy based on his intention to build a strong, multi-product company.
The Newell Company went public in 1972, opening on the NASDAQ at $28 per share. In 1974 they acquired EZ Paintr Corporation, then the world's largest maker of paint applicators. Newell was listed on the New York Stock Exchange with the ticker symbol NWL in 1979.
In 1979, Newell moved into its first corporate headquarters in a historic former bank building in Freeport, Ill.
In 1983 the company entered the cookware market with the purchase of Mirro. In 1987, the company acquired Anchor Hocking Corporation, a specialty manufacturer of glassware, flatware, cookware and other products. The deal included the purchase of Amerock, a maker of cabinet hardware and window components.
In 1992, they acquired Sanford, a leading manufacturer and marketer of writing instruments, including the Sharpie and Expo brands. A year later, they acquired Levolor, a leading manufacturer and marketer of window treatments. Additionally, they entered the beauty and style category by acquiring Goody hair care accessories, which included Ace men’s grooming accessories.
In 1997 the company acquired Kirsch, a leader in branded drapery hardware and custom window coverings.
In 1998 the company expanded cookware family with the purchase of Calphalon Corporation, a manufacturer of gourmet cookware marketed primarily to upscale retailers and department stores. The company also purchased Panex, the number one cookware maker in South America.
In 2016 Newell moved its corporate headquarters to Hoboken, NJ.
Criticism[edit]
Newell Rubbermaid has been criticized in the UK for systematically closing British factories, including those of Parker Pen, Berol, Record and Marples tools.[citation needed]
Mergers[edit]
Rubbermaid[edit]
In 1999, Newell Company acquired the Rubbermaid and Graco brand names in a megamerger deal worth $5.8 billion, and later renamed the combined firm Newell Rubbermaid. This was an acquisition ten times as big as the last biggest acquisition Newell had made before. This nearly doubled the company's size, and significantly increased Newell's portfolio of brands. According to the November 10, 2004 Frontline documentary series' "Is Wal-Mart Good for America?" episode, Newell's chance to buy the Rubbermaid brand resulted from the original Rubbermaid corporation's bankruptcy and fire sale-style liquidation of its remaining assets. The original Rubbermaid had risen to enormous market share and profits by making Wal-Mart the near-sole distributor of its products — shifting away from a previous, years-long policy of diversifying its product distribution by using multiple retailers. After it had become dependent upon Wal-Mart for almost all of its sales, Rubbermaid claimed that it needed to raise the retail price of its products by a small, single-digit percentage. Rubbermaid said that this price increase was needed to keep pace with operational costs and inflation, without sacrificing its legendary product quality. Despite Rubbermaid's insistence that it couldn't afford to stay in business without it, Wal-Mart — citing its strict commitment to its "everyday low price" (EDLP) policy, and language in their contract with Rubbermaid allowing it to control pricing — refused Rubbermaid's request. Rubbermaid's business collapsed shortly thereafter. Most of its physical assets had to be sold off at discount prices to satisfy its creditors; its biggest remaining asset was the Rubbermaid brand name.[citation needed]
However, the merger in 1999 was dubbed as the "merger from hell" by Businessweek magazine.[4] Newell shareholders lost 50 percent of their value in the two years following the closing and Rubbermaid shareholders lost 35 percent. In 2002, Newell wrote off $500 million in goodwill.
Other mergers[edit]
In 2000, Newell Rubbermaid acquired the world’s broadest assortment of writing products with the purchase of Gillette's stationery products business, including the Paper Mate, Parker, Waterman and Liquid Paper brands.
In 2002, they acquired American Tool Companies, adding the globally recognized and powerful Irwin, Vise-Grip, and Marathon brands to their portfolio.
In 2003, Newell Rubbermaid acquired American Saw and Manufacturing Company, a leading manufacturer of linear-edge power tool accessories, hand tools and band saw blades marketed under the Lenox brand.
In 2005, the company acquired DYMO, a global leader in designing, manufacturing and marketing on-demand labeling solutions. The company expanded its presence in this market with the 2006 purchases of CardScan business card scanners and Mimio interactive whiteboard products along with the 2007 acquisition of postage leader Endicia and its Picture-it-Postage brand. In 2005, Mark Ketchum was named president and CEO and the company transformed their focus toward consumer-driven innovation and marketing. The company added the slogan of "Brands That Matter" to their logo to emphasize the change.
In February 2008, Newell Rubbermaid acquired Aprica Kassai, a Japanese maker of strollers, car seats and other children’s products and Technical Concepts, a leader in the away-from-home restroom market. The company created a global headquarters in the Atlanta metropolitan area to consolidate numerous brands and functions under one roof for greater collaboration and a common culture. In July 2011 Michael B. Polk joined the company as president and CEO. After eight years at Unilever, he had a record of successfully instituting change, enhancing performance and delivering improved financial results.[5]
On July 21, 2014, Newell Rubbermaid announced a $308 million acquisition of Ignite Holdings, a Chicago-based maker of reusable water bottles and thermal mugs.[6]
On October 5, 2015, Newell Rubbermaid announced that it would acquire Elmer's Products, the makers of Elmer's glue, Krazy Glue, and X-Acto, amongst other brands, for $600 million. The company also announced plans to divest its window covering brands Levolor and Kirsch.[7]
On December 14, 2015, Newell Rubbermaid announced that it would acquire Jarden for over $15 billion of cash and stock. The combined company will be known as Newell Brands, and 55% will be owned by Newell's shareholders. The combined company will have an estimated annual sales of $16 billion.[8][9]

History[edit]
See also: Rubbermaid
Newell Company[edit]
The Newell Manufacturing Company was founded by Edgar Newell in Ogdensburg, New York, in 1903 as a manufacturer of metal curtain rods.
In 1908, the company boosted profits by investing in machines that produced curtain rods better and faster than any other manufacturer.
The F. W. Woolworth retail chain became the first customer for Newell's bronze–plated curtain rods in 1916, making them the first Newell products to be distributed nationally. This marked the beginning of Newell's mass merchandising strategy. As the business grew, the company built a new 15,000-square-foot facility in Ogdensburg, N.Y.
The company purchased Barnwell Mfg. Co. of Freeport, Ill. in 1921, renaming it Western Newell Manufacturing Company. Freeport's access to railroad lines made it easier to ship products west. Kresge, the department store chain that later became Kmart, was one of Western Newell's larger accounts.
During World War II, Western Newell converted factories to assist with the war effort, earning the Army/Navy "E" award for excellence in wartime production.
Daniel C. Ferguson was named president in 1965 and developed a growth-by-acquisition strategy based on his intention to build a strong, multi-product company.
The Newell Company went public in 1972, opening on the NASDAQ at $28 per share. In 1974 they acquired EZ Paintr Corporation, then the world's largest maker of paint applicators. Newell was listed on the New York Stock Exchange with the ticker symbol NWL in 1979.
In 1979, Newell moved into its first corporate headquarters in a historic former bank building in Freeport, Ill.
In 1983 the company entered the cookware market with the purchase of Mirro. In 1987, the company acquired Anchor Hocking Corporation, a specialty manufacturer of glassware, flatware, cookware and other products. The deal included the purchase of Amerock, a maker of cabinet hardware and window components.
In 1992, they acquired Sanford, a leading manufacturer and marketer of writing instruments, including the Sharpie and Expo brands. A year later, they acquired Levolor, a leading manufacturer and marketer of window treatments. Additionally, they entered the beauty and style category by acquiring Goody hair care accessories, which included Ace men’s grooming accessories.
In 1997 the company acquired Kirsch, a leader in branded drapery hardware and custom window coverings.
In 1998 the company expanded cookware family with the purchase of Calphalon Corporation, a manufacturer of gourmet cookware marketed primarily to upscale retailers and department stores. The company also purchased Panex, the number one cookware maker in South America.
In 2016 Newell moved its corporate headquarters to Hoboken, NJ.
Criticism[edit]
Newell Rubbermaid has been criticized in the UK for systematically closing British factories, including those of Parker Pen, Berol, Record and Marples tools.[citation needed]
Mergers[edit]
Rubbermaid[edit]
In 1999, Newell Company acquired the Rubbermaid and Graco brand names in a megamerger deal worth $5.8 billion, and later renamed the combined firm Newell Rubbermaid. This was an acquisition ten times as big as the last biggest acquisition Newell had made before. This nearly doubled the company's size, and significantly increased Newell's portfolio of brands. According to the November 10, 2004 Frontline documentary series' "Is Wal-Mart Good for America?" episode, Newell's chance to buy the Rubbermaid brand resulted from the original Rubbermaid corporation's bankruptcy and fire sale-style liquidation of its remaining assets. The original Rubbermaid had risen to enormous market share and profits by making Wal-Mart the near-sole distributor of its products — shifting away from a previous, years-long policy of diversifying its product distribution by using multiple retailers. After it had become dependent upon Wal-Mart for almost all of its sales, Rubbermaid claimed that it needed to raise the retail price of its products by a small, single-digit percentage. Rubbermaid said that this price increase was needed to keep pace with operational costs and inflation, without sacrificing its legendary product quality. Despite Rubbermaid's insistence that it couldn't afford to stay in business without it, Wal-Mart — citing its strict commitment to its "everyday low price" (EDLP) policy, and language in their contract with Rubbermaid allowing it to control pricing — refused Rubbermaid's request. Rubbermaid's business collapsed shortly thereafter. Most of its physical assets had to be sold off at discount prices to satisfy its creditors; its biggest remaining asset was the Rubbermaid brand name.[citation needed]
However, the merger in 1999 was dubbed as the "merger from hell" by Businessweek magazine.[4] Newell shareholders lost 50 percent of their value in the two years following the closing and Rubbermaid shareholders lost 35 percent. In 2002, Newell wrote off $500 million in goodwill.
Other mergers[edit]
In 2000, Newell Rubbermaid acquired the world’s broadest assortment of writing products with the purchase of Gillette's stationery products business, including the Paper Mate, Parker, Waterman and Liquid Paper brands.
In 2002, they acquired American Tool Companies, adding the globally recognized and powerful Irwin, Vise-Grip, and Marathon brands to their portfolio.
In 2003, Newell Rubbermaid acquired American Saw and Manufacturing Company, a leading manufacturer of linear-edge power tool accessories, hand tools and band saw blades marketed under the Lenox brand.
In 2005, the company acquired DYMO, a global leader in designing, manufacturing and marketing on-demand labeling solutions. The company expanded its presence in this market with the 2006 purchases of CardScan business card scanners and Mimio interactive whiteboard products along with the 2007 acquisition of postage leader Endicia and its Picture-it-Postage brand. In 2005, Mark Ketchum was named president and CEO and the company transformed their focus toward consumer-driven innovation and marketing. The company added the slogan of "Brands That Matter" to their logo to emphasize the change.
In February 2008, Newell Rubbermaid acquired Aprica Kassai, a Japanese maker of strollers, car seats and other children’s products and Technical Concepts, a leader in the away-from-home restroom market. The company created a global headquarters in the Atlanta metropolitan area to consolidate numerous brands and functions under one roof for greater collaboration and a common culture. In July 2011 Michael B. Polk joined the company as president and CEO. After eight years at Unilever, he had a record of successfully instituting change, enhancing performance and delivering improved financial results.[5]
On July 21, 2014, Newell Rubbermaid announced a $308 million acquisition of Ignite Holdings, a Chicago-based maker of reusable water bottles and thermal mugs.[6]
On October 5, 2015, Newell Rubbermaid announced that it would acquire Elmer's Products, the makers of Elmer's glue, Krazy Glue, and X-Acto, amongst other brands, for $600 million. The company also announced plans to divest its window covering brands Levolor and Kirsch.[7]
On December 14, 2015, Newell Rubbermaid announced that it would acquire Jarden for over $15 billion of cash and stock. The combined company will be known as Newell Brands, and 55% will be owned by Newell's shareholders. The combined company will have an estimated annual sales of $16 billion.[8][9]

History[edit]
See also: Rubbermaid
Newell Company[edit]
The Newell Manufacturing Company was founded by Edgar Newell in Ogdensburg, New York, in 1903 as a manufacturer of metal curtain rods.
In 1908, the company boosted profits by investing in machines that produced curtain rods better and faster than any other manufacturer.
The F. W. Woolworth retail chain became the first customer for Newell's bronze–plated curtain rods in 1916, making them the first Newell products to be distributed nationally. This marked the beginning of Newell's mass merchandising strategy. As the business grew, the company built a new 15,000-square-foot facility in Ogdensburg, N.Y.
The company purchased Barnwell Mfg. Co. of Freeport, Ill. in 1921, renaming it Western Newell Manufacturing Company. Freeport's access to railroad lines made it easier to ship products west. Kresge, the department store chain that later became Kmart, was one of Western Newell's larger accounts.
During World War II, Western Newell converted factories to assist with the war effort, earning the Army/Navy "E" award for excellence in wartime production.
Daniel C. Ferguson was named president in 1965 and developed a growth-by-acquisition strategy based on his intention to build a strong, multi-product company.
The Newell Company went public in 1972, opening on the NASDAQ at $28 per share. In 1974 they acquired EZ Paintr Corporation, then the world's largest maker of paint applicators. Newell was listed on the New York Stock Exchange with the ticker symbol NWL in 1979.
In 1979, Newell moved into its first corporate headquarters in a historic former bank building in Freeport, Ill.
In 1983 the company entered the cookware market with the purchase of Mirro. In 1987, the company acquired Anchor Hocking Corporation, a specialty manufacturer of glassware, flatware, cookware and other products. The deal included the purchase of Amerock, a maker of cabinet hardware and window components.
In 1992, they acquired Sanford, a leading manufacturer and marketer of writing instruments, including the Sharpie and Expo brands. A year later, they acquired Levolor, a leading manufacturer and marketer of window treatments. Additionally, they entered the beauty and style category by acquiring Goody hair care accessories, which included Ace men’s grooming accessories.
In 1997 the company acquired Kirsch, a leader in branded drapery hardware and custom window coverings.
In 1998 the company expanded cookware family with the purchase of Calphalon Corporation, a manufacturer of gourmet cookware marketed primarily to upscale retailers and department stores. The company also purchased Panex, the number one cookware maker in South America.
In 2016 Newell moved its corporate headquarters to Hoboken, NJ.
Criticism[edit]
Newell Rubbermaid has been criticized in the UK for systematically closing British factories, including those of Parker Pen, Berol, Record and Marples tools.[citation needed]
Mergers[edit]
Rubbermaid[edit]
In 1999, Newell Company acquired the Rubbermaid and Graco brand names in a megamerger deal worth $5.8 billion, and later renamed the combined firm Newell Rubbermaid. This was an acquisition ten times as big as the last biggest acquisition Newell had made before. This nearly doubled the company's size, and significantly increased Newell's portfolio of brands. According to the November 10, 2004 Frontline documentary series' "Is Wal-Mart Good for America?" episode, Newell's chance to buy the Rubbermaid brand resulted from the original Rubbermaid corporation's bankruptcy and fire sale-style liquidation of its remaining assets. The original Rubbermaid had risen to enormous market share and profits by making Wal-Mart the near-sole distributor of its products — shifting away from a previous, years-long policy of diversifying its product distribution by using multiple retailers. After it had become dependent upon Wal-Mart for almost all of its sales, Rubbermaid claimed that it needed to raise the retail price of its products by a small, single-digit percentage. Rubbermaid said that this price increase was needed to keep pace with operational costs and inflation, without sacrificing its legendary product quality. Despite Rubbermaid's insistence that it couldn't afford to stay in business without it, Wal-Mart — citing its strict commitment to its "everyday low price" (EDLP) policy, and language in their contract with Rubbermaid allowing it to control pricing — refused Rubbermaid's request. Rubbermaid's business collapsed shortly thereafter. Most of its physical assets had to be sold off at discount prices to satisfy its creditors; its biggest remaining asset was the Rubbermaid brand name.[citation needed]
However, the merger in 1999 was dubbed as the "merger from hell" by Businessweek magazine.[4] Newell shareholders lost 50 percent of their value in the two years following the closing and Rubbermaid shareholders lost 35 percent. In 2002, Newell wrote off $500 million in goodwill.
Other mergers[edit]
In 2000, Newell Rubbermaid acquired the world’s broadest assortment of writing products with the purchase of Gillette's stationery products business, including the Paper Mate, Parker, Waterman and Liquid Paper brands.
In 2002, they acquired American Tool Companies, adding the globally recognized and powerful Irwin, Vise-Grip, and Marathon brands to their portfolio.
In 2003, Newell Rubbermaid acquired American Saw and Manufacturing Company, a leading manufacturer of linear-edge power tool accessories, hand tools and band saw blades marketed under the Lenox brand.
In 2005, the company acquired DYMO, a global leader in designing, manufacturing and marketing on-demand labeling solutions. The company expanded its presence in this market with the 2006 purchases of CardScan business card scanners and Mimio interactive whiteboard products along with the 2007 acquisition of postage leader Endicia and its Picture-it-Postage brand. In 2005, Mark Ketchum was named president and CEO and the company transformed their focus toward consumer-driven innovation and marketing. The company added the slogan of "Brands That Matter" to their logo to emphasize the change.
In February 2008, Newell Rubbermaid acquired Aprica Kassai, a Japanese maker of strollers, car seats and other children’s products and Technical Concepts, a leader in the away-from-home restroom market. The company created a global headquarters in the Atlanta metropolitan area to consolidate numerous brands and functions under one roof for greater collaboration and a common culture. In July 2011 Michael B. Polk joined the company as president and CEO. After eight years at Unilever, he had a record of successfully instituting change, enhancing performance and delivering improved financial results.[5]
On July 21, 2014, Newell Rubbermaid announced a $308 million acquisition of Ignite Holdings, a Chicago-based maker of reusable water bottles and thermal mugs.[6]
On October 5, 2015, Newell Rubbermaid announced that it would acquire Elmer's Products, the makers of Elmer's glue, Krazy Glue, and X-Acto, amongst other brands, for $600 million. The company also announced plans to divest its window covering brands Levolor and Kirsch.[7]
On December 14, 2015, Newell Rubbermaid announced that it would acquire Jarden for over $15 billion of cash and stock. The combined company will be known as Newell Brands, and 55% will be owned by Newell's shareholders. The combined company will have an estimated annual sales of $16 billion.[8][9]
