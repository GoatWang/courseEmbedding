Risk Factors - MVP REIT

MVP REIT is closed to new investments.

Risk Factors

MVP REIT » Risk Factors 
Forward-Looking Statements
This website includes forward-looking statements that can be identified by the use of words such as “will,” “may,” “should,” or other comparable terminology. Statements concerning future performance, cash flows and any other guidance on present or future periods constitute forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties and you should not unduly rely on these statements. You should be aware that a number of important factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in these forward-looking statements including the risks summarized below and the risks described in our filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The statements made herein are as of the date hereof and we undertake no obligation to update these statements except as may be required by applicable securities laws.
Risks to Consider Before Investing
You should purchase these securities only if you can afford a complete loss of your investment. See “Risk Factors” in the company’s prospectus to read about the more significant risks you should consider before buying shares of our common stock. These risks include the following:

We have a limited operating history, having commenced operations in December 2012.
Although we have acquired several properties and identified others we intend to acquire, we are effectively a “blind pool” because we have not identified, and you will not be able to evaluate, any additional investments we will make with proceeds from this offering.
This is a “best efforts” offering, and if we are unable to raise substantial funds then we may not be able to accomplish our business objectives and the poor performance of a single investment may materially adversly affect our overall investment performance.
Because a predominant focus for our investments will be parking and self-storage facilities, our revenues will be significantly influenced by demand for such properties gernerally, and a decrease in such demand would likely have a greater adverse effect on our revenues than if we owned a more diversified real estate portfolio.
We depend upon our advisor and its affiliates to conduct our operations.
There is no public trading market for the shares and we are not required to list or liquidate by a certain date or at all. Accordingly, the common shares lack liquidity and you may have to hold the investment indefinitley.
There are restrictions on your ability to have your shares repurchased under our share repurchase program.
There are substantial conflicts of interest between us and our advisor and its affiliates.
We may not be able to make distributions on a monthly basis. We currently pay distributions from sources other than cash flow from operations and may continue to pay from sources other than cash flow from operations, which includes the sale of assets, borrowings or offering proceeds. We have no limits on the amounts we may pay from such sources. If we pay distributions from sources other than our cash flow from operations, the funds available to us for investments would be reduced and your share value may be diluted.
We may incur substantial debt, which will increase our risk and may reduce our distributions.
Failure to qualify as a REIT would adversely affect our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.
See “Risk Factors” in the company’s prospectus to read about the more significant risks you should consider before buying shares of our common stock.
Our business strategy involves substantial risk as many of our investments are expected to be in real estate markets that have suffered significant declines in values over the last several years and we may seek to acquire loans made to higher risk borrowers.
As with all investments in securities, there is risk of loss of capital.
This is not a solicitation. Please read prospectus, which is the only means of soliciting for shares of MVP REIT.

Hybrid REITs - MVP REIT

Hybrid REITs

MVP REIT » What is a REIT? » Hybrid REITs 
Potential Advantages of a Hybrid REIT
As a hybrid, MVP REIT seeks to provide its stockholders with the full range of benefits that investments in commercial real estate and real estate secured loans can provide:



Multiple Revenue Sources
Real estate may provide income generated by rent collected from tenants of a commercial property. Additionally, real estate-secured loans may provide income generated by interest payments made by property owners. These multiple revenue sources are objectives of MVP REIT, which invests in both real estate and real estate-secured loans.


Diversification
As commercial real estate property values increase, the value of the REIT increases. However, should property values fall, the value of the REIT declines. MVP REIT’s hybrid nature may provide more diversification than pure real estate REITs, which lack a component of real estate-secured loans. Diversification does not ensure a profit or guarantee against a loss.


Flexibility
Investing in both real estate and real estate-secured loans provides MVP REIT potentially greater flexibility in evaluating assets. The REIT can acquire an entire building, an attractive mortgage, or even provide short-term loans—providing greater investment options.


Appreciation
Direct ownership of commercial property acquired at favorable prices may provide returns that are not available through investment in real estate-secured loans as a result of value appreciation. The appreciation is limited by the amount of funds invested in real estate as compared to loans secured by real estate.




Diverse Income Sources May Provide Greater Balance
MVP REIT invests in both direct real estate and real estate-secured loans, providing it with multiple sources of revenue.

Real Estate Returns vs. Inflation
Whether their portfolio can keep pace with the rate of inflation is a common concern among investors. Real estate has long been considered by many to be an effective hedge against inflation, as returns for both public and private real estate generally outpace inflation.
While no one can predict when or if significant inflation will strike, well-balanced investment portfolios typically include assets that serve as protection, or a hedge, against inflation’s corrosive impact on savings.

What is a REIT?

MVP REIT » What is a REIT? 
Understanding Real Estate Investment Trusts
What is a REIT?
A real estate investment trust, or REIT, is a company that combines the capital of many investors to acquire or provide financing for a diversified portfolio of real estate investments under professional management. REITs are required by law to pay distributions to stockholders of at least 90 percent of their annual taxable income.
Congress created REITs in 1960 to allow individuals the opportunity to invest in large-scale commercial properties-expensive assets that typically had been owned by institutions and the very wealthy. The REIT industry has grown dramatically in size and importance since that time.
Types of REITs
Real estate investment trusts typically come in three varieties:

Equity REITs (which directly own properties)
Mortgage REITs (which provide loans to property owners)
Hybrid REITs (which invest in both properties and loans)

REITs At-A-Glance
Real estate investment trusts, or REITs, are companies that:

Pool the capital of many investors to acquire or provide financing for real estate.
Allow individuals to invest in a diversified real estate portfolio managed by a professional management team.
Are required to pay distributions to investors of at least 90 percent of their taxable income (excluding net capital gains) each year.


Intended Objectives of a REIT


Traded vs. Non-Traded REITs
Many REITs trade on a stock exchange, such as the NYSE and NASDAQ. They are liquid investments that may be bought and sold daily, and whose prices fluctuate with the market.
Non-traded REITs are similar in structure to their traded counterparts, but do not trade on an exchange. As a result, non-traded REITs are generally illiquid investments.
Both traded and non-traded REITs are regulated by the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission.

Diversification and Balance - MVP REIT

MVP REIT is closed to new investments.

Diversification and Balance

MVP REIT » Investor Highlights » Diversification and Balance 
The current historically low interest rate environment poses a significant challenge for those seeking to generate investment income. MVP REIT, Inc. (“MVP REIT”) may offer income-seeking investors a solution. MVP REIT seeks to provide its stockholders*:

Monthly distributions
Capital appreciation that may be earned through an increase in value of MVP REIT’s real estate portfolio upon the end of the investment holding period

Strategic Opportunity
MVP REIT intends to employ a strategic diversification*** investment plan centered on opportunities in growing markets across the United States where commercial real estate values may be depressed. We believe there may be an opportunity to acquire undervalued income-producing assets in these markets, thereby potentially providing additional profit upon their sale, should property values increase.**

Income-producing commercial properties that are available at attractive prices, thereby providing potential upside.
Real estate-secured loans tied to income-producing commercial real estate assets that may provide steady distributions.

This hybrid strategy is designed to provide investors with a balanced commercial real estate investment opportunity that may deliver steady distributions and long-term capital appreciation.
*** Diversification does not ensure a profit or guarantee against a loss.

Target Markets
We believe demand for commercial property across the U.S. will continue to grow based upon a number of factors, including continued population growth. Many commercial real estate markets in these regions remain at or near the lows established during the Great Recession.


* CLICK HERE TO VIEW THE RISK FACTORS, which may affect our ability to achieve these results.
** MVP REIT has not yet acquired a diverse portfolio of assets.

LAS VEGAS, May 1, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- MVP REIT, Inc. ("MVP I") and MVP REIT II, Inc. ("MVP II") today jointly announced that, after reviewing strategic alternatives, a special committee of the board of directors of MVP I (the "MVP I Special Committee") has accepted a non-binding Letter of Intent ("LOI") from MVP II regarding a proposed merger of MVP I with MVP II.  If necessary approvals are received and other conditions are satisfied, the merger consideration payable by MVP II to each holder of common stock, $0.001 par value per share, of MVP I would be 0.365 shares of common stock, $0.0001 par value per share, of MVP II.








The LOI also provides, among other non-binding terms and conditions, that any definitive merger agreement agreed to by the parties will include go-shop and termination fee provisions. The proposed merger is subject to substantial conditions to consummation, including the entry by MVP I and MVP II into a definitive merger agreement, certain third party approvals and, if a definitive merger agreement is reached, any required stockholder approvals.  There can be no assurance that the proposed merger will be consummated.
In connection with the proposed merger, MVP I also announced that it would suspend its distribution reinvestment plan and share repurchase plan pending the consummation of the proposed merger.  In accordance with the distribution reinvestment plan and share repurchase plan, the suspension of the distribution reinvestment plan and share repurchase plan will take effect on May 11, 2017 and June 1, 2017, or 10 days and 30 days, respectively, after the date of this press release providing notice of suspension.
MVP I also announced, in connection with the proposed merger, that the monthly distribution for record holders as of May 24, 2017 expected to be paid on June 10, 2017 will consist of a $0.0225 cash distribution per share (3% per annum based upon the initial $9.00 offering price), a stock dividend equal to .002414 shares of stock for each share owned (3% per annum based upon the initial $9.00 offering price), and a special one-time distribution of $0.0105 in additional cash distributions per share (0.7% per annum for the remaining two months left in the quarter based upon the initial $9.00 offering price).  Thereafter, MVP I anticipates paying monthly cash distributions of $0.0225 per share and stock dividends of .0024 shares for each share of stock owned. 
The MVP I Special Committee, consisting entirely of independent directors, was advised by Robert A. Stranger & Co., Inc. and Venable LLP as financial and legal advisers, respectively.  The proposed merger terms were negotiated on behalf of MVP II by a special committee of its board of directors, consisting entirely of independent directors and advised by Houlihan Lokey Capital, Inc. and Vinson & Elkins L.L.P., as financial and legal advisers, respectively.
