EVP, Technology and Operations Allstate Insurance




Suren Gupta is executive vice president of technology & operations for Allstate Insurance Company. He is a member of Allstate’s senior leadership team reporting to the Chairman, President and CEO.
In this role he leads a global organization delivering innovative and transformational solutions for Allstate’s customers, agency owners and employees. He is responsible for enterprise-wide technology and network operations. His responsibilities for operations include providing service and support for approximately 16 million households and about 11,600 exclusive Allstate agencies and financial representatives in the U.S. and Canada.
Gupta joined Allstate in 2011, bringing leadership, information technology, operations, product development and sales experience to Allstate. Since then, he has been instrumental in enhancing delivery capabilities, focusing on innovation and establishing global operations to enhance 24/7 support and development capabilities.
Previously, Gupta was Wells Fargo executive vice president and group chief information officer for consumer lending. Under his leadership, real estate lending was re-engineered with new delivery capabilities that enabled the field sales force to serve customers more effectively with just-in-time information.
Earlier in his career, Gupta provided key leadership and vision as a founding member of the corporate executive team of Airclic Inc., a startup wireless Internet venture, and was senior vice president, informational technology and operations for GMAC Residential, a division of General Motors. Gupta also has held senior operations, sales, marketing and strategic development roles at INTELSAT, a groundbreaking satellite telecommunications company.
Gupta is a graduate of the Advanced Management Program at Harvard Business School. He also received a master’s degree in computer engineering from West Virginia University and an MBA from George Mason University. He serves on the Chicago Public Library Foundation Board and on the board of Pratham U.S.A, the American chapter for Pratham, which was established in 1994 to provide pre-school education to children in India’s slums. It now is the country’s largest nongovernmental organization with activities in 21 states of India to to provide education to millions of children who might otherwise work instead of attend school.
