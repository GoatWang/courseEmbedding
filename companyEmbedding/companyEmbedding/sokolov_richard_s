Richard Sokolov


 
 
 



Role
Director
Qualifications
BEng (Mech) Hons






“Seeing people’s eyes light up when together you get the “aha” moment or when someone grabs a product and smiles, never gets old”
Richard Sokolov - Director




In spite of a burning desire for a career in professional football, Richard built on the talents he did have in physics and a boundless curiosity about how things work to become a very successful engineer. More than 16 years on, he still loves to create, to make things what they are and do what they do. As the resident “prototype breaker” at ide, Richard excels in leading the team in exploring possibilities and coming up with breakthrough ideas.


With Richard’s long and distinguished track record in creating and launching new products, the golden moments when it all comes together are still a real triumph and delight for him.  And his abiding interest in the great game of football lives on.  When he’s not traveling to games or taking a few moguls on the ski slopes, you’ll probably find him talking about footy with his mates.
