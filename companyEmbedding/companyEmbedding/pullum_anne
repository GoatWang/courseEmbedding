Willis Group Appoints Simon Gaffney as COO of Willis Global 
and Willis Limited and Anne Pullum as Director of Corporate 
Development 
London, UK, 15 May 2014 – Willis Group Holdings plc (NYSE: WSH), the global risk adviser, insurance and reinsurance broker, today announced the appointment of 
Anne Pullum as Director of Corporate Development to succeed Simon Gaffney, who 
becomes Chief Operating Officer (COO) of Willis Global. 
Ms Pullum will play a key role in determining the group’s strategy, working across a number of key functions. She joins Willis from McKinsey & Company, where she was an Engagement Manager serving financial services and natural resources clients. 
Previously, Ms Pullum held strategic and analyst roles at Greenspan Associates and 
Goldman Sachs. She holds an MBA from INSEAD. In her new position at Willis, she 
will report to Group Chief Executive Officer Dominic Casserley.
In his new role, Simon Gaffney will lead the operations function of Willis Global, 
which encompasses Willis’s reinsurance, specialty insurance and risk consulting 
businesses. Mr Gaffney will report to Steve Hearn, Chairman and CEO of Willis 
Global and Deputy CEO of the Willis Group.
Mr Gaffney also joins the board of Willis Limited, the Willis Group’s principal UK regulated entity, as COO and as a Director. Mr Gaffney joined Willis in 2000, when Willis acquired the risk information research and technology firm W.I.R.E. Ltd. Since then he has served in a number of corporate roles encompassing planning and 
analysis, strategy, ecommerce and technology and business transformation.
Commenting on these appointments, Dominic Casserley said: “Investment in 
business development and operations is an integral part of our strategy to improve 
our operational efficiency and to connect our business globally, providing our clients 
with the best of Willis’s risk management, analytics and broking expertise. Both Anne and Simon will be working alongside leaders across our company to implement our plans for growth, helping to connect our innovation and on-the-ground relationships to drive solutions for clients right across the risk set they face.”
Mr Gaffney said: “The business units that form the global segment of Willis cover a very broad spectrum of insurance, reinsurance broking and risk consulting activities. We work with clients to address their challenges right across the globe in a diverse range of geographies and sectors. Key to our ongoing success is our ability to connect Willis’s deep industry specific knowledge with our global broking capabilities and international network, as we continue to deliver world-class risk management solutions for our clients.”
Ms Pullum said: “Willis has a huge opportunity to grow its business across industries and geographies worldwide, building on its existing capabilities and creating new products and risk management strategies in all global markets. I look forward to building on the work Simon has done, working with teams throughout the business to develop our offering and help drive our performance for the benefit of our clients, our Associates and our shareholders.”

Willis Group Appoints Simon Gaffney as COO of Willis Global and Willis Limited and Anne Pullum as Director of Corporate Development













Posted on 19 May 2014 by Neilson













Willis Group Holdings plc, the global risk adviser,  insurance and reinsurance broker, today announced the appointment of  Anne Pullum as Director of Corporate Development to succeed Simon  Gaffney, who  becomes Chief Operating Officer (COO) of Willis Global.
Ms Pullum will play a key role in determining the group's strategy,  working across a number of key functions. She joins Willis from McKinsey  & Company, where she was an Engagement Manager serving financial  services and natural resources clients.  Previously, Ms Pullum held strategic and analyst roles at Greenspan  Associates and  Goldman Sachs. She holds an MBA from INSEAD. In her new position at  Willis, she  will report to Group Chief Executive Officer Dominic Casserley.
In his new role, Simon Gaffney will lead the operations function of Willis Global,  which encompasses Willis's reinsurance, specialty insurance and risk consulting  businesses. Mr Gaffney will report to Steve Hearn, Chairman and CEO of Willis  Global and Deputy CEO of the Willis Group.
Mr Gaffney also joins the board of Willis Limited, the Willis Group's  principal UK regulated entity, as COO and as a Director. Mr Gaffney  joined Willis in 2000, when Willis acquired the risk information  research and technology firm W.I.R.E. Ltd. Since then he has served in a  number of corporate roles encompassing planning and  analysis, strategy, ecommerce and technology and business  transformation.
Commenting on these appointments, Dominic Casserley said: "Investment  in  business development and operations is an integral part of our strategy  to improve  our operational efficiency and to connect our business globally,  providing our clients  with the best of Willis's risk management, analytics and broking  expertise. Both Anne and Simon will be working alongside leaders across  our company to implement our plans for growth, helping to connect our  innovation and on-the-ground relationships to drive solutions for  clients right across the risk set they face."
Mr Gaffney said: "The business units that form the global segment of  Willis cover a very broad spectrum of insurance, reinsurance broking and  risk consulting activities. We work with clients to address their  challenges right across the globe in a diverse range of geographies and  sectors. Key to our ongoing success is our ability to connect Willis's  deep industry specific knowledge with our global broking capabilities  and international network, as we continue to deliver world-class risk  management solutions for our clients."
Ms Pullum said: "Willis has a huge opportunity to grow its business  across industries and geographies worldwide, building on its existing  capabilities and creating new products and risk management strategies in  all global markets. I look forward to building on the work Simon has  done, working with teams throughout the business to develop our offering  and help drive our performance for the benefit of our clients, our  Associates and our shareholders."
