Private Equity
BW Capital Partners manages a portfolio of private equity investments and looks to invest in growing, well-managed private businesses.
 

Investment Philosophy
Active Portfolio


BW Capital Partners invests in growth companies which are led by strong management teams.  We look to partner with founders and management to facilitate growth through organic means as well as through thoughtful and diligent acquisition strategies.  We generally source opportunities through our network of industry contacts and typically avoid shopped transactions.  We have access to capital from our relationship with a $2 billion+ Chicago family office as well as from our investor network that has invested in deals with us over the years.  Our investment outlook can be different than the traditional private equity firm model due to our family office model, where we can have a longer investment horizon.  We focus our efforts on the following industries:

Business and Financial Services
Specialty Pharmaceutical
Media Services
Consumer Services

We will consider opportunities outside these industries where the management team is exceptional and growth prospects are robust.
Transaction Size
We typically look to deploy $5 to $15 million in capital per transaction, whether initially or over time.   However, we have the capability to fund significantly larger transactions where we feel we have a competitive advantage over other potential investors.
We have flexibility in time, structure and size of each investment.  Historically we have invested capital into the following types of situations:

Management led buyouts
Growth equity investments/late stage venture capital
Leveraged buyouts
Majority and minority investment structures

Off-Site Storage
Don’t lose your valuable video footage! In the event your DVR is damaged or stolen, off-site storage ensures your data is backed up to DTT’s secure video cloud. Data is uploaded from the DVR to the backup server every 2 minutes, ensuring that the minutes immediately prior to an incident are captured. Off-site storage is paired with DVR replacement insurance so the cost of new hardware won’t come out of your own pocket. Choose from two different options:
 Standard Off-Site Storage
 – Video footage from any 1 camera backed up and stored for 3 days.
 Off-Site Storage PLUS
 – Video footage from any 1 camera backed up and stored for 90 days. – Adheres to PCI Compliance regulations, which requires that video cameras monitor entry/exit point of sensitive areas.

×

CloudQuery™
CloudQuery™ allows a deeper dive into your video exception data. With highly advanced filtering and multiple priority levels, you can review transactional activity across your entire enterprise including trending across locations, cashiers, dayparts, exception types, and more.

With RISAPLUS, your video will be uploaded to MyDTT™ and available for viewing and sharing directly on the portal, without the need to download any files. RISAPLUS offers cross-platform compatibility so footage can be viewed from any device.

Sam Naficy  |  Founder/Chief Executive Officer, DTT
 
Sam Naficy is the Founder and Chief Executive Officer of DTT, a company he founded in 1999. Mr. Naficy is by nature a serial entrepreneur and has founded numerous companies in a variety of industries. He has approximately 20 years of active business experience at senior executive levels in business sectors including but not limited to: pharmaceuticals, retail/distribution, quick service restaurant development, and technology.
In October of 1998, in the midst of the technology and internet boom, Naficy incorporated Drive Thru Technology (DTT). With a keen interest in the food industry, specifically the concept of franchising, DTT was formed to supply technology solutions to the restaurant and hospitality industries and has emerged as the premier manufacturer of digital surveillance products to this niche market.
Prior to DTT Inc., Naficy founded The NORG Group which entered into Joint Venture agreements with the 99 Cents Only Corporation (a publicly traded company on the NYSE–NDN). NORG established joint venture partners for the 99 Cents Only Corporation in China, Guatemala and Mexico. Those relationships continue to this day; however, NORG is no longer involved.
Prior to The NORG Group, Naficy established Daru Nardin, a pharmaceutical brokerage firm specializing in the Middle East. During its first 18 months Daru Nardin attained the exclusive distribution rights to Merck Sharpe & Dohme (MSD — Merck) and Faulding Pharmaceuticals (one of Australia’s largest pharmaceutical companies) for sales into Iran. US sanctions against Iran barred any US based entity to do business in that country. These rights expired in the summer of 2007.
