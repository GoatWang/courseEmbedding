Boomkat Product Review:
This is a 69 track edition of over two hours of Raymond Scott's unreleased electronic recordings from the 1950s and 60s. 
In 1946, Scott formed Manhattan Research Inc. (MRI), billed as Designers and Manufacturers of Electronic Music and Musique Concrète Devices and Systems. His colleague Robert Moog said, Scott was definitely in the forefront of developing electronic music technology and in the forefront of using it commercially as a musician.
Soothing Sounds For Baby was just a warm-up. With MRI, prepare yourself for something beyond the pleasant parameters of pop. Scott's electronic experiments took him to uncharted netherworlds. The results are intriguing, compelling, and often far ahead of their time and ours. The personnel on MRI consists of such Scott inventions as the Clavivox, a keyboard theremin that was later modified to produce an array of sounds similar to a synthesizer; the Electronium, an instantaneous composition-performance console (conceived in the '50s, developed in the '60s, used at Motown in the '70s); polyphonic sequencers, including his Circle Machine ; the Rhythm Modulator; and the Bass Line Generator; along with existing sound devices (e.g., the Ondioline and tone generators).
The recordings range from detergent jingles to decidedly non-commercial -- uncommercial, even -- experimental adventures in sound sculpture. Aside from several samples of Scott re-tooling old titles (e.g., 1937's The Toy Trumpet and Twilight in Turkey), the remainder is new material. Also included, for the first time in commercial release, are several mid-1960s film soundtrack collaborations between Scott and Jim Henson.
Having been rated by everybody from Coldcut to Radiohead as one of the most important works of electronic music ever released, Manhattan Research Inc was listed in pretty much everybody's top 10 listings for the year 2000 when it originally came out on CD. Absolutely stunning.

        Payment Security
      

        We take the security of our website and of your transactions
        extremely seriously.  We encrypt all traffic involving personal
        data with industry-standard SSL certificates and we are also
        PCI compliant - meaning that we follow all current data security
        standards and undergo weekly scans monitoring our security status. 
      

        Additionally, we do not store any card details at all, all
        payments are handled using a system of Tokenisation which is
        an industry-standard method of secure payment handling. When
        you place an order with us payment is either handled via your
        Paypal account or if you choose to pay by credit/debit card we
        create a "Token" with your payment details which is stored by
        the Bank payment gateway. When you return to make a purchase
        it basically reactivates the "Token" so no details need to be
        entered again and those details are not stored by us.

        Estimated Shipping Dates
      

        Estimated shipping dates are accurate to the best of our
        knowledge, based on the latest stock information made available
        to us from the supplier. Available items should ship to you within
        the time-frame indicated. If there are any unforeseen issues with
        availability we will notify you immediately.

        Shipping FAQs
      

        Free Shipping: We offer free postage on orders over
        £50.00 to the UK sent via Royal Mail.*
      

        *To qualify for free postage the order must be sent as one package.
        Therefore, all items must be in stock or you should be happy to wait
        until all items become available to ship so they can be sent as one
        package. Downloads and Gift Vouchers do not count towards free
        shipping. Please note that Pre-Orders do not count towards free
        shipping as their release dates are liable to fluctuate.
      
Stock Status

        If your order contains items that have different estimated
        shipping dates (for example, ‘available to pre-order’, ‘in stock’,
        ‘available to ship in 1-3 days’) you will be given an option either
        to wait for everything to become available to ship in one package,
        or to ship each item as soon as it becomes available.  Stock arrives
        at the office throughout the day so the stock status of items on the
        website can change several times a day.
      

        Important Note: all items that are not currently displaying as
        In Stock need to be ordered in from our suppliers and the estimated
        shipping dates are only an indication of when we expect those items
        to come into stock. If there are any unforeseen issues with
        availability we will notify you immediately.
      
Premium Packaging

        At checkout you are able to select a premium packaging option
        for a fee of £1.50. We pack all of our orders using appropriate
        packaging, however when you pick this option we use a wider
        cruciform offering additional protection if you have a
        particularly heavy-handed postman.
      
UK and International Shipping Options

        We offer two services:
      

        1.  First Class Royal Mail - for UK and for International
        orders: The package will be delivered by your national postal service.
      

        Royal Mail sets limits on the weight of packages, so if the order
        becomes too heavy to ship in one package the order will be split
        into two or more packages. The packages will be marked accordingly,
        for example, if an order has to be sent over two packages the packages
        would be labelled ‘1 of 2’ and ‘2 of 2’.
      

        2. Parcelforce tracked courier service:
      

        This comprises a flat box fee for UK (and some European countries),
        and a sliding scale based on weight for other countries. Parcelforce
        is a Monday - Friday service. Packages sent via Parcelforce can be
        tracked here:
        http://www.parcelforce.com/track-trace


        Parcelforce can only ship to PO boxes in certain countries,
        details can be found once you have made your country selection
        at checkout.
      

        Once you have added items to your crate you can select your
        country and choose either to send everything in one package or
        to ship as soon as the items become available. At this point the
        total given is a guide to the cost and more shipping configurations
        are available once you have logged in and proceeded to checkout.
        At the checkout you will still be able to add or take away items
        from the crate and change/compare your shipping options.
      

        Pre-orders are treated as separate packages to items that are
        either in stock or available to order. If pre-orders share the
        same release date then they can be ordered and shipped together.
        However pre-order release dates are liable to change, if you have
        ordered two pre-orders with the same date to ship together and
        then one release date gets pushed back, we will ship the available
        pre-order straight away and the second pre-order as soon as it
        becomes available with no extra shipping charge.
      

        If you choose to ship your order across more than one package you
        can select the Royal Mail service for one package and Parcelforce
        courier for the other.
      

        Exceptions:
      

        * if an individual item weighs more than 2kg and you are outside
        of the UK the package must be sent via courier as Royal Mail sets
        a 2kg limit on packages.
      

        * Royal Mail covers postage all countries, however Parcelforce is
        not available in every country.
      
Missing Packages

        If an order does not arrive, we can issue a replacement package.
        In the UK we consider a package to be missing after 15 working
        days. Most international orders are considered missing after 25
        working days with the exception of France, South America and Africa
        - packages to these destinations are considered missing after 60
        working days. Before we can issue a replacement, customers must
        have checked with their local depot/sorting office to see if their
        package is awaiting pick up. If we think there is an issue with
        the shipping address, or that packages are being stolen in the
        post, we reserve the right to refuse future orders to these
        addresses.
      
Insurance

        We automatically add an insurance supplement to orders over £30. 
        Orders between £30 - £49.99 are charged a 60p insurance supplement.
        Orders over £50 are charged a £3 insurance supplement.
      
Returned Packages

        If a package is returned to us because of an incomplete address,
        or because it was not collected from a local depot, we will have to
        charge you again in order to re-send it.  We will get in touch with
        you before any package is re-sent.
      
Delivery Times

        The delivery times below are estimates.  A lot depends on the
        efficiency of your local post service.
      
Royal Mail:

        UK (inc. Northern Ireland): 1 - 2 working days
        Western Europe: 3 - 5 working days
        Eastern Europe: 5 - 12 working days

        longer shipping to Finland, Greece, Italy, Norway, Portugal and Sweden.

        to 7 days for other countries, please get in touch for further

        Rest of World: 2-7 working days for most countries, please get in

        on the area - for further information please get in touch.
      

        Please note that the estimated shipping times above can be
        affected by circumstances beyond our control such as bad
        weather, delays at customs, busy times of year etc.

        Stock Status
      

        Physical Products have different types of stock availability, for example:

        In Stock (Ready to ship)
        Pre-Order with estimated shipping dates
        Available to Order (Estimated shipping between 1-3 working days)
        Available to Order (Estimated shipping between 3-7 working days)
        Available to Order (Estimated shipping between 7-14 working days)

        If your order contains items that have different estimated shipping
        dates you will be given an option either to wait for everything to
        become available to ship in one package, or to ship each item as soon
        as it becomes available. Stock arrives at the office throughout the
        day so the stock status of items on the website can change several
        times a day.

        Important Note: all items that are not currently displaying as In Stock
        need to be ordered in from our suppliers and the estimated shipping
        dates are only an indication of when we expect those items to come
        into stock. If there are any unforeseen issues with availability we
        will notify you immediately.

Forever a coach and a teacher. Fan of horse racing, NCAA Volleyball, and MLB. Live in the Twin Cities• Acts 20:24Jul 8, 2014How to Alienate a HorseplayerAn Update Two Years LaterJuly 2012I ran my Canterbury Park MVP card through the shredder. I am on day 12 of boycotting my home track- the place where I was introduced to horse racing some eight or nine years ago. While the Canterbury Park track personnel were celebrating their new partnership with Mystic Lake Casino, I was busy evaluating new tracks where I could shift my bankroll.The last two years Canterbury had pushed for legislation that would allow the horse track to add slots. Like so many other racetracks, they were looking for revenue from gaming to fuel their dying horse racing industry. Mystic Lake Casino, owned and operated by the Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community, is literally down the street from Canterbury. It became a battle of lobbyist. The two parties shocked everyone and reached a historic agreement. Pretty much Mystic Lake gained sponsorship opportunities at Canterbury and peace of mind knowing there would not be competition down the street. Canterbury gained $75 million dispersed over a ten year period, an obvious boost to purses.My problem arose because I could not reserve my regular clubhouse table on the big day of racing for the 2012 meet. The reservation was being made well in advance, but I was informed that all the clubhouse tables were reserved for tribal personnel. I, the diehard horseplayer, had been placed on the backburner. Almost a decade of wagering on the product and now my clubhouse seat had been sold to the highest bidder. I would have accepted that the event had sold out. Instead, I was told that no one can reserve clubhouse seating on that day as all seating is being held for tribal personnel and sponsors. Canterbury Park sent me a clear message that my dollars wagered on their product and my enthusiastic support of their brand in the social media world, did not matter. After years of attending live racing and wagering on the product, I distanced myself from the racetrack. It appeared Canterbury had no interest in pleasing the horseplayer.Present DayThe agreement between Mystic Lake and Canterbury Park significantly increased purses for horse racing. I could see that two years ago. It was a business decision; it was the best decision they had available. Now we see larger fields, bigger purses, and some big name horses and jockeys that come to Canterbury Park for the featured days.In 2012, Canterbury Park ranked 38th in the HANA track ratings. The 2014 edition showed the Shakopee track at number 20. That’s a notable increase, especially in an era where tracks are slipping. While casino money has given New Mexico horse racing a boost in purses, most of their tracks are still in the bottom of HANA’s track ratings. The same could be said about PARX, Penn National, Mountaineer, and others. Slots money alone does not solve the issues. Large fields, low takeouts, and a quality racing product appeal to horseplayers. Attracting and satisfying horseplayers are the keys to increasing the handle. And when handle goes up, life at the track is better for everyone.Despite my boycott of Canterbury, in 2013 they began to do things to attract the horseplayer. Maybe I had been bumped for tribal personnel and sponsors, but it was just one day. What Canterbury did in 2013 and 2014 with a low 14% takeout on a 50 cent Pick 4 made horseplayers happy. The Mystic Lake agreement boosted purses. Larger purses brought some new barns, but more importantly it brought larger fields. And large fields and low takeout are the things that make a track stand out in the HANA Track Ratings. HANA 2013 Track Ratings reported that the Canterbury handle had increased 11.84%. The 2014 Track Ratings show an incredible 22.90% increase in handle. So, despite one frustrated horseplayer from two years ago, the handle at Canterbury Park keeps going up. And that is maybe the most important statistic in the racing business.July 2012I sit in the comfort of the onehorsestable home office and follow live horse racing via TwinSpires. This is not the 1970s. I have no need for a live racing product in my backyard. I don’t need Canterbury Park’s simulcast center or a local OTB. Thanks to a laptop and a high speed internet connection, I have ample opportunities to wager on horse racing. Why don’t racetracks realize that horseplayers have options? I can move my money to tracks with the best racing, the lowest takeout, the biggest fields, or whatever I choose. Since my boycott of Canterbury Park, I have been able to focus heavily on the final days of racing at Indiana Downs, harness racing at Balmoral, and my usual steady diet of Arlington Park. To modify a quote from the HANA Harness blog, “You may have certain tracks where you do better than others and you can’t ignore that. But when all else is equal, horseplayers need to be looking for the best deal and the tracks that cater to the horseplayers.”In all fairness, the Canterbury Park Twitter account responded promptly and engaged with me to address my unhappiness. We exchanged e-mails, and the person behind the account promised a resolution by the end of the day. Despite the noble efforts of this track employee, the answer I received was the same information I heard over the phone initially: 1) No, I cannot reserve ANY seat in the clubhouse level, 2) EVERYTHING is reserved for tribal personnel and sponsors, and 3) you can put your name on a waiting list.I wanted to shout, “Waiting list? Don’t you know WHO I AM?!” But I didn’t. And in reality, my wagering will have little impact on their handle. I just thought they cared more about their handicappers. A Canterbury employee named Andrew went above and beyond to try and help this disgruntled horseplayer have a seat for the big day. Several people contacted me throughout the month of July. I am sure they were limited in what they could actually offer me. In the end, they did offer me a table. After all the tribal personnel and sponsors had been accounted for, they called me about a table that was available. I declined. But I appreciated the effort.Present DayMy boycott lasted from July 2012 until the day of the Wood Memorial in April 2013. No live racing and no simulcast center for me. All my wagering went through my ADW account. The boycott ended because Canterbury is my favorite place to be. There is nothing my wife and I enjoy in the Twin Cities more than live racing at Canterbury. And the simulcast center is my second home. I love being there on dark days in the fall and spring to play other meets. Dubai World Cup Day is one of my favorite days and I love being at Canterbury to bet those races. Like all good boycotts, it had to come to an end. I wanted to watch and wager on the Wood Memorial, and I wanted to spend the day at one of my favorite places. I have been back at my regular clubhouse table ever since. I had to get a new MVP Card since I shredded the other one, but it was good to be back.SummaryMaryland Jockey Club President Tom Chuckas said, “The money that comes to the racing industry from gaming is basically a state grant. And the purpose is to get our industry back in line and to get it back where it should be.” Though the scenario in Minnesota was different than Maryland, the principle is the same. Canterbury needs to look at the Mystic Lake agreement as a way to get racing back on track. The money may not last forever. I still think Canterbury should pay more attention to the horseplayers. Everything seems geared to the $2 per race player and not the horseplayer. But, the agreement has brought larger fields. The track listened to handicappers when it implemented a 50 cent Pick 4 with a low 14% takeout. And large fields and low takeout are two things that every horseplayer loves.Last year it was clear what impact the Mystic Lake agreement had made on horse racing in Minnesota. On the day of the Mystic Lake Mile, our little track hosted some big names. Mike Stidham, Chris Block, Miguel Mena, Mike Maker, Ken and Sarah Ramsey, Chris Landeros, Louie Roussel, and Chris Block. Those were some of the connections represented. That never would have happened before. But I hope Canterbury heeds the advice of Tom Chuckas. Chuckas said, “Anybody that looks at it that this is free money or will be here until the end of time, I think they’re making a serious mistake… We should be using that money to build our business and put us in a position that if it lessens or even goes away, that we can survive.”“The goal wasn’t casino,” Canterbury Park’s Randy Sampson said back in 2012. “The goal was horse racing — making horse racing successful. This absolutely does that.” Two years later, with large fields, bigger purses, and a feature race that attracts big name connections, indeed it has. But in the meantime, build the business. Don’t alienate the horseplayers. Keep them happy. Put yourself in a position so that you can survive if the the slots revenue dries up in Pennsylvania. Put yourself in a position so that you can survive when the Mystic Lake agreement ends one day. Make sure you still have the horseplayers. It is this group of people that you always want to appeal to, day in and day out, year in and year out.About the AuthorScott Raymond is a writer, a horseplayer, and an avid reader.
