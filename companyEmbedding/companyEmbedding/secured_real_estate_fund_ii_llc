INCOME FUND I

 


















Our investment Strategy is to buy commercial properties at what we identify as deep discounts. Our investors value our expertise in our diligent underwriting process to acquire what we believe to be high quality properties with historically strong cash flow. Our qualified team looks for these types of assets across the nation—meaning a regionally diverse portfolio that we feel is more resilient to the ebb and flow of the real estate market. We are a boutique asset manager that is offering a private fund to allow accredited investors to participate. We offer four tranches: 8.5%, 10%, 12% preferred targeted annual return, plus a new 1-D tranche with a profit share and fees — Please speak with one of our Investor Relations representatives or read the PPM for further details. Note: Series 1B 10%, Series 1C 12% and Series 1D 10% plus profit share is currently closed.

Secured Income Fund II, LLC 



















Fund Type: Private Mortgage Lending





StrategyHow It WorksBenefitsFund News



Fund inception: 2010
Traditionally, people have looked to residential real estate as a source of easy credit and did not tap into the equity available in commercial or investment properties. The market has shifted, and now that “new” source of equity is being utilized. In response, Stonecrest is taking advantage of lending opportunities in equity-rich, realistically priced residential, commercial, and investment properties for qualified borrowers.
Stonecrest has taken the market experience and strategic approach that made our Private Capital Fund a success and applied them to the Secured Income Fund II. Our goal is to grow the Fund portfolio while delivering stable yields and minimizing risk. Secured Income Fund II offers investors healthy returns on loans with attractive loan-to-value ratios, which translates into lower risk.






Fund managers solicit, underwrite, process, and fund private money loans for commercial and residential borrowers in California. The Fund has produced a stable yield since inception – outperforming income markets and competitors.
Secured Income Fund II, LLC is modeled on our successful Private Capital Fund (est. 2004). Our proven underwriting guidelines are the same for both funds:

Ensure that there is sufficient equity in the underlying property
Ensure that our borrowers are financially able to make their loan payments
Identify our borrowers’ exit strategies in advance
Perform thorough internal appraisal and review of property
Secure stable yield for fund investors
Cross-collateralize when possible for additional security
Place emphasis on income producing properties that generate positive cash flow
Avoid overexposure to a single borrower
Stay sensitive to average loan amounts relative to the overall value of fund









 Stable yields.
 Intra-fund diversification to minimize overall portfolio risk.
 Safe positions in equity-strong properties.
 Choice between income or compounding distribution.
 Qualification for 401K, IRA, and pension plans.
 Professional full-service account management.
