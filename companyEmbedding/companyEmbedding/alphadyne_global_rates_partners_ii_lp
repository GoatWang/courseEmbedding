About Alphadyne
Alphadyne Asset Management is a multi-billion dollar alternative investment management firm founded in 2005 by Philippe Khuong-Huu and Bart Broadman, who were colleagues at J.P.Morgan.  Investors include pension funds, insurance companies, asset managers, investment consultants and sovereign wealth funds. Alphadyne has offices in New York, Singapore and London.
Alphadyne pursues macro and fixed income relative value investment strategies in global interest rate, foreign exchange, equity, commodity and credit markets. Investments are made in both developed and emerging market countries. The firm’s activity is weighted to interest rate and foreign exchange markets and to execution via swaps, options and cash instruments. Alphadyne seeks to generate superior risk-adjusted returns with low correlation to the main asset classes.
