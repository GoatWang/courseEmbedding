Feature Article: It’s Time for the Bottom Line to Get a Little Bigger

October 2009 / Feature Articles


   Download article as PDF     		Download article as PDF 	 Kristoffer E. Nelson
As I’ve discussed recently in my blog Integral Business, the future of sustainable, profitable and socially responsible companies rest well beyond what is now commonly referred to as “triple bottom line” organizations. Indeed an evolutionary step, achieving a triple bottom line status is a great challenge that inspires great merit—it’s a huge accomplishment. And, we need more.
There is a lot of talk in the business world, especially the post-modern business world of … 




Leadership Coaching Tip: You Are Your Most Important Tool

August 2009 / Leadership Coaching Tips


   Download article as PDF     		Download article as PDF 	 As leaders, coaches, and change agents each of us have so much to give and offer. It seems from the desire to give, the fear of not knowing, and the push for a result we can so easily loose ourselves in the process. I’ve certainly found myself so lost in trying to solve someone’s problem or decide what technique to employ I have completely lost touch, becoming removed from myself and the person in front of …

Magdalena Dumitrana on 09/17 – An Integral Catholic Leader: Father Anthony de Mello, SJ - 07/06/2017Thank you for this article.
I have discovered Anthony de Mello several years ago- at that time there was no posts about him on you tube and not too many possibilities to get his books.
I believe he was a gift of God and every time there is an opportunity, I talk or write about him. Well, not too much hope for changing people...

YOU SAY YOU WANT A REVOLUTION? - NESIFORUM on 8/31 – 3D-Management: An Integral Business Theory - 01/04/2017[…] 3D Management: An integrally built metatheory of management developed by Marco Robledo (yes, that’s me). It stands for Three-Dimensional Management, in reference to three fundamental and irreducible dimensions: science, arts and ethics, which refer respectively to the techno-economical, the developmental- emotional and the moral aspects of organizational reality. Those three are integrated in an essential unit by fourth one, the spiritual dimension, which strives for unity and meaning. 3D Management denies the absolutist imperialism of the economic in business and replaces it by a harmonic triumvirate that takes equally into account other objectives such as the vertical development of people and social responsibility and total stakeholder orientation, all of them integrated towards a higher purpose.

Paul Hess on 11/30 – Transformations on the Path to Really Teal & Turquoise Organizations - 12/02/2016A customer focused strategy requires higher levels of integration: it is relational and moral based on empathy and other moral skills. It forces individuals to listen with emotional embodied qualities because that is what listening involves  and gives feedback for reflection beyond the current construction of self.  A customer focus end oriented and thus paves the way for rational coordination to escape the iron cage of bureaucracy that turns means into ends. Human ends provide metrics for scientific improvement in engineering terms to replace abstract formal rationality of remote control accounting. UR is in the ecosystem which is richly connected to all these levels: cost and productivity in LR; mind body and human nature conscious in UL, and a positive vision of environmentalism in a culture of abundance that integrates quality of life and ends for stakeholders in LL within the morality of empathy, service and ethics of contribution. That's how this model of the sustainable firm integrates all quads.
Eugene Pustoshkin on 11/30 – Transformations on the Path to Really Teal & Turquoise Organizations - 12/02/2016Thank you, Paul! I am convinced that a second-tier organization would require more explicit second-tier understanding of consciousness and culture. After all, it’s a holistic and integrative tier, the one which comes to integrating a vast array of lifespaces. Still, an Integral consciousness, even if it doesn’t know any integral framework, would probably be able—or strive to—naturally design teal or turquoise worldspaces. It is a natural tendency of consciousnesses to weave a cultural fabric which is correspondent to their common altitude. It would be a tetra-mesh of factors, including the emergence of more sophisticated cybernetic environments in LR which would potentially mediate and inspire the greater depth in consciousness. I can only speculate now, but I would love if people would gather in transgenerational action research groups and actually test the waters of reality.
Eugene Pustoshkin on 11/30 – Transformations on the Path to Really Teal & Turquoise Organizations - 12/02/2016Thank you, Arthur! It would be really terrific to see what a true Teal company could be, the one which is founded and grounded in the Teal altitude of consciousness and being. Some people say that we have to deal with the first tier first, but I am not sure about that. It is as if to say: before leaving your cave and exploring the world, you have to study every inch of that archaeological cave and make it very comfortable. Both movements are necessary. The world is in crisis of being limited to first-tier solutions.
Paul Hess on 11/30 – Transformations on the Path to Really Teal & Turquoise Organizations - 12/01/2016I like the way you state the limitations of Laloux and the difference between teal and turquoise, as well as strategic considerations for transformation between stages. I want to add to that and show how my work on models of the firm organization develops some of these themes in more detail, although I did not attempt to distinguish between teal and turquoise as clearly as you do.  

It’s clear that Laloux is almost entirely green in his focus on participation, which is the green vehicle to individual authentic expression and procedural symbol of equality. Laloux explicitly states that a customer focused business strategy is not an important feature distinguishing kinds of organizations. Here he reveals that he has no clue what is going with world class business. Laloux is firmly in the green “stakeholder model of the firm” as opposed to a second tier “sustainable model of the firm.” 

A customer focused business strategy in fact changes the logic of organizations with top down “remote control accounting” explained in detail by business historians Kaplan and Johnson in their widely accepted critique. The customer focused strategy creates the horizontal organization driven by market demand not of price signals but human needs to integrate specializations into process flows systemically. This leads to four revolutions in management thinking about organization, economics, science and morality.  I explain this as I contrast three models of firm organization: shareholder, stakeholder, and sustainable firms, (orange, green, and above). I model this in detail by 9 principles and 10 organizational features that show how the customer focus changes each functional specialty: management, accounting, HR, product development, operations, marketing, etc.  http://integralleadershipreview.com/11393-424-sustainable-firm/

My sustainable model of corporate organization was developed more inductively through a sociological “grounded theory” methodology, more than guided initially by using theoretical categories deductively so integral categories are not explicit, especially because I was writing for a broader audience. But anyone in Integral can see the categories, which was why I was invited to publish in Integral Leadership Review, April 2014. Nevertheless, this level of detail of analysis is not usually found in Integral or Spiral so there was little discussion to follow.  This level of detail took me 21 years to formulate into an article, growing out of my Ph.D. research in sociology.

I did not explicitly parse out the distinctions between teal and turquoise, which your article makes me think about. The practical problem I was actually addressing I can now more clearly see was the transition from teal to turquoise involved in implementing the basic framework for the new firm: total quality management, TQM, now called six sigma, which at best are understood in teal terms. Teal and turquoise can be distinguished between a process versus more systems orientation, to use the Memeonomics distinction of Said Dawlabani.  Six sigma is all about process improvement to serve customers, but has lacked systematic organizational design to support its new logic. TQM and six sigma has also lacked looking at customers as whole persons and the relationships between stakeholders or customers in those stakeholder roles. I gave an example of a strategy that integrates stakeholders with a focus on health through reducing toxicity that would improve quality of life for customers and employees, and workplace productivity, while reducing health care costs and environmental impact. This win-win logic between stakeholders is based on reducing economic trade-offs between cost, quality, speed, etc., not green wishful thinking, although green gets it.

At the teal level, total quality management was sometimes reduced in understanding by green to participation, but had radical implications for management accountability seen in Japan mostly, that were eventually stripped off in the American context and reduced back to orange more narrowly scientific and statistical reasoning. Thus, the later term “six sigma,” which means 6 parts per million defect levels as a high level of quality, as an internal metric, not necessarily even customer focused. Systematic organizational integration around customers has always been the challenge.

My article did not develop the upper left quadrant as much as your chart does,  but I have elaborated one aspect of that elsewhere, the epistemology of contextual reasoning following a logic of connection, a more accessible version of high theory. I like your “deep process rule principles” which I think captures of six sigma improvement methodologies as standards to revise standards for work at any level of organization within any location of the organization. 

Anyway, thanks for making me think of this again.
Arthur ten Wolde on 11/30 – Transformations on the Path to Really Teal & Turquoise Organizations - 12/01/2016Excellent work. Did not know Russian companies were striving to become Teal/Yellow. That is in itself good news! Now in the Netherlands, which is regarded as the forefront of the circular economy, we have approximately 200 Green companies. Generally with Yellow in the Board, while at the same time still a lot of Orange and Blue elements in the company undergoing further transformation. Turquoise I encounter only at the personal level and in some smaller nonprofit organisations. So indeed, don't skip any stage because if you try, your organisation will fall back inevitably and be even further from home - in this case, from becoming a Yellow/Turquoise, circular company.
