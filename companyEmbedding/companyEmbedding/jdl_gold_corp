        Comment Guidelines        


We encourage you to use comments to engage with users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other. However, in order to maintain the high level of discourse we’ve all come to value and expect, please keep the following criteria in mind: 

Enrich the conversation
Stay focused and on track. Only post material that’s relevant to the topic being discussed.
Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically.
 Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases.
NOTE: Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed
Avoid profanity, slander or personal attacks directed at an author or another user.
Don’t Monopolize the Conversation. We appreciate passion and conviction, but we also believe strongly in giving everyone a chance to air their thoughts. Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse.
Only English comments will be allowed.

Perpetrators of spam or abuse will be deleted from the site and prohibited from future registration at Investing.com’s discretion. 
I have read Investing.com's comments guidelines and agree to the terms described.

Comment Guidelines
 

        Comment Guidelines        


We encourage you to use comments to engage with users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other. However, in order to maintain the high level of discourse we’ve all come to value and expect, please keep the following criteria in mind: 

Enrich the conversation
Stay focused and on track. Only post material that’s relevant to the topic being discussed.
Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically.
 Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases.
NOTE: Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed
Avoid profanity, slander or personal attacks directed at an author or another user.
Don’t Monopolize the Conversation. We appreciate passion and conviction, but we also believe strongly in giving everyone a chance to air their thoughts. Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse.
Only English comments will be allowed.

Perpetrators of spam or abuse will be deleted from the site and prohibited from future registration at Investing.com’s discretion. 
I have read Investing.com's comments guidelines and agree to the terms described.

Holy Name residential project could include 700-plus units




Jim Letchinger, president of Chicago-based JDL Development, confirmed that he is in talks with the Archdiocese of Chicago to acquire the site at the southwest corner of State Street and Chicago Avenue. Though his plans for the parcel are far from firm, he outlined his vision for the project and explained his motivation for pursuing it.
“It’s at the crossroads of the great neighborhoods of Chicago. It ties North Michigan Avenue, River North and the Gold Coast together,” Letchinger said. “The scale of the site gives us the opportunity to create something that is spectacular for the City of Chicago.”

Cornering the Market




There's truth to that old cliché about location and real estate, but luxurious finishes and amenities are equally critical, and good timing doesn't hurt either. Two West Delaware, the glam redevelopment of a 2010 tower, represents the intersection of all three on one of the most desirable corners on the Gold Coast.

How Chicago Multifamily Morphed from Mid-Rise Condos to Luxury Towers




Pre-crash Chicago multifamily was all about mid-rise condos. No longer. This cycle, the focus is on high-density apartment towers with shared amenities and other condo-like features. That’s among the reasons we’re excited to host Bisnow’s You’re Going to Build What? 3rd Annual Chicago Construction & Development event on Aug. 18 at Trump International Hotel & Tower Chicago, starting at 7am.

The 22-story tower that is looking to take the place of the kitschy Ed Debevic’s restaurant in River North is one step closer to digging in. Last week, the Chicago Plan Commission approved of the plan from JDL Development, which includes 251 apartments, 12,000 square feet of ground floor retail space and 117 parking spaces…

Rise of JDL Properties Developer Chronicled in New Profile




In 2011, developer Jim Letchinger broke ground on a 250-unit apartment in Old Town, perfect timing to capture the upswing in the rental market. When he sold for $157 million in 2013, he made a handsome profit. That sales marked the beginning of a big growth period in his career, as Crain’s revealed in a new profile showing how Letchinger recovered from the recession to build an impressive real estate portfolio…

Nearly flattened by the recession, this developer now is one of Chicago’s busiest builders




Cinco de Mayo was a special holiday for Jim Letchinger in 2011. After a few tough years trying to satisfy unpaid debts from the real estate bust—and briefly considering a career change—the Chicago developer broke ground that day on a 250-unit apartment project in Old Town, just as the rental market was shifting into a higher gear. The project “kick-started my career,” says Letchinger, president of JDL Development, a company he founded in 2003. “It gave me credibility.”
It was the beginning of what his son calls JDL 2.0, a frenetic period for Letchinger, who has become one of the city’s busiest residential developers in the post-crash era. Letchinger and his partners have built or are building more than 1,000 apartments in Chicago, including his biggest project, a 469-unit tower under construction in the South Loop.

Here come another 959 apartments downtown




In the South Loop, a joint venture between Chicago-based JDL Development Corp. and iStar Financial Inc. of New York secured a $79.7 million construction loan for a 28-story, 469-unit high-end apartment tower at 1000 S. Clark St. The venture has begun preparing the site for construction and is awaiting a foundation permit from the city, said JDL President Jim Letchinger.Mr. Letchinger said he expects the first residents at 1000 S. Clark to move in in October 2015. He expects to charge rents around $2.60 per square foot. The construction loan covers 64 percent of the project’s total cost of $124 million, he said. The Chicago office of HFF Inc. arranged the loan from Little Rock, Arkansas-based Bank of the Ozarks.

 Big Sleek Apartment Tower Coming to South Loop




The rise of the skyscrapers in Chicago continues with news that developer Jim Letchinger of JDL Development is planning a 29 story, 469-unit tower at 1000 S. Clark Street, according to Crain’s. Letchinger is “very, very close” to securing a construction loan and hopes to break ground in mid-May. The building will be designed by Chicago’s own Hartshorne Plunkard Architecture with a completion date set for May 2015.
While no details were given concerning amenities or building details, the tower will be located next door to the South Loop Target store. The building will be a joint venture between JDL Development and iStar Financial Inc., which took the property back from its prior owner in 2011. Under the property’s current zoning, the construction of the new building is permitted.

Busy Builder




With Old Town and Wrigleyville covered, developer Jim Letchinger has set his sights on the South Loop.
Mr. Letchinger is in advanced stages of planning a 469-unit apartment tower at 1000 S. Clark St., just a short walk north of the Target store on Roosevelt Road. Designed by Hartshorne Plunkard Architecture, it would be the biggest building for Mr. Letchinger…

South Loop to land big new apartment building




As he wraps up apartment projects in Old Town and Wrigleyville, developer Jim Letchinger is preparing to launch an even bigger one in the South Loop.
Mr. Letchinger said he plans a 469-unit tower at 1000 S. Clark St., just north of the Target store on Roosevelt Road. He is “very, very close” to securing a construction loan for the development, which he would build in a joint venture with lender iStar Financial Inc. iStar which took the property back from its prior owner in 2011.It has been a busy few years for Mr. Letchinger. He was part of a venture that developed 1225 Old Town, a 250-unit tower in Old Town, and sold it for $157 million last year. Across the street, at the corner of Wells and Scott streets, he and Norridge-based Harlem Irving Cos. are developing a 71-unit apartment building that he expects to finish in August.
In Wrigleyville, a joint venture between JDL and Harlem Irving recently completed a 269-unit project at 3740 N. Halsted St. The development is 25 percent leased, and its first residents started moving in over the weekend, Mr. Letchinger said.

Parking Minimums at Work: Uptown Tower Must Build 554 Parking Spots




At the site of the former Cuneo Hospital and Maryville Academy in Uptown, slated to be demolished shortly, JDL Development has proposed building 749 apartments in two buildings, along with 30,000 square feet of retail space. In addition, 554 parking spaces will be constructed, the minimum required by Chicago’s zoning code.
Of these spaces, 65 will be set aside for the retail (likely a grocery store), while the remaining will be for residents. The parking will be “unbundled” from the price of housing, meaning that tenants will not have to pay for parking if they don’t need it. The spaces for retail will be offered free of charge to patrons.
Chicago shouldn’t require so much parking. The developer, James Letchinger, said in an email that 60-65 percent of parking in JDL’s other developments sit empty. At tens of thousands of dollars per space in construction costs alone, all these parking spaces drive up the price of housing and the cost of retail goods. Parking mandates also result in less space being developed for more productive uses.

New Glassy Apartment Tower Confirmed For The South Loop




A previously mysterious rendering of a South Loop residential tower has been confirmed today to be a new apartment development planned at 1000 South Clark Street. Don’t pack your things just yet, as the developer still needs to secure funding for the shiny new building. However, Crain’s is reporting that the developer, JDL Development is super close to getting loans for the construction of South Loop’s latest entry. At 29 stories, the tower isn’t breaking any height records, but once completed, the building should have enough room for about 469 apartment units. An updated rendering also comes along with the news, which appears to show no design changes, only more detail. While River North is swimming in proposed apartment developments, this new large rental project may indicate a shifting trend towards new apartments in the South Loop area.

 Tomorrow’s Apartments Will be Smaller, with Pet Spas




Chicago’s apartment market continues to fire on all cylinders as never-before-seen rents and amenities enter the fray. (Are we inching closer to robot butlers?) We got the lowdown at the Bisnow fourth annual Chicago Multifamily Summit…
JDL Development president Jim Letchinger (1,500 units under development in Chicago) says only the best locations with high barriers to entry will get built these days. If it’s easy to build, you’re probably in the wrongmarket. Today’s renters are renting by choice, looking for top of the market product that is more desirable than their for-sale options. On micro apartments, Jim says large-scale adoption of the trend is a number of years away in Chicago. As a stepchild to the coasts, people come here for the space, not to enjoy the admittedly practical uses of a Murphy bed.

Not Your Mom’s Clark/Division




On the seam between Old Town and the Gold Coast lies the fabled mini-neighborhood of Clark and Division where the development gears are whirring. Actually, it’s very real. And those of you who’ve ended a long night at Mother’s or Butch McGuire’s know what we mean.
JDL Development president Jim Letchinger has known the area literally his entire life (he grew up around Division and the lake). His recent 250-unit multifamily project with Hines (1225 Old Town), opened in August and is already 92% leased with rents well over $3/SF. Jim likes the high demand in the area and even more the high barrier to entry for new projects (JDL won zoning approval for 1225 back in 2009). He’s bringing in a 28k SF Plum Market specialty grocery store this spring. He’s also working with Harlem Irving on a proposed $30M mixed-use development across the street. In the midst of permitting, the proposed 71-unit apartment building with 10k SF of retail is being eyed by a “strong Chicago name” restaurant, Jim hints, and he hopes to break ground by the end of March.

On the Market: A Gold Coast Condo with a Suburban Feel




The 16-story Elm Tower, at Elm and Dearborn streets, is a six-year-old building designed to look and feel like the vintage co-ops of the Gold Coast. When he was building it, the developer, Jim Letchinger, told me he had grown up in the neighborhood and wanted to put up something that captured the intimate, urban feeling of the 1920s residential buildings he loved there…

Quoteboard data fields include:  Day High / Low: The highest and lowest trade price for the current trading session. Open: The opening price for the current trading session is plotted on the day's High/Low histogram. Previous Close: The closing price from the previous trading session. Bid: The last bid price and bid size. Ask: The last ask price and ask size. Volume: The total number of shares or contracts traded in the current trading session. Average Volume: The average number of shares traded over the last 20 days. Weighted Alpha: A measure of how much a stock or commodity has risen or fallen over a one-year period. Barchart takes this Alpha and weights this, assigning more weight to recent activity, and less (0.5 factor) to activity at the beginning of the period. Thus, Weighted Alpha is a measure of one-year growth with an emphasis on the most recent price activity.  Chart Snapshot A thumbnail of a daily chart is provided, with a link to open and customize a full-sized chart.Price Performance This section shows the Highs and Lows over the past 1, 3 and 12-Month periods. Click the "See More" link to see the full Performance Report page with expanded historical information.Barchart Technical Opinion The Barchart Technical Opinion widget shows you today's overally Barchart Opinion with general information on how to interpret the short and longer term signals. Unique to Barchart.com, Opinions analyzes a stock or commodity using 13 popular analytics in short-, medium- and long-term periods. Results are interpreted as buy, sell or hold signals, each with numeric ratings and summarized with an overall percentage buy or sell rating. After each calculation the program assigns a Buy, Sell, or Hold value with the study, depending on where the price lies in reference to the common interpretation of the study. For example, a price above its moving average is generally considered an upward trend or a buy. A symbol will be given one of the following overall ratings:  Strong Buy (greater than "66% Buy") Buy (greater than or equal to "33% Buy" and less than or equal to "66% Buy") Weak Buy ("0% Buy" through "33% Buy") Hold Strong Sell (greater than "66% Sell") Sell (greater than or equal to "33% Sell" and less than or equal to "66% Sell") Weak Sell ("0% Sell" through "33% Sell")  The current reading of the 14-Day Stochastic indicator is also factored into the interpretation. The following information will appear when the following conditions are met:   If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 90 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is in highly overbought territory. Beware of a trend reversal." If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 80 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is approaching overbought territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 10 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is in highly oversold territory. Beware of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 20 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is approaching oversold territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal." Support and Resistance This section shows a snapshot view of the Trader's Cheat Sheet with the Last Price, and four separate pivot points (2 Support Levels, and 2 Resistance Points). The Last Price shown is the last trade price at the time the quote page was displayed, and will not update every 10 seconds (as the Last Price at the top of the Quote page does). The Last Price will update only when the page is refreshed. Pivot points are used to identify intraday support, resistance and target levels. The pivot point and its support and resistance pairs are defined as follows, where H, L, C are the current day's high, low and close, respectively. Support and Resistance points are based on end-of-day prices and are intended for the current trading session if the market is open, or the next trading session if the market is closed.   Pivot Point: (P) = (H + L + C) / 3 First Resistance Level: (R1) = (2 * P) - L First Support Level: (S1) = (2 * P) - H Second Resistance Level: (R2) = P + (R1 - S1) Second Support Level: (S2) = P - (R1 - S1) Fundamentals For US Stocks, the Overview page includes key statistics on the stock's fundamentals, with a link to see more. Most Recent Earnings figures are based on Non-GAAP income from continuing operations. Market Cap: capitalization or market value of a stock is simply the market value of all outstanding shares. It is computed by multiplying the market price by the number of outstanding shares.
