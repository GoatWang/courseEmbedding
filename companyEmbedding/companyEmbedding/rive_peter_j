        Generating Solar Power
    

UB's solar strand energizes education and research, produces
sustainable energy and reduces the environmental footprint.
Faculty, staff and community members connect through this cultural
and natural landscape.








        
        Preserving Clean Water
    

RENEW researchers work to keep our lakes environmentally clean
and free from algae blooms.








        
        Checking Climate Change
    

Geology professor Jason Briner's research on climate change
takes him to Canada's Baffin Island, where he studies the processes
and timing of changes in glaciers and ice sheets. 




















UB RENEW (Research and Education in eNergy, Environment and
Water) Institute is university-wide
and interdisciplinary, focusing on complex energy and
environmental issues, as well as the social and economic
ramifications. It helps develop and coordinate innovative
research, education and outreach programs.




OUR FOCUS




RENEW’s research focuses on several prominent issues, including:





Energy Diversification







Freshwater Protection and Restoration







Ecosystem Science, Engineering and Policy







Societal Adaptation to Changing Environments and the Green Economy







Public Health







Environmental Management and Governance


















RENEW Focus Areas












Sustainable Urban Environments
6/17/16
 The RENEW focus in Sustainable Urban Environments addresses the
critical role of cities on the establishment of sustainable
relationships between human society and the planet. 
















Next-Generation Materials & Technologies for  Energy, Environment, & Water Sustainability
6/17/16
 Materials design and discovery hold a critical place in the 21
century economy, with broad impact that spans the transportation,
health, microelectronic, and renewable energy industries. 
















Environmental Exposures, Genomes, and Health
6/21/16
 The Environmental Exposures, Genomes, and Health focus area will
stimulate integrated, multidisciplinary research and education at
UB to conduct innovative, cutting edge environmental research. 
















Climate Change and Socioeconomic Impacts
6/17/16
 Climate change is the single most pressing global issue facing
society today; one estimate suggests that a climate-induced global
sea level rise of just one meter will cost 28 trillion US dollars
to world economies. 
















Freshwater Coastal Ecosystems
6/21/16
 In addition to the most basic need for safe drinking water, the
availablity of good quality freshwater affects nearly every aspect
of modern life, including energy resources, food production,
transportation, manufacturing, and recreation, as well as
supporting ecological well-being and the ecosystem services on
which life depends.

Seed Projects












Offshore wind energy in the Great Lakes
9/14/16
 The project brings together a team of engineers, ecologists and
policy experts to examine wind farm systems in terms of integrity,
performance, ecological impacts and policy issues. 
















Energy efficient seawater desalination and food processing
9/14/16
 Reverse osmosis is a water purification method that uses a
semipermeable membrane to desalinate seawater into drinkable water.
While promising, it’s a relatively expensive technology. 
















Microbial Pollution in Lake Erie: Using Next-Generation Sequencing to Examine Microbial Community Interactions and their Relationship to Flow Patterns
9/14/16
 Lake Erie provides drinking water to the region, habitat for
wildlife, and it’s a mecca for fishing and recreation.
However, microbial pollution in the lake threatens human and
ecosystem health, as well as local economies and future economic
development. 
















Toward Rational Design of Next-Generation Renewable Energy Materials: Photovoltaics from Materials to Device Model
9/14/16
 Materials design and discovery hold a critical place in the 21st
century economy, with broad impact that spans the transportation,
health, microelectronic and renewable energy industries. 
















Combining High-Resolution Airmass Trajectory Modeling and Climate Data to Generate Precipitation Predictions that are useful for Policymakers
9/14/16
 Accurate projections and accessible information about the
impacts of climate change on water resources are critical for
planning and adaptation.  
















Tracking emerging contaminants in the Great Lakes
9/14/16
 Advanced manufacturing will help revitalize Western New
York’s economy. But just like 20th century manufacturing, it
poses pollution risks, especially to freshwater. 
















Designing Sustainability: Integrating Consumer Behavior and Product Design to Minimize Electronic Waste
9/14/16
 The project will focus on mitigating electronic waste (e-waste)
through design engineering and market promotion-based solutions
that induce “green” behavior from consumers.  
















The new agriculture: From food farms to solar farms
9/14/16
 Across the United States, government agencies and energy
developers are looking at agricultural land to develop renewable
energy resources, such as wind and solar. 
















Emerging Ultra-Wide Bandgap Semiconductors for Clean Energy and Water
9/14/16
 Renewable energy sources such as wind and solar are expected to
be integrated into the future electric grid for economic, energy
and environmental security.
