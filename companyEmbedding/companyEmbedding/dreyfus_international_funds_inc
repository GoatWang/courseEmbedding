Performance Metrics





Main Risks

					Allocation Risk: Asset allocation cannot ensure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets. There can be no guarantee that any particular level of return, or the fund's investment objective, will be achieved.Equity Risk: Equity funds are subject generally to market, market sector, market liquidity, issuer and investment style risks, among other factors, to varying degrees, all of which are more fully described in the fund's prospectus.Foreign Investment Risk: To the extent the fund invests in foreign securities, its performance will be influenced by political, social and economic factors affecting investments in foreign companies. These special risks include exposure to currency fluctuations, less liquidity, less developed or less efficient trading markets, lack of comprehensive company information, political instability, and differing auditing and legal standards.Small/Mid Cap Company Risk: Small and midsize companies carry additional risks because their earnings and revenues tend to be less predictable and their share prices more volatile than those of larger, more established companies. The shares of smaller companies tend to trade less frequently than those of larger, more established companies.

Overview






		Why invest in this Fund?
The fund seeks long-term growth of capital. To pursue this goal, the fund normally invests at least 80% of its assets in equity securities of companies located in the foreign countries represented in the Morgan Stanley Capital Inter-national Europe, Australasia and Far East (EAFE) Index and Canada. The fund's stock investments may include common stocks, preferred stocks and convertible securities. The fund intends to invest in a broad range of countries. The fund may invest up to 20% of its assets in securities of issuers located in emerging market countries, but no more than 5% of its assets may be invested in issuers located in any one emerging market country. The fund invests in stocks that appear to be undervalued (as measured by their price/earnings ratios) and that may have value and/or growth characteristics. The portfolio managers employ a bottom-up investment approach, which emphasizes individual stock selection.
