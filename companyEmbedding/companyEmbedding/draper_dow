SheerWeave® made with Dow ECOLIBRIUM - A Greener Shading Solution
Draper is now offering SheerWeave® PW3500, PW4100 and PW4400, made with Ecolibrium 
DOW ECOLIBRIUM Bio-Based Plasticizers offer a renewable alternative that is phthalate-free, offering a more sustainable option while having the same great performance and feel of current materials. 
What is the benefit of a phthalate-free product? Many agencies and organizations, including the EPA and FDA, are studying the effects of human exposure to phthalates. This statement is from www.epa.gov: 
"EPA is concerned about phthalates because of their toxicity and the evidence of pervasive human and environmental exposure to these chemicals. Phthalates are used in many industrial and consumer products, many of which pose potentially high exposure. Phthalates have been detected in food and also measured in humans."
Ideal for use in interior and exterior shades.
