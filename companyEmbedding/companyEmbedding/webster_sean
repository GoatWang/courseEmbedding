      Sean Webster Band(UK)http://www.seanwebster.co.ukSean Webster is the brilliant front man guitar vocalist for the 3 piece band with a great reputation on the British Blues and rock scene. Since forming in 2003 they have been making great headway both in the U.K and Europe. 2004 was a big year for Sean, as he released the debut album "Long Time Coming". This put the band in the public eye for the first time, and showcased Sean's fine guitar playing, which combines a great number of influences including Albert Collins, Eric Clapton, Mark Knopfler, Gary Moore and SRV to name a few. His vocal style is of a rich, sexy tone with a low end rumble drawing comparisons with Joe Cocker, Bryan Adams and Jonny Lang. Britain's leading blues magazine "Blues Matters!" has described the debut album as "A real gem", concluding that Sean was: ".... set for big stages with superb guitar work.... They'll soon be bursting out of the Nottingham area now Sean has got his writing shoes on."2005 saw the band perform many live dates around the U.K. including main stage performances at, Burnley Festival, Maryport Festival the prestigious Great British R&B Festival in Colne in August with organisers quoting, " Sean is a new legend in the making. He has rich powerful vocals and searing guitar licks. Like so many, he has been working hard for years but these are Sean Webster's years, and he is in his ascendancy". Sean's second cd release entitled, " If Only" pushed the boundaries of the blues music, with Sean reaching out to a wider and (often) younger audience. " If Only" came to the attention of Tony Edser, editor of " Where`s Eric! " the official Eric Clapton magazine who decided to feature Sean as The " One to watch ". Having personally placed a copy of the cd in Eric`s hands, it has been rumoured that Sean may be inline for supporting Eric in next years tour. An extract reads, "This is an original collection of blues based songs, skilfully played, nicely produced and with some beautifully melodic guitar work. If Eric is stuck for a decent support act for his forth coming Euro tour, he need look no more ". Sean recorded a live session for the Paul Jones show on BBC radio 2 which was aired in September 2006, enabling some 500,000 people to hear Sean's music. He regularly has his music played on radio stations around the world, including Bosnia, Canada, Spain, France, and Germany etc. As well as performing various dates throughout the U.K. he has just returned from a very successful 5 week tour of America, taking in Chicago, Minnesota, Houston, Galvaston and Austin Texas. Aswell as having a great learning experience he had the chance to meet up with Jimmie Vaughn and Doyle Bramhall II. Check out the pictures page. The double album " Live and in Session " is now out and available at gigs and via the website. Sean hopes to continue his growth in the music industry and bring his music to new ears, both young and old. Sean has something for everyone, make sure you catch him at the earliest opportunity.

 ENDORSEMENTSAs Sean has gained a greater reputation over the years he is privileged to endorse the following products.  









Bare Knuckle pickupsSean has a set of "Mule" pickups fitted to his Les Paul. Along with 300k original Gibson pots, this gives a real "bluesy" warm tone.

Learn More
 









Tanglewood guitarsFor a number of years Sean continues to play acoustic performances. For more than 10 years now Sean has endorsed Tanglewood guitars. His 2 favourites are the TW33 and the Premier Dreadnought TW1000. Both these guitars appear on all of Sean's albums.

Learn More
 









Rotosound stringsAs any touring guitarist knows, strings are one of the most important factors in tone, piece of mind and playability. Rotosound strings provide Sean with all those factors and always surpass his expectations.

Learn More






















Zilla MusicHaving found the amp which he always wanted, (a Fender Tonemaster), Sean was faced with cab choice. After speaking at length to Paul at Zilla Music, Sean was offered an artist deal and advised to purchase a 2 X 12 Fat Boy. This cab was colour matched to his Fender Tonemaster and this combination goes to every gig with Sean. 

Learn More
 









Deeflexx systemsFaced occasionally with too much direct beam from Sean's cab, the Deeflexx system not only offers shielding from the the sometimes harsh direct beam, but provides a greater overall on stage sound. This dramatically improves being able to hear yourself and reduces reliance on monitors.

 THANKS GUYS"As I continue down my musical path I would just like to thank all my sponsors for helping me, making things all the more easier"

Sean Webster Band: Leave Your Heart At The Door (CD)
(2017/Sean Webster) 11 tracks. 
Sean Webster has been sculpting his career in the blues, rock world for almost 25 years, since picking up the guitar at the age of 14. His debut album, 2004's Long Time Coming, secured him his first recording contract and showcased his fine guitar playing.
His influences are wide and varied but include Albert Collins, Gary Moore, Mark Knopfler and especially Eric Clapton. His vocals have been described as amongst the best on the current music scene, drawing comparisons with Joe Cocker and Jonny Lang.
'Leave Your Heart At The Door' is the next step for Sean, a finely tuned piece of work formed straight from the heart that further demonstrates his masterful use of musical phrasing whilst at the same time showing his ability to bare his soul through a gut-wrenching and often tear-jerking vocal delivery.
Bluesrock from Great Britain
