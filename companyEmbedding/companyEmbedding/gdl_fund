FREE FUNDRAISING






YouCaring is dedicated to helping as many people as possible. This is why we will never charge anyone to raise money on our site.

Start your own fundraiser today.
It's free!
Create Fundraiser







Our Crowdfunding Platform Charges $0
Most crowdfunding sites charge 5% to 10% in fees just to use their platform. We never have and never will. This is because we believe that for people facing life’s challenges, every dollar counts. With more than $500 million in donations raised, our free fundraising platform has saved fundraisers more than $13 million in fees.

0% fee















5% – 10% fee









Donation Processor Costs

All online fundraising requires a third-party credit card processor such as PayPal, WePay or Stripe. These processors allow money to be safely collected and transferred online, but they do charge small fees for this service. Each donation processor charges 2.9% plus $0.30 per transaction.
This is not a YouCaring fee.

To learn more about our donation processors, read our blog post Which Donation Processor Is Right for Your Fundraiser. Rest assured, you can change donation processors at any time during your campaign. Simply contact us and we’ll be happy to guide you through the process.






Keep More of Your Money

When a donation is processed, the donation processor deducts their cost from the donation total. For example, if someone donates $100, the donation processor will take 2.9% plus $.30, resulting in a $3.20 fee. Other sites charge an additional 5% to 10% just to use their site.
YouCaring saves you money by charging no site fees.

How YouCaring Supports Itself

We rely on the generosity of our users to help us provide a free crowdfunding platform for those struggling with life’s challenges. At times, we do receive financial support from our amazing processors and other partners. People who give to fundraisers on YouCaring have the option of providing a voluntary contribution to support our operations and help keep fundraising free. We are incredibly grateful to those who have contributed and in doing so, chosen to participate in our mission to bring life-changing philanthropy to as many people as possible.

noun
Crowdfunding is the practice of funding a project or cause by raising money from a large number of people, typically through the Internet.

The Rise of Crowdfunding


The flourishing sharing economy is changing the landscape of fundraising, and in recent years, crowdfunding has dominated the scene. According to research firm Massolution, donation-based crowdfunding alone grew more than 50 percent in 2015, raising nearly $3 billion. The overall crowdfunding market, including donation-based, lending-based, reward-based and equity-based funding, was expected to grow to $34.5 billion in 2015, more than double that of 2014.







Recent statistics contributing to crowdfunding’s popularity:

Annual out-of-pocket medical expenses in the U.S. have risen to $400 billion, or $1,254 per person.1
Average medical deductibles in the last eight years have increased 100 percent, from $584 to $1,217 for individuals, not including the price of co-pays, co-insurance, drugs and procedures not covered by health insurance plans.2
Forty seven percent of Americans can’t afford $2,000 in an emergency
Annual charitable giving in the U.S. has grown to $360 billion, with 72 percent coming from individuals.3
The sharing economy in 2015 is estimated to be $15 billion and projected to grow to $335 billion by 2035.4





How can you key into the trend and help yourself or someone you love overcome a hardship or challenge by launching a successful crowdfunding campaign?


How To Crowdfund













1. Create
YouCaring’s easy-to-use fundraiser template allows you to create an effective home page for your crowdfunding campaign. Show potential donors how they can help by telling a compelling story, uploading several pictures and videos, and posting updates.



2. Share
Activate your social network. With just a few clicks, spread the word of your fundraiser to friends, family and other potential donors through Facebook, Twitter, email and other channels. Each share is worth $37 on average.



3. Collect
Donations to your fundraiser can be transferred into your account as they’re received. YouCaring provides free fundraising, which means we don’t charge a thing. The donation processor does, however, take 2.9%, plus $.30 per transaction.








Best Crowdfunding Practices
The most important goal of crowdfunding is to build a community and a network that empathizes with your cause and donates.






Five Key Strategies:


Plan Ahead
Create a social presence by setting up Facebook and Twitter accounts if you haven’t already done so. Immediately start connecting with as many friends, family members, coworkers and acquaintances as possible. See our Using Social Media to Promote Your Fundraiser page. Also consider setting up a blog or website devoted to your cause to further boost your social presence. See our How to Start a Fundraising Website or Blog page.

Make It Compelling
From the title to the story to the visuals, your campaign should inspire potential donors to contribute to your cause. Take time to create a great name for your campaign and write an engaging story. Uploading several high-quality photos and one or more videos can exponentially increase donations to your campaign. For additional tips, see these YouCaring articles: Great Ideas for Naming Your Online Fundraiser, How Images Can Lead to Fundraising Success and Videos Are Powerful Fundraiser Tools.

Share and Update
Sharing your campaign often via social media channels and asking your friends, family and others to do the same is the best way to raise awareness and support for your cause. Every share can raise $37. Multiply those shares and your fundraiser may go viral. Meanwhile, well-written updates keep supporters and potential donors engaged. Fundraisers with five updates can raise 15 times more than those with one. Fundraisers with 20 or more updates on average meet their fundraising goal.

Organize Offline Events
Complementing your online campaign with an offline fundraiser can get your community personally involved and rally support from local businesses. Sports tournaments, dinners, auctions, dances and other events are great options. See our Fundraising Ideas page for other tips.

Reach Out to the Media
Getting your campaign covered by a local newspaper, T.V. station, radio station or even blogger and Facebook pages can propel your fundraiser to new heights. See our tips page, How to Get Local Media to Cover Your Fundraiser.

The Crowdfunding Platform You Choose Matters
It is vital to pick the crowdfunding platform that best suits your needs and your cause. The most important aspects include the fees charged to fundraise, the site’s customer service standards and reputation, the schedule for payment of donations, the caliber of online tools available to illustrate and share your campaign, and the quality of the site—from the visuals to the user experience.

Crowdfunding Campaign Success Stories






Help Save Matthew!





Goal: $800,000

Raised: $835,918



Matthew Schreindorfer and his wife, Katia Luciani, could not have imagined the journey they would face starting in August 2014. At age 24, Matthew was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. He had gone through every possible treatment in Canada, all of which failed to bring him into remission. According to his doctors, his only hope was to be admitted for a CART-19 clinical trial in the U.S. The couple started working with Sloan Kettering Cancer Institute in New York and started a YouCaring fundraiser with a goal of $800,000, the estimated cost for the treatment. With the help of family and friends in Canada, and newfound supporters in the U.S. and around the world, the couple was able to drum up plenty of support for the clinical trial in the U.S., which proved to be fruitful, putting Matthew in remission for more than six months.

And Luca Makes 5 – Mullen Family Adoption





Goal: $40,500

Raised: $41,259



In February 2016, the Mullen Family of Bethany, Okla., brought home their third adoptive child, Luca, a 3-year-old Eastern European boy with special needs. The joyous occasion came after nearly one year of fundraising, the majority of which included the YouCaring campaign, And Luca Makes 5: The Mullen Family Adoption. After 15 years of marriage, during which the couple was unable to have children, they embarked on an adoptive journey to grow their family, and brought Levi and Lia home in 2011. Their YouCaring fundraiser to adopt Luca raised more than $41,000. Successful strategies didn’t get any better than the Mullen’s over the course of their campaign, during which time they involved their children in many of the happy moments leading up to the last stretch to welcome little Luca.

Help Fatal Arson Survivor Safyre Terry and Family





Goal: $15,000

Raised: $432,249



The story of 7-year-old Safyre Terry stole the hearts of people around the world when a Facebook post in 2015 describing her wish to receive Christmas cards went viral. Safyre was a courageous young burn victim from Upstate New York who was the only survivor of a house fire that killed the rest of her family in 2013. At the time, Safyre was 5 years old, and through all of her medical treatments and ensuing challenges, has remained a bright, optimistic girl who loves life. Around the time of the Facebook post, a YouCaring fundraiser had also been started by friends for Safyre’s aunt and uncle, Mike and Liz Dolder, who are now raising her. The fundraiser was set up to help with the costs of medical treatments and other expenses. Nearly 10,000 people from around the world contributed to the campaign.

Bonsai: Half the Bulldog, Twice the Love





Goal: $1

Raised: $22,898



It’s hard to resist a cute black and white bulldog puppy. But when you see Bonsai, born with multiple rare medical conditions that left him with only half a spine and no pelvis playing with a big pink squeaky toy, still just as rambunctious and playful as any puppy with four legs, it truly tugs at your heartstrings. A group of individuals from Friends of Emma, a rescue organization, took to crowdfunding to give Bonsai a leg up in his treatment. The fundraiser has successfully raised nearly $23,000 to help pay for Bonsai’s medical treatments and a possible mobility device to give him an even happier and healthier life.

Fund Overview for The GDL Fund








Objective

    The Fund is a diversified, closed-end management investment company whose investment objective is to achieve absolute returns in various market conditions without excessive risk of capital. Absolute returns are defined as positive total returns, regardless of the direction of securities markets. To achieve its investment objective, the Fund, under normal market conditions, will invest primarily in
securities of companies (both domestic and foreign) involved in publicly announced mergers, takeovers, tender offers and leveraged buyouts and, to a lesser extent, in corporate reorganizations involving stubs, spin-offs, and liquidations.

Fund Structure:    Closed End


Investment Style:    Merger/Arbitrage


Inception:    January 26, 2007

 
 

Portfolio Manager 

Mario J. Gabelli, CFA








 



Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of the Fund before investing.  You can obtain more information about the Fund by calling 1-800-GABELLI (1-800-422-3554). The Fund’s net asset value (“NAV”) per share will fluctuate with changes in the market value of the Fund’s portfolio securities. Stocks are subject to market, economic, and business risks that cause their prices to fluctuate. Investors acquire shares of the Fund on a securities exchange at market value, which fluctuates according to the dynamics of supply and demand.  Leverage Risk. The use of leverage, which can be described as exposure to changes in price at a ratio greater than the amount of equity invested, through the issuance of preferred shares, magnifies both the favorable and unfavorable effects of price movements in the investments made by the Fund. The Fund’s use of leverage in its investment operations subjects it to substantial risk of loss.  Merger Arbitrage Risk. The principal risk associated with the Fund’s investment strategy is that certain of the proposed reorganizations in which the Fund invests may be renegotiated, terminated or involve a longer time frame than originally contemplated, in which case losses may be realized. The investment policies of the Fund are expected to lead to frequent changes in investments, which increase transaction costs to the Fund, and may also result in accelerated recognition of short-term capital gain, which will be taxable to shareholders when distributed by the Fund.

Under normal circumstances, the Fund will invest at least 80% of its assets in securities or hedging arrangements relating to companies involved in corporate transactions or reorganizations, giving rise to the possibility of realizing gains upon or within relatively short periods of time after the completion of such transactions or reorganizations. This policy is not fundamental and may be changed by the Fund with notice of not less than 60 days to its shareholders. In market cycles with scarce transaction opportunities, the Fund may seek to accomplish its objective of achieving absolute returns by temporarily investing in other assets, including, but not limited to, short-term debt securities, which may make it less likely for the Fund to achieve an attractive rate of return. As a global fund, the Fund may invest without limitation in the securities of foreign and domestic issuers. The Funds investment strategy is to invest in merger arbitrage transactions and corporate reorganizations throughout the world. Under normal market conditions, the Fund expects to have at least 40% of its assets invested in at least three countries, other than the United States. To the extent that the majority of mergers, takeovers, tender offers and leveraged buyouts and corporate reorganizations are concentrated in any given geographic region, such as Europe, North America or Asia, a relatively high proportion of the Funds assets may be invested in that particular region.

Please note: Closed end funds are subject to the risk of their underlying assets and investment strategy. Unlike open end funds, closed end funds trade on an exchange at a price which is often a discount to their net asset value (NAV). The market price may experience periods of increased volatility due to the use of leverage as well as market and fund illiquidity. Important information you should know about investing in closed-end funds.

Investment Objective Summary


Under normal circumstances, the Fund will invest at least 80% of its assets in securities or hedging arrangements relating to companies involved in corporate transactions or reorganizations, giving rise to the possibility of realizing gains upon or within relatively short periods of time after the completion of such transactions or reorganizations. This policy is not fundamental and may be changed by the Fund with notice of not less than 60 days to its shareholders. In market cycles with scarce transaction opportunities, the Fund may seek to accomplish its objective of achieving absolute returns by temporarily investing in other assets, including, but not limited to, short-term debt securities, which may make it less likely for the Fund to achieve an attractive rate of return. As a global fund, the Fund may invest without limitation in the securities of foreign and domestic issuers. The Funds investment strategy is to invest in merger arbitrage transactions and corporate reorganizations throughout the world. Under normal market conditions, the Fund expects to have at least 40% of its assets invested in at least three countries, other than the United States. To the extent that the majority of mergers, takeovers, tender offers and leveraged buyouts and corporate reorganizations are concentrated in any given geographic region, such as Europe, North America or Asia, a relatively high proportion of the Funds assets may be invested in that particular region.

More about Portfolio Composition








*The Overall Morningstar RatingTM for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and ten-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a funds monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads and redemption fees, if applicable), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.)The performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted. Distributions are not guaranteed and the amount of distributions will vary depending on a number of factors. Market prices and investment return will vary, therefore you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. Click on the "Performance & Risk" link to view quarter-end performance. All performance data is for the common shares of the fund. Total distribution rate (at market or NAV) may include unknown combinations of income, capital gains and return of capital.Cumulative total returns are reported as of the period indicated. Life of fund figures are reported as of the commencement date to the period indicated. ^Premium/Discount to NAV represents the percentage by which the funds market price exceeds or is less than net asset value (NAV). Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a market price that is a discount to their NAV.Top holdings are as of the date indicated and may not be representative of the funds current or future investments.
