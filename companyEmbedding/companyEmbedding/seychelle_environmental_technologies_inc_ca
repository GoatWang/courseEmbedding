Seychelle EnvironmentalTechnologies, Inc.
















Seychelle Water Filters
Seychelle's Ionic Adsorption Micron Filters are the most laboratory and field-tested of their kind in the world using EPA protocols and tested to NSF/ANSI Standards 42 and 53 by Broward Testing Laboratory.Beneficial trace minerals are not removed in the filtering process. What's good stays…what's bad goes.



TYPES OF FILTERS
Seychelle REGULAR FilterThe Regular filter removes up to 99.99% of chlorine, chemicals (VOCs), heavy metals and Radon 222. Removes up to 90% of fluoride. Since it is more open in porosity, it does not remove giardia, cryptosporidium or E-Coli. It is designed to be used as a drinking water filter for use with chlorinated municipal water and as a bottled water replacement.  (Not to be used with salt water)Seychelle STANDARD FilterThe Standard filter is ideal for any in or out-door use; like traveling, hiking, biking, camping, fishing or for emergency purposes. It can be used with any type of water source; tap or rainwater, rivers, streams or even lakes (Excluding salt water). It is designed for use with water that is non-turbid, non-stagnant. It removes up to 99.99% of contaminants and pollutants found in fresh water supplies including Aesthetics such as chlorine, Sediment and dirt; Chemicals (VOC's) such as DDT, MTBE, Benzene, Chloroforms (THM's);  Dissolved Solids (heavy metals) such as Arsenic, Lead, Mercury, Copper, Zinc, Aluminum, Chromium 6 and up to 99.9% of  Biologicals (pathogens) such as Giardia and Cryptosporidium.   Removes up to 90% of fluoride. Seychelle ADVANCED FilterThe Advanced filter is made of the same media as the Standard filter with the addition of EPA approved iodinated resin (EPA Reg #: 35917-2), which has been proven effective in the removal of bacteria and virus to six logs (99.9999%). Removes up to 90% of fluoride. It can be used in extreme conditions; turbid and stagnant water; and is ideal for emergencies such as hurricanes, cyclones, etc. such as events that occurred in the US with Katrina and the hurricane in Haiti.  (Not to be used with salt water)                         Seychelle RADIOLOGICAL FilterThe Radiological filter removes the four basic zones of contamination: Aesthetic (Chlorine, taste and odor), Chemicals (from Industry and Agriculture), Dissolved Solids (heavy metals such as lead, mercury, Chromium 6) and up to 99.99% of Radiological Contaminants such as Gross Beta, Radon 222, Alpha Radium 226, Plutonium, Uranium, Cesium 134 and 137. Removes up to 90% of fluoride.  (Not to be used with salt water)Seychelle EXTREME RAD/ADV FilterThe Extreme filter removes up to 99.99% of Chlorine, Chemicals (VOC’s), Heavy Metals and Radiological Contaminants.  It removes up to 99.9999% of Bacteria and Virus and 99.9% of Giardia and Cryptosporidium for up to 100 gallons of safe drinking water.  The Extreme filters are perfect when using water of an unknown quality, or emergency preparedness, when survival is threatened by earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, fires, radiological contamination or terrorism. Removes up to 90% Fluoride.  (Not to be used with salt water)Seychelle ALKALINE (pH Enhanced) Filter  - pH2O PureWater FilterThe pH Enhanced filter removes up to 99.99% of chlorine, chemicals (VOCs), heavy metals, and Radon 222. It removes up to 90% of fluoride. The new filter, incorporating proprietary medias, increase the alkalinity (pH) of drinking water sources up to 9.5pH..  (Your results may vary.)  Since it is more open in porosity, it does not remove giardia, cryptosporidium, virus or bacteria. It is designed to be used as a drinking water filter for use with chlorinated municipal water, as a bottled water replacement, and for those who value the benefits of high-quality, alkaline filtered water.  (Not to be used with salt water)Seychelle SUPREME FilterThe Supreme filter is made of the same media as the Extreme Rad/Adv filter with the addition of our proprietary pH medias used in our pH2O Purewater filter, which increase the alkalinity of drinking water sources up to 9.5pH.  The Supreme filter removes up to 99.99% of Chlorine, Chemicals (VOC’s), Heavy Metals and Radiological Contaminants.  It removes up to 99.9999% of Bacteria and Virus and 99.9% of Giardia and Cryptosporidium for up to 100 gallons of safe drinking water.  It removes up to 90% of fluoride and increase the pH balance of drinking water up to 9.5. (Not to be used with salt water)

Mr. Palmer is the inventor of thirteen patented products related to water purification. Mr. Palmer founded the Company in 1998. He considers it his life’s work to bring affordable clean drinking water to all, and dedicates a portion of his time to humanitarian work related to that cause in developing nations.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- NOTE 2: MANAGEMENT'S PLAN AND LIQUIDITY  Our largest customer ceased placing orders in February 2016. There were no sales to this customer during the six month period ended August 31, 2016 and the likelihood of this customer continuing to purchase our product in the future is remote. The loss of business from this customer has had a materially adverse effect on our revenues in the short term and may continue to have a materially adverse effect on our revenues in the long term if these revenues are not replaced by new products and other existing or new customers.  As of August 31, 2016, the Company had $387,601 in cash and cash equivalents, $435,751 in accounts receivable, working capital of $3,259,996 and a backlog of $51,756 in unshipped product. Additionally, the Company has developed an innovative new concept of a world filter product to sell in the world where quality drinking water is not available. Under this initiative, both the bottle and cap will to be sourced locally in each country to make the finished product competitive in the international market. The Company initiated these foreign sales plans during the six months ended August 31, 2016 with the appointment of its first international exclusive sales agent. Accordingly, management believes that over the next twelve months, sufficient working capital and liquidity will be obtained from sales to existing and new customers, in addition to debt and other capital sources as required to fund operations. The TAM Trust ("TAM"), the Company's major stockholder, has also verbally committed to provide up to $500,000 in additional funding as a line of credit to Seychelle, if required but is not legally obligated to do so.  - 7 -  SEYCHELLE ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGIES, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED (UNAUDITED) FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  August 31, 2016  NOTE 3: BASIC INCOME (LOSS) PER SHARE  Basic income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period presented. Diluted income (loss) per share is determined using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for the dilutive effect of common stock equivalents. In periods when losses are reported, the weighted average number of common shares outstanding excludes common stock equivalents because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive. The dilutive effect of outstanding stock options and warrants is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method.  The denominator for diluted income (loss) per share for the period ended August 31, 2016 did not include warrants as they would have been anti-dilutive. For the three and six month periods ended August 31, 2016, 6,407,221 warrants were excluded from the denominator for diluted net income (loss) per share.   For the six months ended August 31, 2016 2015 Numerator: Net income (loss) available to common shareholders $ (592,811 ) $ 987,575 Weighted average shares - basic 26,610,421 26,023,362 Net income (loss) per share - basic $ (0.02 ) $ 0.04 Dilutive effect of common stock equivalents: Warrants - 1,894,062 Weighted average shares - diluted 26,610,421 27,917,424 Net income (loss) per share - diluted $ (0.02 ) $ 0.04 For the three months ended August 31, 2016 2015 Numerator: Net income (loss) available to common shareholders $ (148,466 ) $ 515,077 Weighted average shares - basic 26,640,313 26,144,531 Net income (loss) per share - basic $ (0.01 ) $ 0.02 Dilutive effect of common stock equivalents: Warrants - 2,320,031 Weighted average shares - diluted 26,640,313 28,464,562 Net income (loss) per share - diluted $ (0.01 ) $ 0.02  - 8 -  SEYCHELLE ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGIES, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED (UNAUDITED) FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  August 31, 2016  NOTE 4: COMMON STOCK AND WARRANTS  Common Stock  During the six month period ended August 31, 2016, 250,000 shares of fully vested restricted common stock were issued by the Company to an employee. The shares were valued at the closing price of the Company's common stock at date of grant for a total expense of $117,500.  During the six month period ended August 31, 2015, 115,000 shares of restricted common stock were issued to employees and officers of the Company. Additionally, 100,000, 20,000, and 10,000 shares of restricted common stock were issued to TAM, vendors, and TAM's trustee, respectively. All such shares were fully vested upon issuance. The value recorded in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements was based on the estimated fair value of the stock on the date of the grant and aggregated $83,000.  Warrants  The Company had previously granted warrants to selected members of management and determined the estimated value of warrants granted using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The warrants became fully vested during the year ended February 29, 2016. The amount of the expense charged to operations for these warrants was $0 and $67,200 for the three months ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The amount of expense charged to operations for these warrants was $0 and $134,200 for the six months ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  A summary of warrant activity for the six months ended August 31, 2016 is as follows:   Weighted- Average Warrants Exercise Outstanding Price Outstanding at February 29, 2016 6,407,221 0.21 Granted - - Exercised - - Forfeited - 0.21 Outstanding at August 31, 2016 6,407,221 0.21 Vested at August 31, 2015 6,407,221 0.21 Exercisable at August 31, 2015 6,407,221 0.21  The following table summarizes significant ranges of outstanding warrants as of August 31, 2016:   Warrants Outstanding Warrants Exercisable Weighted Weighted Weighted Average Average Average Exercise Number Remaining Exercise Number Exercise  - 9 -  SEYCHELLE ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGIES, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED (UNAUDITED) FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  August 31, 2016  NOTE 5: INVENTORY The Company's inventory consisted of the following at August 31, 2016 and February 29, 2016: August 31, February 29, 2016 2016 Raw materials $ 1,973,974 $ 1,084,782 Finished goods 673,873 1,466,676 2,647,847 2,551,458 Reserve for obsolete and slow moving inventory (40,000 ) (40,000 ) $ 2,607,847 $ 2,511,458  NOTE 6: CONCENTRATIONS  Sales to one customer accounted for 27% and 35% of sales for the three and six month periods ended August 31, 2016, respectively. Accounts receivable from three customers amounted to $290,720 or approximately 63% of accounts receivable as of August 31, 2016.  Sales to two customers accounted for 61% and 66%, respectively, of sales for the three and six month periods ended August 31, 2015. Accounts receivable from these two customers amounted to $166,861 or approximately 37% of accounts receivable as of August 31, 2015. Two other customers amounted to $194,500 or approximately 43% of accounts receivable as of August 31, 2015.  NOTE 7: INCOME TAXES  For the three and six month periods ended August 31, 2016, the Company incurred tax net operating losses ("NOL's") approximating $249,000 and $972,000, respectively. Such NOL's result in deferred tax assets of approximately $386,000 at August 31, 2016. Additionally, deferred tax assets at August 31, 2016 consists of stock compensation and temporary differences related to certain accrued expenses resulting in total deferred tax assets of approximately $999,000.  In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities (including the impact of available carryback and carryforward periods), projected future taxable income, and tax-planning strategies in making this assessment. At August 31, 2016, management determined that a deferred tax asset valuation allowance was not necessary due to the Company's profitability in recent years. Management will continue to evaluate the need for a deferred tax asset valuation allowance going forward each reporting period.  - 10 -  SEYCHELLE ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGIES, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED (UNAUDITED) FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  August 31, 2016  NOTE 8: RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS  During the three month periods ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company incurred consulting fees to related parties in the amounts of $25,000 and $25,000, respectively. During the six month periods ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company incurred consulting fees to related parties in the amounts of $25,000 and $75,000, respectively. These fees were related to TAM, in which Cari Beck, is the trustee and current Board member, as well as a daughter of Carl Palmer, an officer and Board member. These amounts are included as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses on the condensed consolidated statements of operations. All amounts due to TAM had been paid in full as of August 31, 2016 and 2015.  During the three month periods ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, TAM purchased, on behalf of the Company, $12,350 and $208,000, respectively, of raw materials from a vendor with which it already had a business relationship. During the six month periods ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, TAM purchased, on behalf of the Company, $20,090 and $393,000, respectively, of raw materials, and paid $0 and $3,500, respectively, for related tooling to a vendor with which it already had a business relationship.  The Company utilizes the services of an individual, who is a related party, to source materials and provide the manufacturing of component parts with third-party vendors in China. For the six months ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, purchases facilitated through the related party accounted for approximately 34% and 30%, respectively, of total raw material purchases.  As of August 31, 2016 and February 29, 2016, the Company had receivables from employees of approximately $45,000 and $40,000. These amounts are being repaid through direct payroll withdrawals.  TAM has also verbally committed to provide up to $500,000 in funding as a line of credit on behalf of Seychelle, if required, but is not legally obligated to do so.  NOTE 9: COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  Leases  The Company is obligated on three operating leases at August 31, 2016: two in San Juan Capistrano, California (as previously reported in the Company's Form 10-K/A filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the year ended February 29, 2016) and one (new) in Aliso Viejo, California. The Company moved its corporate headquarters from San Juan Capistrano to Aliso Viejo during August 2016 and combined its corporate offices with warehouse and production space, which were previously in separate locations. The Company has sub-leased its prior office space location to a third party in connection with the move, and is attempting to sub-lease the remaining San Juan Capistrano location to other third parties.  - 11 -  SEYCHELLE ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGIES, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED (UNAUDITED) FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  August 31, 2016  NOTE 9: COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (continued)  The sub-lease was effective September 1, 2016, provides the Company with $6,505 per month, and expires July 31, 2017.  The Company's Aliso Viejo lease was effective August 1, 2016, requires monthly payments of $19,446, with graduated annual increases, and expires in July 2021.  Litigation  On September 26, 2016, the Company was served with a complaint by a former employee alleging breach of contract. The Company believes the case is without merit and intends to vigorously defend itself in this matter. No outcome can be determined at this time.  NOTE 10: SUBSEQUENT EVENTS  On October 7, 2016, Mr. James Place, Director, President, Treasurer and CFO, resigned from the Board of Directors and the Company. There were no disagreements between the Company and Mr. Place.

Ms. Cari Beck became the Treasurer as well as retaining the title of Secretary and Director.  - 12 -  ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  This discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting the operating results, financial condition and liquidity and cash flows of Seychelle Environmental Technologies, Inc., and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of and for the three and six month periods ended August 31, 2016 and 2015. The discussion and analysis that follows should be read together with the consolidated financial statements of Seychelle Environmental Technologies, Inc. and the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2016. Except for historical information, the matters discussed in this section are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties and are based upon judgments concerning various factors that are beyond the Company's control.  Forward-Looking Statements  Certain statements contained herein are "forward-looking" statements. Forward-looking statements include statements which are predictive in nature; which depend upon or refer to future events or conditions; or which include words such as "expects", "anticipates", "intends", "plans", "believes", "estimates", or variations or negatives thereof or by similar or comparable words or phrases. In addition, any statement concerning future financial performance, ongoing business strategies or prospects, and possible future Company actions that may be provided by management are also forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and projections about future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions about the Company; and economic and market factors in the countries in which the Company does business, among other things. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and the Company has no specific intentions to update these statements. Actual events and results may differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors including, among others:  (1) the portable water filtration industry is in a state of rapid technological change, which can render the Company's products obsolete or unmarketable;  (2) any failure by the Company to anticipate or respond to technological developments or changes in industry standards or customer requirements, or any significant delays in product development or introduction, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, operating results and financial condition;  (3) the Company's sales are concentrated to a few large customers, and loss of business from one or more could impact the Company's revenues, gross profit and operating results;  (4) the Company's cost of sales may be materially affected by increases in the market prices of the raw materials used in the Company's assembly processes;  (5) the Company's water related product sales could be materially affected by weather conditions and government regulations;  (6) the Company is subject to the risks of conducting business internationally; and  (7) the industries in which the Company operates are highly competitive. Additional risks and uncertainties are outlined in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its most recent fiscal 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K/A.  - 13 -  Description of the Business  We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on January 23, 1998 as a change of domicile to Royal Net, Inc., a Utah corporation that was originally incorporated on January 24, 1986. Royal Net, Inc. changed its state of domicile to Nevada and its name to Seychelle Environmental Technologies, Inc. effective in January 1998.  On January 30, 1998, we entered into an Exchange Agreement with Seychelle Water Technologies, Inc., a Nevada corporation (SWT), whereby we exchanged our issued and outstanding capital shares with the shareholders of SWT on a one share for one share basis. We became the parent company and SWT became a wholly owned subsidiary. SWT had been formed in 1997 to market water filtration systems of Aqua Vision International.  Our Company is presently comprised of Seychelle Environmental Technologies, Inc., a Nevada corporation, with two wholly-owned subsidiaries, Seychelle Water Technologies, Inc. and Fill 2 Pure International, Inc., also Nevada corporations (collectively, the Company or Seychelle). We use the trade name "Seychelle Water Filtration Products, Inc." in our commercial operations.  Seychelle designs, assembles and distributes unique, state-of-the-art ionic absorption micron filters for portable filter devices that remove up to 99.99% of all pollutants and contaminants found in any fresh water source. Patents or trade secrets cover all proprietary products.  Our principal business address is 22 Journey, Aliso Viejo, California 92656. Our telephone number at this address is 949-234-1999.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Results of Operations  Our summarized historical financial data is presented in the following table to aid in your analysis. You should read this data in conjunction with this section entitled Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, our condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. The selected condensed consolidated statements of operations data for the three and six month periods ended August 31, 2016 and 2015 are derived from our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.  Three month period ended August 31, 2016 compared to the corresponding period in 2015   Period over 2016 2015 Period change % Sales $ 728,232 $ 2,724,829 (1,996,597 ) (73%) Cost of sales 358,432 1,319,711 (961,279 ) (73%) Gross profit 369,800 1,405,118 (1,035,318 ) (74%) Gross profit % 51% 52% - - Selling general and administrative expenses 608,121 602,371 5,750 1% Depreciation and amortization expense 20,779 20,395 384 2% Other income 10,072 443 9,629 2174% Income (loss) before income tax benefit (expense) (249,028 ) 782,795 (1,031,823 ) (132%) Income tax benefit (expense) 100,562 (267,718 ) 368,280 138% Net income (loss) (148,466 ) 515,077 (663,543 ) (129%)  - 14 -  Sales. The decrease in sales to approximately $728,000 during the three months ended August 31, 2016 from approximately $2.7 million during the three months ended August 31, 2015 (73%) is primarily due to our largest customer ceasing ordering in February 2016. There were no sales to this customer during the three month period ended August 31, 2016 and the likelihood of this customer continuing to purchase our product in the future is remote. The loss of business from this customer has had a materially adverse effect on our revenues in the short term and may continue to have a materially adverse effect on our revenues in the long term if these revenues are not replaced by new products and other existing or new customers.  While the Company has experienced decreased sales and anticipates lower total sales in the current fiscal year, the Company has developed an innovative new concept of a world filter product to sell worldwide where quality drinking water is not available. Both the bottle and the cap will be sourced locally to make the finished product competitive in the international market. The Company initiated these foreign sales plans during the three months ended August 31, 2016 with the appointment of its first international sales agent in Sri Lanka. In addition to this appointment, we have identified sales agents for India, South Korea and the Philippines and are pursuing other contacts to dramatically expand this effort to expand our customer base. Accordingly, management believes that over the remainder of the fiscal year, sufficient working capital and liquidity will be obtained from revenues to sustain operations. Management believes that sales will increase from the current quarter with the launch of this world filter product.  Cost of sales and gross profit percentage. As a percentage of sales, the gross profit margin during the three months ended August 31, 2016 decreased slightly to 51% from 52%. Variations such as this occur routinely based on product mix.  Selling, general and administrative expenses. These expenses remained relatively consistent period over period, increasing by approximately $6,000, or 1%, during the period ended August 31, 2016, compared to the same period in the prior year. The Company's management expects selling, general and administrative expenses to decrease during the remainder of the current fiscal year.  Depreciation and amortization expense. Depreciation and amortization expense was relatively flat from period to period, but the slight increase is due to additional computer equipment purchased during the period ended August 31, 2016.  Income tax expense (benefit). The Company recorded income tax benefit of approximately $101,000 due to the pretax loss of approximately $249,000 during the three months ended August 31, 2016, compared to an income tax expense of approximately $268,000 related to pretax income of approximately $783,000 during the three month period ended August 31, 2015. The Company has a net deferred tax asset at August 31, 2016 of approximately $999,000, and management believes no valuation allowance is needed at this time.  Net income (loss). Net loss for the three month period ended August 31, 2016 was approximately $148,000 compared to net income for the three month period ended August 31, 2015 of approximately $515,000. This was primarily due to the decrease of approximately $2.0 million in sales (73%) and the loss of our largest customer as noted above. We remain focused on the primary factors affecting our bottom line and look to continue to improve the Company's profitability in the upcoming periods during fiscal 2017.  - 15 -  Six month period ended August 31, 2016 compared to the corresponding period in 2015   Period over 2016 2015 Period change % Sales $ 1,627,368 $ 5,072,012 (3,444,644 ) (68%) Cost of sales 946,917 2,387,741 (1,440,824 ) (60%) Gross profit 680,451 2,684,271 (2,003,820 ) (75%) Gross profit % 42 % 53 % Selling general and administrative expenses 1,621,034 1,154,287 466,747 41% Depreciation and amortization expense 42,830 30,107 12,723 42% Other income (expense) 11,244 707 10,537 1490% Income (loss) before income tax benefit (expense) (972,169 ) 1,500,584 (2,472,753 ) (165%)  Oct 14, 2016  (c) 1995-2016 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc.
