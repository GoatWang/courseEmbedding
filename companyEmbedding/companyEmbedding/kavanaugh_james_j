Will You Be My
                    Friend?
                  Kavanaugh writes: "Friendship is freedom, is flowing,
                  is rare.. It trusts, understands, grows, explores, it
                  smiles and weeps. It does not exhust or cling, expect
                  or depand. It is - and that is enough - and it dreams
                  a lot!"

We can once again offer you a way to get some of Jim's books! ~ Check our Book Shop ~   James Kavanaugh passed
                            away on the 29th of December 2009. 
                            He left a legacy we like to call "The Spirit
                            of James Kavanaugh".  

The purpose of
                          this website is to bring this spirit of Jim
                          back to life for us today.  The timeless
                          qualities of any great writer is an ability of
                          putting together simple thoughts in ways that
                          express profound, insightful meaning about
                          this time we call life. I believe Jim had this
                          ability and proved it over and over again in
                          all of his writing.  His words allow us
                          to laugh out loud on one page, cry silent
                          tears on the next and smile in agreement with
                          another.  
One of
                  the common threads that run though all of Jim's
                  writings is a belief that the answers we need in life
                  come from within each of us.  These life answers
                  are always revealed through the exchange of love we
                  share with our lover or in the disappointments we
                  experienced in life and in those times when all our
                  friends desert us for reasons we never fully
                  understand.  Jim helps us discover these and
                  other reasons in the beauty of nature, life and love
                  as we walk easy on the earth and learn how to view
                  love and life as an ever expanding process along our
                  journey.  




Jim's
                  books were a regular fixture in bookshops around
                  America until life became more individualistic and
                  focus mainly on our financial return from life and
                  less on the unconditional positive regard for
                  others.  Since 1969, when Jim wrote "The Birth of
                  God", we have only intensified our acceptance of
                  self-limiting institutions, acquisitions of material
                  positions and heartless sexual encounters as a better
                  path toward a fuller life.  We have failed to
                  heed Jim's words in "There Are Men
                      Too Gentle To Live Among Wolves":




"There are men too
                                  gentle to live among wolves
Who
                                  prey upon them with their IBM eyes
And sell their hearts
                                  and guts for martinis at noon.
There are men too
                                  gentle for a savage world"




 
We no
                  longer seem to believe there is a place for a more
                  human side in our isolating post-modern society. 
                  We have freely exchanged any chance for a fuller,
                  richer love because we have given ourselves over to
                  heartless business activities, soulless religious
                  institutions and lifeless marriages and interpersonal
                  relationships.      
 
 
I
                  believe it is time to take a fresh look at the
                  words Jim wrote so many years ago and begin the
                  process of redefining the meaning of love and
                  friendship and rediscover the pathways to more
                  rewarding lives and deeper love relationships. 
                  As part of this process we will be transforming this
                  website into a tool to help us rediscover the joy of
                  developing deeper more passionate love and
                  friendships.  Come in and explore these pages and
                  see how the work Jim started so many years ago can
                  become alive for us today.  

                  Jim describes the challenge and rewards of a life that
                  is full of gentleness and renewed passion in his poem
"Will You Be
                      My Friend?" :   
 


 



  
...A friend 
  

  
Who far beyond the
                                feebleness of any vow or tie
 
 Will touch the
                                    secret place where I am really I,
   

 To know the pain of
                                    lips that plead and eyes that weep,
   

  
Who will not run away
                                when you find me in the
                                street   

 
  
Alone and lying mangled
                                by my quota of defeats 
 
  
But will stop and stay to
                                tell me of another day 
 
  
When I was beautiful. 
 
  
Will you be my friend? 
 
  
There are so many
                                        reasons why you never should ...

                  our bookshop and visit our workshops area to see if
                  one of our workshops or those of our associates may be

About the Author


James Kavanaugh was ordained and actively ministered for ten years as a Catholic Priest before attending Catholic University in Washington D.C. Working on his second doctoral degree, he wrote an article for the Saturday Evening Post, entitled, "I am a Priest, and I want to marry." The article questioned the practice of celibacy among priests. The year was 1967, the height of the sexual revolution. Although it was written under a pseudonym and even his closest friends and family were not aware of the author, it was received with such commotion and outrage, the secret would not be kept for long. Soon Simon and Schuster was calling for a book deal. Amid personal confusion, James took a leave of absence from the priesthood, packed his VW bug and headed for California to write books.

This title, one of his earliest, and the many more that he's  written since, have sold over 16 million copies, and every poetry reading  he gives is sold out. This quiet man writes prose and poetry that sings of  the love of God that we return to God and share with each other, and it  helps us recognize the sacred in our lives.Read more0Comment|

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
