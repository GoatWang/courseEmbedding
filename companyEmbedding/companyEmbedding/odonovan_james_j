boston mormons - ConnellEARLY BOSTON MORMONS AND MISSIONARIES, J TO Z 1831-1860 Alphabetical List of People Affiliated with the Boston Branch (J to Z) Women are alphabetized below by their maiden names; their married names are included in parentheses. Smithite means follower of Joseph Smith and member of the LDS Church before his murder in June 1844. Brighamite refers to the vast majority of Smithites who followed Brigham Young (at least initially) as Smith’s successor after August 1844. Strangites were those few who followed James J. Strang as Smith’s successor. Lack of notation below means that person was a Smithite and/or Brighamite only. I have created a separate listing of early Mormons who lived in nearby Essex County (including small branches in Salem, Lynn, Danvers, Gloucester, Newbury, etc.) If they also had known affiliation with the Boston Branch as well (such as Augusta Adams Cobb), they are cross-listed here as well.
