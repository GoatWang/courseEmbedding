Seadrill - Why Has Hemen Holding Extended Expiration Of The TRS Agreement For 3.9 Million Shares? - Seadrill Limited (NYSE:SDRL) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Seadrill - Why Has Hemen Holding Extended Expiration Of The TRS Agreement For 3.9 Million Shares?Jul. 3.17 | About: Seadrill Limited (SDRL) Fun Trading Special situations, contrarian, long/short equity, valueSummaryJune 6, 2017 - Hemen Holding Ltd, indirectly controlled by John Fredriksen, has extended TRS agreements for 3.9 million shares of SDRL.
        The new expiration of the TRS agreements is September 6th, 2017. The exercise price on the agreements is NOK 3.888 ($US 0.466) per share, down from NOK 10.8759 ($US 1.306).
        Every move made by John Fredriksen is an important topic to analyze. Are we going to get another delay of some sort?
        

 Source: Seadrill. Seadrill Ltd. (NYSE:SDRL) Investment Strategy: Sadly, filing for bankruptcy is now a familiar occurrence in the offshore drilling industry. After Hercule offshore, now gone, Paragon offshore (PGNPQ), Ocean Rig UDW (ORIG) and probably soon Pacific Drilling (PACD) we are waiting for Seadrill to release the "news". Everyone here knows that Seadrill (NYSE:SDRL) and its subsidiaries such as North Atlantic Drilling (NYSE:NADL) are in the process of restructuring their huge debt (~$14 billion), either through an out-of-court deal or through Chapter 11. We all expect now an agreement by the end of July, after the company announced early April that it managed to get another delay to complete the restructuring plan. Of course, Seadrill may push the can even further down the road if necessary? As I said before, very often in these particular situations, shareholders will be offered a tiny percentage of the new stock, and I believe Seadrill restructuring plan will leave between 1% to 5% to present shareholders. The company warned in April that shareholders will get a "minimal recovery" which implies that SDRL shareholders should expect for a "tiny stake" in exchange of their shares -- different from zero -- in the new reorganized Seadrill. The stock took a dive on the news.
 

 Depending on which side of the fence you are standing on, it is easy to use this statement "any which way you can" as Clint Easwood said. As I indicated in my preceding article, Seadrill may come up with an out-of-court deal -- with the consent of the majority of the bondholders -- which is generally more favorable for present shareholders, in my opinion. The major difference in this particular restructuring case is that the main player is John Fredriksen, worth over $9 billion, who owns 23.41% of the company stocks through Hemen Holdings Ltd. Hence, the best strategy is to adopt a "middle way attitude", based on the "most likely" scenario which is a restructuring under a pre-packaged bankruptcy deal that leaves a small stake to shareholders in the new company. The topic of this article is to talk about what could be a "minimal recovery" translated in share price and how to trade the stock with a profit? Recent development from Hemen Holdings Ltd. On June 7, 2017, we learned the following: Hemen Holding Ltd, which is indirectly controlled by trusts established by John Fredriksen for the benefit of his immediate family, has extended TRS agreements relating to 3.9 million shares in Seadrill Limited. The new expiration of the TRS agreements is September 6th, 2017. The exercise price on the agreements is NOK 3.888 per share. Hemen Holding Ltd's affiliated ownership in Seadrill is following this transaction unchanged 119,097,583 shares, constituting 23,41 percent of the issued share capital. In addition, Hemen Holding holds TRS agreements with exposure to 3,900,000 shares in Seadrill Limited. A TRS is a Total Return Swap is another popular derivative contract that was developed from a traditional swap format to enable synthetic replication of financial asset.
 I waited a few weeks to give my opinion on this recent development because I was curious to see what effect could represent this announcement on the stock price? Based on an exchange rate between NOK to $US (1 Norwegian Krone = 0.119835), NOK 3.888 represents $0.466. Apparently, the market did not move much about this deal. However, the sudden sell off on June 23 with a volume close to 48 million shares is still a big enigma. Yes, so-called Russell re-balancing day may have played a big part of the sell off in the last half hour of the trading day in June 23. As we all know, Seadrill is also a component of the Russell 2000. 

 The Russell 2000 is one of the leading indices tracking small-cap companies in the United States, and therefore, the sell off could be logically attributed to this issue. That is the annual reconstitution of the Russell Indexes, where the index provider makes rule-based changes to the composition of its indexes, to ensure that changes in market value or investment styles, like shares of companies deemed value or growth, for example, are properly accounted. However, we cannot rule out some sort of manipulation directly related to SDRL, using the Russell re-balancing day as just a pretext. The stock skidded down 20% that day, mainly in the last 15 minutes of trading on Friday. In fact, in retrospect, SDRL was the victim of a triple whammy that day.  Crude toppled below $45 on bearish inventory data in the USA in June 22. Russel 2000 re-balancing. End of the trading week.  


 Unfortunately, while oil prices have recovered nicely since June 22 from $44.75 a barrel to now $48.77, conversely, SDRLis still trading close to the low achieved in January 24. This suggests that 0.35 may well be a strong support until the news hit the wire on the restructuring. The question is the significance of the 0.35 pricing by the street now? We have no easy way to logically define what could be the value of SDRL after restructuring, and we are reduced to a simple guessing. I base my thinking empirically on the book value, and the potential stake given to the stockholders for their shares in the new company. The Book value is used when referring to the total amount of stockholders' equity appearing on a corporation's balance sheet. Again, this book value is not an indication of the market value of the corporation. It simply indicates the amounts appearing on the books for the assets less the amounts appearing for the liabilities. A corporation can be far more valuable than the amount of its book value. To simplify my demonstration I will take the Book value indicated by yahoo, which is $18.98, adjusted by the Brent oil price divided by $50 per barrel. (Anything below $50 is bearish).    Percentage given to stockholders n%   PPS equivalent BV x n%   Oil price ratio BV x n% x Brent/50    1% 0.19 0.18   2% 0.38 0.37   3% 0.57 0.55   4% 0.76 0.74   5% 0.95 0.92   Based on the table above it seems that a 2% stake is the probable outcome that the street is betting on. This is also what I believe will happen. Thus, I think any deal below 2% will be damaging for the stock and the price per share may eventually sink another 50%. The Hemen holding TRS agreements may suggest a 2.5% instead. Conclusion: SDRL is extremely difficult to trade and I do not recommend any investing or trading at this present stage, because the risk is too high and the outlook is too blurry. The best strategy is to wait for a specific news and act swiftly using the trend either on the short side or on the long side. The only catalyst that could give a positive boost to the stock now is the price of oil above $50 a barrel. According to Statoil chief economist Eirik Waerness, who spoke to Bloomberg last Monday, oil prices will jump over $60 “relatively soon”. 
  He said oil prices should tighten with the next five years, describing the slow recovery as a “patience game.” Non-OPEC nations must also cut production in order to reverse the supply glut. “At some point this level is not sustainable,” the economist added.  It will not happen tomorrow, but when it comes to a restructuring plan it is a paramount element in the negotiation. Important note: Do not forget to follow me on the offshore drilling sector.

History[edit]
Frontline has its origin in Frontline AB, which was founded in 1985, and which was listed on the Stockholm Stock Exchange from 1989 to 1997. Hemen Holding (a company indirectly controlled by the largest shareholder and chairman of Frontline, John Fredriksen) became the largest shareholder of Frontline in 1996. In May 1997, a decision was made at the general meeting in Frontline AB to change its domicile from Sweden to Bermuda and to list its shares on the Oslo Stock Exchange. The change of domicile was executed through a share for share exchange offer from the then newly formed Frontline in Bermuda.
Under Fredriksen the company absorbed several other companies: London and Overseas Freighters (1997), ICB (1999), and Golden Ocean (2000). These takeovers made Frontline the world's largest tanker company, a position it has retained to the present day.[3][4]
Today[edit]
As of December 31, 2010, Frontline's tanker and OBO fleet consisted of 73 vessels. The fleet consists of 44 VLCCs, which are either owned or chartered in, 21 Suezmax tankers which are either owned or chartered in and eight Suezmax OBOs which are chartered in. Frontline also had five VLCC newbuildings and two Suezmax newbuildings on order and three VLCCs under their commercial management. The company's largest shareholder is Hemen Holding Ltd., a company indirectly controlled by the chairman of Frontline, billionaire John Fredriksen, Norway's highest net worth person.
The freight market is a very volatile market, with standard deviations of up to 70%. From an options perspective, this is a possibility for a very large up and downside—part of this downside can be hedged away via freight derivatives. AG-Japan clean and dirty are the most liquid routes traded in the derivatives market. Frontline has a very high dividend yield, both in cash and in Ship Finance (SFL) stocks; for example, in late 2007 its annual dividend ran between 12 and 18%, depending on the fluctuating share price. SFL is an offshoot of Frontline; the offshoot is estimated to have generated 25% gains to shareholders due to the different risk in Frontline and SFL. Golden Ocean Group (GOGL), a dry bulk carrier firm, was also spun off of Frontline and listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange. GOGL is a volatile stock, and as with Frontline, dry freight derivatives are available. In 2006, Frontline started a new Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) project, Sea Production.
In June 2007, Frontline sold its entire holding of 25,500,000 shares in Sea Production. The sale of the shares was in line with Frontline's strategy to remain a pure crude oil transportation company. Frontline and Sea Production will continue a strategic partnership with respect to conversion of crude oil tankers into oil storage and production units.

In May 1997, a decision was made at the general meeting in Frontline AB to change its domicile from Sweden to Bermuda and to list its shares on the Oslo Stock Exchange. The change of domicile was executed through a share for share exchange offer from the then newly formed Frontline in Bermuda.
Under Fredriksen the company absorbed several other companies: London and Overseas Freighters (1997), ICB (1999), and Golden Ocean (2000). These takeovers made Frontline the world's largest tanker company, a position it has retained to the present day.[3][4]
Today[edit]
As of December 31, 2010, Frontline's tanker and OBO fleet consisted of 73 vessels. The fleet consists of 44 VLCCs, which are either owned or chartered in, 21 Suezmax tankers which are either owned or chartered in and eight Suezmax OBOs which are chartered in. Frontline also had five VLCC newbuildings and two Suezmax newbuildings on order and three VLCCs under their commercial management. The company's largest shareholder is Hemen Holding Ltd., a company indirectly controlled by the chairman of Frontline, billionaire John Fredriksen, Norway's highest net worth person.
The freight market is a very volatile market, with standard deviations of up to 70%. From an options perspective, this is a possibility for a very large up and downside—part of this downside can be hedged away via freight derivatives. AG-Japan clean and dirty are the most liquid routes traded in the derivatives market. Frontline has a very high dividend yield, both in cash and in Ship Finance (SFL) stocks; for example, in late 2007 its annual dividend ran between 12 and 18%, depending on the fluctuating share price. SFL is an offshoot of Frontline; the offshoot is estimated to have generated 25% gains to shareholders due to the different risk in Frontline and SFL. Golden Ocean Group (GOGL), a dry bulk carrier firm, was also spun off of Frontline and listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange. GOGL is a volatile stock, and as with Frontline, dry freight derivatives are available. In 2006, Frontline started a new Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) project, Sea Production.
In June 2007, Frontline sold its entire holding of 25,500,000 shares in Sea Production. The sale of the shares was in line with Frontline's strategy to remain a pure crude oil transportation company. Frontline and Sea Production will continue a strategic partnership with respect to conversion of crude oil tankers into oil storage and production units.

Redeploying Capital – Mr. Fredriksen Sells a Small Piece of Seadrill
 




Last week, John Fredriksen announced that Hemen Holding Ltd, a company ultimately controlled by trusts established for the benefit of Mr. Fredriksen’s children, agreed to sell 24 million shares of Seadrill Limited to investors while entering into a privately negotiated cash or physically Settled Put Option with Goldman Sachs with a 90 day average maturity on 24m Shares with a strike price set at the closing price on the New York Stock Exchange at Norwegian Kroner 235.1419. The highly structured put mechanism will provide purchasers with downside protection for the period specified. On Thursday, the company announced that it has sold 24 million Shares and 24 million Seller Put Options at a combined purchase price of NOK 236.3176 per share and seller put option. Following the completion of the offering, Hemen will hold 109 million shares, in addition to TRS agreements with underlying exposure to 3.9 million shares. If all the put options are exercised with physical delivery at expiry, Hemen's position in Seadrill will revert to the original 28% interest.
Hemen’s current share ownership of 28% is currently worth approximately $5.6 billion and represents 63% of the Fredriksen Group's investment portfolio of the listed companies controlled by Hemen. Through the offering, Hemen's ownership in Seadrill will be reduced to approximately 23% but, nevertheless, it will remain the largest shareholder in Seadrill. Commensurately with the sale, Seadrill's proportion of the Fredriksen investment portfolio will be reduced from 63% to 58%.
The sale will allow for greater diversification of the portfolio by creating liquidity for the Fredriksen Group
“…to aggressively pursue investment opportunities in the currently oversupplied market for commodity shipping.”  Such opportunities would include but not be limited to buying distressed asset companies, ordering newbuildings and seeking opportunities for consolidation.
	The company has entered into a lock-up where it has agreed not to sell further shares in Seadrill for a period of one year.
Arctic Securities’ Erik Nikolai Stavseth puts these numbers into perspective: “The sale will amount to approximately USD 1bn…. We see this as a positive sign for companies like FRNT, and potentially GOGL, but also think the Fredriksen Group could be aiming for other segments (as shown by their 6+4 order of MRs). With an additional USD 1bn in equity at hand, this could effectively turn into USD 3bn of investments assuming 66% gearing – below what most of Fredriksen’s listed entities indicate as achievable financing. As a back-of-the-envelope perspective, USD 3bn could turn into 35 VLCCs (6% of existing fleet) at USD 85m per vessel or 67 Capesizes (~5% of existing fleet) at USD 45m per vessel – showing the firepower John Fredriksen is creating for his companies.”
Fotis Giannakoulis of Morgan Stanley also has a hypothesis as to what Mr. Fredriksen might do with the new found liquidity:
“With GLNG’s expansion in the LNG sector already topping a $3.5bn orderbook, the focus is most likely shifting towards counter-cyclical expansion into bulkers and tankers. However, in our view, Fredriksen’s steps could be more cautious than headlines might suggest, potentially targeting an investment horizon much longer than most equity investors. Both tankers and bulkers are currently in a state of distress, and this is not expected to change over the near term. Nevertheless, we see exposure through newbuild orders as a possibility, given recent technology changes on fuel efficiency, low down payments and options that offer further leverage to the upside. His recent order of 10 fuel-efficient product tankers with 2013-14 delivery could be only a first step in our view. With the long-term outlook for crude tankers negative and asset values still high, we would expect to see further expansion in the dry bulk market. We would also not exclude the possibility of a distressed deal in containerships as the KG market is suffering.”
We find ourselves in Fotis’ court. Mr. Fredriksen has shown a preference on the drilling side to order new state of the art equipment to earn premium rates. Moreover, pricing and terms are in his favor as he points out.
Of course the last thing the world needs now is more ships. Yes, oil prices are high and there is no end in sight or is there?  We recall financing U.S. Line’s round the world service which was built upon 12 “jumbo” (4,200 TEU) low-cost, slow speed container vessels with fuel efficient engines in the early 1980s. The concept was the brainchild of Malcolm McLean in the early 1980s, when everyone was talking about $100/barrel oil. It never came and speed was of the essence. It also did not help that the main trade flows were largely unidirectional across the trans-Pacific. By 1986, U.S. Lines filed for bankruptcy.
The reason for the digression for this Santayana moment is to remind all of the importance of institutional memory. On the other hand, we have learned over time to expect the unexpected when it comes to both markets and Mr. Fredriksen, so we will not be taking bets.
Lastly, we wax philosophical and thought about the trade-off of the fuel savings versus the energy expenditures involved in the construction and the premature destruction, due to so-called economic obsolescence, of assets designed to trade for thirty years. Then there are the piles of steel that need to be transformed yet again through the use of more energy. Everything has a price and for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction (Newton’s Third Law of Motion).

Home | About Frontline | History




 




History
The early years
Our company traces its origins to Frontline AB, which was founded in 1985 and listed on the Stockholm Stock Exchange from 1989 to 1997. In 1996, Hemen Holding Limited, a company indirectly controlled by trusts established by John Fredriksen for the benefit of his immediate family (“Hemen Holding”), became the majority shareholder in Frontline AB.  Frontline AB was subsequently re-domiciled from Sweden to Bermuda and listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange in May 1997.  The following year, Frontline AB was merged with London & Overseas Freighters (“LOF”), also a Bermuda company, with LOF as the surviving company. LOF was subsequently renamed Frontline Ltd. (“Frontline”), the Frontline we know today. 
Returning Value to Shareholders
Through a series of acquisitions and purchases of new and secondhand tankers, Frontline became the world’s largest tanker company. In August 2001, Frontline shares began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the ticker ‘FRO’.  For the next ten years, Frontline consistently returned value to its shareholders in the form of cash dividends and shares of Frontline subsidiaries spun off as separately listed companies. 
In October 2003, Frontline formed Ship Finance Limited (“Ship Finance”) as a wholly owned subsidiary.   On June 16, 2004, Frontline distributed 25% of the common shares of Ship Finance to Frontline’s shareholders.  The following day, the common shares of Ship Finance began trading on the NYSE under the symbol ‘SFL.’.  By the end of 2006, Frontline had distributed 100% of its ownership in Ship Finance to its shareholders.    
In December 2004, Frontline spun off its interest in a subsidiary, dry bulk owner Golden Ocean Group Limited (“Golden Ocean”), to shareholders of Frontline.  Golden Ocean was subsequently listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange and later through the merger with Knightsbridge on NASDAQ under the ticker ‘GOGL’.
Since the company’s initial listing on the NYSE, it has returned significant dividends to its shareholders.    The company has also generated significant returns for its shareholders through share spin offs.    
Restructuring & Rebuilding
In early 2012, after an extend downturn in the tanker market, Frontline completed a restructuring while many of its peers filed for bankruptcy protection.  The restructuring was made possible through a significant financial commitment of Frontline’s still-largest shareholder, Hemen Holding. In the restructuring, a new company, Frontline 2012 Ltd., was formed and listed on the Norwegian over the counter market.  Frontline 2012 raised $285 million in equity, of which 50% was received from Hemen Holding, to acquire 15 of Frontline’s vessels, including five newbuilding contracts, and the debt and contractual obligations associated with those vessels.  
Following the restructuring, Frontline gradually divested itself of older vessels and decreased its fleet size.
Frontline 2012 pursued a growth strategy, mainly through newbuilding acquisitions in the dry bulk, gas, crude oil, and refined product segments. In 2013 Frontline 2012 acquired a large stake in Avance Gas Holding Ltd (“Avance”) and Frontline 2012 sold eight Very Large Gas Carrier newbuildings to Avance. Later the shares in Avance were distributed to the Frontline 2012 shareholders.
In 2014 Frontline 2012 and Knightsbridge Tankers Limited agreed to combine Frontline 2012s cape size dry bulk newbuildings. Knightsbridge subsequently issued shares to Frontline 2012. Knightsbridge later agreed to merge with Golden Ocean Group Limited and forming a leading dry bulk company. In 2015 Frontline 2012 announced a special dividend and distributed its shares in the merged company, Golden Ocean , to its shareholders.
Merger with Frontline 2012
On November 30, 2015, the shareholders of each of Frontline and Frontline 2012 agreed to enter into a merger transaction, with Frontline 2012 becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of Frontline.
