Ziad2017-07-19T20:57:21+00:00Gates has been backing HIV self-testing and rapid diagnostics projects since around 2010, when it invested $600,000 in Daktari Diagnostics, a company focused on “delivering critical diagnostic test results.” In 2015, Daktari rolled out its portable point-of-care device that measures CD4 cell counts. CD4s are white blood cells that fight infection and are defined as “antigen[s] found on helper T cells.” The following year, in 2011, Gates awarded PATH a $1.1 million grant to “develop a target product profile […]

SNAP Sorter Smart Neural Action Potential Software



      Scientists at the Leibniz-Institut für Molekulare Pharmakologie (FMP) and NeuroCure Cluster of Excellence in Berlin discovered a neuronal circuit which regulates the hypothalamus and activates food-seeking in mice. Surprisingly, this neural mechanism appeared to utilize gamma oscillations, and does not depend on hunger. Optogenetics helped to shed light on the behavioral function of this circuit. The findings allow for better understanding of the mechanisms of feeding behavior, and could lead to development of innovative therapies to treat eating disorders. Read the full article from MedicalXpress.
    

       Using the Digital Lynx SX in conjunction with Neuronexus optotrodes and Omicron Laser, they established a protocol that combines optogenetics with electrophysiological recordings from neonatal mice in vivo to elucidate the substrate of early network oscillations in the prefrontal cortex. Read the full article from Nature.

Shulman Rogers NEXT: Experienced Lawyers, Fixed And Predictable Fees For Start-Ups









PR Newswire




May 17, 2017 10:51 AM EDT













 


















































 Client reaction has been extremely strong and positive.  "I worked with Anthony, who is both an excellent senior lawyer and an entrepreneur," said Seulki Lee, CEO of Neuraly Inc., which offers promising therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.  "He and his team helped me with all aspects of a very successful financing, and knowing we had a predictable pricing model provided significant peace of mind."    Yulia Yaani, co-founder with Masha Sharma of RealAtom.com, the first commercial real estate online debt exchange matching borrowers with the right lenders in real time, has used Shulman Rogers NEXT for employment services.  "We had the opportunity to work directly with Merry Campbell, co-chair of the Employment Law Practice Group, through a fixed-price employment package .  Merry is sharp, clearly experienced, great to work with, and she quickly solved our issue. As a start-up, knowing we had a manageable, fixed price was very valuable."  Shulman Rogers views NEXT as a beginning of long-term relationships with clients.  The firm routinely works with later stage and mature companies, and also represents venture capital and private equity funds.
