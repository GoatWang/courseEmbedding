Digital Millennium Copyright Act Notice Form
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") is a United States copyright law that provides guidelines for online service providers in case of copyright infringement. Below is the information that should be present in these notices. It is designed to make submitting notices of alleged infringement to us as straightforward as possible while reducing the number of notices that we receive that are fraudulent or difficult to understand or verify. The form of notice specified below is consistent with the DMCA, which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office website, http://www.copyright.gov.
To file a notice of infringement with us, you must provide us with the items specified below. Please note that you will be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) if you materially misrepresent that the material is infringing your copyright. Accordingly, if you are not sure whether material infringes your copyright, we suggest that you first contact an attorney.
This notice and any attachments we receive will be forwarded to the alleged infringer, who will then have the opportunity to file a counter notification pursuant to Sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. Should a properly filed counter notification be filed, you will be notified and have 10 business days within which to file for a restraining order in Federal Court to prevent the reinstatement of the material.
* Denotes a required field. All required fields must be filled out for us to be able to process your form.



From our Membership Agreement
"Lulu is a place where people of all ages, backgrounds, experience, and professions can publish, sell, or buy creative content such as novels, memoirs, poetry, cookbooks, technical manuals, articles, photography books, children's books, calendars, and a host of other content that defies easy categorization. We help people distribute information and art spanning a wide range of subject matter while providing a safe, friendly, respectful, and serious site for all content creators. Since our community serves a broad range of ages, we do not encourage content that could make a majority of our users uncomfortable."
If you are sure that this product is in violation of acceptable content as defined in the agreement or that it does not meet our guidelines for General Access, please fill out the form below. It will then be reviewed by Lulu Staff to determine the next course of action.

Lulu abides by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA"), which governs how we are to treat claims of copyright infringement. If someone believes in good faith that a Lulu Account Holder has infringed their copyright, they can request that we take down the infringing material by filing a DMCA Notice. To file a DMCA Notice with Lulu, click on the button "Continue".
We reserve the right to ignore a Notice that is not in compliance with the DMCA. When a clear and valid Notice is received pursuant to the guidelines, we will respond by either taking down the allegedly infringing content or blocking access to it, and we may also contact you for more information.
If you are not the copyright holder or its agent and if the content is clearly infringing the copyright of a well-known work, please select "Infringes a well-known work" from the dropdown menu.

Turner John W
Owner


















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in New York:













Does Turner John W carry a valid contracting license?



Any person or business involved in a home improvement project more than $200 must get a license from the Department of Consumer Affairs to operate legally in New York.
Turner John W currently holds license 015554 (Architecture), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in New York?



New York City maintains high standards for licensing. To obtain a home improvement license, applicants must pass a written exam.











Your liability risk when hiring Turner John W



Licensed contractors in NYC are required to carry workers' compensation insurance.











Financial recourse when hiring Turner John W



Licensed contractors contribute $200 to DCA's Trust Fund at the time of application and each time they renew or post a bond. DCA's Trust Fund reimburses homeowners who hired a licensed contractor who subsequently damaged their home and went out of business or left town.











What else should I know before hiring Turner John W



NYC home improvement contractors are required to submit a copy of their fingerprints to the DCA and pass a criminal background check.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The NYC Department of Consumer Affairs recommends getting at least three written bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

I was ordered deported and was detained for many months and was going to be deported to my home country.  Mr. Helt stopped my deportation, reopened my case, removed my deportation order and obtained my release.  From that moment on, Mr. Helt was always with me during my saga to legalize my status and stand up for my rights.  HE FOUGHT FOR ME -- for years in the district courts and the immigration courtrooms and in different cities.  I was deported in Los Angeles and Mr. Helt was there for me.  My bond hearing was in Louisiana, and Mr. Helt was there for me.  Mr. Helt was there for me at the Memphis court to help me obtain my lawful permanent residency.  My immigration case was never easy.  Even on the last day of my immigration trial, it was a very contested hearing.   We won and Mr. Helt many times spoke up for me, made numerous objections, protected my rights, made sure that I was treated like a human being and with respect.  And Mr. Helt later represented my wife.  The day before her interview, there was a big snow storm in Chicago and the flights were cancelled.  Mr. Helt left the airport and drove to Memphis overnight (THROUGH A SNOW STORM) so he could be with us at 8:00 a.m. the next morning.  My wife got her green card, thanks to Christopher Helt.  What Mr. Helt did for me and my family was amazing and is superhuman. I can honestly say I don't think there will ever be another lawyer who fights for the South Asian community like Mr. Helt.Lannon Lannon & Barrderek.schultz.965 ratedThis law firm is amazing, espe...This law firm is amazing, especially Patricia Lannon, who handled my case incredibly well. My workers' compensation case began in 2005. My first attempt at finding a lawyer to represent me did not go well. Within months it became apparent he didn't know what he was doing, and even more so when he withdrew his counsel 3 years later. The opposing lawyers loved this, and began calling my house, taunting me, telling me to just give up. And it WAS a very difficult case, I knew this, and so I began to think maybe it WAS hopeless. But thanks to the anger I felt from their phone calls and my mom's encouragement , I pursued the case. I knew I was right, and so I started to look for a better lawyer.That's when I found Lannon Lannon & Barr. In the beginning they were unsure of the outcome, and they told me it would be a very difficult case. They didn't give up on me though, and before I knew it the case was building and moving forward. Suddenly everything started to look like maybe I actually had a chance. I knew very quickly that I had found a very good lawyer.We won the case. After losing two more appeals the insurance company finally gave up, firing the lawyers who had originally harassed me and admitting defeat. I can't even express in words how excited I am with the outcome. I sincerely recommend this law firm to everyone and anyone who needs a good workers' compensation attorney. They WON'T give up on you; they know EXACTLY what they are doing, and they work HARD for you! Call them!Budin Law OfficesB A. ratedI and two more students were hit by a car in the cross walk in a school campus. I don't have any family or relatives in here so i contacted with one of the student office for a lawyer suggestion, they suggested Adam Ingber. this guy took my case and was interested in the beginning. 6 months later he learned driver does not have very good insurance, there is very limited money. he said he can't do anything for my case, he needs to run a business and i should just go hospital and cry then they might waive my bill. i had a horrible legal service experience until i meet with Budin Law Offices (John Budin).He is very experienced and helpful attorney. First of all, he took my case although there was not so much money, he really wanted to help me. Since there were 3 people and limited money, it was very challenging to get equal amounts of money among 3 people. I ended up getting equal amount with others (although i had less injury), which is great for me. He knows what he is doing! and he is trying everything to make your case better. He only contacted with me 1-2 times during all this process, he takes care everything in an amazing way. i was very depressed after accident and my first bad attorney experience. I appreciate John Budin Law office, my case is successfully solved. they did a great job in my case. I will definitely suggest John Budin if you need a legal service. He solves challenging cases in a smart way and he is very supportive and trustable person. Sakina Carbide Law OfficeS. M. ratedI know Sakina Carbide for the past 19 years, she helped me with my immigration case in year 2000 for my status change to permanent resident. Everything went smooth all due to her guidance and her preparing me. Recently, she has helped us with my wife immigration case from fiancée visa in 2008, then permanent resident in 2009 and finally citizenship in 2017. Sakina Carbide has always been our number one choice. She is very hardworking, dedicated, friendly, and competent lawyer in Chicago, IL area. She has treated us like family and cares about her clients from the bottom of her heart. Her fees are very reasonable, and she will spend the extra time with you if needed on top of that she will be present with you during your interview.  She is our lawyer for all our future legal needs. I would highly recommend Sakina Carbide to anyone and everyone who needs a lawyer. I thank her for all the help she has provided me and my family, God bless her and her family. She is an excellent attorney! Second to none.O'Malley, Veronica MTrent S. ratedI Would Like To Thank The Extremely Honorable Judge Veronica M. O'Malley. It Was An Absolute  Honor To Be In Your Presence May 17 2017 In Your Court Room. My Only Regret Is I Was Not Able To Film The Total Smack Down! Your vision for evil I observed emediately. The patience you possess is undeniable considering the total fabrications from the Petitioner you had to endure. Even know you seen right through her lies from the onset you displayed considerable Open-mindedness, courtesy, and tact. Your courage was inspiring considering the danger I was portrayed by that old lady. You assessed us both with punctuality, firmness, understanding, and compassion. In the end you resolved the issue with humility and common sense. You Are An Extremely Beautiful Person ... Inside And Outside! Thank You, I Love You and May God Bless Every Thing You Do!I have been blessed with unparalleled vision, For DEER and Evil!ALL GLORY GOES TO GOD  ... Without the Lord Jesus Christ I am nothingSal Sheikh - Attorney at LawAnonymous C. ratedI hired Mr. Sheikh due to the fact that he is professional, knowledgeable, a great listener, easy to talk to and most importantly acts with a sense of urgency.  I received a phone call within the hour I left him a message! A bright and compassionate attorney, from our first conversation he made me feel at ease and did not judge me for the situation I had placed myself in (criminal charges).  Once we met in person I could tell he had the experience and expertise I needed for my situation.  I’m so thankful he took my case; other attorneys’ plans were not good options for me and Sal had a different plan and approach that worked!  He worked around my schedule, patiently answered all my questions and explained what to expect several times over the course of my year-long ordeal.  Sal’s been doing this a long time, is very good at what he does and knows what to do to get you the best outcome for your case. Call Sal!Sal Sheikh - Attorney at LawBrandon R. ratedSalim J Sheikh was not was what I was expecting from a lawyer. He not only soothed my anxieties about my case, but he also gave me back my dignity and hope. The man has worked tirelessly for me and has included me in every step of the process. He has given me more of his time than I would ever reasonably expect from law practitioner. Not only is Mr. Sheikh on top of all things case related, he is also very wise and sharp as a tac. When trouble came looking for me Sal immediately came to my home and discussed the case. From there we drafted a reasonable retainer agreement that allowed me to still keep my head above water. This case was the most serious case I have ever faced and Mr. Sheikh has walked me through the maze. I could not hope for a better Attorney and counselor. Finally I could not recommend Mr. Sheikh more.Azita M. MojaradTudor M. ratedAzita Mojarad is hands down, one of the best attorneys in the Chicagoland area! Azita, along with her knowledgeable team, have represented myself as well as my friends and family for the past 15 years. Sometimes life has its downs, for many of us... Well, fortunately, Azita has always made sure I always come up on top! No matter what the circumstances were, no matter how hard the case was, no matter what time of day or night I called, in need of advice, or a bond, she was always there. In this day and age, when the legal ramifications are getting more and more complex, when problems sometimes seem unsolvable, the need for excellent legal advice is needed more than ever, in order to succeed. This is why I highly recommend Azita Mojarad as well as her team of highly experienced attorneys!  David M. Smith Attorney at LawBarbara L. ratedI was charged with Domestic Battery and a Order of Protection was issued on me in my own house. After hiring Mr. Smith I felt a relief that I would not have to go this course alone, I felt I had someone who had my best interest at heart. We took this case to trial and WON, he was like a young Perry Mason. At any rate not only was I found not guilty of Domestic Battery the OP was thrown out. By the way I also hired Mr. Smith to serve this individual a 30 day notice to vacate my property. Needless to say I'm one Happy Camper with the services I received from David Smith and his team. I would Highly Recommend anyone with issues such as mine to contact Mr. Smith so that at least you will be able to breath.McCready, Garcia & Leet PC Law OfficesS S. ratedMy family had an unfortunate experience at a factory and needed the experience of a workman's comp lawyer that not only knew the law but spoke Spanish as well to make us feel more at ease.  Well, Edwin Reyes came to the rescue.  The initial consultation was free and we didn't have to pay anything if the case wasn't won.  Oh and 5 stars to the assistants and all the office staff there, especially Alyssa.  Any question we had, little or major- they were there either on the phone or in person ready to answer.   Always friendly, always smiling, making my parents feel like real people not some case number.   THANK YOU!Did You Know?Types of AttorneysThe legal profession is vast, with each attorney having his or her specialties. Here are some of the most common attorneys individuals seek out when they require legal aid:Criminal Lawyer
A criminal defense lawyer is probably the attorney the average person imagines. Criminal attorneys are the men and women who defend individuals accused of a crime. The lawyer may work pro bono - for the public good - so the accused is certain to have representation, even if he or she cannot afford an attorney.Criminal lawyers are experts in the criminal justice system. They help their clients decide how to plead when first charged by the police and guide them through trial procedures. Defense lawyers must use every bit of their knowledge and resources to get their clients the fairest results from criminal proceedings.Business Lawyer
If you are a small business owner or the head of a larger corporation, you may come into contact with a business lawyer. Many big companies keep a legal staff on payroll to deal with the daily operations of running and maintaining a large enterprise. Business lawyers may have more specific specialties like copyright law, product liability and mergers and acquisitions.Business attorneys may focus their practices on certain industries. There are entertainment lawyers to guide artists through royalties and media contracts, while hospitals employ malpractice attorneys to protect doctors from aggressive litigation.Employment Lawyer
When you work for a company, you may find yourself in need of an employment lawyer - especially if the relationship between you and your employer sours. An employment attorney prevents people from losing their jobs due to unfair reasons. Workers' compensation lawyers help maintain safe employment conditions and ensure workers receive fair compensation after workplace injury or discrimination.Finance Lawyer
A personal finance attorney can protect and manage your investments and securities. You may use a finance lawyer to help you prepare your taxes, but you might be better off working with an accountant. A tax attorney is more commonly contacted after a business or individual runs into trouble with the IRS or state regulators.Real Estate Lawyer
Your family may keep a lawyer on retainer to guide you through the major expenses that come up in life. When buying a home, you could work with a real estate lawyer to make sure you get the best deal and won't get taken advantage of by tricky mortgage agreements or unfair landlords. An estate attorney can help you plan for the worst by creating a will and preparing your finances for after your death.Bankruptcy Lawyer
A bankruptcy lawyer is essential to help you resolve your financial difficulties when they start to spin out of control. Certain attorneys help create strategies to bring you out of debt and speak to your creditors. A lawyer can advise you on which type of bankruptcy you should file for.Civil Lawyer
If you are suing someone or being sued, you need a civil lawyer. Civil attorneys - and criminal lawyers - are the legal representatives who argue on your behalf in a courtroom setting. Civil lawyers may represent you on matters of business, finance or a wide variety of other specialized needs.One of the most common types of civil attorneys is a personal injury lawyer. When you're hurt by an outside party and you would like to hold them legally responsible, a personal injury attorney conducts litigation and negotiates settlements to compensate for your pain and suffering. Sometimes many wronged people will join together with a single civil lawyer or law office to form a class action lawsuit.Family/Divorce Lawyer
Most people will turn to a lawyer during a divorce to navigate the emotionally charged legal proceedings. A divorce attorney can assist in determining grounds for separation, division of property and custody of children.Family attorneys deal with much more personal matters. If you're getting married, a family lawyer can help you prepare a prenuptial agreement or other family planning paperwork such as adoption or inheritance documents.Questions One Should Ask a Lawyer Before Hiring ThemTo ensure you find a competent attorney who won't abuse your trust or drain your finances, you have to make the proper inquiries. There are several questions you should ask, but the majority will fall under three general topics:Training and Experience Questions
One of the best ways to determine quality is to examine an attorney's history. When you first step into a lawyer's office, you should check for the appropriate certifications and diplomas. You have to ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practice's success. Look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of court.Once you inquire about the broad details of their legal career, you should ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue. You should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs. Lawyers can't mention clients by name, but you should ask for basic details about identical past cases.Financial Questions
You need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney. You should request a list of all costs in advance so you won't be surprised by additional expenses like overhead. Also determine exactly when you will start being billed. You want to inspect paperwork carefully. If the attorney charges you for his or her experience, you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistant.Find out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour. Many civil lawyers work on contingency. Whatever the payment plan, make inquiries about how the lawyer plans to provide service for your money and what you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performance.Lawyer/Client Relationship Questions
When you hire a lawyer, you're agreeing to work with someone over a certain period of time. You need to ask questions about how the attorney will communicate with you and what responsibilities you hold in the relationship. The attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication and you need to inform him or her when you want updates.You should also ask questions to get to know the attorney as an individual in order to ensure this is a person you can trust. Ask about their legal philosophy and how he or she views the lawyer/client relationship. Great questions to start off with are ones that will make your life easier, such as how to keep fees down or what daily disruptions you should expect from a long legal battle. The more forthcoming the lawyer appears to be with individual needs, the better.Top Reasons to Hire a LawyerYou may keep a lawyer on retainer or you could turn to an attorney during specific situations. Here are some common reasons people begin seeking legal representation or advice:You Know Your Limitations
If you sign documents and you come across a word you don't recognize, you need assistance. You may need a third party to help you navigate important employment or real estate paperwork. It's essential you fully understand the terms of any legally binding documentation or activity you become a part of. If you are not an expert in a given field, you'll want to hire an attorney who is.A lawyer may find legal implications or opportunities you might miss. If you find yourself in a civil or criminal matter, a proper attorney ensures you don't receive a harsh punishment for a small mistake.You're Facing an Important Event/Decision
When making decisions critical to your financial stability or personal life, you may want a lawyer with expertise in your situation to make sure you do everything you can to arrive at the proper resolution. This is especially true when you become involved in a criminal case and your freedom is on the line.It's not just a matter of legal knowledge; lawyer's have access to numerous resources you do not. They have staff ready to work around the clock and experts in a variety of fields to give your important issues the attention they deserve.You Can't Be Impartial
During times when personal matters intersect with legal proceedings, you may need to have an advocate to prevent your emotions from getting in the way of level-headed thinking. For example, divorce lawyers can mediate a heated argument and help both partners get on with their lives.Emotional investment could be subtle. You may want to have a lawyer look over an investment opportunity that looks too good to be true or investigate the merits of a possible civil suit when you feel wronged.You're Out of Options
Many people turn to lawyers when they are in trouble. If you've been accused of a crime or are in a terrible financial situation, you can find an attorney who will work with what you have available to assist you as you deal with your problems.Personal injury lawyers find solutions for people who can no longer work under their own power and bankruptcy attorneys prevent people from giving in to debt. If you find yourself in a situation where you can't find a solution, a lawyer may be able to offer the counsel you need.How to Choose a LawyerWhen it comes time to choose a lawyer, you should start by searching close to home. While you probably don't want the conflict of interest that comes from being represented by a family member, friends and loved ones can recommend lawyers who served them well in the past. If you do have attorneys you are familiar with, ask who they believe would be best for you.After going through personal references - especially from individuals who had similar needs - you should broaden your search through public information resources. You can call your area's attorney referral service or check legal organizations like Martindale-Hubbell. There are other resources available online. You should check websites for client reviews and other third-party forms of approval.When you build a list of possible candidates, perform a background check on each one. See if you can find information on their history and success record. Once you find a possible lawyer, you should call to arrange a consultation so you can ask your important questions in person.By performing the necessary research and taking every available precaution, you can narrow your search to the attorney most suited to your needs.
