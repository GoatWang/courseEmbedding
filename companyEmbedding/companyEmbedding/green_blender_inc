How it Works




Get it
Each week, you'll get 5 new smoothie recipes and all the pre-portioned ingredients you'll need to make 10 smoothies. Our recipes are hand crafted to ensure they're packed with flavor and nutrients. We only use the best produce and superfoods, and focus on working with organic and local farms, to create a uniquely balanced menu.



Blend it
We believe it's important to build a relationship with what you consume. That's why our recipes are more than just a list of ingredients, but a course in micro-biology. As you blend, you'll learn how our carefully crafted smoothies will nourish your body and mind. That's knowledge you can taste.



Drink it
You are what you drink. Our smoothies are packed with essential vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, proteins and fiber. Their benefits are endless: clearer skin, heightened mental clarity, increased energy, and weight loss. And, their nutrients are known to reduce the risk of cancer and heart disease. You're welcome, body.



Share it (or don't)
Each original recipe yields two 12oz servings. It's the perfect size to share with someone you love. Or love yourself twice as much.

GreenBlender brings us joy every morning. When we are too tired to think about what to make - it tells us exactly what to do and every smoothie is healthy and delicious.

What a great way to start my day. With such a variety of delicious and healthy smoothies, I've already felt a huge boost in energy. I actually look forward to getting out of bed.
