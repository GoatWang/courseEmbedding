You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.

ResourcesWasatch NewsView Our Funds
Our History
In 1975, Sam Stewart started Wasatch and put into place a new investment philosophy that was noticeably unique. Headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, the firm patterns its practices of thorough, rock-solid research and collaborative investing after the granite peaks that surround it.
Over 40 years of growth




KEY EVENTS
1975    Wasatch opens for business, focused on small-cap growth investing for separate accounts
1986    The firm launches its first two mutual funds, Small Cap Growth and Core Growth 
1995    Opening of the Wasatch Micro Cap Fund, the firm’s first fund in the micro-cap style
1997    Wasatch enters value investing with its first value fund, Small Cap Value
2002    The firm launches its first fund with an international focus: International Growth 
2008    Wasatch acquires the 1st Source Funds, now the Wasatch Large Cap Value, Wasatch Long/Short, and 1st Source Income Funds





Over the years, we have expanded products and channels.  Our key decision screen for new products has always been based in the following questions: Can we be good at it and will it make our collective team better investors? 
The early years: from small cap to value investing
In 1986, after 11 years of small-cap investing for separately managed accounts, we launched our first two small-cap portfolios with the simple desire to open our investment approach to everyone. 
By 1995 we had put together a solid long-term track record in the small cap space, and it didn’t take a rocket scientist to see that the same principals that formed Wasatch’s foundation were completely transferable to micro-sized companies. So, in 1995, we launched our first Micro Cap portfolio.
Less intuitive was the launch of our first Value portfolio two years later. We had always been growth managers.  We wrestled with this decision for a long time. The root of the idea was that we had a competitive advantage in evaluating the long-term prospects of growth companies when they stumbled (which we refer to as “fallen angels”) because of the deep growth company research that we were already doing.  We were frustrated because we saw some fallen angels that we were already familiar with being undervalued relative to their potential, but we couldn’t fill our growth portfolios with companies that weren’t currently growing.  The launch of the Small Cap Value fund in 1997 gave us a place to leverage these unique insights.  As a result, our value portfolios are often described to be “growthier value.”
Expanding to international investing
By 2001 we had noticed a dramatic change in globalization, both in the broadening markets and in the competitive set of our companies. It also became increasingly easier to purchase stocks on foreign exchanges.  We saw this as a long-term trend and thought that we should be better at evaluating our investment opportunities on a global scale.  We created an international team and launched our first fund focused outside of the U.S. in 2001. The collaborative nature of our research team allowed our international learning to easily flow across the broader team, and foreign holdings quickly began showing up in all of our equity portfolios.  
Looking forward
Today, we continue to honor our roots by being steadfast to our repeatable process that allows us to be successful in many investment segments. We hope our efforts to work as a team allow us to exceed your expectations. Every aspect of investing—from picking the stocks to sending out the annual reports—focuses on our founding principles: hard work, discipline, collaboration, candor, and responsibility. Our investment culture thrives in the lives of the people who live it. Back to About Wasatch main | next section: What's in a name

Data shows past performance, which is not indicative of future performance. Current performance may be lower or higher than the data quoted. To obtain the most recent month-end performance data available, please click on the “Performance” tab of the individual fund under the “Our Funds” section. The Advisor may absorb certain Fund expenses, without which total return would have been lower. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate and shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. 
Wasatch Funds will deduct a 2.00% redemption proceeds fee on Fund shares held 60 days or less. Performance data does not reflect the deduction of fees, including sales charges, or the taxes you would pay on fund distributions or the redemption of fund shares. Fees and taxes, if reflected, would reduce the performance quoted. Wasatch does not charge any sales fees. For more complete information including charges, risks and expenses, read the prospectus carefully.
Wasatch Funds are subject to risks, including loss of principal. Performance for the Core Growth, Small Cap Value, and Large Cap Value Fund Institutional Class shares prior to 1/31/2012 is based on the performance of the Investor Class shares. Performance for the Long/Short Fund Institutional Class shares prior to 12/13/2012 is based on the Investor Class shares. Performance for the Emerging India, Emerging Markets Small Cap, Frontier Emerging Small Countries, Global Opportunities, International Growth, International Opportunities, Small Cap Growth, and World Innovators Fund Institutional Class shares prior to 2/1/2016 is based on the performance of the Investor Class shares.  Fund Performance during the above periods referenced includes the actual expenses of the Fund's Investor Class shares without any adjustments. For any such period of time, the performance of the Fund's Institutional Class would have been substantially similar to, yet higher than, the performance of the Fund's Investor Class, because the shares of both classes are invested in the same portfolio of securities, but the classes bear different expenses.
