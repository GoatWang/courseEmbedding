LETTER TO THE EDITOR OF LAFAYETTE MAGAZINE
The fall issue was lovely as always. However, I find it disheartening that
in focusing on millennials, no mention is made of alumni actively serving
in the military, including Jeffrey Werrell 02 and Barret Diefenderfer 02,
who are with the United States Marine Corps. There are most certainly
others. Wouldn’t you agree that serving in the military makes a
difference?
