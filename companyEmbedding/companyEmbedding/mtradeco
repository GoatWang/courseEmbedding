Grupo Tradeco




We are a construction and infrastructure development company with 100% Mexican capital, founded on February 18th, 1992, with the purpose of meeting the need of infrastructure development.
The trajectory of Grupo Tradeco is significant, since in a few years we have played a main role in the execution of works and projects in Mexico, as well as in Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, Chile, Colombia and the United States. These projects have allowed us to develop several specialties that conform the universe of the construction industry. This is why Grupo Tradeco has been strengthened by the creation of specialized companies such as: Tradeco Infraestructura, Tradeco Industrial, Tradeco Urbana, Tradeco Ingenieria, Innovaciones Tecnicas en Cimentacion (ITECSA), CompaĂąia Mexicana de Taxis Aereos (COMETA), Avance Concesionarias and Operaciones y Rentas Costa Afuera (ORCA), among others.
Our principal experience is based on the construction of highways, bridges, hospitals, penitentiary centers, industrial plants, office buildings, epc projects, tunnels, infrastructure development under various contracting modalities, and the rendering of off-shore services, among others.
Our main goal is to occupy a leading place in the national and international markets, using our clients satisfaction as our main formula.

The best way to predict the future is creating it.

Peter Ferdinand Drucker


In GRUPO TRADECO our Mission is:
To participate actively in construction of infrastructure projects for the public and private sectors, national and international.
Our Vision is:
To execute an amount of work that allows us to attain a sustained annual growth, supported by the implementation of an integrated management system.


corporate principles

QUALITY AS A CULTURE  The continual improvement in the quality of products and processes, the safeguarding of the environment, and the health and safety of workers and subcontractors are a com- mitment and a permanent obligation of all members of the organization, this being a fundamental trait of the Tradeco organizational culture.
RESPECT   The deportment of the organization and its collaborators shall be framed in respect for others, the environment, areas, accesses, equipment and materials, in order to protect the health and safety of the surroundings.
