SeedInvest is an equity crowdfunding platform that connects startups with investors online. The company was founded in 2012 and launched in 2013.[3] SeedInvest has focused on building liquidity in the platform by attracting high-net-worth individuals, family offices and venture capital firms.[4] SeedInvest screens and vets deals before allowing them to take advantage of the JOBS Act exemption permitting General Solicitation.[5] In September 2014 the company launched a partnership with Angel Investing website Gust.[6]

Funding[edit]
SeedInvest raised a significant portion of its own $4.15 million in total Series A funding online in April 2014 [7] from Scout Ventures and a mix venture capital and angel investors.[8] An earlier round of seed capital was raised in 2013.[9]
Capital raised on the platform[edit]
Notable funding rounds on SeedInvest have included Virtuix ($7M raised), Knightscope ($5M raised), Keen Home ($2.5M raised), DSTLD ($2.5M raised), ChargeItSpot ($1M raised), Patch of Land ($1M raised), Sharestates ($1M raised), Snapcard ($1.5M raised) and Vengo Labs ($2M raised).[10]
JOBS Act[edit]
SeedInvest founders Ryan Feit and James Han were involved in consultation with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and in the United States Congress for the passing of the JOBS Act.[11] The JOBS Act included provisions that permit online equity crowdfunding by platforms such as SeedInvest. SeedInvest hosted the first Testing The Waters campaign under the new Regulation A rules for equity crowdfunding on June 19 2015.[12]

Aaron KellnerInvestment Director Prior to joining SeedInvest, Aaron co-founded a mobile app company. He quickly recognized the problems associated with raising money for a twenty-first century startup within a twentieth-century regulatory framework. Aaron's positive entrepreneurial experience and desire to help small companies with their own fundraising hurdles led him to SeedInvest. Previously, he worked at Goldman Sachs as an analyst on the firm’s NYSE Designated Market Maker desk. There he provided situational advice to traders and developed pitch books for prospective issuers resulting in wins worth over $100 billion in aggregate market capitalization. Before joining Goldman Sachs, he worked as a private equity analyst at a small-cap fund where he was primarily responsible for analyzing investment opportunities and conducting due diligence. He graduated summa cum laude from NYU’s Stern School of Business with a BS in Finance and Marketing. Aaron spends the majority of his free time reading, cooking and cheering on the New York Rangers.

Equity crowdfunding sounds ideal for SpaceX. SeedInvest allows the "average human" to invest in a "mino-IPO" w/o the company going public!https://twitter.com/NicoLeeper/status/889858416352559104 …

    Replying to @elonmusk @RyanBiddle603 @SpaceX

Raising under Reg A using a trust would allow SpaceX to let normal people invest w/out having to go public and have 1 shareholder of record

Only Accredited Investors can make investments in Offerings under Rule 506(b) and 506(c) of Regulation D.Step 2:Customize Deal FlowWe will ask questions during your onboarding process to help customize your SeedInvest experience according the preferences you indicate.Customize your investment goals by telling us how much you have put aside to invest and what portion of that you would like to invest in startups.+- How much should I invest in startups?You should only invest amounts that you are willing to lose in its entirety. Startups are highly risky and illiquid investments, and there is a real risk that investors in startups will lose the entire principal amount. Due to the high-risk nature of startup investing, diversification is a commonly used technique used by investors try to mitigate risk. You should consider diversifying across multiple startups as well as diversifying across different industries, depending on your individual preferences and risk tolerance. There may also be limits set forth by the SEC on the amount you can invest in depending on various factors as determined in relevant regulations.+- How to connect with us?Aaron KellnerPrincipalMessageStep 3:Browse Investment OpportunitiesExplore all of our investment opportunities on the offerings page.We strive to feature a broad assortment of companies on SeedInvest in order to appeal to our entire investor network.  Once you find something that interests you, you may continue on to the company's profile to learn more or participate in conversions with other investors and the startups’ founders in areas available for discussion.+- How does SeedInvest get its dealflow?Our venture team actively sources deal flows in three different ways:
                        Referrals from venture capital funds, incubators, accelerators, and angel groups.Our venture team is dedicated to keeping a pulse on venture activity and establishing relationships with companies we've identified as trending.Organic - we are fortunate that many companies hear about SeedInvest through word of mouth and apply directly online.+-How does SeedInvest screen companies?All Regulation D and A+ offerings are marked as "Vetted" have successfully gone through our complete due diligence process, which includes internal business due diligence and outsourced legal and confirmatory due diligence. Such investment opportunities are offered via SI Securities, a registered broker-dealer. Investment opportunities offered under Regulation CF have not been fully vetted and offered via SI Portal, a registered crowdfunding portal. Such investment opportunities have gone through a screening process with SI Portal and have gone through legal and confirmation due diligence processes.Legal and confirmatory review includes:The organization of the companyThe corporate structure and ownershipThe people behind the companyInformation provided to investorsInvestor information and terms of the offeringReview of Transaction Documents by Outside Legal CounselBusiness due diligence generally includes:Problem or inefficiency being addressedProduct / service overview, stage of development and anticipated milestonesDemonstrated traction (e.g. revenue, pre-sales, purchase orders, signed contracts, media coverage, awards, etc.)Data to support claims made in marketing materials (e.g. user / customer metrics, signed contracts and agreements, product demonstrations, etc.)Growth strategyEmployees and advisors (including ownership structure)Addressable market (e.g. size, growth, penetration, etc.)Competitive landscape and industry dynamicsExit opportunitiesIntellectual propertyHistorical financialsFinancial projections (including error-checking, evaluation of key assumptions and reconciliation to stated growth plan)Reference checks (e.g. previous investors, advisors, etc.)Investment overview (including determination of key terms, uses of funds, and current and previous investors)Step 4:Do Your HomeworkInvesting in startups is inherently risky. It is important for you to do your own independent due diligence to mitigate those risks.Take a closer look at the companies that you're interested in. Get to know the companies by leveraging the SeedInvest team and connect with the companies' founding team members. Take a deeper dive into the due diligence materials uploaded to the data room or offering circulars.+- What is due diligence?Due diligence is an investigation into a business for the purpose of being able to make an informed investment decision.Get to know the company you are looking to invest in by viewing their investor deck, any financial documentation, and term sheet.Connect and communicate with the founding team members.Understand the industries and marketplace in which the company is positioned.Do research about the company outside of the SeedInvest platform.Share the deal with your colleagues and get outside opinions. Feedback is valuable, but also remember that you're the one writing the check.+- How to connect with startups?When available, investors may directly message the company by visiting the company's profile page. Investors may also participate in conference calls and in-person events scheduled by SeedInvest. Note that for Regulation CF companies, all communication must occur on the SeedInvest platform so others can leverage each others’ insights and opinions. There is a discussion board on each company’s profile pages to facilitate this for the crowd.Step 5: Make InvestmentClick the "INVEST" button on the startup's profile page and follow the steps to complete your investment.You can invest as an individual or through an entity (such as LLCs, IRAs, or Trusts).+- What are the steps to making an investment?Click the "Invest" button on a given company's profile.Enter your investment amount.Verify your identity and accreditation status.Enter the account information of your bank account (checking or savings) or choose to wire the funds.Confirm your investment.Complete any follow-ups in the case of missing information or special circumstances.+- Where does my money go?Once you confirm your investment, the funds will be transferred to an escrow account for safe-keeping until the fundraising is closed. Once the fundraising round closes, you will receive confirmation of success and a link to the counter-signed legal agreements if applicable. Upon the completion of certain closing mechanics and compliance checks, the funds will be transferred to the startup.Step 6: Manage Your PortfolioMaking your first investment is just the beginning of building a portfolio of private company investments on SeedInvest.Many investors practice portfolio diversification and invest across multiple (10, 15, or more) startups and industries to mitigate risk. Keep an eye out for companies in different industries and come up with a plan for adding additional investments over time.Also, stay up-to-date by returning to SeedInvest to read updates from your portfolio companies.+- How to monitor your portfolio?You can view a list of all of your investments on your portfolio page as well as access your final investment documents on this page.SeedInvest is currently building out reporting tools which will streamline company reporting and shareholder tracking.+- What are best practices for building a portfolio?Investing in private companies is different than investing in public stocks:Startup investing can be a very rewarding activity but it is also a very risky one. Some investors like to invest in things that they have expertise in and most investors practice portfolio diversification and invest across multiple private companies to try and mitigate risk. Investors should never consider investing in solely one or two private companies.It is critical to allocate only a small percentage of your overall portfolio to private companies, typically no more than 5-10%. Investors should be mindful of future diversification as they consider how much to invest per company.Learn how to raise on SeedInvest  Get started on SeedInvest.Join as an InvestorList Your StartupJoin as an InvestorList Your StartupJoin as an InvestorList Your StartupBrowse InvestmentsBrowse InvestmentsCompanyAbout UsMeet The TeamPress & Media KitJobsFAQsHow it WorksInvestRaiseRegulation ALearnEquity CrowdfundingAcademyBlogJoinInvestorsEntrepreneursLegalTerms of UsePrivacy PolicyLegal Documents© 2017 SeedInvest Technology, LLC · Made with care in NYC

Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings and refresh the page.Our platform is redefining early-stage investing and capital raising.Learn About SeedInvest SeedInvest is a leading equity crowdfunding platform opening up access to venture capital and angel investing to everyoneVenture CapitalThe SeedInvest Selections Fund is currently investing $200,000 alongside each company that successfully raises capital on SeedInvest under Regulation D. The fund is targeting investments in 50 companies over the next two years and its limited partners are looking for opportunities to make strategic co-investments and follow-on investments.Angel InvestingInvesting in startups used to be reserved for just venture capitalists and high-connected angel investors. But SeedInvest is now enabling individual investors to invest alongside venture capital firms and angel groups and access startup investments for the very first time. Furthermore, SeedInvest helps filter out the noise. Our team is comprised of former professional investors who screen all companies which apply.Equity CrowdfundingAs a result of the JOBS Act and the work that the SEC, FINRA, SeedInvest, and other market participants began back in 2012, companies can now raise from all investors up to $50 million under Regulation A+, which went into effect June 19, 2015, and up to $1 million under Regulation CF, which went into effect on May 16, 2016. These new exemptions open up investing to 240+ million Americans who previously could not invest and allows SeedInvest to help startups turn their most ardent supporters and customers into passionate investors for the first time.Our StoryRyan Feit and James Han founded SeedInvest in 2012. Shocked by how difficult it was for their Wharton classmates to raise capital for their startups, Ryan and James joined a movement to change 80-year-old securities laws to make it easier for entrepreneurs to raise capital online. During the following year, they became instrumental in arguably the most significant change to U.S. securities laws in our lifetime: the passage of the JOBS Act. Ryan and James professionally invested in and financed companies across technology, consumer, and other major market sectors while at Wellspring Capital, Francisco Partners, Lehman Brothers, and Morgan Stanley. By leveraging their experience as investors and entrepreneurs, they aspired to build an online platform that made startup investing and fundraising simple and accessible to everyone. In April 2014, after building a sizeable investor base and helping dozens of companies raise capital online, SeedInvest raised its Series A round on its own platform.Since then, the SeedInvest team has grown to over twenty team members, helped over 215 companies raise capital, and built a rapidly growing network of over 181,199 investors. In June 2015, SeedInvest was the first equity crowdfunding platform to open up to the other 98% of Americans who were previously restricted from investing in startups.

Under today’s federal securities laws, only individuals and entities that qualify as an accredited investor can legally take advantage of startup investing opportunities under minimal limitations. Because of accredited investors’ presumed wealth, they are deemed more able to bear the high financial risk of investments in private companies.
As a result of recent changes to securities laws, companies may now decide whether to raise from everyone or just from accredited investors. Under recent developments such as Title III and Title IV of the JOBS Act, non-accredited investors are allowed to legally invest alongside accredited investors under certain guidelines. Title III and Title IV of the JOBS Act permit what is known as “equity crowdfunding”, whereby companies can openly advertise their offerings and accept investments from non-accredited investors – the 98% of Americans who do not meet the definition of an accredited investor.
In this guide, we will discuss how one can confirm their status as an accredited investor and the requirements needed to take part in investing in this asset class.







                    Accredited Investor                  


In order for an individual to be an accredited investor, he or she must meet at least one of the following criteria:

Individual income exceeding $200K for each of the past two years with a reasonable expectation that the $200K threshold will be reached in the current year.
Joint income with spouse exceeding $300K for each of the past two years with a reasonable expectation that the $300K threshold will be reached in the current year.
Lastly, an individual is an accredited investor if his or her net worth (excluding the value of a primary residence) exceeds $1M.

An entity that is not a natural person (e.g., Fund, Corporation) generally qualifies as an accredited investor if it has at least $5M in assets or if all of the owners of that entity are themselves accredited investors.







                    Suitability                  


In addition to meeting the requirements as an accredited investor, investors must be made aware of and acknowledge the high financial risks of startup investing when investing through some intermediaries. When investing, investors should keep in mind that the majority of startups fail and those that do provide a return to their investors may take five to seven years (or more) to do so. Therefore, investors who would like to invest in startups should take the following precautions:

Do not allocate more than 5-10% of your overall portfolio into alternative assets, including startup investment opportunities.
Build a diversified portfolio of at least 10-15 startup investments.
Do not invest any capital which you are not comfortable having locked up for at least 5-7 years.








                    On SeedInvest                  


Investors on SeedInvest should also consider the general risk factors set out at: https://www.seedinvest.com/general-risk-factors
The SeedInvest platform collects accredited investor information and facilitates the verifications required to make a startup investment online. During the signup process the SeedInvest platform also guides users through a series of questions about their current investment portfolio and asset allocation to help investors think through the most appropriate investment strategy for approaching early-stage investments. The SeedInvest team are also available to investors on the phone, email or through online chat to discuss any questions regarding the risks inherent in the asset class.
