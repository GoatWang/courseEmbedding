            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Founding and early history[edit]
In 1939 Eric Warburg of the Warburg banking family founded a company under the name E.M. Warburg & Co. Its first address was 52 William Street, New York, the Kuhn Loeb building. Throughout the early post-war period, the firm was a small office of 20 employees. In 1966, E.M. Warburg merged with Lionel I. Pincus & Co, forming a new company that eventually became known as E.M. Warburg, Pincus & Co.[11] In 1965, when Eric Warburg retired to Germany, control was handed to Lionel Pincus, a partner in the Ladenburg Thalmann investment bank, and the working language of the office switched from German to English. Lionel ran the company from 1966 to 2002, and died in 2009. [12]
Warburg Pincus began investing in Europe in 1983 and opened its first office in Asia in 1994. It has invested more than $5 billion in Europe; more than $3 billion in India[13] and more than $3.3 billion in China. The firm is headquartered in New York and has offices in Beijing, Hong Kong, London, Mumbai, San Francisco, São Paulo, Shanghai and Singapore, with administrative offices in Amsterdam, Luxembourg and Mauritius.[14]
The firm is structured as a global partnership led by co-presidents Charles Kaye and Joseph Landy.[15] Kaye has been with Warburg Pincus since 1986 and worked to launch the Asian operations. Landy has been with the firm since 1985, focusing on investments in information technology, communications applications and structured investments. Approximately 35% of the firm’s investments are outside of the U.S.[16]
Initial public offerings[edit]
Warburg Pincus has completed more initial public offerings with its companies than any other global private equity firm.[17] More than 140 Warburg Pincus companies have listed on exchanges, raising approximately $30 billion in public markets.[18] In each of these IPOs, the firm was the principal financial investor in the portfolio company. The companies have listed on 13 exchanges, including at least 30 IPOs outside the U.S. In August 2010, a six-year partnership between management and Warburg Pincus led to MEG Energy’s successful IPO.[19]
Venture capital[edit]
Warburg Pincus has a history of venture capital investing. The firm is a founding member of the venture capital associations in the U.S. and China, and offers a global entrepreneur in residence program to help start up new businesses.[citation needed]
In October 2014, Reuters reported that Warburg Pincus had raised $4 billion for its first energy-focused private equity fund.[20]
Growth capital[edit]
Warburg Pincus has invested in companies such as Harbin Pharmaceutical in China,[21] Bharti Telecommunications in India, AmRest in Poland[22] and Nuance Communications in the U.S.[23] In Bharti Airtel, Warburg Pincus had invested $292 million across multiple tranches and exited with $1.9 billion in 2005, which is considered to be the largest Private Equity exit in India.[24]
Fight over the Warburg name[edit]
During the post-war period, Eric Warburg vied with his cousin Siegmund Warburg, founder of S.G. Warburg, over the use of the Warburg name in New York. Siegmund wished to expand the S.G. Warburg franchise into New York but was blocked by the existence of E.M. Warburg & Co. Following the effective sale of the business to Pincus, Siegmund Warburg accused Eric of prostituting the Warburg name. "Complicating matters was that Siegmund thought Pincus the wrong kind of Jew - of Eastern European ancestry, with a garment-district background. Professionally, he thought Pincus well below haute banque stature in the venture capital world."[25]
In January 1970, Siegmund finally got the name changed to E.M. Warburg, Pincus & Company to differentiate it from S.G. Warburg & Company. "In the end, however, Lionel Pincus had the last laugh on Siegmund. He expanded Eric's tiny firm into a giant, thriving business, with three and a half billion dollars of venture capital partnerships."[25]
In 1999, they attempted to purchase English Premier League football (soccer) team Everton.[26]

Founding and early history[edit]
In 1939 Eric Warburg of the Warburg banking family founded a company under the name E.M. Warburg & Co. Its first address was 52 William Street, New York, the Kuhn Loeb building. Throughout the early post-war period, the firm was a small office of 20 employees. In 1966, E.M. Warburg merged with Lionel I. Pincus & Co, forming a new company that eventually became known as E.M. Warburg, Pincus & Co.[11] In 1965, when Eric Warburg retired to Germany, control was handed to Lionel Pincus, a partner in the Ladenburg Thalmann investment bank, and the working language of the office switched from German to English. Lionel ran the company from 1966 to 2002, and died in 2009. [12]
Warburg Pincus began investing in Europe in 1983 and opened its first office in Asia in 1994. It has invested more than $5 billion in Europe; more than $3 billion in India[13] and more than $3.3 billion in China. The firm is headquartered in New York and has offices in Beijing, Hong Kong, London, Mumbai, San Francisco, São Paulo, Shanghai and Singapore, with administrative offices in Amsterdam, Luxembourg and Mauritius.[14]
The firm is structured as a global partnership led by co-presidents Charles Kaye and Joseph Landy.[15] Kaye has been with Warburg Pincus since 1986 and worked to launch the Asian operations. Landy has been with the firm since 1985, focusing on investments in information technology, communications applications and structured investments. Approximately 35% of the firm’s investments are outside of the U.S.[16]
Initial public offerings[edit]
Warburg Pincus has completed more initial public offerings with its companies than any other global private equity firm.[17] More than 140 Warburg Pincus companies have listed on exchanges, raising approximately $30 billion in public markets.[18] In each of these IPOs, the firm was the principal financial investor in the portfolio company. The companies have listed on 13 exchanges, including at least 30 IPOs outside the U.S. In August 2010, a six-year partnership between management and Warburg Pincus led to MEG Energy’s successful IPO.[19]
Venture capital[edit]
Warburg Pincus has a history of venture capital investing. The firm is a founding member of the venture capital associations in the U.S. and China, and offers a global entrepreneur in residence program to help start up new businesses.[citation needed]
In October 2014, Reuters reported that Warburg Pincus had raised $4 billion for its first energy-focused private equity fund.[20]
Growth capital[edit]
Warburg Pincus has invested in companies such as Harbin Pharmaceutical in China,[21] Bharti Telecommunications in India, AmRest in Poland[22] and Nuance Communications in the U.S.[23] In Bharti Airtel, Warburg Pincus had invested $292 million across multiple tranches and exited with $1.9 billion in 2005, which is considered to be the largest Private Equity exit in India.[24]
Fight over the Warburg name[edit]
During the post-war period, Eric Warburg vied with his cousin Siegmund Warburg, founder of S.G. Warburg, over the use of the Warburg name in New York. Siegmund wished to expand the S.G. Warburg franchise into New York but was blocked by the existence of E.M. Warburg & Co. Following the effective sale of the business to Pincus, Siegmund Warburg accused Eric of prostituting the Warburg name. "Complicating matters was that Siegmund thought Pincus the wrong kind of Jew - of Eastern European ancestry, with a garment-district background. Professionally, he thought Pincus well below haute banque stature in the venture capital world."[25]
In January 1970, Siegmund finally got the name changed to E.M. Warburg, Pincus & Company to differentiate it from S.G. Warburg & Company. "In the end, however, Lionel Pincus had the last laugh on Siegmund. He expanded Eric's tiny firm into a giant, thriving business, with three and a half billion dollars of venture capital partnerships."[25]
In 1999, they attempted to purchase English Premier League football (soccer) team Everton.[26]

3, Amendment No. 4, Amendment No. 5, Amendment No. 6, Amendment No. 7, Amendment No. 8 and Amendment No. 9, the “Initial
Schedule 13D”), and is being filed on behalf of Warburg Pincus Private Equity IX, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership
(“WP IX”), Warburg Pincus IX GP L.P., a Delaware limited partnership and the general partner of WP IX (“WP
IX GP”), WPP GP LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and the general partner of WP IX GP (“WPP GP”),

Warburg Pincus Partners GP LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and the general partner of WP Partners (“WPP GP LLC”),
Warburg Pincus & Co., a New York general partnership and the managing member of WPP GP LLC (“WP”), Warburg
Pincus LLC, a New York limited liability company that manages WP IX (“WP LLC”), and Messrs. Charles R. Kaye
and Joseph P. Landy, each a Managing General Partner of WP and a Managing Member and Co-Chief Executive Officer of WP LLC, who
may be deemed to control WP IX, WP IX GP, WPP GP, WP Partners, WPP GP LLC, WP and WP LLC. WP IX, WP IX GP, WPP GP, WP Partners,
WPP GP LLC, WP, WP LLC, Mr. Kaye and Mr. Landy are hereinafter referred to as the “Warburg Pincus Reporting Persons”.
The Initial Schedule 13D, as amended by this Amendment No. 11, is being referred to as the “Schedule 13D”. This
Amendment No. 11 relates to the common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Common Stock”), of Synutra International,
Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Issuer”). Information in respect of each Warburg Pincus Reporting Person
is given solely by such Warburg Pincus Reporting Person and no Warburg Pincus Reporting Person has responsibility for the accuracy
or completeness of information supplied by any other Warburg Pincus Reporting Person. All capitalized terms used herein that are
not defined herein have the meanings for such terms set forth in the Initial Schedule 13D.
 
The Warburg Pincus Reporting Persons are
filing this Amendment No. 11 because they sold certain Common Stock shares of the Issuer and are no longer the beneficial owners
of more than five percent of the Common Stock of the Issuer, as described in Item 5. Consequently, their obligation to file a Schedule
13D has terminated with this filing.
 
Unless set forth below, all previous Items
set forth in the Initial Schedule 13D are unchanged.
 


Item 4.
Purpose of Transaction 

 
Item 4 is hereby amended and restated
as follows:
 
On November 2, 2016, WP IX sold an aggregate
of 4,000,000 shares of Common Stock of the Issuer in a block trade at a price per share of $3.45 (without giving effect to brokerage
commissions). As a result of the sale, the Warburg Pincus Reporting Persons disposed of all of their shares of Common Stock of
the Issuer. The sale was undertaken for portfolio management purposes.
 


Item 5. 
Interest in Securities of the Issuer

 
Item 5 is hereby amended and restated as
follows:
 
(a) – (b) As a result of the transaction
disclosed in Item 4 herein, the Warburg Pincus Reporting Persons no longer own any securities of the Issuer or have sole or shared
power to vote, direct the vote, dispose or direct the disposition with respect to any securities of the Issuer, and therefore their
obligation to file further amendments to this statement has terminated.
 
(c) Except as set forth in Item 4 above,
the Warburg Pincus Reporting Persons have not effected any transaction in the Common Stock of the Issuer in the past 60 days.
 
(d) Not applicable.
 
(e) On November 2, 2016, the Warburg Pincus
Reporting Persons ceased to be the beneficial owners of more than five percent of the Common Stock as a result of the consummation
of the transaction disclosed herein.
 


 
 

 
 
SIGNATURES 
 
After reasonable inquiry and to the best
of my knowledge and belief, I certify that the information set forth in this statement is true, complete and correct.

The firm’s unique, globally integrated partnership ensures that all of our resources are committed to the success of each portfolio company. Regardless of an investment’s stage of development, industry focus or geography — the right people, with the right experience, are available to every entrepreneur and management team.
At Warburg Pincus, private equity investing is our only business. Established more than 50 years ago, Warburg Pincus has invested more than $60 billion in more than 780 companies in more than 40 countries around the world.
Warburg Pincus traces its roots to E.M. Warburg & Co., founded in 1939. The firm was acquired by Lionel I. Pincus & Co. in 1966, forming Warburg Pincus. John Vogelstein joined Lionel Pincus and together they helped to create the private equity industry. Today Warburg Pincus is a globally-integrated partnership led by co-chief executive officers Charles R. Kaye and Joseph P. Landy.
The firm’s strategy combines deep industry expertise and local market experience; the flexibility to support all stages of company development; a long-term investment horizon; and fully aligned interests among our portfolio company management, limited partners and general partners. Partnering with superior management teams, Warburg Pincus helps companies formulate strategy, conceptualize and implement suitable financing structures and recruit talented executives.
We take a long-term perspective and invest in businesses at all stages of development, from founding start-ups and fostering growth in developing companies to leading complex recapitalizations or large-scale buy-outs of more mature businesses. This approach also applies to our expectations of accountability, ethical business conduct and a sense of responsibility for the local communities in which we operate.
The firm’s social commitment is further evidenced by our charitable giving program, community outreach and volunteer services and the Warburg Pincus Foundation.
