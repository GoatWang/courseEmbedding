BELLEVUE, Wash., March 10, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Finsphere Corporation, a leader in mobile identity-authentication services, today announced the appointment of Michael (Mike) Millegan, a retired Verizon Communications Inc., senior executive, to its strategic advisory board. 
"Mike brings Finsphere excellent mobile network and telecom expertise to compliment our experience in fraud-prevention technology and financial services -- especially regarding digital media content distribution strategy, which he helped implement globally while at Verizon," said Finsphere CEO Mike Buhrmann. "Additionally, his global business knowledge of building underlying networks to advanced4G wireless is a valuable asset to take our location-based, precision-analytics engine to mobile carriers around the world." 
Millegan, a perennial 100 best selectee by leading publications, retired from Verizon last year after spending 33 years with the company and its predecessor GTE. As president of Verizon Global Wholesale, he was responsible for the P&L of its domestic and international wholesale division, growing strategic services revenue and expansion into international markets including EMEA, Latin America, AsiaPacific, Canada and Mexico. 
Millegan's appointment follows last month's news announcing the addition of former WAMU and Barclays banking executive Deanna Oppenheimer as a strategic adviser to the company.  Finsphere has been focused on building its strategic adviser bench strength and together Millegan and Oppenheimer bring their wireless and financial resources to help the company grow its footprint globally. 
Founded in 2007, Finsphere has developed a geo-location precision-analytics engine that enables global financial services companies and enterprises to help protect their customers by securing access to sensitive information, preventing accounts from being compromised and reducing financial loss due to fraud. The company holds a total of 11 patents, including six granted in the U.S.
Finsphere's non-intrusive, privacy enhancing services do not require users to remember passwords or PINs, respond to transaction-verification calls, reply to text messages, receive one-time passwords, carry physical tokens or perform any additional action that interferes with typical financial transactions or access events. 
About Finsphere Corporation:Finsphere is a leader in mobile identity-authentication services, enabling financial institutions, retail payment networks and mobile network operators to protect against fraud and enhance customer experiences.  By using a mobile device as a proxy for an individual's identity, Finsphere's sophisticated wireless engineering, geospatial analysis and fraud-analytic capabilities authenticate users non-intrusively in real time. An innovator in this field, Finsphere holds multiple U.S. and international patents in the area of location- and risk-based authentication. Headquartered in Bellevue, Wash., Finsphere is a privately held corporation whose major investors include Mohr Davidow, Shasta Ventures, Frazier Technology Ventures and Vodafone Ventures.

Takes Initiative







Andrew Fazekas Head of Product at Disney Interactive
					Patrick has been an extremely valuable addition to the Commander team. In a matter of a few months, he has established himself as a data-driven, analytical, and creative product manager on a demanding project. He takes new responsibilities on head-on, presents intelligent analysis, thinks creatively, and always has a positive attitude.

				



Analytics and Maximizing Efficiency







Sean Dornan-Fish Creative Director at Disney Interactive
					Patrick is on the ball, passionate, and equally adept at tactical and strategic thinking. I'm always impressed by his ability to gather information and come to excellent data-informed decisions. Another place where Patrick excels is time management. He often improves process which allows him more time to take on additional tasks. Patrick is a difference maker on ever task, feature, and product he works on and I would happily work with him anytime.

				



Creative and Entrepreneurial







Jack Luh Sr. Engineering Manager at Disney Interactive
					Patrick is a very bright PM. He has great ideas and always thinks outside the box. He is creative and solves problems with an entrepreneurial mindset. Patrick will add value to any team and will find a way to help out. He is certain a person I would want on my team.
				



Executer and Innovater







Laura Gluhanich Co-Founder at Signal Camp
					Having worked with Patrick I can attest to the quality, commitment, enthusiasm and smart ideas he'd bring to any team. Not only does Patrick execute at a high-level, he consistently finds the time to innovate and creatively solve problems to make the team more efficient. I look forward to seeing great things from Patrick, and would love to work with him in the future.

				



Problem Solver







Ryan Freitas Co-Founder at about.me
					Patrick is resourceful and driven. He takes a creative approach to problem solving, and does a great job of producing solid work with a minimum of management.

				



Motivated and Driven







Rachel Donné UI/UX Designer at Disney Interactive
					Patrick is a charismatic and motivated individual. He's extremely driven to soak up knowledge and experiences. In the time that we've worked together, I've watched his skill set expand rapidly. He's always one to be optimistic, and he makes friends quickly. I know any team he becomes apart of will quickly see him become an intricate, and invaluable contributor.
				



Resourceful and Transparent







Jamil Hale Sr. QA Analyst at Disney Interactive
					Patrick is one of the most intelligent individuals I have ever worked with. Anyone that can come onto a project and by the end be responsible for what used to be the work of 3 engineers deserves all accolades available to him. Without him, the product would have been lost and I greatly appreciated how informative he was about the health of our product and how he always made the effort to create learning opportunities within the team.

The Millegan Creek Apartments Case Solution & Answer
Case Study Analysis Solutions
 

Location, Product & Pricing
First of all, if we talk about the location of the Millegan Creek Apartment, then it could be seen that the occupancy levels in the apartment market are quite high and the property would be located at about 11 miles away from CBD and this location would be very much close to the other high tech companies in Austin.
The Millegan Creek Apartment would be basically a luxury apartment complex and therefore, the employees of these high tech companies would be more preferable to service themselves in Millegan Creek Apartment.
All the apartments, which are developed by JPI are improved and refined on a continual basis by JPI and this would be more significant in the case of Millegan Creek Apartment as this would be a high luxury complex, which would be just targeting the high income group of the market who like to live alone in a single home which is highly luxurious.
The site amenities for this apartment would include laundry facilities, steam rooms, sauna, fitness center, club house and swimming pools……………….
This is just a sample partial work. Please place the order on the website to get your own originally done case solution
