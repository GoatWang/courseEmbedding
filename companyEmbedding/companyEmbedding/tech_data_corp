EPS represents the portion of a company's profit allocated to each outstanding share of common stock. Net income (reported or estimated) for a period of time is divided by the total number of shares outstanding (TSO) during that period; See growth rate measures for EPS. Our vendor's methodology for the EPS on the infoquote and Summary Quote pages follows the EPS used by the majority of the analysts following the stock, in many cases this is EBITDA EPS.

Tech Data Corporation (commonly referred to as Tech Data) is an American multinational distribution company specializing in IT products and services headquartered in Clearwater, Florida. Tech Data provides a broad range of product lines, logistics capabilities and value-added services that enable technology manufacturers and resellers, such as Apple, Cisco, HP, IBM, Lenovo, Microsoft, Sony, Symantec and VMware, to deploy IT solutions.
Tech Data is now one of the world’s largest distributors of IT products and services, generating $27.7 billion in net sales for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015. The company is ranked No. 108 on the Fortune 500[3] and one of Fortune’s “World’s Most Admired Companies.”[4]
History[edit]
Founded in Clearwater, FL by Edward C. Raymund in November 1974, Tech Data Corporation marketed data processing supplies for mini and mainframe computers. In 1983, Tech Data began to transition from a reseller to full-line national distributor of personal computer products, a transition led by Steven A. Raymund, Edward's son.
Steve A. Raymund succeeded Edward C. Raymund as Chief Executive Officer in 1986, the same year Tech Data announced its initial public stock offering on NASDAQ (ticker symbol: TECD).
In 2006, Robert M. Dutkowsky was named Chief Executive Officer.
Over the past 20 years, Tech Data expanded its business into Canada, Mexico and Europe by acquiring 18 companies. Some companies acquired included Canadian-based ParityPlus, Paris-based Softmart International, Munich-based Computer 2000 AG, Globelle Canada, UK-based Azlan Group PLC, Actebis AG Switzerland, Nordics-based IT distributor Scribona, Netherlands-based Triade Holding B.V., Specialist Distribution Group (SDG), and Signature Technology Group (STG).[5]
On August 25, 2015, Talkin’ Cloud ranked Tech Data one of the world’s top cloud service providers for the second consecutive year, naming Tech Data No. 24 on the annual list. [6]
In the second quarter of 2015, Tech Data posted record earnings, increasing net income by 22.4% and sales by 8%. Tech Data's data-center business is attributed with the record earnings. [7]
In September 2016, Tech Data announced that it had entered into an agreement to acquire the Technology Solutions operating group from Avnet, Inc. in a stock and cash transaction valued at approximately USD $2.6 billion. Under the terms of the agreement, Avnet received at closing approximately USD $2.4 billion in cash and 2.785 million shares of Tech Data common stock, representing an approximate 7 percent ownership position in Tech Data. The acquisition was closed in February 2017.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Tech Data Corporation (commonly referred to as Tech Data) is an American multinational distribution company specializing in IT products and services headquartered in Clearwater, Florida. Tech Data provides a broad range of product lines, logistics capabilities and value-added services that enable technology manufacturers and resellers, such as Apple, Cisco, HP, IBM, Lenovo, Microsoft, Sony, Symantec and VMware, to deploy IT solutions.
Tech Data is now one of the world’s largest distributors of IT products and services, generating $27.7 billion in net sales for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015. The company is ranked No. 108 on the Fortune 500[3] and one of Fortune’s “World’s Most Admired Companies.”[4]
History[edit]
Founded in Clearwater, FL by Edward C. Raymund in November 1974, Tech Data Corporation marketed data processing supplies for mini and mainframe computers. In 1983, Tech Data began to transition from a reseller to full-line national distributor of personal computer products, a transition led by Steven A. Raymund, Edward's son.
Steve A. Raymund succeeded Edward C. Raymund as Chief Executive Officer in 1986, the same year Tech Data announced its initial public stock offering on NASDAQ (ticker symbol: TECD).
In 2006, Robert M. Dutkowsky was named Chief Executive Officer.
Over the past 20 years, Tech Data expanded its business into Canada, Mexico and Europe by acquiring 18 companies. Some companies acquired included Canadian-based ParityPlus, Paris-based Softmart International, Munich-based Computer 2000 AG, Globelle Canada, UK-based Azlan Group PLC, Actebis AG Switzerland, Nordics-based IT distributor Scribona, Netherlands-based Triade Holding B.V., Specialist Distribution Group (SDG), and Signature Technology Group (STG).[5]
On August 25, 2015, Talkin’ Cloud ranked Tech Data one of the world’s top cloud service providers for the second consecutive year, naming Tech Data No. 24 on the annual list. [6]
In the second quarter of 2015, Tech Data posted record earnings, increasing net income by 22.4% and sales by 8%. Tech Data's data-center business is attributed with the record earnings. [7]
In September 2016, Tech Data announced that it had entered into an agreement to acquire the Technology Solutions operating group from Avnet, Inc. in a stock and cash transaction valued at approximately USD $2.6 billion. Under the terms of the agreement, Avnet received at closing approximately USD $2.4 billion in cash and 2.785 million shares of Tech Data common stock, representing an approximate 7 percent ownership position in Tech Data. The acquisition was closed in February 2017.
