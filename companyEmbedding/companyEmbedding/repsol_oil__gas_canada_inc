          5.85% Senior Notes due 2037 (CUSIP No. 87425E AJ2 and
          ISIN No. US87425EAJ29) (the "2037 Notes"),
        



          6.25% Senior Notes due 2038 (CUSIP No. 87425E AK9 and
          ISIN No. US87425EAK91) (the "2038 Notes"),
        



          5.50% Senior Notes due 2042 (CUSIP No. 87425E AN3 and

          5.75% Senior Notes due 2035 (CUSIP No. 87425E AH6 and

          No. US87425EAE32) (the "2027 Debentures" and together
          with the 2019 Notes, the 2021 Notes, the 2037 Notes, the
          2038 Notes, the 2042 Notes and the 2035 Notes, the

      The following table summarizes, with respect to each series

      The consents received from holders of Notes of each series
      exceed the amount needed to adopt the Proposed Amendments to
      each of the Indentures. Accordingly, the Company, Repsol
      S.A., a sociedad anónima organized in
      Spain, and the relevant trustee under each Indenture will
      execute a supplemental indenture to each Indenture effecting
      the Proposed Amendments (each a "Supplemental Indenture" and
      collectively, the "Supplemental Indentures"). Each
      Supplemental Indenture will become operative upon payment of
      the applicable Consent Only Payment (as defined below) or
      Total Consideration (as defined below). Each Supplemental
      Indenture will amend the reporting covenant and eliminate the
      merger covenant in the relevant Indenture, as well as make
      certain other related changes.
    

      Holders that validly delivered consents at or prior to the
      Consent/Early Tender Deadline without tendering the related
      Notes will receive the Consent Only Payment of U.S.$2.50 per
      U.S.$1,000 principal amount of Notes (the "Consent Only
      Payment") as to which they delivered (and did not revoke)
      such consents on the initial settlement date, which is
      expected to be June 27, 2017 (the "Initial Settlement Date").
    

      Holders that validly tendered their Notes and thereby
      delivered the related consents at or prior to the
      Consent/Early Tender Deadline will receive in respect of
      Notes accepted for purchase the applicable Total
      Consideration of U.S.$1,087.50 for each U.S.$1,000 principal
      amount of 2019 Notes, U.S.$1,000.00 for each U.S.$1,000
      principal amount of 2021 Notes, U.S.$1,000.00 for each
      U.S.$1,000 principal amount of 2037 Notes, U.S.$1,000.00 for
      each U.S.$1,000 principal amount of 2038 Notes, U.S.$955.00
      for each U.S.$1,000 principal amount of 2042 Notes,
      U.S.$960.00 for each U.S.$1,000 principal amount of 2035
      Notes and U.S.$1,135.00 for each U.S.$1,000 principal amount
      of 2027 Debentures (the "Total Consideration"), plus accrued
      and unpaid interest from the applicable last interest payment
      date to, but not including, the applicable settlement date
      ("Accrued Interest"), on the Initial Settlement Date. Such
      holders will not receive the Consent Only Payment.
    

      Each Tender Offer remains open and is scheduled to expire at
      12:00 midnight, New York City time, on July 7, 2017, unless
      such Tender Offer is extended or earlier terminated by the
      Company in its sole discretion, subject to applicable law
      (such time and date with respect to each Tender Offer, as the
      same may be extended or earlier terminated, the "Expiration
      Time"). For the avoidance of doubt, as used in this press
      release, midnight on a particular day refers to the time one
      minute after 11:59 p.m. on such day. Holders that validly
      tender their Notes after the Consent/Early Tender Deadline
      but at or prior to the Expiration Time will be eligible to
      receive in respect of Notes accepted for purchase the
      applicable Tender Offer Consideration of U.S.$1,057.50 for
      each U.S.$1,000 principal amount of 2019 Notes, U.S.$970.00
      for each U.S.$1,000 principal amount of 2021 Notes,
      U.S.$970.00 for each U.S.$1,000 principal amount of 2037
      Notes, U.S.$970.00 for each U.S.$1,000 principal amount of
      2038 Notes, U.S.$925.00 for each U.S.$1,000 principal amount
      of 2042 Notes, U.S.$930.00 for each U.S.$1,000 principal
      amount of 2035 Notes and U.S.$1,105.00 for each U.S.$1,000
      principal amount of 2027 Debentures, plus Accrued Interest,
      on the final settlement date, which is expected to be July
      12, 2017. Such holders will not receive the Consent Only
      Payment. Holders that tender Notes will be automatically
      deemed to have delivered consents to the Proposed Amendments
      in respect of such Notes.
    

      The Consent Solicitations and the Tender Offers are being
      made on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
      the Consent Solicitation Statement and Offer to Purchase
      dated June 9, 2017 (the "Consent Solicitation Statement and
      Offer to Purchase"), and related consent and letter of
      transmittal.
    

      Consummation of the Consent Solicitations and the Tender
      Offers are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the
      conditions set forth in the Consent Solicitation Statement
      and Offer to Purchase. The Company may amend, extend or
      terminate the Consent Solicitations and the Tender Offers
      with respect to one or more series of Notes in its sole
      discretion, subject to applicable law.
    

      This press release is not a solicitation of consents with
      respect to the Proposed Amendments or any Notes. In addition,
      this press release is neither an offer to purchase nor a
      solicitation of an offer to sell any Notes. The Consent
      Solicitations and the Tender Offers are being made only
      pursuant to the Consent Solicitation Statement and Offer to
      Purchase and related consent and letter of transmittal,
