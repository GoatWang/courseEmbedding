Partnership

 



Powerful Partnerships
Teaming with other technology developers is an essential part of our business strategy. Several of InnovaTek's existing products require integration with other products before they can be sold in certain markets.
InnovaTek also seeks alliances with major technology sales and manufacturing concerns who would be interested in licensing and distributing our products.

Our Services Products and Partners About Us CONTACT 







ABOUT USWHO WE ARESinnovaTek is a turn-key technology provider of food processing systems to manufacturers around the world delivered by a team of specialized engineers and food scientists experienced with advanced processing technologies, such as the Aseptia AseptiWave™ microwave processor. Our experience was gained through years of years of hands-on involvement with the development and commercialization of these technologies.





WHAT WE DOSinnovaTek is a complete solutions provider for the food processing industry. We work with startup companies aiming to get new products to market, as well as Fortune 100 companies looking to deploy new concepts with the latest technologies. Our talented team can take a product from ideation through full commercialization, including product development, R&D, process engineering and creative packaging solutions. We focus on natural, nutrient dense value-added products that push the boundaries of the existing market and provide the end consumer attributes of health and wellness that can be achieved through our technologies. We also keep an eye on the future, investigating new and emerging food processing solutions that can address food manufacturing needs and opportunities unmet by current offerings.THE BIGGER PICTUREWe believe that the global food market will continue to be a dynamic marketplace with an ever-growing world population to feed and that we have a responsibility to help provide this growing consumer base with high quality, healthy food at a reasonable price. Our processing technologies and services address the growing problems of nutrient deficiency and food waste at every scale, through small processing systems that enable startup companies to self-manufacture and growers to take more of their crops to market and large processing systems that allow global brands to economically and efficiently bring their products to market with greater nutrient retention, better flavor and longer shelf life.OUR TEAMSinnovaTek is an employee owned and customer driven company. We believe that our team is the key to our success and we seek out and retain those with the highest levels of talent and experience.ABOUT MICHAELMICHAEL DRUGA

OUR BRANDSBARTELL - MORRISON - INNOVATECH - SPE - CONTEC NA








Bartell began to manufacture concrete finishing power trowels for the local construction industry in the mid 1960’s and quickly became the dominant supplier to the Canadian market.












Morrison is still the only aluminum bolt screed on the market. They were bought and operated by Terex in 1999, until Morrison merged with Bartell in the 2007 acquisition.












For years, Innovatech has been world-renowned for its high-quality concrete floor grinder and Ride on Floor Scraper, the Terminator.












SPE began with the design and manufacture of the original 20ES Autoblast machine. This equipment was initially used to provide an on-site service for the construction, industrial flooring, and petrochemical industry.












Contec NA was acquired by Bartell Global in 2015 from Contec Germany. All of Contec Products are still manufactured in Germany resulting in high-quality surface prep equipment.
