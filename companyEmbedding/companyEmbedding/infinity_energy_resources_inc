	EXPLANATORY
	NOTE







	 






	We
	are filing this Amendment No. 1 on Form 10-Q/A to amend and restate in their entirety the following items of our Quarterly Report
	on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2016 as originally filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 13, 2016
	(the “Original Form 10-Q”): (i) Item 1 of Part I “Financial Information,” (ii) Item 2 of Part I, “Management’s
	Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” (iii) Item 4 of Part I, “Controls and Procedures,”
	and (iv) Item 6 of Part II, “Exhibits”, and we have also updated the signature page, the certifications of our Chief
	Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer in Exhibits 31.1, 31.2, 32.1 and 32.2, and our financial statements formatted in
	Extensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) in Exhibits 101. No other sections were affected, but for the convenience of the
	reader, this report on Form 10-Q/A restates in its entirety, as amended, our Original Form 10-Q. This report on Form 10-Q/A is
	presented as of the filing date of the Original Form 10-Q and does not reflect events occurring after that date, or modify or
	update disclosures in any way other than as required to reflect the restatement described below.






	 






	We
	have determined that our previously reported results for the quarter ended March 31, 2016 included non-operating income from
	the derecognition of liabilities recognized upon the expiration date of their respective statute of limitations for
	collection purposes. Management has reconsidered this position and has determined that it should wait until a court has
	confirmed the extinguishment of the obligation to pay such liabilities through a judicial decree. The condensed statement of
	operations for the quarter ended March 31, 2016 included in this Form 10-Q/A have been restated to remove the effects of
	derecognizing liabilities totaling $1,134,082 previously recognized as non-operating income. The condensed balance sheet as
	of March 31, 2016 included in this Form 10-Q/A have been restated to remove the effects of derecognizing liabilities totaling
	$1,134,082 which decreased accounts payable and accrued expenses as previously reported. The condensed statement of cash
	flows for the quarter ended March 31, 2016 included in this Form 10-Q/A includes certain adjustments to correspond to the
	statement of operations adjustment as described in Note 12 of the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements
	included in this filing. We have made necessary conforming changes in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
	Financial Condition and Results of Operations” resulting from the correction of this error.







	 









	Amendment








	 






	This
	Form 10-Q/A sets forth the Original Filing, as modified and superseded where necessary to reflect the Restatement and related
	matters.






	 






	Specifically,
	the following items of the Original Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are amended by this Form 10-Q/A to reflect the Restatement and
	related matters:






	 






	Part
	I - Item 1. Financial Statements, note describing the Restatement (Note 12) and updates to selected notes impacted by the Restatement
	in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.






	 










	Part
	I - Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

	Unaudited
	Interim Financial Information






	 




	Infinity
	Energy Resources, Inc. (collectively, “we,” “ours,” “us,” “Infinity” or the “Company”)
	has prepared the accompanying financial statements pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
	(the “SEC”) for interim financial reporting. These financial statements are unaudited and, in our opinion, include
	all adjustments consisting of normal recurring adjustments and accruals necessary for a fair presentation of our balance sheets,
	statements of operations, and cash flows for the periods presented. Operating results for the periods presented are not necessarily
	indicative of the results that may be expected for 2016 due to various factors. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally
	included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”)
	have been omitted in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC. These financial statements should be read in conjunction
	with the audited financial statements and accompanying notes in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,”
	of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC.




	 






	Nature
	of Operations








	 






	The
	Company is engaged in the exploration of potential oil and gas resources in the Perlas and Tyra concession blocks offshore Nicaragua
	in the Caribbean Sea (the “Nicaraguan Concessions” or “Concessions”), which contain a total of approximately
	1.4 million acres. The Company sold its wholly-owned subsidiary Infinity Oil and Gas of Texas, Inc. in 2012 and its wholly-owned
	subsidiary, Infinity Oil and Gas of Wyoming, Inc., was administratively dissolved in 2009.




	 




	The
	Company has been pursuing exploration and development of the Nicaraguan Concessions, which represents its principal asset and
	only exploration and development project. On March 5, 2009 Infinity signed the contracts relating to its Nicaraguan Concessions.
	Infinity has conducted activities to develop geological information from the processing and evaluation of newly acquired and existing
	2-D seismic data that was acquired for the Nicaraguan Concessions. Infinity has conducted activities to develop geological information
	from the processing and evaluation of 2-D seismic data that was acquired for the Nicaraguan Concessions. The Company has identified
	multiple sites for exploratory drilling and is planning the initial exploratory well on the Perlas Block in order to determine
	the existence of commercial hydrocarbon reserves, subject to receipt from the Nicaraguan government of authorizations for the
	drilling of up to five wells, financing and satisfaction of other conditions. In order to meet its obligations under the Perlas
	Block of the Nicaraguan Concession, the Company has to drill its initial exploratory well during 2016 or risk being in default
	and losing its rights under the Nicaraguan Concessions. The work plan on the Tyra block now requires the Company to shoot additional
	seismic prior to the commencement of exploratory drilling. The Company is attempting to negotiate with the Nicaraguan government
	to seek the waiver of the additional seismic mapping on the Tyra Block and extension of time to complete its initial well. There
	can be no assurance whether it will be able to obtain such waiver of the requirement. The current environment for oil and gas
	development projects, especially discoveries in otherwise undeveloped regions of the world, is very challenging given the depressed
	commodity prices for oil and gas products and the resulting industry-wide reduction in capital expenditure budgets for exploration
	and development projects. There can be no assurance whether the Company will be able to obtain adequate financing to fund the
	exploration and development of its Nicaraguan projects.




	 




	On
	May 7, 2015 the Company completed the private placement (the “May 2015 Private Placement”) of a $12.0 million principal
	amount Senior Convertible Note (the “Note”) and a common stock purchase warrant to purchase 1,800,000 shares of the
	Company’s common stock (the “Warrant”) with an institutional investor (the “Investor”). At the closing,
	the Investor acquired the Note by paying $450,000 in cash and issuing a promissory note, secured by cash, with a principal amount
	of $9,550,000 (the “Investor Note”). Assuming all amounts payable to the Company under the Investor Note are paid,
	the May 2015 Private Placement will result in gross proceeds of $10.0 million before placement agent fees and other expenses associated
	with the transaction, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. The Company will receive the remaining cash proceeds
	upon each voluntary or mandatory prepayment of the Investor Note. The Investor may, at its option and at any time, voluntarily
	prepay the Investor Note, in whole or in part. As of March 31, 2016 an additional $60,000 was funded under the Investor Note for
	a total of $510,000 advanced to the Company.




	 








	7










	 







	 




	The
	Investor must prepay the Investor Note, in whole or in part, upon the occurrence of one or more mandatory prepayment events. These
	include (i) the Investor’s conversion of the Note into shares of common stock upon which the Investor will be required to
	prepay the Investor Note, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, for each subsequent conversion of the Note and (ii) the Company’s
	delivering a mandatory prepayment notice to the Investor after it has received governmental authorizations from the Nicaraguan
	authorities necessary to commence drilling on at least five sites within the Concessions and the receipt of forbearance or similar
	agreements relative to its general creditors, among other conditions.




	 




	The
	Note matures on the three-year anniversary of its issuance, bears interest at 8% per annum, and is convertible at any time at
	the option of the holder into shares of the Company’s common stock at $5.00 per share (the “Conversion Price”).
	As a part of the May 2015 Private Placement, the Company issued a Warrant to the Investor giving it the right to purchase up to
	an aggregate of 1,800,000 shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $5.00 per share. The Warrant is exercisable
	commencing six months from the date of issuance for a period of seven years from the date of issuance. The Note ranks senior to
	the Company’s existing and future indebtedness and is secured by all of the assets of the Company, excluding the Concessions.




	 




	In
	addition, the Company continues to seek offers from industry operators and other third parties for interests in the acreage in
	the Nicaraguan Concessions in exchange for cash and a carried interest in exploration and development operations or other joint
	venture arrangement.




	 






	Going
	Concern






	 




	As
	reflected in the accompanying statements of operations, the Company has had a history of losses. In addition, the Company has
	a significant working capital deficit and is currently experiencing substantial liquidity issues.




	 




	The
	Company has relied on raising debt and equity capital in recent years in order to fund its ongoing maintenance/expenditure obligations
	under the Nicaraguan Concession, for its day-to-day operations and its corporate overhead since it has generated no operating
	revenues or cash flows in recent history.




	 




	The
	Company is in Sub-Period 3 of the exploration phase of the 30-year Concession for both Perlas and Tyra as of March 31, 2016. Sub-Period
	3 of the Nicaraguan Concessions requires the drilling of at least one exploratory well on the Perlas Block during 2016 and the
	shooting of additional seismic on the Tyra Block. The Company is in process of identifying at least one potential drilling site
	on the Perlas Block as required in Sub-Period 3 and will have to perform supplemental EIA work prior to requesting and receiving
	the permit to drill from the Nicaraguan government. The work plan on the Tyra block for Sub-Period 3 requires the Company to shoot
	additional seismic, which is estimated to cost approximately $2,500,000 prior to the commencement of exploratory drilling. The
	Company is attempting to negotiate with the Nicaraguan government to seek a waiver of the additional seismic mapping on the Tyra
	Block so that it can proceed with exploratory drilling. There can be no assurance whether it will be able to obtain a waiver of
	the requirement.




	 




	In
	accordance with the Nicaraguan Concession agreements, the Company has previously provided the Ministry of Energy with the required
	letters of credit in the amounts of $443,100 for Perlas (expired March 2014) and $408,450 for Tyra (expired September 2014). The
	Company has also made all required expenditures related to the Nicaraguan Concessions for training programs and as “area
	fees,” for each respective year for 2010 through 2015. In accordance with the Nicaraguan Concession agreements, the Company
	must provide the Ministry of Energy with the required letters of credit in the amounts which total $1,356,227 for the Perlas block
	and $278,450 for the Tyra block for exploration requirements on the leases as required by the Nicaraguan Concessions, to replace
	the expired letters of credit. The minimum cash requirements to maintain and comply with the minimum work program as defined in
	the Nicaraguan Concessions for the next twelve-month period will be approximately $5,500,000 for the Perlas Block, which includes
	all costs to prepare for and drill the initial exploratory well, and $280,000 for the Tyra Block, assuming the waiver is granted
	regarding the seismic mapping. If such waiver is not granted, the Company estimates it will require approximately $2,500,000 for
	the seismic mapping. Finally, the Company estimates it will need approximately $300,000 to prepare and submit an environmental
	supplement to the Nicaraguan government to identify and receive authorization to drill up to five wells in the Concessions.




	 








	8










	 







	 




	If
	the Company does not receive the funding anticipated under its May 2015 Private Placement, it must raise substantial amounts of
	debt and equity capital from other sources in the immediate future in order to fund: (1) the required letters of credit to the
	Nicaraguan Government; (2) the drilling of at least one exploratory well on the Perlas Block of the Nicaraguan Concessions during
	2016; (3) the shooting of additional seismic on the Tyra Block of the Nicaraguan Concessions should it be unable to negotiate
	a waiver of such requirement from the Nicaraguan government; (4) the payment of normal day-to-day operations and corporate overhead;
	and (5) the payment of outstanding debt and other financial obligations as they become due. These are substantial operational
	and financial issues that must be successfully addressed during 2016 or the Company’s ability to satisfy the conditions
	necessary to maintain its Nicaragua Concessions will be in significant doubt. The Company is actively seeking new outside sources
	of debt and equity capital in addition to the May 2015 Private Placement in order to fund the substantial needs enumerated above;
	however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such capital or obtain it on favorable terms or within the timeframe
	necessary to cure the technical defaults existing on the Nicaraguan Concessions or to meet its ongoing requirements relative to
	drilling the exploratory wells. The current environment for oil and gas development projects, especially discoveries in otherwise
	undeveloped regions of the world, is very challenging given the depressed commodity prices for oil and gas products, and the resulting
	industry-wide reduction in capital expenditure budgets for exploration and development projects. These may provide substantial
	impediments for the Company and its ability to obtain adequate financing to fund the exploration and development of its Nicaraguan
	projects.




	 




	Due
	to the uncertainties related to these matters, there exists substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as
	a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of
	asset carrying amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might result should the Company be unable to continue
	as a going concern.




	 






	Management
	Estimates






	 




	The
	preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires
	management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
	assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
	period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates with regard to the financial statements include
	the estimated carrying value of unproved properties, the estimated fair value of derivative liabilities, senior convertible note
	payable, stock-based awards and overriding royalty interests, and the realization of deferred tax assets.




	 






	Oil
	and Gas Properties






	 




	Unproved
	properties are assessed periodically (at least annually) to ascertain whether impairment has occurred. Unproved properties whose
	costs are individually significant are assessed individually by considering the primary lease terms of the properties, the holding
	period of the properties, geographic and geologic data obtained relating to the properties, and estimated discounted future net
	cash flows from the properties. Estimated discounted future net cash flows are based on discounted future net revenues associated
	with probable and possible reserves, risk adjusted as appropriate. Where it is not practicable to assess individually the amount
	of impairment of properties for which costs are not individually significant, such properties are grouped for purposes of assessing
	impairment. The amount of impairment assessed is deducted from the costs to be amortized, and reported as a period expense when
	the impairment is recognized. All unproved property costs as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 relate to the Nicaraguan
	Concessions. In assessing the unproved property costs for impairment, the Company takes into consideration various information
	including: i) the terms of the government concessions, ii) the status of the Company’s compliance with the Nicaraguan Concessions’
	requirements, iii) the ongoing evaluation of the seismic data, iv) the commodity prices for oil and gas products, v) the overall
	environment related to oil and gas exploration and development projects for unproven targets in unproven regions of the world,
	vi) the availability of financing for financial and strategic partners, and vii) other factors that would impact the viability
	of a significant long-term oil and gas exploration and development project.




	 








	9










	 







	 




	The
	current environment for oil and gas development projects, especially discoveries in otherwise undeveloped regions of the world,
	is very challenging given the depressed commodity prices for oil and gas products and the resulting industry-wide reduction in
	capital expenditure budgets for exploration and development projects. These may provide substantial impediments for the Company
	and its ability to obtain adequate financing to fund the exploration and development of its Nicaraguan projects. The Company has
	performed its impairment tests as of December 31, 2015 and has concluded that a full impairment reserve should be provided on
	the costs capitalized for the Nicaraguan Concessions oil and gas properties. All costs related to the Nicaraguan Concessions from
	December 31, 2015 through March 31, 2016 have been charged to operating expenses as incurred.




	 






	Concentrations






	 




	The
	Company’s business plan consists of developing the Nicaraguan Concessions and it expects to be active in Nicaragua for the
	foreseeable future, given sufficient capital. The political climate in Nicaragua could become unstable and subject to radical
	change over a short period of time. In the event of a significant negative change in political and economic stability in the vicinity
	of the Nicaraguan Concessions or of the inability of the Company to obtain sufficient financing, the Company might be forced to
	abandon or suspend its efforts and its rights under its Nicaraguan Concessions.




	 






	Derivative
	Instruments






	 




	The
	Company accounts for derivative instruments or hedging activities under the provisions of ASC 815

	Derivatives and Hedging

	.
	ASC 815 requires the Company to record derivative instruments at their fair value. If the derivative is designated as a fair value
	hedge, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in
	earnings. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative
	are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) and are recognized in the statement of operations when the hedged item affects
	earnings. Ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges, if any, are recognized in earnings. Changes in
	the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge treatment are recognized in earnings.




	 




	The
	purpose of hedging is to provide a measure of stability to the Company’s cash flows in an environment of volatile oil and
	gas prices and to manage the exposure to commodity price risk. As of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 and during the periods
	then ended, the Company had no oil and natural gas derivative arrangements outstanding.




	 




	As
	a result of certain terms, conditions and features included in certain common stock purchase warrants issued by the Company (Notes
	2, 3 and 6), those warrants are required to be accounted for as derivatives at estimated fair value, with changes in fair value
	recognized in operations.




	 






	Income
	Taxes






	 




	The
	Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. This method requires the recognition of deferred tax
	liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between financial accounting bases and
	tax bases of assets and liabilities. The tax benefits of tax loss carryforwards and other deferred taxes are recorded as an asset
	to the extent that management assesses the utilization of such assets to be more likely than not. Management routinely assesses
	the realizability of the Company’s deferred income tax assets, and a valuation allowance is recognized if it is determined
	that deferred income tax assets may not be fully utilized in future periods. Management considers future taxable earnings in making
	such assessments. Numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable earnings, including such
	factors as future operating conditions. When the future utilization of some portion of the deferred tax asset is determined not
	to be more likely than not, a valuation allowance is provided to reduce the recorded deferred tax asset. When the Company can
	project that a portion of the deferred tax asset can be realized through application of a portion of tax loss carryforward, the
	Company will record that utilization as a deferred tax benefit and recognize a deferred tax asset in the same amount. There can
	be no assurance that facts and circumstances will not materially change and require the Company to adjust its deferred income
	tax asset valuation allowance in a future period. The Company recognized a deferred tax asset, net of valuation allowance, of
	$-0- at March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.




	 








	10










	 







	 




	The
	Company is potentially subject to taxation in many jurisdictions, and the calculation of income tax liabilities (if any) involves
	dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex income tax laws and regulations in various taxing jurisdictions. It recognizes
	certain income tax positions that meet a more-likely-than not recognition threshold. If the Company ultimately determines that
	the payment of these liabilities will be unnecessary, it will reverse the liability and recognize an income tax benefit. No liability
	for unrecognized tax benefit was recorded as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.




	 






	Asset
	Retirement Obligations






	 




	The
	Company records estimated future asset retirement obligations pursuant to the provisions of ASC 410. ASC 410 requires entities
	to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred with a corresponding
	increase in the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. Subsequent to initial measurement, the asset retirement liability
	is required to be accreted each period. The Company’s asset retirement obligations consist of costs related to the plugging
	of wells, the removal of facilities and equipment, and site restoration on oil and gas properties. Capitalized costs are depleted
	as a component of the full cost pool using the units of production method. Although the Company had divested all of its domestic
	oil properties that contain operating and abandoned wells as of March 31, 2016, the Company may have obligations related to the
	divestiture of certain abandoned non-producing domestic leasehold properties should the new owner not perform its obligations
	to reclaim abandoned wells in a timely manner. Management believes the Company has been relieved from asset retirement obligation
	related to Infinity-Texas because of the sale of its Texas oil and gas properties in 2011 and its sale of 100% of the stock in
	Infinity-Texas in 2012. The Company has recognized an additional liability of $734,897 related to its former Texas oil and gas
	producing properties (included in asset retirement obligations) to recognize the potential personal liability of the Company and
	its officers for the Infinity-Texas oil and gas properties should the new owner not perform its obligations to reclaim abandoned
	wells in a timely manner. In addition, management believes the Company has been relieved from asset retirement obligations related
	to Infinity-Wyoming because of the sale of its Wyoming and Colorado oil and gas properties in 2008; however, the Company has recognized
	an additional liability of $981,106 related to its former Wyoming and Colorado oil and gas producing properties (included in asset
	retirement obligations) to recognize the potential liability of the Company and its officers should the new owner not perform
	its obligations to reclaim abandoned wells in a timely manner.




	 






	Fair
	Value of Financial Instruments






	 




	The
	carrying values of the Company’s accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities and short term notes represent
	the estimated fair value due to the short-term nature of the accounts.




	 




	The
	carrying value of the Company’s debt under its line-of-credit with related party represents its estimated fair value due
	to its short-term nature, its rate of interest, associated fees and expenses and initially recorded discount.




	 




	In
	accordance with ASC Topic 820 —

	Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures

	(“ASC 820”), the Company utilizes
	the market approach to measure fair value for its financial assets and liabilities. The market approach uses prices and other
	relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets, liabilities or a group of assets
	or liabilities, such as a business.




	 




	ASC
	820 utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three
	broad levels. The following is a brief description of those three levels:




	 






	 




	●




	Level
	1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	Level
	2 — Other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities).






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	Level
	3 — Significant unobservable inputs (including the Company’s own assumptions in determining the fair value.






	 








	11










	 







	 




	The
	estimated fair value of the Company’s Note and various derivative liabilities, which are related to detachable warrants
	issued in connection with various notes payable, were estimated using a closed-ended option pricing model utilizing assumptions
	related to the contractual term of the instruments, estimated volatility of the price of the Company’s common stock, interest
	rates, the probability of both the downward adjustment of the exercise price and the upward adjustment to the number of warrants
	as provided by the warrant agreement terms and non-performance risk factors, among other items. The fair values for the warrant
	derivatives as of and March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were classified under the fair value hierarchy as Level 3.




	 




	The
	following table represents the Company’s hierarchy for its financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a
	recurring basis as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015:

	Net
	Income (Loss) per Share






	 




	Pursuant
	to FASB ASC Topic 260,

	Earnings per Share,

	basic net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing the net income (loss)
	by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed
	by dividing the net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common and common equivalent
	shares outstanding during the period. Common share equivalents included in the diluted computation represent shares issuable upon
	assumed exercise of stock options and warrants using the treasury stock and “if converted” method. For periods in
	which net losses are incurred, weighted average shares outstanding is the same for basic and diluted loss per share calculations,
	as the inclusion of common share equivalents would have an anti-dilutive effect.




	 






	Reclassifications






	 




	Certain
	amounts in the prior period were reclassified to conform to the current period’s financial statement presentation. These
	reclassifications had no effect on previously reported net loss or accumulated deficit.

	On
	May 7, 2015, the Company completed the May 2015 Private Placement of a $12.0 million principal amount senior secured convertible
	note (the “Note”) and Warrant to purchase 1,800,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, $0.0001 par value.
	The placement agent for the Company in the transaction will receive a fee of 6% of cash proceeds, or $600,000, if and when the
	Company receives the full cash proceeds. It received $27,000 of such amount at the closing. In addition, the placement agent was
	granted a warrant to purchase 240,000 shares of common stock at $5.00 per share, which warrant is immediately exercisable.




	 




	The
	Note and Warrant were issued pursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement, dated May 7, 2015, by and between the Company and the
	Investor. The May 2015 Private Placement was made pursuant to an exemption from registration under such Act. At the closing, the
	Investor acquired the senior convertible note by paying $450,000 in cash and issuing a senior promissory note, secured by cash,
	with an aggregate initial principal amount of $9,550,000 (the “Investor Note”). Assuming all amounts payable to the
	Company under the Investor Note are paid without any offset or default, the May 2015 Private Placement will result in gross proceeds
	of $10.0 million before placement agent fees and other expenses associated with the transaction, subject to the satisfaction of
	certain conditions. The Company used the proceeds from this offering to retire certain outstanding obligations, including the
	2015 area and training fees relating to its Nicaraguan Concessions, and to provide working capital. As of March 31, 2016, an additional
	$60,000 was funded under the Investor Note for a total of $510,000 advanced to the Company prior to any repayments.




	 




	The
	Company is to receive the remaining cash proceeds upon each voluntary or mandatory prepayment of the Investor Note. An Investor
	may, at its option and at any time, voluntarily prepay the Investor Note, in whole or in part. The Investor Note is also subject
	to mandatory prepayment, in whole or in part, upon the occurrence of one or more of the following mandatory prepayment events:




	 




	(1)

	Mandatory Prepayment upon Conversion

	– At any time the Investor has converted more than $2.0 million principal amount
	of the Note, representing the original issue discount of the Note, the Investor will be required to prepay the Investor Note,
	on a dollar-for-dollar basis, for each subsequent conversion of the Note.




	 




	(2)

	Mandatory Prepayment upon Mandatory Prepayment Notices

	– The Company may require the Investor to prepay the Investor
	Note by delivering a mandatory prepayment notice to the Investor, subject to (i) the satisfaction of certain equity conditions,
	(ii) the Company’s receipt of all Governmental Authorizations, as defined in the Purchase Agreement, necessary to commence
	drilling on at least five Properties, also as defined in the Purchase Agreement, within the Nicaraguan Concessions, and (iii)
	the Company obtaining forbearance agreements from certain third parties to whom the Company owes obligations. Notwithstanding
	the foregoing, the Company may not request a mandatory prepayment if after giving effect to such proposed mandatory prepayment,
	the Company, would hold more than $4.0 million in cash or if prepayment under the Investor Note for the preceding sixty calendar
	day period would exceed $2.0 million.




	 








	13










	 







	 




	The
	Investor Note also contains certain offset rights, which if executed, would reduce the amount outstanding under the Note and the
	Investor Note and the cash proceeds received by the Company.




	 





	Description
	of the Senior Convertible Note





	 




	The
	Note is senior to the Company’s existing and future indebtedness and is secured by all of the assets of the Company, excluding
	the Nicaraguan Concessions, and to the extent and as provided in the related security documents.




	 




	The
	Note is convertible at any time at the option of the holder into shares of the Company’s common stock at $5.00 per share
	(the “Conversion Price”). The Note matures on the three-year anniversary of the issuance date thereof. If the Company
	issues or sells shares of its common stock, rights to purchase shares of its common stock, or securities convertible into shares
	of its common stock for a price per share that is less than the Conversion Price then in effect, the then current Conversion Price
	will be decreased to equal such lower price. The foregoing adjustments to the Conversion Price for future stock issues will not
	apply to certain exempt issuances, including issuances pursuant to certain employee benefit plans. In addition, the Conversion
	Price is subject to adjustment upon stock splits, reverse stock splits, and similar capital changes.




	 




	On
	the first business day of each month beginning on the earlier of the (i) effectiveness of a registration statement the Company
	files to register the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Note or exercise of the Warrant, as defined below,
	or (ii) sixth month following the date of the Note through and including the maturity date (the “Installment Dates”),
	the Company will pay to the Note holder an amount equal to (i) one-thirtieth (1/30th) of the original principal amount of the
	Note (or the principal outstanding on the Installment Date, if less) plus (ii) the accrued and unpaid interest with respect to
	such principal plus (iii) the accrued and unpaid late charges (if any) with respect to such principal and interest. The Investor
	has the ability to defer or accelerate such monthly payments in its sole discretion.




	 




	Prior
	to the maturity date, the Note will bear interest at 8% per annum (or 18% per annum during an event of default) with interest
	payable in cash or in shares of Common Stock monthly in arrears on the first business day of each calendar month following the
	issuance date.




	 




	Each
	monthly payment may be made in cash, in shares of the Company’s common stock, or in a combination of cash and shares of
	its common stock. The Company’s ability to make such payments with shares of its common stock will be subject to various
	equity conditions, including the existence of an effective registration statement covering the resale of the shares issued in
	payment (or, in the alternative, the eligibility of the shares issuable pursuant to the Note and the Warrant, as defined below,
	for sale without restriction under Rule 144 and without the need for the Company to remain current with its public filing obligations)
	and certain minimum trading price and trading volume. Such shares will be valued, as of the date on which notice is given by the
	Company that payment will be made in shares, at the lower of (1) the then applicable Conversion Price and (2) a price that is
	80.0% of the arithmetic average of the three lowest weighted average prices of the Company’s common stock during the twenty-trading
	day period ending two trading days before the applicable determination date (the “Measurement Period”). If the Company
	elects to pay such monthly payment in shares of the Company’s stock it is required to pre-deliver shares of the Company’s
	common stock and is required to deliver additional shares, if any, to a true-up such number of shares to the number of shares
	required to be delivered on the applicable Installment Date pursuant to the calculation above.




	 




	At
	any time after the issuance date, the Company will have the right to redeem all or any portion of the outstanding principal balance
	of the Note plus all accrued but unpaid interest and any other charges at a price equal to 125% of such amount provided that (i)
	the arithmetic average of the closing sale price of the common stock for any twenty (20) consecutive Trading Days equals or exceeds
	200% of the Conversion Price and (ii) among other conditions, there is an effective registration statement covering the resale
	of the shares issued in payment or, in the alternative, the eligibility of the shares issuable pursuant to the Note and the Warrant
	for sale without restriction under Rule 144 and without the need for the Company to remain current with its public filing obligations.
	The Investor has the right to convert any or all of the amount to be redeemed into common stock prior to redemption.




	 








	14










	 







	 




	Upon
	the occurrence of an event of default under the Note, the Investor may, so long as the event of default is continuing, require
	the Company to redeem all or a portion of its Note. Each portion of the Note subject to such redemption must be redeemed by the
	Company, in cash, at a price equal to the greater of (1) 125% of the amount being redeemed, including principal, accrued and unpaid
	interest, and accrued and unpaid late charges, and (2) the product of (I) the amount being redeemed and (II) the quotient determined
	by dividing (A) the greatest closing sale price of the shares of common stock during the period beginning on the date immediately
	preceding the event of default and ending on the date the holder delivers a redemption notice to the Company, by (B) the lowest
	Conversion Price in effect during such period.




	 




	Subject
	to certain conditions, the Investor may also require the Company to redeem all or a portion of its Note in connection with a transaction
	that results in a Change of Control, as defined in the Note. The Company must redeem each portion of the Note subject to such
	redemption in cash at a price equal to the greater of (1) 125% of the amount being redeemed (including principal, accrued and
	unpaid interest, and accrued and unpaid late charges), and (2) the product of (I) the amount being redeemed and (II) the quotient
	determined by dividing (A) the greatest closing sale price of the shares of common stock during the period beginning on the date
	immediately preceding the earlier to occur of (i) the consummation of the Change of Control and (ii) the public announcement of
	such Change of Control and ending on the date the holder delivers a redemption notice to the Company, by (B) the lowest Conversion
	Price in effect during such period.




	 





	Description
	of the Warrant

	.




	 




	As
	a part of the May 2015 Private Placement, the Company issued a Warrant to the Investor giving it the right to purchase up to an
	aggregate of 1,800,000 shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $5.00 per share. The Warrant is exercisable
	commencing six months from the date of issuance and the exercise prices for the Warrant is subject to adjustment for certain events,
	such as stock splits and stock dividends. If the Company issues or sells shares of its common stock, rights to purchase shares
	of its common stock, or securities convertible into shares of its common stock for a price per share that is less than the exercise
	price then in effect, the exercise price of the Warrant will be decreased to equal such lesser price. Upon each such adjustment,
	the number of the shares of the Company’s common stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrant will increase proportionately.
	The foregoing adjustments to the exercise price for future stock issues will not apply to certain exempt issuances, including
	issuances pursuant to certain employee benefit plans. In addition, the Conversion Price is subject to adjustment upon stock splits,
	reverse stock splits, and similar capital changes. The Warrant will expire on the seventh (7th) anniversary of the date of issuance.




	 





	9.99%
	Restriction on Conversion of Note and Exercise of Warrant





	 




	The
	Investor has no right to convert the Note or exercise the Warrant to the extent that such conversion or exercise would result
	in the Investor being the beneficial owner in excess of 9.99% of the Company’s common stock. The Company was required to
	hold a meeting of its shareholders to approve increase the number of its authorized shares to meet its obligations under the Purchase
	Agreement to have reserved 200% of the shares issuable upon conversion of the Note and exercise of the Warrant. The Company held
	its Annual Meeting of Shareholders on September 25, 2015 and the shareholders approved the reverse split of the Company’s
	common stock issued and outstanding shares, which satisfied this requirement.




	 





	Registration
	Rights Agreement





	 




	In
	connection with the May 2015 Private Placement, the Company and the Investor entered into a Registration Rights Agreement under
	which the Company is required, on or before 45 days after the closing of the May 2015 Private Placement, to file a registration
	statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) covering the resale of 130% of the shares of the
	Company’s common stock issuable pursuant to the Note and Warrant and to use its best efforts to have the registration declared
	effective as soon as practicable. The Company will be subject to certain monetary penalties, as set forth in the Registration
	Rights Agreement, if the registration statement is not filed or does not remain available for the resale (subject to certain allowable
	grace periods) of the Registrable Securities, as such term is defined in the Registration Rights Agreement. The Company filed
	the required registration statement on Form S-1 on June 19, 2015 and the Securities and Exchange Commission declared the Form
	S-1 effective on October 9, 2015 and has thereby satisfied this requirement.

	Participation
	Rights





	 




	If,
	during the period beginning on the closing date and ending on the four (4) year anniversary of the closing date, the Company offers,
	sells, grants any option to purchase, or otherwise disposes of any of its or its subsidiaries’ equity or equity equivalent
	securities (a “Subsequent Placement”), the Investor will have the right to participate for 50% of any such future
	Subsequent Placement.




	 





	Description

	The
	Company elected to account for the Note on its fair value basis, therefore, the fair value of the Note, including its embedded

	The
	Company received $450,000 of proceeds at the date of issuance and after repayments and additional funding the net principal balance
	was $243,000 as of March 31, 2016. The fair market value of the Note was estimated to be $682,400 as of the issuance date, $265,929
	at December 31, 2015 and $247,135 as of March 31, 2016. The net $53,206 change in fair market value of the Note is included in
	change in fair value of senior notes payable in the accompanying statement of operations for the three months ended March 31,
	2016.




	 




	The
	Warrant issued to purchase 1,800,000 common shares in connection with the Note was treated as a derivative liability for accounting
	purposes due to its ratchet and anti-dilution provisions. Accordingly, the Company has estimated the fair value of the warrant
	derivative as of the issuance date of the Note was issued at $8,034,007, which has been charged to non-operating expense during
	the year ended December 31, 2015. The estimated fair value of the warrant derivative as of March 31, 2016 was $79,953 representing
	a change of $102,564 from December 31, 2015 which is included in changes in derivative fair value in the accompanying statement
	of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2016.




	 




	The
	warrant issued to purchase 240,000 shares issued as part of the placement fee in connection with the Note was treated as a derivative
	liability for accounting purposes due to its ratchet and anti-dilution provisions. Changes in the fair value of the warrant derivative
	liability totaled $13,675 (reduction in the derivative liability) through March 31, 2016, which is included in changes in derivative
	fair value in the accompanying statement of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The warrant derivative liability
	balance related to such warrants was $10,660 and $24,336 as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.




	 






	The
	Company is required to make monthly installment payments in the form of cash, common stock or a combination of both. Elected to
	make such monthly payments in the form of common stock and has delivered a total of 1,984,446 shares of common stock representing
	required principal repayments ($107,000 principal balances) and 111,389 representing interest payments ($6,006 interest payments)
	during the three months ended March 31, 2016. A total of 317,154 common shares were issued to “true-up” previous installments
	which were included in the shares delivered during the three months ended March 31, 2016.

	Line-of-Credit
	with Related Party








	 






	The
	Company entered into a line-of-credit facility on September 23, 2013 that provides it with borrowing capacity on a revolving basis
	up to a maximum of $50,000, which was increased to $75,000 at August 28, 2015 and an initial maturity of November 28, 2013. The
	line of credit is convertible to common stock at a rate of $5.00 per share. The entity providing the credit facility is owned
	by an officer of another corporation for which Infinity’s president and chairman of the board serves as president and chairman
	of the board. The facility is unsecured, bears interest at 8% per annum, and was renewed at its maturity several times with its
	current maturity date as May 28, 2016. In consideration for the origination of the line of credit facility and the various renewals,
	the Company granted the lender common stock purchase warrants. On February 28, 2016 the Company extended the line-of-credit expiration
	date to May 28, 2016 and issued a warrant to purchase 10,000 common shares at an exercise price of $5.00 per share, which warrants
	were immediately exercisable and expire on February 28, 2021. The Company estimated the fair value of the warrants at $774 as
	of the grant date, which amount was recorded as debt issuance costs and will be amortized to interest expense over the extended
	term of the line-of-credit.




	 




	During
	the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, $689 and $184,537 of debt issuance costs amortized (including amounts
	immediately expensed) to interest expense, respectively and the remaining unamortized balance was $505 as of December 31, 2015,
	which is included in prepaid expenses.




	 






	Note
	Payable – Short-term






	 




	On
	December 27, 2013 the Company borrowed $1,050,000 under an unsecured credit facility with a private, third-party lender. The facility
	is represented by a promissory note (the “December 2013 Note”) with an original maturity date of March 12, 2014.




	 




	In
	connection with the December 2013 Note, the Company granted the lender a warrant (the “Warrant”) exercisable to purchase
	100,000 shares of its common stock at an exercise price of $15.00 per share. In connection with an extension to April 2015, the
	parties amended the date for exercise of the Warrant to be a period commencing April 7, 2015 and expiring on the third anniversary
	of such date. The Company issued no additional warrants to the lender in connection with the extension of the Note to the New
	Maturity Date. If the Company fails to pay the Note on or before its New Maturity Date, the number of shares issuable under the
	Warrant increases to 1,333,333 and the exercise price drops to $0.75 per share. All other terms of the Warrant remain the same.
	The Warrant has been treated as a derivative liability whereby the value of Warrant is estimated at the date of grant and recorded
	as a derivative liability and as a discount on the note payable. The warrant liability is revalued to fair value at each reporting
	date with the corresponding income (loss) reflected in the statement of operations as change in derivative liability. The discount
	is amortized ratably through the original maturity date and each of the extended maturity dates.

	In
	connection with an extensions of the December 2013 Note to April 7, 2016, the Company agreed to enter into a definitive revenue
	sharing agreement with the lender to grant the lender under the revenue sharing agreement an irrevocable right to receive a monthly
	payment equal to one half of one percent (1/2%) of the gross revenue derived from the share of all hydrocarbons produced at the
	wellhead from the Nicaraguan Concessions and any other oil and gas concessions that the Company and its affiliates may acquire
	in the future. This percent increased to one percent (1%) when the Company did not pay the December 2013 Note in full by August
	7, 2014. Therefore, the revenue sharing agreement is fixed at one percent (1%). The value of the one percent (1.0%) definitive
	revenue sharing agreement granted to the lender as consideration for the extension of the maturity date to December 7, 2014 was
	estimated to be $964,738. Such amount was recorded as a reduction of oil and gas properties and as a discount on the renewed note
	payable and amortized ratably over the extended term of the note.




	 




	In
	connection with the extension of the maturity date of the December 2013 Note to April 7, 2016, the Company also (i) issued the
	lender 20,000 shares of restricted common stock; (ii) decreased the exercise price of the warrant to $5.00 per share and extended
	the term of the warrant to a period commencing on the New Maturity Date and expiring on the third anniversary of such date; and
	(iii) paid $50,000 toward amounts due under the December 2013 Note. The Company issued no additional warrants to the lender in
	connection with the extension of the Note to the New Maturity Date. If the Company fails to pay the December 2013 Note on or before
	its New Maturity Date, the number of shares issuable under the Warrant increases to 1,333,333 and the exercise price drops to
	$0.75 per share. All other terms of the warrant remain the same. The December 2013 Note may be prepaid without penalty at any
	time. The Note is subordinated to all existing and future senior indebtedness, as such terms are defined in the Note. The Company
	and the holder are currently negotiating to extend the maturity date of this note (See Note 11), therefore the December 2013 Note
	is in technical default, however there can be no assurances such negotiations will be successful.




	 




	The
	Warrant has been treated as a derivative liability whereby the value of Warrant is estimated at the date of grant and recorded
	as a derivative liability and as a discount on the note payable. The warrant liability is revalued to fair value at each reporting
	date with the corresponding income (loss) reflected in the statement of operations as change in derivative liability. The discount
	is amortized ratably through the original maturity date and each of the extended maturity dates. The Company recognized the value
	of the 20,000 shares of common stock issued ($104,000) and the increased value of the outstanding warrants due to the decrease
	in their exercise price ($68,716) as an additional discount on the note payable to be amortized ratably over the extended term
	of the underlying note.




	 




	The
	discount recorded as of the December 27, 2013 origination date of the note and as a result of the amendments to the Note terms
	and extensions of the maturity date has been amortized ratably over the term and extended terms of the note. Discount amortization
	expense aggregated $47,432 and $38,052 for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and the remaining unamortized
	discount was $3,094 as of March 31, 2016. The related warrant derivative liability balance was $1,176 at fair value as of March
	31, 2016.




	 




	Other
	than the Note described above, during the three months ended March 31, 2016 the Company had short-term notes outstanding with
	entities or individuals as follows:




	 






	 




	●




	On
	July 7, 2015 the Company borrowed a total of $50,000 from an individual under a convertible note payable with the conversion
	rate of $5.60 per share. The term of the note was for a period of 90 days and bears interest at 8% per annum. In connection
	with the loan, the Company issued the entity a warrant for the purchase of 5,000 shares of common stock at $5.60 per share
	for a period of five years from the date of the note. The terms of the note and warrant provide that should the note and interest
	not be paid in full by its maturity date, the number of warrants automatically increases to 10,000 shares and the exercise
	price remains at $5.60 per share. The ratchet provision in the stock purchase warrant requires that the warrant be accounted
	for as derivative liability. The Company recorded the estimated fair value of the warrant totaling $22,314 as a discount on
	note payable and as a derivative liability in the same amount, as of the origination date. On October 7, 2015, the note was
	extended for an additional 90 days or until January 7, 2016 and later to May 7, 2016. In consideration, the Company granted
	the lender common stock purchase warrants exercisable to purchase 5,000 shares of common stock on each extension date at an
	exercise price of $5.60 per share, which warrants were immediately exercisable and expire in 5 years. The total value of the
	5,000 newly issued warrants issued on January 7, 2016 totaled $379, and is being amortized over the extension period (through
	May 7, 2016). Discount amortization totaled $525 for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and the remaining unamortized discount
	was $116 as of March 31, 2016. The related warrant derivative liability balance was $429 at fair value as of March 31, 2016.

	On
	July 15, 2015 the Company borrowed a total of $35,000 from an individual under a convertible note payable with the conversion
	rate of $5.60 per share. The term of the note was for a period of 90 days and bears interest at 8% per annum. In connection
	with the loan, the Company issued the entity a warrant for the purchase of 3,500 shares of common stock at $5.60 per share
	for a period of five years from the date of the note. The terms of the note and warrant provide that should the note and interest
	not be paid in full by its maturity date, the number of warrants automatically increases to 7,000 shares and the exercise
	price remains at $5.60 per share. The ratchet provision in the stock purchase warrant requires that the warrant be accounted
	for as a derivative liability. The Company recorded the estimated fair value of the warrant totaling $11,827 as a discount
	on note payable and as a derivative liability in the same amount, as of the origination date. On October 15, 2015, the note
	was extended for an additional 90 days or until January 15, 2016 and later to May 15, 2016. In consideration, the Company
	granted the lender common stock purchase warrants exercisable to purchase an aggregate of 3,500 shares of common stock on
	each extension date at an exercise price of $5.60 per share, which warrants were immediately exercisable and expire in 5 years.
	The total value of the 3,500 newly issued warrants on January 15, 2016 totaled $267, and is being amortized over the extension
	period (through May 15, 2016). Discount amortization totaled $406 for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and the remaining
	unamortized discount was $99 as of March 31, 2016. The related warrant derivative liability balance was $300 at fair value
	as of March 31, 2016.






	 





	Note
	4 – Common Stock





	 




	The
	Company has delivered a total of 1,984,446 shares of common stock representing required principal repayments ($107,000 principal
	balances) and 111,389 representing interest payments ($6,006 interest payments) during the three months ended March 31, 2016.
	A total of 317,154 common shares were issued to “true-up” previous installments which were included in the shares
	delivered during the three months ended March 31, 2016. See Note 2

	– Senior Convertible Note Payable

	.




	 





	Note
	5 – Stock Options





	 




	The
	Company applies ASC 718,

	Stock Compensation

	, which requires companies to recognize compensation expense for share-based
	payments based on the estimated fair value of the awards. ASC 718 also requires tax benefits relating to the deductibility of
	increases in the value of equity instruments issued under share-based compensation arrangements to be presented as financing cash
	inflows in the statement of cash flows. Compensation cost is recognized based on the grant-date fair value for all share-based
	payments granted, and is estimated in accordance with the provisions of ASC 718.




	 




	In
	May 2006, the Company’s stockholders approved the 2006 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2006 Plan”), under which
	both incentive and non-statutory stock options may be granted to employees, officers, non-employee directors and consultants.
	An aggregate of 47,000 shares of the Company’s common stock are reserved for issuance under the 2006 Plan. In June 2005,
	the Company’s stockholders approved the 2005 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2005 Plan”), under which both incentive
	and non-statutory stock options may be granted to employees, officers, non-employee directors and consultants. An aggregate of
	47,500 shares of the Company’s common stock were reserved for issuance under the 2005 Plan however such 2005 Plan has now
	expired and no further issuances can be made. Options granted under the 2005 Plan and 2006 Plan allow for the purchase of common
	stock at prices not less than the fair market value of such stock at the date of grant, become exercisable immediately or as directed
	by the Company’s Board of Directors and generally expire ten years after the date of grant. The Company also has issued
	other stock options not pursuant to a formal plan with terms similar to the 2005 and 2006 Plans.




	 




	The
	Annual Meeting of Stockholders was held on September 25, 2015 and the stockholders approved the Infinity Energy Resources, Inc.
	2015 Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan (the “2015 Plan”) and reserved 500,000 shares for issuance under the Plan.




	 




	As
	of March 31, 2016, 515,650 shares were available for future grants under all plans.

	The
	fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires
	the input of subjective assumptions, including the expected term of the option award, expected stock price volatility and expected
	dividends. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. For purposes of estimating
	the expected term of options granted, the Company aggregates option recipients into groups that have similar option exercise behavioral
	traits. Expected volatilities used in the valuation model are based on the expected volatility that would be used by an independent
	market participant in the valuation of certain of the Company’s warrants. The risk-free rate for the expected term of the
	option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The Company’s forfeiture rate assumption
	used in determining its stock-based compensation expense is estimated based on historical data. The actual forfeiture rate could
	differ from these estimates. There were no stock options granted during the three months ended March 31, 2016.

	Derivatives
	– Warrants Issued Relative to Note Payables






	 




	The
	estimated fair value of the Company’s derivative liabilities, all of which are related to the detachable warrants issued
	in connection with various notes payable and the senior convertible note, were estimated using a closed-ended option pricing model
	utilizing assumptions related to the contractual term of the instruments, estimated volatility of the price of the Company’s
	common stock, interest rates, the probability of both the downward adjustment of the exercise price and the upward adjustment
	to the number of warrants as provided by the note payable and warrant agreement terms (Note 2 and 3) and non-performance risk
	factors, among other items (ASC 820,

	Fair Value Measurements

	(“ASC 820”) fair value hierarchy Level 3). The
	detachable warrants issued in connection with the senior convertible note (See Note 2), the December 2013 Note (See Note 3) and
	the two other short-term notes payable (See Note 3) contain ratchet and anti-dilution provisions that remain in effect during
	the term of the warrant while the ratchet and anti-dilution provisions of the other notes payable cease when the related note
	payable is extinguished. When the note payable containing such ratchet and anti-dilution provisions is extinguished, the derivative
	liability will be adjusted to fair value and the resulting derivative liability will be transitioned from a liability to equity
	as of such date. The derivative liability associated with the warrants issued in connection with the senior convertible note payable
	will remain effect until such time as the underlying warrant is exercised or terminated and the resulting derivative liability
	will be transitioned from a liability to equity as of such date.

	The
	Company has issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of 2,165,500 common shares in connection with various outstanding debt instruments

	Note
	8 – Income Taxes





	 




	For
	income tax purposes, the Company has net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately $67,415,000 as of December 31, 2015, which
	expire from 2025 through 2030. The Company has provided a 100% valuation allowance due to the uncertainty of realizing the tax
	benefits from its net deferred tax asset.




	 




	The
	Company has not completed the filing of tax returns for the tax years 2012 through 2015. Therefore, all such tax returns are open
	to examination by the Internal Revenue Service.




	 




	The
	Internal Revenue Code contains provisions under Section 382 which limit a company’s ability to utilize net operating loss
	carry-forwards in the event that it has experienced a more than 50% change in ownership over a three-year period. Current estimates
	prepared by the Company on a preliminary basis indicate that no ownership changes have occurred, and are currently not subject
	to an annual limitation, but may be further limited by additional ownership changes which may occur in the future.




	 





	Note
	9 – Commitments and Contingencies





	 




	The
	Company has not maintained insurance coverage on its U.S domestic oil and gas properties for several years. The Company is not
	in compliance with Federal and State laws regarding the U.S. domestic oil and gas properties. The Company’s known compliance
	issues relate to the Texas Railroad Commission regarding administrative filings and renewal permits relative to its Texas oil
	and gas properties that were sold in 2012. The ultimate resolution of these compliance issues could have a material adverse impact
	on the Company’s financial statements.




	 






	Nicaraguan
	Concessions






	 




	In
	April 2011, we filed with the Nicaraguan government an Environmental Impact Assessment (“EIA”) covering proposed seismic
	activities on our Nicaraguan Concessions. The filing of the EIA was followed by a comment period during which there was interaction
	between us the Ministerio del Ambiente y los Recursos Naturales de Nicaragua, an agency of the Nicaraguan government; and the
	autonomous regions of Nicaragua that are nearest to the Nicaraguan Concessions. In April 2013 the EIA was formally approved by
	the Nicaraguan government and we were cleared to commence 2-D and 3-D seismic mapping activities in the area. In late 2013 and
	early 2014, we contracted with a fully integrated Geoscience company that provides geological, geophysical and reservoir services
	to the global oil and gas industry, to conduct 2-D and 3-D seismic data covering selected areas within the boundaries of the Nicaraguan
	Concessions.




	 




	The
	final approval of the EIA by the Nicaraguan government of our environment impact study on April 13, 2013, began Sub-Period 2 for
	both the Tyra and Perlas Blocks as defined in the Nicaraguan Concessions. The Company believes it has satisfied the acquisition,
	processing and interpretation of Seismic data required in Sub-Period 2 for both the Perlas and Tyra Blocks. Therefore, it is now
	in Sub-Period 3 of the exploration phase of the 30-year Concession for both Perlas and Tyra as of June 30, 2015. Sub-Period 3
	of the Nicaraguan Concessions requires the drilling of at least one exploratory well on the Perlas Block during 2016 and the shooting
	of additional seismic on the Tyra Block. The Company is in process of identifying at least one potential drilling site on the
	Perlas block as required in Sub-Period 3 and will have to perform supplemental EIA work prior to requesting and receiving the
	permit to drill from the Nicaraguan government. The work plan on the Tyra block for Sub-Period 3 requires the Company to shoot
	additional seismic, which is estimated to cost approximately $2,500,000 prior to the commencement of exploratory drilling. The
	Company is negotiating with the Nicaraguan government to seek a waiver of the additional seismic mapping on the Tyra Block so
	that it can proceed with exploratory drilling. There can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain such waiver of the requirement.




	 








	22










	 







	 




	During
	late December 2013, we completed the 2-D seismic survey activities in the area as required under both of the Nicaraguan Concessions
	at that point. We believe that the newly acquired 2-D seismic data, together with the previously acquired reprocessed 2-D seismic,
	has helped us further evaluate the structures that were previously identified with 2-D seismic in the Eocene Zone. Our geological
	consultants have estimated that these Eocene structures may contain recoverable hydrocarbons (principally oil) in place. In addition,
	the new 2-D seismic acquired in 2013 provided our first geological information regarding the potential for oil resources in the
	Cretaceous Zone, which we could not evaluate using less precise older 2-D seismic mapping. We have identified multiple promising
	sites on the Perlas Block for exploratory drilling and are planning the drilling of initial exploratory wells in order to determine
	the existence of commercial hydrocarbon reserves, given sufficient financing. We believe that we have performed all work necessary
	as of June 30, 2015 to proceed to Sub-Period 3 for the Perlas Block as defined in the Nicaraguan Concessions, which requires the
	drilling of at least one exploratory well on the Perlas Block within the following one-year period. We must first prepare and
	submit a supplemental EIA to the Nicaraguan government before the drilling permit can be issued on the Perlas Block, which had
	not been completed as of March 31, 2016.




	 




	The
	Company has not yet submitted the EIA supplement to the Nicaraguan Government and therefore has not received a drilling permit;
	however, assuming that Government does accept the supplemental EIA and grant the drilling permit, the Company will be required
	to drill at least one exploratory well on the Perlas Block during 2016 or risk being in default and losing our rights under the
	Nicaraguan Concessions.




	 




	The
	Company is in technical default of the Nicaraguan Concession because it has not provided the required letters of credit to the
	Nicaraguan Government. In accordance with the Nicaraguan Concession agreements, the Company had previously provided the Ministry
	of Energy with the required letters of credit in the amounts of $443,100 for Perlas (expired March 2014) and $408,450 for Tyra
	(expired September 2014). The Company had also made all required expenditures related to the Nicaraguan Concessions for training
	programs and as “area fees,” for each respective year for 2010 through 2015. The Company is attempting to negotiate
	the renewal and increase of the required letters of credit which total $1,356,227 for the Perlas block and $278,450 for the Tyra
	block with the Nicaraguan Government and its lenders; however, there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in
	the regard. The Company considers it is fully in compliance with the terms of the Nicaraguan Concessions agreements, except for
	the renewal of the expired letters of credit.




	 




	The
	Company must raise substantial amounts of debt and equity capital in the immediate future in order to fund: (1) the required letters
	of credit to the Nicaraguan Government; (2) the drilling of at least one exploratory well on the Perlas Block of the Nicaraguan
	Concessions during 2016; (3) the shooting of additional seismic on the Tyra Block of the Nicaraguan Concessions if it is unable
	to negotiate a waiver of such requirement from the Nicaraguan government; (4) the payment of normal day-to-day operations and
	corporate overhead; and (5) the payment of outstanding debt and financial obligations as they become due. These are substantial
	operational and financial issues that must be successfully mitigated during 2016 or the Company’s ability to satisfy the
	conditions necessary to maintain its Nicaragua Concessions will be in significant doubt. The Company completed the May 2015 Private
	Placement in May 2015 in an effort to obtain its required capital. See Note 2 to the Financial Statements.




	 




	The
	Company is also seeking offers from industry operators and other third parties for interests in the acreage in the Nicaraguan
	Concessions in exchange for cash and a carried interest in exploration and development operations or other joint venture arrangement.
	Accordingly, it intends to finance our business strategy through external financing, which may include debt and equity capital
	raised in public and private offerings, joint ventures, sale of working or other interests, employment of working capital and
	cash flow from operations, if any, and net proceeds from the sales of assets.

	Revenue
	Sharing Commitments






	 




	On
	March 23, 2009, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement, dated effective as of March 23, 2009, with Off-Shore,
	an accredited investor, to issue a subordinated promissory note in the aggregate principal amount of up to $1,275,000 and a one
	percent (1%) revenue sharing interest in the Nicaraguan Concessions. Off-Shore funded a total of $1,275,000 and subsequently converted
	the subordinated promissory note to common stock.




	 








	24










	 







	 




	Under
	the Revenue Sharing Agreement (the “Revenue Agreement”), Infinity assigned to Off-Shore a monthly payment (the “RSP”)
	equal to the revenue derived from one percent (1%) of Infinity’s share of the hydrocarbons produced at the wellhead from
	the Nicaraguan Concessions. The RSP will bear its proportionate share of all costs incurred to deliver the hydrocarbons to the
	point of sale to an unaffiliated purchaser, including its share of production, severance and similar taxes, and certain additional
	costs. The RSP will be paid to Off-Shore by the last day of each month based on the revenue received by Infinity from the purchaser
	of the production during the previous month from the Nicaraguan Concessions. The Revenue Agreement does not create any obligation
	for Infinity to maintain or develop the Nicaraguan Concessions, and does not create any rights in the Nicaraguan Concessions for
	Off-Shore. In connection with its dissolution Off-Shore assigned its RSP to its individual members.




	 




	On
	June 6, 2009 the Company entered into a Revenue Sharing Agreement with the officers and directors for services provided. Infinity
	assigned to officers and directors a monthly payment equal to the revenue derived from one percent (1%) of Infinity’s share
	of the hydrocarbons produced at the wellhead from the Nicaraguan Concessions. The RSP will bear its proportionate share of all
	costs incurred to deliver the hydrocarbons to the point of sale to an unaffiliated purchaser, including its share of production,
	severance and similar taxes, and certain additional costs.




	 




	The
	RSP shall be paid by the last day of each month based on the revenue received by Infinity from the purchaser of the production
	during the previous month from the Nicaraguan Concessions. The Revenue Agreement does not create any obligation for Infinity to
	maintain or develop the Nicaraguan Concessions, and does not create any rights in the Nicaraguan Concessions for officers and
	directors.




	 




	The
	Company intends to seek joint venture or working interest partners (the “Farmout”) prior to the commencement of any
	exploratory drilling operations on the Nicaraguan Concessions. On September 8, 2009 the Company entered into a Revenue Sharing
	Agreement with Jeff Roberts to assist the Company with its technical studies of gas and oil holdings in Nicaragua and managing
	and assisting in the Farmout. Infinity assigned to Jeff Roberts a monthly payment equal to the revenue derived from one percent
	(1%) of Infinity’s share of the hydrocarbons produced at the wellhead from the Nicaraguan Concessions. The RSP will bear
	its proportionate share of all costs incurred to deliver the hydrocarbons to the point of sale to an unaffiliated purchaser, including
	its share of production, severance and similar taxes, and certain additional costs. The RSP shall be paid to Jeff Roberts by the
	last day of each month based on the revenue received by Infinity from the purchaser of the production during the previous month
	from the Nicaraguan Concessions. The Revenue Agreement does not create any obligation for Infinity to maintain or develop the
	Nicaraguan Concessions, and does not create any rights in the Nicaraguan Concessions for Jeff Roberts.




	 




	In
	connection with the extension of the December 2013 Note with a $1,050,000 principal balance issued in December 2013, the Company
	entered into a Revenue Sharing Agreement in May 2014. Infinity assigned to the note holder a monthly payment equal to the revenue
	derived from one percent (1%) of 8/8ths of Infinity’s share of the hydrocarbons produced at the wellhead from the Nicaraguan
	Concessions and any other oil and gas concessions that the Company and its affiliates may acquire in the future. The RSP will
	bear its proportionate share of all costs incurred to deliver the hydrocarbons to the point of sale to an unaffiliated purchaser,
	including its share of production, severance and similar taxes, and certain additional costs. The RSP shall be paid by the last
	day of each month based on the revenue received by Infinity from the purchaser of the production during the previous month from
	the Nicaraguan Concessions. The Revenue Sharing Agreement does not create any obligation for Infinity to maintain or develop the
	Nicaraguan Concessions.




	 






	Letter
	of Intent to enter Exploration Services Agreement






	 




	On
	October 13, 2014 the Company announced that it had entered into a Letter of Intent (“LOI”) with Granada Exploration,
	LLC, which has agreed to join with the Company to explore for potential hydrocarbons beneath Infinity’s 1.4 million-acre
	oil and gas concessions in the Caribbean Sea offshore Nicaragua. Under the terms of the LOI, Granada Exploration will provide
	its services in exchange for a working interest in the Nicaraguan Concessions. The scope of such services will be more specifically
	described in a mutually acceptable Exploration Services Agreement (“ESA”), which is currently being negotiated. The
	ESA is anticipated to provide that Granada will earn an assignment from Infinity of an undivided 30% working interest in the Concessions,
	based on an 80% net revenue interest. Granada and Infinity are also anticipated to enter into a Joint Operating Agreement. Granada
	may, at its discretion, participate in an initial exploratory well for up to an additional undivided 20% working interest, on
	a prospect-by-prospect basis, with such additional interest to be based on an 80% net revenue interest.




	 








	25










	 







	 




	The
	LOI is subject to Granada’s normal and customary due diligence, including the evaluation of the Company’s Form 10-K
	and 10-Q filings, documents showing that the Company is in good standing regarding the Nicaraguan Concessions and with the Nicaraguan
	government; negotiation and approval of mutually acceptable formal agreements; and final approval by a majority of the partners
	that comprise Granada Exploration, LLC. The parties continue to negotiate the terms of the ESA, but have not entered into definitive
	agreements. Granada has not completed its normal and customary due diligence with progress being delayed due to the current environment
	affecting oil and gas exploration projects and uncertainties involving the status of the Nicaraguan Concessions.




	 






	Lack
	of Compliance with Law Regarding Domestic Properties






	 




	Infinity
	has not been in compliance with existing federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations for its previously owned domestic
	oil and gas properties and this could have a material or significantly adverse effect upon the liquidity, capital expenditures,
	earnings or competitive position of Infinity. All domestic oil and gas properties held by Infinity – Wyoming and Infinity-Texas
	were disposed of prior to March 31, 2016; however, the Company may remain liable for certain asset retirement costs should the
	new owners not complete their obligations. Management believes the total asset retirement obligations recorded of $1,716,003 as
	of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are sufficient to cover any potential noncompliance liabilities relative to the to the
	plugging of abandoned wells, the removal of facilities and equipment, and site restoration on oil and gas properties for its former
	oil and gas properties. The Company has not maintained insurance on the domestic properties for a number of years nor has it owned/produced
	any oil & gas properties for a number of years.




	 






	Litigation






	 




	The
	Company is subject to numerous claims and legal actions in which vendors are claiming breach of contract due to the Company’s
	failure to pay amounts due. The Company believes that it has made adequate provision for these claims in the accompanying financial
	statements.




	 




	The
	Company is currently involved in litigation as follows:




	 






	●




	In
	October 2012 the State of Texas filed a lawsuit naming Infinity-Texas, the Company and the corporate officers of Infinity-Texas,
	seeking $30,000 of reclamation costs associated with a single well, in addition to administrative expenses and penalties.
	The Company engaged in negotiations with the State of Texas in late 2012 and early 2013 and reached a settlement agreement
	that would reduce the aggregate liability, in this action and any extension of this to other Texas wells, to $45,103, which
	amount has been paid. Certain performance obligations remain which must be satisfied in order to finally settle and dismiss
	the matter.






	 




	 






	 




	Pending
	satisfactory performance of the performance obligations and their acceptance by the State of Texas, the officers have potential
	liability regarding the above matter, and the officers are held personally harmless by indemnification provisions of the Company.
	Therefore, to the extent they might actually occur, these liabilities are the obligations of the Company. Management estimates
	that the liabilities associated with this matter will not exceed $780,000, calculated as $30,000 for each of the 26 Infinity-Texas
	operated wells. This related liability, less the payment made to the State of Texas in 2012 in the amount of $45,103, is included
	in the asset retirement obligation on the accompanying balance sheets.






	 




	 






	●




	Cambrian
	Consultants America, Inc. (“Cambrian”) filed an action in the District Court of Harris County, Texas, number CV2014-55719,
	on September 26, 2014 against Infinity Energy Resources, Inc. resulting from certain professional consulting services provided
	for quality control and management of seismic operations during November and December 2013 on the Nicaraguan Concessions.
	Cambrian provided these services pursuant to a Master Consulting Agreement with Infinity, dated November 20, 2013, and has
	claimed breach of contract for failure to pay amounts due. On December 8, 2014, a default judgment was entered against the
	Company in the amount of $96,877 plus interest and attorney fees. The Company has included the impact of this litigation as
	a liability in its accounts payable. The Company will seek to settle the default judgment when it has the financial resources
	to do so.

	Torrey
	Hills Capital, Inc. (“Torrey”) notified the Company by letter, dated August 15, 2014, of its demand for the payment
	of $56,000, which it alleged was unpaid and owed under a consulting agreement, dated October 18, 2013. The parties entered
	into a consulting agreement under which Torrey agreed to provide investor relations services in exchange for payment of $7,000
	per month and the issuance of 15,000 shares of common stock. The agreement was for an initial three month-term with automatic
	renewals unless terminated upon 30 days’ written notice by either party. The Company made payments totaling $14,000
	and issued 15,000 shares of common stock during 2013. The Company contends that Torrey breached the agreement by not performing
	the required services and that it had provided proper notice of termination to Torrey. Furthermore, the Company contends that
	the parties agreed to settle the dispute on or about June 19, 2014 under which it would issue 2,800 shares of common stock
	in full settlement of any balance then owed and final termination of the agreement. Torrey disputed the Company’s contentions
	and submitted the dispute to binding arbitration. The Company was unable to defend itself and the arbitration panel awarded
	Torrey a total of $79,594 in damages. The Company has accrued amounts in accounts payable as of March 31, 2016 and December
	31, 2015, which management believes is sufficient to provide for the ultimate resolution of this dispute.






	 





	Note
	10 – Related Party Transactions





	 




	The
	Company does not have any employees other than the CEO and CFO. In previous years, certain general and administrative services
	(for which payment is deferred) had been provided by the CFO’s accounting firm at its standard billing rates plus out-of-pocket
	expenses consisting primarily of accounting, tax and other administrative fees. The Company no longer utilizes the CFO’s
	accounting for such support services and was not billed for any such services during the three months ended March 31, 2016 and
	2015. The amount due to the CFO’s firm for services previously provided was $762,407 at March 31, 2016 and December 31,
	2015, and is included in accrued liabilities at both dates.




	 




	On
	June 6, 2009 the Company entered into a Revenue Sharing Agreement with the officers and directors for services provided. Infinity
	assigned to officers and directors a monthly payment equal to the revenue derived from one percent (1%) of Infinity’s share
	of the hydrocarbons produced at the wellhead from the Nicaraguan Concessions. The RSP will bear its proportionate share of all
	costs incurred to deliver the hydrocarbons to the point of sale to an unaffiliated purchaser, including its share of production,
	severance and similar taxes, and certain additional costs. The RSP shall be paid by the last day of each month based on the revenue
	received by Infinity from the purchaser of the production during the previous month from the Nicaraguan Concessions. The Revenue
	Agreement does not create any obligation for Infinity to maintain or develop the Nicaraguan Concessions and does not create any
	rights in the Nicaraguan Concessions for officers and directors.




	 




	In
	connection with its subordinated loan, Offshore Finance, LLC was granted a one percent (1%) revenue sharing interest in the Nicaraguan
	Concessions in connection with a subordinated loan provided previously which was subsequently converted to common stock. The managing
	partner of Offshore and the Company’s CFO are partners in the accounting firm which the Company used for general corporate
	purposes in the past. In connection with its dissolution, Offshore assigned its RSP to its individual members, which includes
	the former managing partner of Offshore.




	 




	As
	of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had accrued compensation to its officers and directors of $1,482,208 and
	$1,423,208, respectively.




	 




	The
	Company entered into a line-of-credit facility on September 23, 2013 that provides it with borrowing capacity on a revolving basis
	up to a maximum of $50,000, which was increased to $75,000 at August 28, 2015 and an initial maturity of November 28, 2013. The
	line of credit is convertible to common stock at a rate of $5.00 per share. The entity providing the credit facility is owned
	by an officer of another corporation for which Infinity’s president and chairman of the board serves as president and chairman
	of the board. The facility is unsecured, bears interest at 8% per annum, and was renewed at its maturity several times with its
	current maturity date as May 28, 2016. In consideration for the origination of the line of credit facility and the various renewals,
	the Company granted the lender common stock purchase warrants. On February 28, 2016 the Company extended the line-of-credit expiration
	date to May 28, 2016 and issued a warrant to purchase 10,000 common shares at an exercise price of $5.00 per share, which warrants
	were immediately exercisable and expire on February 28, 2021. The Company estimated the fair value of the warrants at $774 as
	of the grant date, which amount was recorded as debt issuance costs and will be amortized to interest expense over the extended
	term of the line-of-credit.

	Note

	–

	Subsequent Events





	 




	From
	April 1, 2016 through May 13, 2016, the Company issued a total of 1,507,970 shares of common stock to the holder of the senior
	convertible note payable in the form of principal payments aggregating $83,040 and related accrued interest. See Note 2

	–
	Senior Convertible Note Payable.





	 




	The
	Company has not resolved the contingency related to the expired letters of credit for its Nicaraguan concessions (See Note 9).
	The Company continues to negotiate the renewal of the letters of credit with the Nicaraguan Government and its lenders; however,
	there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in that regard.




	 




	During
	May 2016, the Company extended the maturity date of two promissory notes with principal balances totaling $85,000. The new maturity
	dates are August 7, 2016 and August 15, 2016. In connection with the extension of the maturity date of these notes Company issued
	the lenders warrants to purchase a total of 8,500 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $5.60 per share which are immediately
	exercisable and expire in five years.




	 




	On
	December 27, 2013 the Company borrowed $1,050,000 under an unsecured credit facility with a private, third-party lender which
	has an outstanding principal balance of $1,000,000. The facility is represented by a promissory note (the “Note”).
	Effective April 7, 2016 the Company and the lender have agreed in principal to extend the maturity date of the Note from April
	7, 2016 to the earlier of (i) April 7, 2017 or (ii) the payment in full of the Investor Note issued to the Company by Hudson Bay
	Master Fund, Ltd. in the principal amount of $9,490,000 (the “New Maturity Date”). All other terms of the Note are
	expected to remain the same.




	 




	The
	Note may be prepaid without penalty at any time. The Note is subordinated to all existing and future senior indebtedness, as such
	terms are defined in the Note.




	 




	In
	connection with the proposed extension of the maturity date of the Note to the New Maturity Date, the Company (i) will issue to
	the lender 20,000 shares of restricted common stock; and (ii) agreed to pay $50,000 toward amounts due under the Note as soon
	as sufficient funds are available to do so. The Company will issue no additional warrants to the lender in connection with the
	proposed extension of the Note to the New Maturity Date. If the Company fails to pay the Note on or before its New Maturity Date,
	the number of shares issuable under the Warrant increases to 1,333,333 and the exercise price drops to $0.75 per share. All other
	terms of the warrant are expected to remain the same.




	 




	The
	parties are negotiating and finalizing the documents relative to this proposed extension, therefore the terms may change as and
	when such documents are finalized and executed. However, there can be no assurance that such extension will be completed or that
	the current agreed terms will be the finalized terms of such extension.

	–

	Restatement to previously issued interim financial statements





	 




	Subsequent
	to the issuance of the March 31, 2016 interim financial statements, management determined that the Company should obtain court
	approval before derecognizing liabilities due to the expiration of their respective statute of limitations. The Company had previously
	derecognized liabilities during the quarter ended March 31, 2016 which resulted in other income totaling $1,134,082. This amount
	was reversed in the fourth quarter of 2016 which only affected the interim financial statements previously issued during 2016.
	As a result, the interim financial statements previously issued for the quarter ended March 31, 2016, were restated.

	MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS







	 





	FORWARD-LOOKING
	STATEMENTS





	 




	This
	quarterly report on Form 10-Q contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities
	Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which are intended to be covered
	by the safe harbors created thereby. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as “may,”
	“should,” “expects,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,”
	“predicts,” “potential,” “continue,” “intends,” and other variations of these
	words or comparable words. In addition, any statements that refer to expectations, projections or other characterizations of events,
	circumstances or trends and that do not relate to historical matters are forward-looking statements. To the extent that there
	are statements that are not recitations of historical fact, such statements constitute forward-looking statements that, by definition,
	involve risks and uncertainties. In any forward-looking statement, where we express an expectation or belief as to future results
	or events, such expectation or belief is expressed in good faith and believed to have a reasonable basis, but there can be no
	assurance that the statement of expectation or belief will be achieved or accomplished. The actual results or events may differ
	materially from those anticipated and as reflected in forward-looking statements included herein. Factors that may cause actual
	results or events to differ from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements included herein include the risk factors
	described below.




	 




	Although
	we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results,
	levels of activity, performance or achievements. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which
	speak only as of the date of this report. Except as required by law, we do not undertake to update or revise any of the forward-looking
	statements to conform these statements to actual results, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.




	 




	Readers
	are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements contained herein, which speak only as of the date
	hereof. We believe the information contained in this report to be accurate as of the date hereof. Changes may occur after that
	date, and we will not update that information except as required by law.




	 




	Factors
	that could cause or contribute to our actual results differing materially from those discussed herein or for our stock price to
	be adversely affected include, but are not limited to: (i) we have a history of losses and are experiencing substantial liquidity
	problems; (ii) we have substantial obligations to a number of third parties, including our December 2013 in the original principal
	amount of $1,050,000 due in April 2016 and the $12.0 million Convertible Note due May 2018, which began amortizing in October
	2015, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet them; (iii) we require working capital for our operations and
	obligations for the next 12 months and capital to continue our exploration and development efforts on the Nicaraguan Concessions,
	including compliance with the letter of credit and other requirements of the Nicaraguan Concessions to maintain our rights under
	the applicable agreements, and there can be no assurances we will be able to obtain it or do so on terms favorable to us; (iv)
	we and our independent registered public accounting firm have concluded that there exists substantial doubt about our ability
	to continue as a going concern; (v) our Nicaraguan Concessions and planned future exploration activities are in a country with
	a developing economy and are subject to the risks of political and economic instability associated with such economies; (vi) exploration
	and development of our Nicaraguan Concessions will require large amounts of capital or a commercial relationship with an industry
	operator which we may not be able to obtain; (vii) we may not have sufficient resources to conduct required seismic mapping on
	our Nicaraguan Concessions; (viii) the oil and gas exploration business involves a high degree of business and financial risk;
	(ix) we will be subject to regulations affecting our activities with the Nicaraguan Concessions; (x) our operations may be adversely
	affected by changes in the fiscal regime of Nicaragua; (xi) we are continuing to negotiate with our creditors and may face additional
	claims in the future; (xii) oil prices may be affected by regional factors; (xiii) any future production will be contingent on
	successful exploration, development and acquisitions to establish reserves and revenue in the future; (xv) the oil and gas industry
	is highly competitive; (xvi) exploratory drilling is an uncertain process with many risks; (xvii) oil and gas prices are volatile,
	and declines in prices would hurt our revenues and ability to achieve profitable operations; (xviii) our common stock is traded
	on the Pink Sheets, which may not have the visibility or liquidity that we seek for our common stock; (xix) we depend on key personnel;
	(xx) sufficient voting power by coalitions of a few of our larger stockholders to make corporate governance decisions that could
	have significant effect on us and the other stockholders, including Amegy Bank, NA; (xxi) sale of substantial amounts of our common
	stock that may have a depressive effect on the market price of the outstanding shares of our common stock, including sales of
	shares of common stock issued to the holder of the Convertible Note upon its conversion of portions of the outstanding principal
	amount of the Convertible Note; (xxii) possible issuance of common stock subject to options and warrants may dilute the interest
	of stockholders; (xxiii) our ability to comply with Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 Section 404 as it may be required; (xxiv) our nonpayment
	of dividends and lack of plans to pay dividends in the future; (xxv) future sale or issuance of a substantial number of shares
	of our common stock that could depress the trading price of our common stock, lower our value and make it more difficult for us
	to raise capital; (xxvi) our additional securities available for issuance, which, if issued, could adversely affect the rights
	of the holders of our common stock; (xxvii) our stock price is likely to be highly volatile due to a number of factors, including
	a relatively limited public float; (xxviii) indemnification of our officers and directors; and (xxix) whether we will be able
	to find an industry or other financial partner to enable us to explore and develop our Nicaraguan Concessions.




	 




	The
	following information should be read in conjunction with the Condensed Financial Statements and Notes presented elsewhere in this
	quarterly report on Form 10-Q. See Note 1 –

	“Nature of Operations, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant
	Accounting Policies,”

	2016
	Operational and Financial Objectives





	 





	Corporate
	Activities





	 




	We
	hold a 100% working interest in any hydrocarbon deposits found under the Perlas Block (560,000 acres/2,268 km) and Tyra Block
	(826,000 acres/3,342 km) located in shallow waters offshore Nicaragua. The final approval of the EIA by the Nicaraguan government
	of our environment impact study on April 13, 2013, began Sub-Period 2 for both the Tyra and Perlas Blocks as defined in the Nicaraguan
	Concessions. We believe we have satisfied the acquisition, processing and interpretation of Seismic data required in Sub-Period
	2 for both the Perlas and Tyra Blocks. Therefore, we are now in Sub-Period 3 of the exploration phase of the 30-year Concession
	for both Perlas and Tyra as of December 31, 2015. Sub-Period 3 of the Nicaraguan Concessions requires the drilling of at least
	one exploratory well on the Perlas Block during 2016 and the shooting of additional seismic on the Tyra Block. We are in process
	of identifying at least one potential drilling site on the Perlas block as required in Sub-Period 3 and will have to perform supplemental
	EIA work prior to requesting and receiving the permit to drill from the Nicaraguan government. The work plan on the Tyra block
	for Sub-Period 3 requires us to shoot additional seismic, which is estimated to cost approximately $2,500,000 prior to the commencement
	of exploratory drilling. We are negotiating with the Nicaraguan government to seek a waiver of such additional seismic mapping
	on the Tyra Block so that we can proceed with exploratory drilling. There can be no assurance whether we will be able to obtain
	such waiver of the requirement.




	 




	During
	late December 2013, we completed the 2-D seismic survey activities in the area as required under both of the Nicaraguan Concessions
	at that point. We believe that the newly acquired 2-D seismic data, together with the previously acquired reprocessed 2-D seismic,
	helped us to further evaluate the structures that were previously identified with 2-D seismic in the Eocene Zone. Our geological
	consultants have estimated that these Eocene structures may contain recoverable hydrocarbons (principally oil) in place. In addition,
	the new 2-D seismic acquired in 2013 provided our first geological information regarding the potential for oil resources in the
	Cretaceous Zone, which we could not evaluate using less precise older 2-D seismic mapping. We have identified multiple promising
	sites on the Perlas Block for exploratory drilling and are planning the drilling of initial exploratory wells in order to determine
	the existence of commercial hydrocarbon reserves, given sufficient capital. We believe that we have performed all work necessary
	as of December 31, 2015 to proceed to Sub-Period 3 for the Perlas Block as defined in the Nicaraguan Concessions, which requires
	the drilling of at least one exploratory well on the Perlas concession within the following one-year period. We must first prepare
	and submit a supplemental EIA to the Nicaraguan government before the drilling permit can be issued on the Perlas Block.




	 




	We
	must prepare and submit the EIA supplement to the Nicaraguan Government, assuming that it does accept the supplemental EIA and
	grant the drilling permit, we will be required to drill at least one exploratory well on the Perlas Block during 2016 or risk
	being in default and losing our rights under the Nicaraguan Concessions. We do not believe that we will drill a well on the Nicaraguan
	Concessions during 2016 given the current state of the oil and gas commodity markets, financing the drilling, and the challenging
	economics for any new exploration and development project, especially a project in an area of the world without historical proven
	reserves of commercial hydrocarbons. We believe that we will be able to negotiate extensions with the Nicaraguan government of
	the required date by which an exploratory well must be drilled; however, there can be no assurance in this regard.




	 




	The
	Company is in technical default of the Nicaraguan Concession because it has not provided the required letters of credit to the
	Nicaraguan Government. In accordance with the Nicaraguan Concession agreements, the Company had previously provided the Ministry
	of Energy with the required letters of credit in the amounts of $443,100 for Perlas (expired March 2014) and $408,450 for Tyra
	(expired September 2014). The Company had also made all required expenditures related to the Nicaraguan Concessions for training
	programs and as “area fees,” for each respective year for 2010 through 2015. The Company is currently negotiating
	the renewal and increase of the required letters of credit which total $1,356,227 for the Perlas block and $278,450 for the Tyra
	block with the Nicaraguan Government and its lenders; however, there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in
	the regard. The Company considers it is fully in compliance with the terms of the Nicaraguan Concessions agreements, except for
	the renewal of the expired letters of credit. The foregoing items remain as substantial operational and legal issues that we must
	resolve in order to maintain our rights under the Nicaraguan Concessions during 2016.

	We
	are also seeking offers from industry operators and other third parties for interests in the acreage in the Nicaraguan Concessions
	in exchange for cash and a carried interest in exploration and development operations or other joint venture arrangement. Accordingly,
	we intend to finance our business strategy through external financing, which may include debt and equity capital raised in public
	and private offerings, joint ventures, sale of working or other interests, employment of working capital and cash flow from operations,
	if any, and net proceeds from the sales of assets.




	 




	Our
	ability to complete these activities is dependent on a number of factors, including, but not limited to:




	 






	 




	●




	The
	availability of the capital resources required to fund the activities;






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	The
	availability of third party contractors for completion services; and






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	The
	approval by regulatory agencies of applications for permits to conduct exploration activities in a timely manner.






	 




	The
	Company is considering the acquisition of domestic oil and gas properties with both proven and unproven reserves. Management believes
	that the current distressed state for oil and gas properties and the resulting decline in valuations may yield an opportunity
	for the Company to accumulate undervalued oil and gas assets which will produce positive cash flows even with the decline in natural
	gas and crude oil commodity prices. Management believes that there may be financing available for such cash generating oil and
	gas properties at reasonable cost of capital especially when compared to the Nicaraguan Concessions which may yield higher returns
	but at higher risk levels. This initiative may provide the Company with positive cash flows to address immediate working capital
	needs while the environment improves for exploration projects such as the Nicaraguan Concessions, although no assurances can be
	given in this regard.




	 





	Off-Balance
	Sheet Arrangements





	 




	We
	do not have any off-balance sheet debt nor did we have any transactions, arrangements, obligations (including contingent obligations)
	or other relationships with any unconsolidated entities or other persons that may have material current or future effect on financial
	conditions, changes in the financial conditions, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, capital resources, or
	significant components of revenue or expenses.




	 






	For
	the Three Months Ended March 31, 2016 and 2015






	 





	Results
	of Operations, As restated





	 





	Revenue





	 




	The
	Company had no revenues in either 2016 or 2015 as it focused solely on the exploration, development, financing and maintenance
	of the Nicaraguan Concessions.




	 





	Production
	and Other Operating Expenses (income)





	 




	The
	Company had no production related operating expenses in either 2016 or 2015. The Company sold its investment in Infinity-Texas
	in July 2012 and held no developed or undeveloped oil and gas properties in the United States in 2016 and 2015.




	 




	The
	Company has no current or planned domestic exploration and development activities at this time. It is not actively working on
	any domestic property, focusing instead on the exploration, development and financing of the Nicaraguan Concessions.




	 





	Stock-based
	compensation





	 




	Stock-based
	compensation expenses of $7,598 for the three months ended March 31, 2016 decreased $58,360 or 87.0% from the same period
	in 2015. The Company has had minimal resources to pay employees, consultants and other service providers. Therefore, it has issued
	stock options to compensate and motivate its officers, directors and other service providers in previous years that vest generally
	over a two year time period. The Company did not grant any stock options during 2016 and 2015. The significant decrease in stock-based
	compensation expense during 2016 compared to 2015 is attributable to the full vesting of the January 2014 stock option grant in
	January 2016, which reduced the related amortization during the three months ended March 31, 2016 compared to 2015. All outstanding
	stock options are fully vested as of March 31, 2016.




	 








	32










	 







	 





	General
	and Administrative Expenses





	 




	General
	and administrative expenses of $82,570 for the three months ended March 31, 2016 decreased $23,299, or 22.0%, from $105,869 in
	the same period in 2015. The decrease in general and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to a decrease of $19,326
	in Delaware annual report and franchise taxes for 2016 compared to 2015. The Delaware tax is based on our total assets which decreased
	substantially due to the impairment of our Nicaraguan oil and gas properties during 2015. The decrease was also attributable to
	an overall decrease in professional fees of $4,725 as the Company engaged in fewer legal activities during the three months ended
	March 31, 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to the change in our stock transfer agent in early 2015 for cost containment purposes.
	Reductions in general and administrative expenses were also attributable to us attending fewer investor conferences or similar
	forums during the three months ended March 31, 2016 compared to 2015, which decreased such expenses by $12,004. The closing of
	the May 2015 Private Placement reduced the need to incur additional costs related to capital raising and investor relations activities
	during the 2016 period coupled with the poor investment climate for oil and gas companies during 2016 and 2015.




	 





	Interest
	expense





	 




	Interest
	expense decreased from $573,083 for the three months ended March 31, 2015 to $78,170 for the 2016 period. This significant decrease
	is attributable to the Company converting approximately $555,000 of its interest bearing debt to common stock during early 2015.
	The Company received loan proceeds of $450,000 from the senior convertible note issued in May 2015 and $85,000 from two other
	convertible notes issued in July 2015, all of which bear interest at 8% and remained outstanding at March 31, 2016. In previous
	years the Company issued short-term notes payable at various dates and extended their maturities by paying additional compensation
	to the lenders chiefly in the form of warrants. The fair value of the warrants issued to the note holders at the origination and
	extension dates of the short-term promissory notes was recorded as a discount on the related debt. Amortization of the value of
	the warrants and revenue sharing interests granted to the holders resulted in a substantial increase in the overall effective
	borrowing costs during the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2016. Discount amortization represents
	a non-cash expense and totaled $49,053 and $523,784 of total interest expense recognized in the three months ended March 31, 2016
	and 2015, respectively.




	 




	The
	Company’s current financial condition has made traditional bank loans and customary financing terms unattainable; therefore,
	the Company may find it necessary to continue with these types of short-term borrowings with high effective interest rates.




	 








	33










	 







	 





	Change
	in Derivative Fair Value





	 




	The
	conversion feature of the promissory notes and the common stock purchase warrants issued in connection with short-term notes and
	the senior convertible note outstanding during 2016 and 2015 are treated as derivative instruments because the promissory notes
	and warrants contain ratchet and anti-dilution provisions. Accordingly, we adjusted the value of the outstanding derivative liabilities
	to their estimated fair value as of March 31, 2016 and 2015. The mark-to-market process resulted in a gain of $118,511 during
	the three months ended March 31, 2016 and a gain of $265,267 during the three months ended March 31, 2015. The decrease in the
	gain recognized is primarily the result of the lesser reduction in the closing market price of our common stock between the December
	31, 2015 ($0.16 per share) and March 31, 2016 ($0.08 per share) compared to the corresponding period in 2015. Generally, the fair
	value of the derivative liability declines when the market value of the underlying common stock decreases compared to the derivatives
	exercise price.




	 





	Change
	in Fair Value of Convertible Note





	 




	We
	issued the Senior Secured Convertible Note in the May 2015 Private Placement and elected to account for and record such Note on
	a fair value basis. We received $450,000 of proceeds at the date of issuance and the fair market value of the Senior Convertible
	Convertible Note was estimated to be $265,929 as of December 31, 2015 and $247,135 at March 31, 2016. After considering principal
	repayments and additional funding received the net $53,206 change in fair market value of such Note is included in the accompanying
	statement of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2016. No similar notes were outstanding during 2015.




	 





	Income
	Tax





	 




	For
	income tax purposes, the Company has net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately $67,415,000 as of December 31, 2015, which
	expire from 2025 through 2030. The Company has provided a 100% valuation allowance against the resulting deferred tax asset due
	to the uncertainty of realizing the tax benefits from its net operating loss carry-forwards.




	 




	For
	the three months ended March 31, 2016, the Company realized net losses. The Company anticipates operating losses and additional
	tax losses for the foreseeable future and does not believe that utilization of its tax loss carryforward is more likely than not.
	Therefore, because of the uncertainty as to the ultimate utilization of the Company’s loss carryforwards, any deferred tax
	asset at March 31, 2016 that resulted from anticipated benefit from future utilization of such carryforward has been fully offset
	by a valuation allowance.




	 








	34










	 







	 





	Net
	loss





	 




	As
	a result of the above, we reported a net loss of $103,033 for the three months ended March 31, 2016 compared
	to a net loss of $301,028 for the three months ended March 31, 2015.


	This
	represents an improvement of $197,995 (65.8%).




	 





	Basic
	and Diluted Loss per Share





	 




	Basic
	net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the
	period. Diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common shareholders by the weighted-average
	number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Common share equivalents included in the diluted
	computation represent shares issuable upon assumed exercise of stock options and warrants using the treasury stock and “if
	converted” method. For periods in which net losses from continuing operations are incurred, weighted average shares outstanding
	is the same for basic and diluted loss per share calculations, as the inclusion of common share equivalents would have an anti-dilutive
	effect.




	 




	The
	basic and diluted loss per share was ($0.03) and ($0.12) for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively,
	for the reasons previously noted. All outstanding stock options and warrants to purchase common stock were considered antidilutive
	and therefore excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per share for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 because
	of the exercise price of the warrants being substantially higher than market price in 2016 and the net loss reported for 2016
	and 2015. Potential shares of common stock as of March 31, 2016 that have been excluded from the computation of diluted net
	loss per share amounted to 2,900,721 shares, which included 2,489,271 outstanding warrants and 411,450 outstanding stock options.




	 





	Liquidity
	and Capital Resources; Going Concern





	 




	We
	have had a history of losses and have generated little or no operating revenues for a number of years as we concentrated on development
	of our Nicaraguan Concessions, which is a long-term, high-risk/reward exploration project in an otherwise unproven part of the
	world. Historically, we financed our operations through the issuance of redeemable preferred stock and various short and long-term
	debt financing that contained some level of detachable warrants to provide the holder’s with a level of equity participation
	should the Company be successful exploring its Nicaraguan Concessions.




	 




	During
	2013 we borrowed approximately $1,825,000 on a short-term basis by issuing various subordinated promissory notes with detachable
	warrants to purchase common shares. The fair value of the warrants resulted in a substantial increase in the overall effective
	borrowing costs. We used the proceeds of these notes to repay previously issued notes, including the foregoing related party note,
	to meet obligations and conduct seismic mapping related to our Nicaraguan Concessions and to provide working capital. In addition,
	we entered into an unsecured line-of-credit with a related party that supplemented its working capital needs and also provided
	detachable warrants to purchase common stock that increased the overall cost of the borrowing.




	 




	In
	April 2013, we conducted a private placement of units composed of common stock and warrants under which we raised $890,000 in
	proceeds and exchanged $125,000 principal amount of an outstanding note plus accrued interest for units. We used part of these
	proceeds to retire notes issued earlier in 2013.




	 




	We
	were unable to raise long-term capital in 2014 to pay the majority of the outstanding short-term promissory notes on their respective
	maturity dates. We were able to negotiate extensions of the maturity dates on these short-term promissory notes by issuing additional
	warrants exercisable to purchase shares of common stock and, in one case, granting a revenue sharing interest in our Nicaraguan
	Concessions.




	 




	In
	the first quarter 2015, we were able to increase our line-of-credit to a maximum of $100,000, which provided us some liquidity,
	but were unable to obtain other sources of capital. On February 28, 2015, the short-term note holders of maturing debt exercised
	their right to convert principal balances totaling $475,000 and accrued interest totaling $28,630 into 100,726 shares of common
	stock at an exchange rate of $5.00 per share. In addition, on March 31, 2015, the lender who provides the line-of-credit facility
	converted a partial principal balance totaling $50,000 into 10,000 shares of common stock at a price of $5.00 per share. Such
	debt to equity conversions helped to reduce our near term cash needs.




	 








	35










	 







	 




	In
	July 2015, the Company issued two promissory notes for total cash proceeds of $85,000. The promissory notes have maturity dates
	that have been extended several times and currently mature in August 2016. In connection with the origination and extension of
	the notes, the Company issued warrants exercisable to purchase shares of common stock at an exercise price of $5.60 per share.
	The warrants are immediately exercisable and terminate five years from their dates of issuance.




	 




	On
	December 27, 2013 the Company borrowed $1,050,000 under the December 2013 Note, which is an unsecured credit facility with a private,
	third-party lender. Effective April 7, 2015 the Company and the lender agreed to extend the maturity date of the December 2013
	Note from April 7, 2015 to the earlier of (i) April 7, 2016 or (ii) the payment in full of the Investor Note issued in the May
	2015 Private Placement in the principal amount of $9,550,000 (the “New Maturity Date”). All other terms of the Note
	remained the same and the remaining principal balance was reduced to $1,000,000 as of March 31, 2016 after the $50,000 principal
	repayment required by the extension agreement.




	 




	The
	December 2013 Note may be prepaid without penalty at any time. The December 2013 Note is subordinated to all existing and future
	senior indebtedness, as such terms are defined in the December 2013 Note. The parties are attempting to negotiate an extension
	of the December 2013 Note which, if completed, will extend the maturity to April 7, 2017, although there can be no assurance in
	this regard.




	 




	On
	May 7, 2015 the Company completed the May 2015 Private Placement of $12.0 million Senior Secured Convertible Note and a Warrant
	exercisable to purchase 1,800,000 shares of the Company’s common stock with an institutional investor. At the closing of
	the May 2015 Private Placement, the investor acquired the Convertible Note by paying $450,000 in cash and issuing the Investor
	Note, secured by cash, with a principal amount of $9,550,000. Assuming all amounts payable to the Company under the Investor Note
	are paid, the May 2015 Private Placement will result in gross proceeds of $10.0 million before placement agent fees and other
	expenses associated with the transaction, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. The Company used the initial proceeds
	from the closing to retire certain outstanding obligations, including the 2015 area and training fees of approximately $155,000
	owed to the Nicaraguan government relating to its Nicaragua Concessions, and to provide additional working capital.




	 




	The
	Company will receive the remaining cash proceeds upon each voluntary or mandatory prepayment of the Investor Note. The investor
	may, at its option and at any time, voluntarily prepay the Investor Note, in whole or in part.




	 




	The
	Convertible Note matures on the three-year anniversary of its issuance, bears interest at 8% per annum, and is convertible at
	any time at the option of the holder into shares of the Company’s common stock at $5.00 per share (the “Conversion
	Price”). As a part of the May 2015 Private Placement, the Company issued a Warrant to the investor giving it the right to
	purchase up to an aggregate of 1,800,000 shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $5.00 per share. The
	Warrant is exercisable commencing six months from the date of issuance for a period of seven years from the date of issuance.




	 




	The
	investor has no right to convert the Convertible Note or exercise the Warrant to the extent that such conversion or exercise would
	result in the investor being the beneficial owner of in excess of 9.99% of the Company’s common stock. The Convertible Note
	ranks senior to the Company’s existing and future indebtedness and is secured by all of the assets of the Company, excluding
	the Nicaraguan Concessions.




	 




	WestPark
	Capital acted as placement agent for the Company in the May 2015 Private Placement and received a fee of 6% of cash proceeds,
	or $600,000, if and when the Company receives the full cash proceeds. It received $27,000 of such amount at the closing plus the
	reimbursement of legal fees totaling $7,500. The Company also issued WestPark a warrant exercisable to purchase 240,000 shares
	of common stock at a price of $5.00 per share. The warrant was exercisable upon from the date of issuance for a period of seven
	years.




	 








	36










	 







	 




	In
	summary, as of March 31, 2016, we owed: (i) $68,303 on our line-of-credit, which is due May 28, 2016; (ii) the two promissory
	notes in the total principal amount of $85,000 which are due in August 2016; (iii) the Senior Secured Convertible note with a
	fair value of $247,135, which is due in 26 monthly installment payments either in cash or stock; and (iv) and the December 2013
	Note in the principal amount of $1,000,000 which we are currently negotiating to extend the maturity to April 2017. We intend
	to seek additional funding under the senior convertible note and other short-term debt financing to provide the funds necessary
	to pay-off the line-of-credit when it comes due and to provide working capital to fund normal operations, although we can provide
	no assurances that we will be successful in this regard. Our current financial condition has made traditional bank loans and normal
	financing terms unattainable; therefore, we may find it necessary to continue with these types of short-term borrowings with high
	effective interest rates.




	 




	The
	Company is in Sub-Period 3 of the exploration phase of the 30-year Concession for both Perlas and Tyra as of June 30, 2015. Sub-Period
	3 of the Nicaraguan Concessions requires the drilling of at least one exploratory well on the Perlas Block during 2016 and the
	shooting of additional seismic on the Tyra Block. The Company is in process of identifying at least one potential drilling site
	on the Perlas Block as required in Sub-Period 3 and will have to perform supplemental EIA work prior to requesting and receiving
	the permit to drill from the Nicaraguan government. The work plan on the Tyra block for Sub-Period 3 requires the Company to shoot
	additional seismic, which is estimated to cost approximately $2,500,000 prior to the commencement of exploratory drilling. The
	Company is negotiating with the Nicaraguan government to seek a waiver of the additional seismic mapping on the Tyra Block so
	that it can proceed with exploratory drilling. There can be no assurance whether it will be able to obtain a waiver of the requirement.




	 




	In
	accordance with the Nicaraguan Concession agreements, the Company has previously provided the Ministry of Energy with the required
	letters of credit in the amounts of $443,100 for Perlas (expired March 2014) and $408,450 for Tyra (expired September 2014). The
	Company has also made all required expenditures related to the Nicaraguan Concessions for training programs and as “area
	fees,” for each respective year for 2010 through 2015. In accordance with the Nicaraguan Concession agreements, the Company
	must provide the Ministry of Energy with the required letters of credit in the amounts which total $1,356,227 for the Perlas block
	and $278,450 for the Tyra block for exploration requirements on the leases as required by the Nicaraguan Concessions, to replace
	the expired letters of credit. The minimum cash requirements to maintain and comply with the minimum work program as defined in
	the Nicaraguan Concessions for the next twelve-month period will be approximately $5,500,000 for the Perlas Block which includes
	all costs to prepare for and drill the initial exploratory well, and $280,000 for the Tyra Block, assuming the waiver is granted
	regarding the seismic mapping. If such waiver is not granted, the Company estimates it will require approximately $2,500,000 for
	the seismic mapping. Finally, the Company estimates it will need approximately $300,000 to prepare and submit an environmental
	supplement to the Nicaraguan government to identify and receive authorization to drill up to five wells in the Concessions.




	 




	The
	Company has identified multiple sites for exploratory drilling and is planning the initial exploratory wells in order to determine
	the existence of commercial hydrocarbon reserves, subject to receipt from the Nicaraguan government of authorizations for the
	drilling of up to five wells. In order to meet its obligations under the Perlas Block of the Nicaraguan Concession, the Company
	must drill its initial exploratory well during 2016 or risk being in default and losing its rights under the Nicaraguan Concessions.




	 




	We
	are negotiating the renewal and/or adjustment of the required letters of credit with the Nicaraguan Government. Further, we intend
	to seek a waiver of the 3-D seismic mapping requirement because we do not believe it will be effective in providing additional
	information due the supplemental water depth and other factors. We plan to prepare the necessary information to submit to the
	EIA in order to obtain the necessary authorizations to drill up to five locations in the Concessions. There can be no assurance
	that we will be successful in any of the foregoing regards. Except for the foregoing items, we believe we are in full compliance
	with the terms of the Nicaraguan Concessions agreements.




	 




	The
	Company must successfully comply with the restrictions related to the senior convertible note in order to release the remaining
	$9.49 million in funding under the Investor Note or it must raise substantial amounts of debt and equity capital in the immediate
	future in order to fund: (1) the required letters of credit to the Nicaraguan Government; (2) fund approximately $300,000 to prepare
	and submit an environmental supplement to the Nicaraguan government to identify and receive authorization to drill up to five
	wells in the Concessions; (3) the drilling of at least one exploratory well on the Perlas Block of the Nicaraguan Concessions
	during 2016; (4) the shooting of additional seismic on the Tyra Block of the Nicaraguan Concessions if it is unable to negotiate
	a waiver of such requirement form the Nicaraguan government; (5) the payment of normal day-to-day operations and corporate overhead;
	and (6) the payment of outstanding debt and financial obligations as they become due. These are substantial operational and financial
	issues that must be successfully addressed during 2016 or the Company’s ability to satisfy the conditions necessary to maintain
	its Nicaragua Concessions will be in significant doubt. The Company is actively seeking new outside sources of debt and equity
	capital in order fund the substantial needs enumerated above, however, there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain
	such capital or obtain it on favorable terms or within the timeframe necessary to cure the technical defaults existing on the
	Nicaraguan Concessions or to meet its ongoing requirements to drill the exploratory wells.




	 








	37










	 







	 




	In
	addition to the minimum cash requirements related to the Nicaraguan Concessions, we estimate that we will require approximately
	$330,000 of working capital to maintain corporate operations for the next 12 months, but not including approximately $1,000,000
	principal amount of a short-term promissory note due in April 2016 (subject to ongoing extension negotiations), plus accrued interest,
	the $85,000 principal due on the two promissory notes due in January 2016 and the $68,303 currently outstanding under a revolving
	line of credit due February 2016. We owe $4,945,000 in trade payables related to seismic activities already performed (in December
	2013) but not yet paid; however, we believe such party has agreed to extend the time for payment of this obligation to until such
	time as we begin drilling operations on the Nicaraguan Concessions. We also owe other obligations to third parties as noted on
	our balance sheet, which we intend to pay, negotiate and/or settle prior to the beginning of any drilling operations, although
	there is no assurance that will be able negotiate settlements with venders or avoid collection activities.




	 




	We
	plan to raise long-term capital to satisfy the foregoing needs through an offering of our equity or debt securities and/or through
	a commercial relationship with other industry operators, which may involve the granting of revenue or other interests in the Nicaraguan
	Concessions in exchange for cash and a carried interest in exploration and development operations or the creation of a joint venture
	or other strategic partnership. There can be no assurance that we will obtain such funding or obtain it on terms acceptable to
	us. Further, if we cannot meet our obligations respecting the Nicaraguan Concessions, we may lose our rights to them.




	 




	The
	Company does not believe that it will be able to meet all of the Nicaraguan Concession requirements in 2016, including proceeding
	to drill the required exploration well during 2016 given the current state of the oil and gas commodity markets and the challenging
	economics for any new exploration and development project especially a project in an area of the world without historical proven
	reserves of commercial hydrocarbons. The Company believes that it will be able to negotiate extensions with the Nicaraguan government
	relative to the required date by which any exploratory wells must be drilled as well as the other requirements for maintaining
	the Concessions; however, there can be no assurance in this regard. These are substantial operational and legal issues that the
	Company must resolve in order to maintain its rights under the Nicaraguan Concessions during 2016.




	 




	Due
	to the uncertainties related to these matters, there exists substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
	The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts
	or the amount and classification of liabilities that might result should we be unable to continue as a going concern.

	Evaluation
	of Disclosure Controls and Procedures





	 




	Under
	the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial
	officer, as of the date of the filing of our Original Form 10Q on May 13, 2016, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness
	of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures to provide reasonable assurance of achieving the control
	objectives, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Based on their evaluation as of
	March 31, 2016, the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, our principal executive officer and principal
	financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in assuring that financial statement presentation
	and disclosure are in conformity with those which are required to be included in our periodic SEC filings.




	 




	Subsequent
	to the evaluation, in connection with the restatement discussed in Note 12 - “Restatement of Previously Issued Interim Financial
	Statements” to our unaudited financial statements, management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial
	officer, re-evaluated the effectiveness of the design operation of out internal control over financial reporting and disclosure
	controls and procedures as of May 13, 2016 and our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that,
	due to the material weakness identified in our internal control over financial reporting discussed below, our disclosure controls
	and procedures were not effective as of May 13, 2016. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies,
	in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the
	annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.




	 








	38










	 







	 





	Changes
	in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting





	 




	There
	have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that
	have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.




	 




	Internal
	control systems, no matter how well designed and operated, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even a system which is determined
	to be effective cannot provide absolute assurance that all control issues have been detected or prevented. Our systems of internal
	controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.






	 










	PART
	II -

	OTHER INFORMATION







	 










	ITEM
	1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS






	 




	The
	Company is currently involved in litigation as follows:




	 






	●




	In
	October 2012 the State of Texas filed a lawsuit naming Infinity-Texas, the Company and the corporate officers of Infinity-Texas,
	seeking $30,000 of reclamation costs associated with a single well, in addition to administrative expenses and penalties.
	The Company engaged in negotiations with the State of Texas in late 2012 and early 2013 and reached a settlement agreement
	that would reduce the aggregate liability, in this action and any extension of this to other Texas wells, to $45,103, which
	amount has been paid. Certain performance obligations remain which must be satisfied in order to finally settle and dismiss
	the matter.






	 




	 






	 




	Pending
	satisfactory performance of the performance obligations and their acceptance by the State of Texas, the officers have potential
	liability regarding the above matter, and the officers are held personally harmless by indemnification provisions of the Company.
	Therefore, to extent they might actually occur, these liabilities are the obligations of the Company. Management estimates
	that the liabilities associated with this matter will not exceed $780,000, calculated as $30,000 for each of the 26 Infinity-Texas
	operated wells. This related liability, less the payment made to the State of Texas in 2012 in the amount of $45,103, is included
	in the asset retirement obligation on the accompanying balance sheets.






	 




	 






	●




	Cambrian
	Consultants America, Inc. (“Cambrian”) filed an action in the District Court of Harris County, Texas, number CV2014-55719,
	on September 26, 2014 against Infinity Energy Resources, Inc. resulting from certain professional consulting services provided
	for quality control and management of seismic operations during November and December 2013 on the Nicaraguan Concessions.
	Cambrian provided these services pursuant to a Master Consulting Agreement with Infinity, dated November 20, 2013, and has
	claimed breach of contract for failure to pay amounts due. On December 8, 2014, a default judgment was entered against the
	Company in the amount of $96,877 plus interest and attorney fees. The Company has included the impact of this litigation as
	a liability in its accounts payable. The Company will seek to settle the default judgment when it has the financial resources
	to do so.






	 




	 






	●




	Torrey
	Hills Capital, Inc. (“Torrey”) notified the Company by letter, dated August 15, 2014, of its demand for the payment
	of $56,000, which it alleged was unpaid and owed under a consulting agreement, dated October 18, 2013. The parties entered
	into a consulting agreement under which Torrey agreed to provide investor relations services in exchange for payment of $7,000
	per month and the issuance of 15,000 shares of common stock. The agreement was for an initial three month-term with automatic
	renewals unless terminated upon 30 days’ written notice by either party. The Company made payments totaling $14,000
	and issued 15,000 shares of common stock during 2013. The Company contends that Torrey breached the agreement by not performing
	the required services and that it had provided proper notice of termination to Torrey. Furthermore, the Company contends that
	the parties agreed to settle the dispute on or about June 19, 2014 under which it would issue 2,800 shares of common stock
	in full settlement of any balance then owed and final termination of the agreement. Torrey disputes the Company’s contentions
	and submitted the dispute to binding arbitration. The Company was unable to defend itself and the arbitration panel awarded
	Torrey a total of $79,594 in damages. The Company has accrued amounts in accounts payable as of March 31, 2016 and December
	31, 2015, which management believes is sufficient to provide for the ultimate resolution of this dispute.

	ITEM
	2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS






	 




	During
	the three months ended March 31, 2016, the Company entered into the following unregistered sales of equity securities:




	 






	 




	●




	On
	January 28, 2016 the Company negotiated an extension of the line-of-credit facility to May 28, 2016 and granted the lender
	common stock purchase warrants exercisable to purchase an aggregate of 10,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price
	of $5.00 per share, which warrants were immediately exercisable and expire on February 28, 2021. The Company used the loan
	proceeds for working capital and paid no compensation to any party in connection with the establishment of the credit facility
	and issuance of the warrants. It relied on the exemption from registration set forth in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities
	Act for issuance of the credit facility and warrants.






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	In
	January 2016, the Company negotiated an extension of the maturity date for each of the two promissory notes with an aggregate
	principal balance of $85,000. The promissory notes have extended maturity dates in May 2016. In connection with the extension
	of the maturity dates, the Company issued warrants exercisable to purchase 8,500 shares of common stock at an exercise price
	of $5.60 per share. The warrants are immediately exercisable and terminate five years from their dates of issuance. The Company
	relied on the exemption from registration set forth in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act for issuance of the foregoing
	notes and warrants. It paid no compensation in connection with the issuance of the notes and warrants.






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●





	The
	Company is required to make monthly installment payments under its Senior Secured Convertible
	Note which can be made in the form of cash, common stock or a combination at the Company’s
	discretion. In accordance with the Note provisions. The Company delivered a total of
	1,984,446 shares of common stock to the Senior Secured Convertible Note holder representing
	required principal repayments ($107,000 principal balances) and 111,389 representing
	interest payments ($6,006 interest payments) during the three months ended March 31,
	2016. A total of 317,154 common shares were issued to “true-up” previous
	installments which were included in the shares delivered during the three months ended
	March 31, 2016.




	 




	Of
	the 1,984,446 total shares delivered to the holder of the Senior Secured Convertible Note during the three months ended
	March 31, 2016, 253,850 shares were registered under an effective Registration Statement on Form S-1 and the remaining
	1,841,985 shares were issued under an exemption provided under Rule 144.

Vegetable oil needs treatment before it can be burned.

My call to customer service this morning was very seamless and stress free. Wasn't on hold for more than 2 minutes and was able to transfer my electricity from the old address to my new address in less than 20 minutes. The representatives I spoke to answered all of my questions thoroughly and clearly. I spoke to Gregory and he later transferred me over to Paola; they were both cheerful and seemed to genuinely enjoy their jobs and helping me out this morning. 
I greatly appreciate the customer service and how easy the process was!








Lexi Gorfinkel 19:51 17 Jul 17

 

























I just had a call with Christopher who was helping me with a transfer/ connection of new service from one unit to another. Upon hearing me voice concern over the connection fee and first month's payment, he did some research on my account and noted that my recent payment wasn't being applied to the amount quoted. Several moments later after doing some research,  he spoke with his Supervisor he was able to resolve my issue and apply the recent payment bring down the mount for transfer significantly. I must say how appreciative I am to him and his team for realizing the problem and fixing it to get me back on track. Thank you Christopher!

Infinite Energy is a fun, energetic and exciting company.  They take care of their customers as well as their employees.  Their employees are excited to show up to work every day and excited to do right for their customers.  This is truly one of the World's Greatest companies!








Christina Jacobs 20:40 05 Jul 17

 

























Everyone I talked to was super helpful and knowledgeable about this company. Out of the three energy companies I called inquiring about different plans their company offers, this was the kindest group! They were able to answer ALL of my questions and explain it in a way I understand. And I had A LOT of questions!








Hailey B 02:54 04 Jul 17

 

























I have been an Infinite Energy customer for over three years. I have loved their rates and customer service so much that I simply transferred my services across the state when we moved. I honestly did not want to have to go with another company. I have never wasted time trying to call customer service, and they always call back promptly if they have a long line. The service agents have always been kind and friendly, and they'll take the time that you need rather than trying to rush you off the phone. Infinite Energy keeps detailed notes about every call, even if it is a simple question, that way all agents are well informed of your account; you won't get frustrated repeating your story over-and-over. I highly suggest Infinite Energy and hope that I can remain in their service at any future residences.








Jasmine Davis 18:23 09 Jun 17

 

























Great and seamless customer service! Logan, my customer care rep, and the gentleman that transfered me over to him...they were both was very clear and concise and . Explained everything in great detail and was even able to provide me a better deal for service.  He stayed on the phone with me until I had received all email confirmations that I needed for service creation. Great service.








stephanie meyers 14:35 08 Jun 17

 

























Sandra's professionalism was truly outstanding. She went over and beyond in addressing my concerns, extending additional services and providing information to resolve my concerns.  This was truly a great experience!  Sandra is an asset to your firm to be treasured and compensated for her winning partnership relationship taking ownership and exhibiting excellence to take your firm to new heights.








John Kerr 20:00 07 Jun 17

 

























Customer Service is a lost art - especially with utility companies.  Infinite Energy - and Sandra - are a welcome respite.  She worked a number of personalized plans based upon My Usage - to provide detailed information and solutions for my household.  This sounds like a commercial, but it's not.  Their rates are among the best (and they'll help you read the fine print).  I'm glad to have the opportunity to choose - but glad to stay- with Infinite Energy in Texas.








Joseph Jan 15:20 07 Jun 17

 

























Dallas is a very experienced and nice representative.  He explained to me nicely the new plan that I am signing on, which is a 24 months plan at a low rate and the promotion comes with a Nest Camera outdoor unit that I need for my house.  Dallas was very helpful and was able help me switch the current gas provider to Infinite Energy.  I am very happy with his service!








Zac Griffin 20:35 10 May 17

 

























I recently purchased an electricity plan through Infinite Energy. It was the best priced plan with the best customer service ratings. 

I got to experience the great customer service shortly after I signed up when I needed to change the start date for my plan. Nicole was able to get the switch made at the last minute - quickly and at no cost. I got a service representative within 1 minute of calling in. Nicole was also able to help me understand the best way to review my usage and gave me detailed information on my meter read schedule. I look forward to the next 6 months and unless something changes, look forward to renewing after that!








ADS C 16:47 09 May 17

 

























This review is based soley on my experience with activating service.  I'm a new customer who enrolled by phone. The specialist who handled my account went above and beyond to help me select the plan that was best for me. He was incredibly pleasant and easy to work with.  I'm pleased he was able to schedule same-day activation. I look forward to trying this provider and hope the service is as great as my initial experience with Infinite Energy.








Barbara Haseley 17:30 04 May 17

 

























This was the easiest phone call I have ever made to change electricity companies!   Thank you Infinite Energy and Kelsey for the great customer service, I so appreciate that so much.  Kelsey was very helpful and kind and answered all my questions promptly.   Look forward to being a new Infinite Energy customer.








Vence Mondragon 22:51 02 May 17

 

























Their plan was straight forward and easy to understand. We wanted to try a new service provider and at a reasonable rate. The representative, Logan, was knowledgeable, courteous and friendly and was able to answer our questions. Hopefully, Infinite Energy will keep us happy, and satisfied for the next 12 mos.








Jacqueline Ellis 15:36 02 May 17

 

























Logan was very nice & helped answer my questions, and I decided to sign up with Infinity Energy today.  

I was very happy that he could get me changed over from another electric service starting today, since my contract actually ended today.  Am very pleased!  

Thank You!
Jacqueline Ellis ???








Kevin Gaastra 17:44 26 Apr 17

 

























Very efficient and good customer service. Had a bit of trouble with the website when trying to sign up for their plan. So I called them up to see if I could enrol that way instead, call took 10 minutes, I was never on hold, and they got me exactly the plan I wanted at a good rate. Hopefully their service continues to be this good over the next 12 months of my plan, if so I will almost certainly be renewing.








Pacia Jones 12:57 26 Apr 17

 

























5 STARS, I've been with Infinite Energy for over 5 years. Customer Service is Absolutely the BEST. They always listen and is willing to help with any situation. Therm usage is always low and I get a fix rate sometimes as long as 18 months. Thanks Infinite Energy. Job Well Done








Kassidy Cavendish 19:21 18 Apr 17

 

























I called in to switch my services over to a new apartment and they were able to change everything over as well as refund me my last years deposit and waive another deposit for a "new account". Logan was absolutely fantastic and was able to help me in less than 15 minutes! Could not recommend this company enough.








Michael LaBelle 19:00 30 Mar 17

 

























I have been working with Infinite for three years as my provider and the customer service is outstanding. Going through a current move, Sandra has been so helpful with my change in service. I've never had an issue they couldn't solve for me and the rates are always great in my area!








Joyce Hooks 14:40 30 Mar 17

 

























Yes, I spoke with your representative, Shannon. She was very professional and friendly. I had an issue with my bill and not only did she go above and beyond in helping me, she was also able to research and find the issue and get my problem resolved within a few minutes. Before making this call, I was very frantic. After speaking with Shannon, she was able to reassure me that the issue would be resolved, which calmed my emotional state down. At the end of the conversation, she also asked me if there was anything else she could do for me, which there was, and she responded very promptly. Shannon was awesome and I wish I could speak with her every time I call. In any event, Shannon was thorough, professional, knowledgeable, and did her job well. She definitely represents you company well. Thank You Shannon!








Father Vincent Rumain 15:46 21 Mar 17

 

























I called inquiring about a letter regarding the end of my present contract. Logan is the representative who helped me. He was personal, professional and competent, knowing immediately what I needed to know regarding my contract. We agreed on an option, and the rest is history. I am very satisfied with my phone call and it's outcome and will continue to use Infinite Energy. To me they are fair and genuinely interested in satisfying the customer. I trust that my perception is accurate.








Kris Olson 17:13 20 Mar 17

 

























I spoke with Dallas today and he was fantastic in helping me switch over to my new property as well as locking in a few rate as my last plan had reached the end of the term. It was simple and easy and I haven't had any issues so far with anything whether it be the app or payment or my service itself.








Semhar Hagos 21:13 07 Mar 17

 

























I would definitely recommend this company! The representative I worked with, Chris, had such a positive and professional attitude throughout the activation process. Keep up the great work!








Lauren Eubank 19:14 07 Mar 17

 

























Infinite has always been a great utility provider. They've continuously had the best rates in my area, are always fast to answer to the phone, and are polite during every interaction. I was sad I had to cancel my service due to moving into an all-electric apartment, but they explained my options and how they could waive the early termination fee. Not many companies will do that!








Amy Benton 01:08 03 Mar 17

 

























Watching the Atlanta Gladiators at the Infinite Energy Center was a great time!!! We enjoyed the game as well as all the fanfare. Looking forward to going again.








Steve Hutchins 15:15 01 Mar 17

 

























Infinite Energy is a - 5 star A+ company! Great rates. Great customer service. Everyone I've talked to in the past 2 1/2 +/- years has been a quality person, which is rare these days. You will enjoying with this company!








Jane A. Smyth 22:22 28 Feb 17

 

























Logan was friendly, courteous and knowledgeable. He was able to describe the various rates and options for my move. I greatly appreciate how easy it all was, and how kind he was in helping me.








Paolo Chiezzi 14:59 28 Feb 17

 

























Just switched to Infinite Energy and I'm impressed with their level of customer care. Both the operator Antoine and his Supervisor Paolo helped me to get the best rate and their friendly attitude made this a really pleasant and positive experience. 5 Stars no doubt!








SanAntonioCoco 17:08 27 Feb 17

 

























My electricity had been disconnected due partially to a technical issue with the mobile app and partially my own fault. Nevertheless- customer service rep Sandra was so polite, so friendly, so helpful, and fast at getting everything resolved. She acknowledged technical error through the app and made sure my reconnection fee was waived since I had been attempting to make payment since last week. Even my 5 year old loved speaking with her while she was working to get things processed and I had her on speakerphone. lol Thank you, Sandra, for making our day.








Victoria Arnold 16:12 22 Feb 17

 

























Fantastic customer support with management who really cares about you. Where I live, there is a company that owns the gas pipes that Infinite Energy doesn't manage the actual workers of, they just contract them or something. Well, that company couldn't figure out what service area needed to service my place, leading to delays in gas installation. I spoke with several customer service reps and management with Infinite Energy because I was upset I took off work for no reason, and they were absolutely doing the best they could to get me an ETA, even called me to keep me posted on the status of the work order, and showed empathy on my behalf for the inconvenience. Would recommend this company any day of the week, because they make you feel like you actually matter to them as a customer.








Caroline Cisneros 14:49 20 Feb 17

 

























Glad to be back!!! I definitely have to give praise to Chris Mola and his manager at Infinite Energy again. This  guy is a beast with product knowledge and ALWAYS goes above and beyond to make sure I get the best service. I was a customer for 2 years before I moved out of the service area and now I am back and happy to say IE is my electric provider again.

Last Friday, I searched the powertochoose website to check out how IE rates compared to others. To my surprise, IE had a higher price then other competitors. I called Gexa Energy since they were the lowest and spoke with Julian and he offered me a plan for 4.5 cents avg per kwh. After spending 5 mins on the phone with the guy, he kept pushing me to sign up. The guy made me feel uneasy and I called Chris to see if he can beat the price. Chris took his time and walked me through the electricity facts label for that plan, and come to find out... the plan was crap. Absolute crap. The real price after hidden fees was 9.1 cents avg per kwh which was way more than IE's all inclusive rate of 7.1 cents avg per kwh.  Chris than walked me through 2 other competitor company plans whose rates were 4 to 5 cents and again the real rates were really 8 cents and 11 cents. Chris than went over with me IE's facts label so I could see the difference, that IE had no hidden fees and he made sure I understood what I would  be signing up for. Chris than took his time to help me break down some other competitor plans where they were closely to IE's 7.1 cents,. We then found 2 other competitor plans with Cirro Energy and Startrek or Startek or Starwars, whatever you want to call it, who Chris confirmed had IE's prices beat at 6.7 cents. At this point Chris has been on the phone with me for well over 30 minutes and he completely understood if I needed to go with the competitor's plan. He just advised me to call them and ask the right questions to make sure they had no extra fees not stated on their fact label. 

So I called the Starwars company and Maria answered and literally it wasn't even a minute later where she sounded highly irritated and asked me to spell my name exactly as it appears on my social security card. 

It was literally in that moment that I realized that I would rather pay an extra $3 a month to get the best customer service ever from Chris and IE then to deal with Maria and the sequel to Star Wars.  It's definitely worth it to pay for quality.  I trust Chris and owe him a big Thank you! Chris you are a huge asset to IE and your sincerity and honesty is what makes this customer experience thee absolute best!
If you are searching for an electric provider...Infinite Energy is a MUST! 

You can't beat what they do for their customers 🙂








Jean DeRosa 01:00 16 Feb 17

 

























This was the most confusing thing ever to just have my name put on a new account.  Kelsey and Sandra were amazing and helped me navigate this.  The past account was not listed under my actual address since it was a townhouse.  The address used was different and the owner finally gave it to me.  These ladies made this unpleasant experience rewarding as I learned a lot.  I learned what a gas meter and electric meter looks like.  Thank you ladies for helping me cheerfully through this.








Ladonna Collins 03:47 15 Feb 17

 

























My experience was awesome, he was very knowledgeable, polite  and very helpful about the services. He explained to me about the promotions that i could chose from, and I was very impressed about that as well. the service I received this morning deserve  5 stars!

Thank you Marco!








Lorna McArthur 14:02 14 Feb 17

 

























Kelsey's opening greeting made my day - so cheerful and polite!!  She made the transfer from Georgia Natural Gas company quick, easy and painfree!!  You can't do better than that!  And Infinite Energy's rate is considerably less than any other company!!








April Spring 14:29 03 Feb 17

 

























Sandra was amazing! I was so upset with a manager for not handling and she kept me calm and helped me fix the account so it would not happen again. She is a gym! Thank you Sandra!








patricia nyquist 00:07 02 Feb 17

 

























I spoke with Logan today to change my order for new service.  He was extremely helpful, knowledgeable, and friendly!  Thanks again Logan!








Tiffany Boulware 23:12 31 Jan 17

 

























I appreciate the assistance that I received.  The process was seemless.  She took the time to explain everything and was very thorough.








Tracy Lehrer 00:05 31 Jan 17

 

























So far, so good.  I spoke with Logan today to set up my service and it was a smooth experience.  He was very helpful and able to address everything I needed to change my service to Infinite Energy.








Amanda Harden 22:30 24 Jan 17

 

























There was not much of a a wait for customer service. Nick was amazing, answered all of my questions, and was very quick and positive! Scheduled service the very next day!!! GOOOO NICK!!!!








Jesus Hernandez 19:16 23 Jan 17

 

























Saint was awesome! Infinite energy took care of my billing questions and recommended a website to track my wattage usage. Best part is i was also able to make a payment with him without and extra fee!








Maria GARCIA-GONZALES 18:03 23 Jan 17

 

























Logan was very informative and polite.  Great customer service!








Clint Jones 15:08 23 Jan 17

 























Great game, thanks for the tickets.  Suite was comfortable.








Tamima Douyon 19:13 20 Jan 17

 

























It was good. Was able to explain things clearly. Concerned about my satisfaction! Very easy to talk to!








Mary Ruisdael 16:47 19 Jan 17

 

























I appreciate your monthly updates.  Thank your for your gift. Logan was very polite but as I remember our conversation one year ago he was very nice then. If this were a perfect world, everyone would be as nice but not so. Thank you Mary tisdale








Paul Mazzoni 21:50 17 Jan 17

 

























Awesome facility. The people working there were all very friendly. Seating is extremely comfortable and food is also excellent. Saw the Gladiators for the first time and the atmosphere was electrifying, even though the crowd was fairly small. Would love to go back again sometime. Just wish it were closer!








Tammy Young 13:53 17 Jan 17

 

























I love Infinite Energy. My family and I had an awesome time at the Infinite Energy Center. I don't know any other utility company that gives away free tickets to their customers. We really appreciate their great customer service!








Lyn Manzanares 23:46 13 Jan 17

 

























I had a great experience when it came time to renew my rate plan. Logan was very helpful and explained the different options so it was easy to select the plan best suited for me. I have no complaints. I can't wait to get my Nest Thermostat that will help me save more on my bill! Thanks Infinite Energy!








Nick Petrocchi 15:41 09 Jan 17

 

























Infinite Energy's always provided great rates and great customer service. Today a rep named Saint both helped with my transition in addresses mid-contract, and he also provided helpful information on how renewals work.

Courteous, professional, knowledgeable... 5 stars 🙂 In fact, they even emailed me a direct link to provide this review, which is the only reason I had time to write this up.








Heather Daniel 21:37 06 Jan 17

 

























Heather was awesome!!! She really explained everything well and made my experience signing up for service seamless!! Thank you,  Heather!! You rock!!








Angel Quach 17:36 28 Dec 16

 

























Logan was the representative that helped me activate my new service. I enjoyed the conversation because he was friendly and professional. Also it didn't take long to get my account set up. I think I found my new gas provider.








patfollett 14:36 21 Dec 16

 

























Kelsey did a fantastic job taking care of my needs in one simple phone call. Her attitude was very welcoming and cheerful, and her level of customer service was impeccable. She represents your company in a very professional and caring manner. You should feel both fortunate and proud to have her as a member of your team.








Denise Crawford 21:42 16 Dec 16

 

























Kim has been giving me the best service for all of our properties for years.  I hope I retire before she does.  I use Infinite as my provider because of her awesome, impeccable customer service.








McKinsey Flores 20:31 15 Dec 16

 

























Antione is the best. Very nice and polite and quick! I received great service. Thanks so much! Merry Christmas!!








Sharon Smith 14:16 15 Dec 16

 

























Christine, of Infinite Energy, gave me new knowledge pertaining to meter reading cycles, about which I had many questions. She encouraged me to register my meter at Smart Meter Texas which I wanted to do. Numerous number strings are printed on the smart meter face. Which number is the meter number? Christine gave me that information as well. With no face-to-face contact, one goes on tone of voice to determine another person's demeanor. She was so very kind, delightful and respectful --- I thoroughly enjoyed our conversation. Christine, AWESOME JOBl!!!








Amy Williams 03:12 15 Dec 16

 

























Tess was very patient and knowledgeable about the products and services. She has very good customer service skills and very nice. I will definitely recommend family and friends to deal with her. After speaking with five other representatives. I wished I had spoken with her first. Thanks Tess for your good work ethics!








Cyra Davis-Arnold 13:37 12 Dec 16

 

























I have never had better customer service in my life !!! Tess went above and beyond for our family !!! She was very empathetic of our family situation ,all of her  friendly reminder calls helped us stay on track ,she has worked with our family for over a year!!!  Not once did she make us feel bad or uncomfortable about our finances ,as a matter of fact she went above and beyond to make sure that things were easier on our family !!! There should be a "Tess " in everyone's business ,because great customer service is everything!!!!  We thank her from the bottom of our heart Way to go Infinite Energy for hiring such a great person !!








Cindy Cowan 15:38 09 Dec 16

 

























Saint, the customer service rep I spoke with , was amazing. He answered the phone "how may I make your day as amazing as mine."  Super helpful and kind.








Subi Bose 22:48 07 Dec 16

 

























Marcos was very helpful and patient enough to understand my situation.  He was able to clarify my queries and explain me the different options while throwing away tips on how the first bill payment can be handled without over burden. That helped me choose the right plan.  I got the account created on the fly.  Thank you again Marcos and Infinite Energy.








Dmitri Martjuchin 20:12 06 Dec 16

 

























I worked with Dallas who helped set up a 2nd account for me. As an existing Infinite Electric customer, Dallas was an excellent customer service professional. He listened and understood my requests, he handled my requests with understanding of his job and treated me with respect. As I have had a history in the customer service business, I know what it takes to provide good and bad service, and Dallas was one of the best customer service representatives I have ever dealt with. You have a great person in Dallas working for Infinite Electric. By the way a gentleman I believe named Saint also helped me prior to Dallas and he also provided great customer service.








Kelly O'Connell 04:49 02 Dec 16

 

























Infinite Energy has outstanding customer service!!! I have never had a single problem with my account or my bills. I have worked with numerous companies for electricity, among other amenities, and the customer service experience I had with Infinite Energy surpasses everyone else! When I call with questions, I am immediately connected with a real person and I get my questions answered immediately. They don't try to sell you more services, they just try to do what's in the customers best interest! I would absolutely recommend them!!!








Lorraine Mossop 16:05 01 Dec 16

 

























Great experience with Customer Rep Sarah.  She was very friendly and answered my question quickly & efficiently.  She also gave me a heads up on what to expect when my contract comes due.








S Hodge 18:24 22 Nov 16

 

























Very delightful experience. Kelsey really lifted my spirit. Her voice and her words brought peace to me and her knowledge of the product was great.  I have one family member so far that will be switching to Infinite Energy. I am working on getting the others to switch also because I want Kelsey to get a lot of recognition or points or rewards. Keep up the good work. I am a satisfied customer.








Joshua Christie 01:03 21 Nov 16

 

























Tess at Infinite was great.  I called pretty frustrated as the billing period ended in such a way that cost me a $100 credit.  She compromised with me and gave me a $50 credit which I thought was completely reasonable.  She also gave me a helpful guide to know how the billing periods worked.  All in all, I left the conversation feeling more informed with my problem fairly resolved.  Great customer service by Tess and Infinite Energy.








Isabelle Hart 20:30 17 Nov 16

 

























Paolo Estrada is the best account rep not only for Infinite Energy but of all the account reps with which I work.  He is so attentive, proactive, touches base periodically, understands my multiple companies' needs and makes sure he and his team keep me on the right plan.  I highly recommend IE to anyone looking for a new solution for their energy needs.

Our story




Gu-ru / ‘goroō /
Noun:
1. A mentor, a teacher, one who helps you move forward.
2. A source of inspiration and good energy.


GURU
A Story of Organic Growth
Ever since the early days, GURU has always been driven by this idea of crafting the best natural energy drink out there. Founded in Montreal during the summer of 1999 by four college friends, the company marketed the world's first all-natural energy drink.
More than 15 years later, this vision is not only fulfilled but is also thriving and expanding worldwide. GURU has become the #1 Organic Energy Drink in Canada and the US in the Health Channel thanks to a strong network of distribution partnerships and a passionate sales team. 
With research & development at the forefront of our expansion, GURU now tackles a new market and adventure with the recent introduction of our Energy Waters. This new line of product arrives just in time to satisfy a growing demand for organic sugar and calorie-free energy beverages.
In short, GURU has and will always believe that energy should not come at the expense of health. That is what has brought our company a steady and organic growth.
Our Philosophy
Through its corporate philosophy and its beverages, GURU gives good energy for people to make great things, reminding that, with the right dose of will, inspiration and energy, achieving great results is within everyone's reach. 
People today define themselves less by what they have and more by what they do and contribute to the world. Resourcefulness, imagination, inventiveness is today’s new currency. Whether using technology, natural ingredients or just plain common sense, people who Make it Good are the ones who seek to make everything better. We call them Makers.
They are pioneers that never settle. Makers, not followers. Crafters not manufacturers. Some may call them obsessed, exceptional or extraordinary people. But these are men and women who are true innovators, thought leaders and doers in their respective communities. They make the impossible possible.

Luc Martin-Privat
Our Brew Master
Meet Luc our Brew Master. He is the brains behind GURU.  In fact, while he could have become your friendly neighborhood pharmacist, Luc had other dreams…
From the functional herbs he started playing with in his dad’s lab to his PhD in Pharmacology, Luc has mastered the art of blending botanicals, an art he is now applying to our beloved GURU.
Always on the lookout for smart organics from around the world, Luc is looking into the GURU recipe “Organically” to make it perfect everytime! And when he is not looking at new ways to craft our GURU, Luc is dreaming about new products!

Where applicable, a project is considered as such until the end of construction and ramp-up to full capacity (with the exception of mining projects, where the date of commissioning signifies the end of the project). Projects must have a:  a) Start date b) Estimate for completion c) Initial investment estimate  Data For state-owned projects, initial information about the start date and estimates for completion and investment are taken from original signed contracts, along with addendums and annexes. If original contracts cannot be obtained, information is taken from public documents, presentations, news articles from BNamericas archives, and external sources. In cases where contracts are subject to approval by legislators, the start date is the date of the law or legislative approval. In the case of private projects, information is taken from public sources, such as stock exchange filings, annual reports, company presentations, third party research and press releases. In judging the timing of investment decisions for private projects, great care was taken to differentiate between large projects receiving environmental approval and proceeding directly to construction, and smaller projects where the investment decision hinges on securing financing. Best care is taken to ensure that recorded data is correct at the time of entry and that each entry is backed with a relevant source. The greatest care possible was taken to ensure consistency of information in order make a like-for-like comparison in project costs. Insofar as the figures rely on disclosure by the organization or company responsible, the figures can be considered to be conservative in nature. No attempt was made to adjust figures for inflation during the course of research or for consideration of the time value of money. Validation In the case of state-owned projects, validation is carried out where possible with either a member of the consortium, EPC contractor, a relevant state agency or advisors to either party. Currency Projects costs are measured in US dollars. Where project costs are measured in a local currency, amounts are converted to US dollars at the date of the relevant announcement, signature or report.  Severity of deviation from original estimates The severity of deviation from original estimates is defined according to set criteria. Timing    Status Condition     Ahead of time 95% of original estimate or below (measured in months)   On time 95% to 105% of original estimate   Minor changes 105% to 120% of original estimate   Medium changes 120% to 160% of original estimate   Major changes Over 160% of original estimate    Budget    Status Condition     Ahead of budget 95% of original budget estimate or below   To budget 95% to 105% of original budget estimate   Minor changes 105% to 120% of original budget estimate   Medium changes 120% to 140% of original budget estimate   Major changes Over 140% of original budget estimate    Changes in Scope Changes in scope beyond the start date are not accounted for. Language definitions Where guidance is non-specific as to dates for completion, the following is used. Project to be completed by 2018 = December 31, 2017 Project to be completed in 2018 = December 31, 2018

Infinity Energy Resources, Inc. Company Profile

   Maybe nothing lasts forever, but Infinity Energy Resources hopes that US demand for fossil fuels won't go away for a long, long time. The company focuses its oil exploration and production operations in the Fort Worth Basin of Texas, in the Rocky Mountain region in the Greater Green River Basin in Wyoming, and the Sand Wash and Piceance Basins in Colorado. It is also pursuing an opportunity in offshore Nicaragua. The company has proved reserves of 7.8 billion cu. ft. of natural gas equivalent. Infinity Energy Resources has exited the oil services business.

My sons like energy drinks, but i have always questioned their safety and health-risks.  Guru has made an effort to bring a better product to this popular beverage choice.

has a slight citrus taste, gave me the boost i needed without the crash.  much rather drink this than red bull, rockstar or monster as this is organic!  found my new favorite energy drink pre-workout or just when i'm dragging on certain days.  also it doesn't have a ton of calories, big plus!

This product was tasting and refreshing. It helped provide energy. I'm not sure of the importance of it being vegan for an energy drink though.

I don't usually drink energy drinks, but this one is an exception to the rule. It's organic, low calorie, non-GMO and contains ingredients that I can actually trust.  I did not experience a crash afterwards. I read that this has to do with the fact that they use naturally-occurring caffeine from Green Tea and Guarana. I don't know why you would drink any other energy drink than this. Definitely loading up on these again soon! Great price not expensive at all!

Great Taste and quite a Boost. Perfect for tired driving or late night Study! Have quite a few friends that love GURU also and it's Organic.

Definitely better tasting than something like Red Bull---and just as importantly, better smelling.  I can't be the only person who gags at the smell of Red Bull....  In contrast, this stuff is much more palatable, less artificially sweet, and doesn't leave that horrendous aftertaste coating your tongue.    It's harder to find than Red Bull, so when you see it, stock up.

I liked the taste and the fact there was no after taste. Seems like a healthier alternative to the rock star drinks I usually drink. The ingredients make it for a less guilty feeling when drinking an energy drink.

I thought the taste was wonderful. It is nice to see an organic energy drink that burst of flavor.  And is lightly carbonated this is definitely a great drink when you need that extra pep.

The energy drink is great to drink in the morning to get rid of the grogginess after a late night. I doesn't bring you up as high as caffeine, but it settles in with your current mood as a stabilizer.

Having only tried this once in my life, i was shocked at how well it tasted! It didn't feel super heavy with sugars and carbs like alot of energy drinks can feel like after consuming. I let my coworker try some, he said he really enjoyed how well it tasted. I would probably purchase in the future.

Purchased at Vons. Metallic taste and didn't notice an energy boost at all. A bit overpriced and more of a niche product, than a nutritional function type beverage.

I don't drink energy drinks often, mostly because they don't typically taste great and I drink coffee already. However, I was impressed with Guru. I couldn't put my finger on the flavor at first, but reading the ingredients it was the green tea that leaves a mild aftertaste, kind of like matcha. The nose is citrusy and refreshing. That said, although I stayed perky after drinking it; I would say it's safe for people who only drink caffeine moderately to drink it too, and if you're dead tired it might not make much of a difference. It only has caffeine from the tea, so not at all the "crack" type of artificial energy drink like a Monster or Red Bull, which I think taste gross and are horrible for you!

Honestly, I much rather drink this organic energy drink rather then regular energy drinks any day! However, I do not normally drink energy drinks. I prefer to drink my regular vitamins and eat healthy food to get my source of energy for  my days. The taste was okay, I do recommend for those who like to drink their source of energy.

I was extremely pleased with the taste of this drink. There was no bitterness unlike other artificially sweet drinks. The plus point of this drink is that its organic, low calorie and contains ingredients that are not harmful to the body. The caffeine in this drink is derived from natural sources like green tea. So I can have as many drinks I desire without feeling guilty. I tried the Lite version of the drink. The only negative point for this product is the price. Costing around $2 per can is quite expensive!

When it comes to energy drinks, I always prefer to have a more natural drink. With the chemicals and fake flavor of many competitors, this is definitely a healthy alternative to give you that boost you need in your day.

This was actually the first energy drink I ever tried! I was a little skeptical at first but I thought it was delicious! It was a lovely soda, lots of carbonation, no aftertaste (kind of like a citrus apple cider with tea) but there was a little too much sugar. I pay attention to carb intake as I am Type 1 Diabetic and there was quite a bit of sugar...too much for my taste. I don't even think it needed it but it was still yummy!

I'm not big on mainstream energy drinks, so I'm happy that there's a more natural organic variation.

I was pleasantly surprised with the overall energy factor of this drink. It tastes much like that of Redbull, but without the tendency of giving you a throbbing headache. I was quite thrilled with the amount of energy I obtained from a single 8.4 fl oz serving. It does taste much like most traditional energy drinks, a bit canny and tin-like but the energy you get is well worth the metallic taste. I can actually see myself purchasing this on a regular basis. 5/5 stars for sure!

As someone who is always on the run, I like having a large variety of different energy drinks to fuel my day as a substitute for coffee. I tried the GURU organic energy drink out and liked that it didn't taste like the typical energy beverage with the taurine flavor that is so prevalent. Generally if you're putting caffeine into your body, you'd like it to be as unadulterated as possible. I like that the ingredients used in the drink are organic, gluten-free, and NON=GMO verified.

I'm not much an engery drinks kind of person but when I do need a lift of engery I like to drink something that is not super high in sugar or have a list of ingredients I can barely pronounce.

If one is in need of an extra boost of energy and prefer something that is organic Guru is the way to.

The first thing I did when I bought this product was read the ingredients. To my surprise I could read all the ingredients and there was no caffeine. I wake up at 5 o'clock in the morning everyday for work. I'm usually a little tired. About two hours into the workday, this particular work day,  the first thing I did was drink the guru light. I did not feel tired all day and did not feel overly energized.  Plainly said, I felt normal and this was good for me.  That means the drink did what it was supposed to do.  I don't think I'D  drink it everyday but I will definitely keep a few spares around for days when I play hockey until midnight and have to work at 5 in the morning or days where I'm working all day and I need that extra push to get me through. #trynatural

I appreciated the fact that this drink was made with natural products - I felt both more alert and awake after drinking this but it was not an artificial sugar induced buzz and I did not crash immediately afterward as I do with most energy drinks. Tasted like a standard energy drink which is the one thing I would like to see improved - not a big fan of the citrus taurine flavor.

The overall taste is very mild. The ease of drinking this beverage is commendable. It tasted like a natural drink and not like the artificial ones. The energy content is okay since I am an avid coffee drinker, I did not feel as energized as I would if I drank coffee. I also enjoy the fact that is it organic and naturally derived.

I was somewhat skeptical about this product, being a consumer of the energy drink that gives you "wings".  But I was very surprised when I took that first sip.  Yummy!

Yummy!  #trynatural

Wow, this is definitely one of the best tasting energy drinks out on the market.  It has a really nice, sweet flavor to it, and has zero aftertaste.  You can definitely taste the white grape juice, but it's not overpowering   I definitely felt it starting to work immediately, which I also enjoy with energy drinks, as I like to sip them over the course of my afternoon.  I would definitely buy this one again as it was in the same price point as my other usual energy drinks.  I would also recommend it to a friend if they wanted a sweet, pick-me-up to keep them going,

I usually don't use energy drinks because of the flavor but I tried the Guru Organic energy drink and thought it was a step above the usual Red Bull or Monster drinks.  Upon reading the list of ingredients, I was pleased to see that they were all natural.  I was surprised to see echinacea listed as an ingredient, which I felt was a nice alternative to unpleasant tasting vitamin supplements.  My store did not carry the sugar free variety, so I had to settle for the 30 grams of sugar that came with the regular version.  It was very sweet, but the actual taste was good and I liked the level of carbonation.  I didn't get the jitters nor did I have the "crash and burn" that I would have expected with this type of drink.  I did not drink it all at once, but rather had it throughout the second half of the day, which is usually when I start feeling tired.  If I can find the sugar free version, I will definitely try it.  I do have to limit my caffeine intake, but for those occasions when I absolutely must have an extra boost, a cold sparkly Guru sounds like a great alternative to an iced coffee or tea.

I bought the Original version -  because I had read reviews on Amazon saying that it was better-flavored.  It had a nice fruity-citrusy taste, and wasn't overly sweet.  Since I usually buy low or no-calorie energy drinks I am used to a different flavor profile.  I got a nice "kick" from this drink, and it helped keep me stay alert during a long-distance drive.  I also appreciate the organic ingredients, since a lot of energy drinks are full of all sorts of "junk".  Will definitely buy this again!

I opted for the original as opposed to the lite. I've had several other brands of energy drinks in the past, and Guru definitely has a cleaner slightly refreshing taste. I like that guru is made with organic cane sugar, which surprised me as other drinks I've had can leave a artificial taste. The drink also contains sparkling water, organic white grape juice, and organic green tea leaf extract which is a great naturally occurring caffeine. Guru organic energy drink definitely holds its own when it comes to energy drinks and I would definitely purchase again.

I opened it and was pleasantly surprised that it was carbonated. The taste was not overly sweet... it was JUST right. I am not a fan of things that are TOO sweet.  The flavor was slightly fruity, like a mild version of a candy, again, not too sweet.  After about 10 minutes I started feeling more awake and alert. I love that it didn't get me pumped or jittery. It gave me the perfect amount of energy for it to feel natural. I would absolutely​ purchase this again. I never liked energy drinks, but GURU changed my mind.

I am not a fan of RedBull or coffee, but i like caffeine in other forms, so i decided to try Guru. I was pleasantly surprised, because it has wonderful taste. It is not as overwhelming as RedBull, it is more natural, fruity and refreshing. And the energy in it brought some muracles - on lazy and rainy Sunday afternoon, i did not have much hope to achieve anything, but... with Guru, i completed tasks and chores i was procrastinating about for weeks. The only thing to be aware of: if you live in Bay Area, this drink will cost you hefty tax. I was surprised it has the tax penalty for soft sugary drinks!

I personally am a connoisseur of energy drinks. I rely on caffeine for most of my projects at school and for late night coding sessions as well as marathon gaming. Although energy drinks can be considered a crutch, it's a lifestyle decision that many, many people embrace rather than attempt to avoid... I am one of these people.

That said, Guru Energy is fairly cheap ($1.25USD/can) if you buy it here off Amazon, it comes in the Redbull standard 8.3 fl/oz cans, and is shipped in a surprisingly lightweight and compact case (compare this to Monster, Rockstar, or any other brand with standard 16 fl/oz cans).

The taste, like Guru's website describes, is very indescribable. It is very sharp and light with a medium amount of carbonation. The caffeine buzz is more "natural"... it has more of an upslope and downslope rather than a sudden cracked out (which is arguably awesome too in its own respect) then big crash sort of feeling. This is because the caffeine in Guru is derived from 125mg of Guaranine (Guarana Herb) rather than synthetically separated then added. There is no mention about how much of the 125mg of Guaranine is real caffeine, but since Red Bull checks in at 80mg / 8.3oz it seems that Guru is in pretty good shape.

I think a particular good feature of Guru is that it uses cane sugar rather than high fructose corn syrup. I appreciate a good quality soda, particularly microbrew colas, and they often exclusively contain cane sugar.

So in summary, this energy drink is fairly cheap, good buzz, all natural, and great for coding, gaming, or studying.

Nice drink for a pick-me-up - refreshing and pleasant tasting.  Ideal replacement for a soda - the carbonation without all the sugar was perfectly satisfying!  Zero guilt!

The biggest question is DOES IT WORK?? 
The answer to your question is, YES! I was busy all day long and had the best energy I've had in awhile. It feels a lot better than using Redbull.. I'm very sensitive to caffeine so drinking it gives me a lot of energy I have no question about that. But this energy felt like I've slept the whole night without waking up and best bed ever. So pretty much I felt really good!! 
The taste isn't the best but it not a lot you drink so if you hate it a lot then just chug it. It's a little herbaly but not bad. Just different.

Coming from someone who at one point drank a decent amount of Monster Energy drinks, I can say that the GURU Organic Energy drink definitely makes me feel better after consumption. You still get a decent kick of caffeine, but there is less crap (i.e. less gnarly, processed ingredients) in it. I don't consume energy drinks often anymore, but I'd grab one of these if they are available the next time I want one.

I really enjoyed this energy drink. It kept me alert but not at all jittery. So many energy drinks leave me shaky and jittery but this one did not. A BIG bonus for me is that t does not have gross or unpronounceable ingredients in it- it is organic and naturally sweetened with only 10 calories. (This is the lite version- my store did not carry the original) It has a pleasant taste- not great but not bad.
When I need an energy drink again, I will definitely buy this one.

I really enjoyed the Organic Energy Drink by Guru. It was reminiscent of a Slurpee with a slight aftertaste of cough syrup. But the cough syrup taste was not overwhelming. It gave me energy like a normal energy drink would. It is a good-sized drink and has a total of 143 milligrams of caffeine which is only 20 milligrams less than the Monsters that I usually drink. I definitely recommend this and will be buying more.

After popping open the can, I had whiffs of the Red Bull scent. So I was quite surprised after tasting it. Not only did it not taste like Red Bull, it had a fruity flavor, which is a plus! I liked how it was carbonated and that all the ingredients were organic and natural. I tried the regular flavor which was a bit too sweet for me so the Lite may have been a better choice; nonetheless, the original was still pretty good. I do not know if I would recommend it since the sugar (30g) is quite high for one serving, but over other energy drinks, I would. It is probably the best tasting energy drink I have tried so far.

I drink a lot of coffee and a lot of energy drinks. This was was pretty good. It wasn't my favorite, but I enjoyed it. The flavor reminded me if two things. At first, it sort of reminded me of Coca-Cola. Then, the second half sort of reminded me of a 7-11 slurpee. Despite those connotations, it did not taste thick and sugary. It was pretty light and I felt great after drinking it.

Excellent taste and a good source of energy. If you don't care much about sugar content then don't get the lite because the normal one is pretty good too! The can packs a decent punch and the organic components of the product make me feel like I'm not wiring myself up on some synthetic creation that tastes like plastic. The product isn't priced the most competitively but maybe that is because I purchased it at bristol farms, I wouldn't be surprised if whole foods had it for a bit less. I enjoyed my Guru chilled but I totally see how it could be fine on the go at room temperature. Overall I'm happy with my guru experience.

I drink energy drinks often. I drink coffee daily.  With that being said,  guru is pretty good.  I didn't get the jitters like i usually do when trying a new drink for the first time,  so that was a definite plus.  It provided a nice energy boost.  The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the taste. I made the mistake of getting the Lite, so it's my fault but it taste 2 just like anything else that's considered "light", like it's missing an ingredient or mage with fake sugar.  Overall I was satisfied.

I don't usually buy traditional energy drinks because I prefer clean ingredients. This Guru energy drink is very clean (it's organic, too!), and has very low calories. I actually liked the taste a lot better than I thought I would but you can definitely taste the stevia. It's a little bitter but the lemon juice and added sugar help to balance that out. I did not notice a huge lift in energy but it did perk me up at work. I'd probably purchase this in the future to drink after lunch/early afternoon at work.

I really enjoyed the sustained, healthy energy this drink provided. Other energy drinks contain scary amounts of caffeine and vitamin B (like it could give you irregular heart rhythms scary) which causes an energy crash, This one takes a more natural approach. The result is a productive pep that does not make you feel (or seem) like you're on crack and it doesn't cause a sudden drop in energy either. The energizing ingredients are green tea extract, guarana seed, and ginseng. There is also echinacea which is great for the immune system. At first I found the stevia to be overwhelming, but the berry flavor presumably from the luo han guo fruit kept me sipping. I have a suspicion I would like the non-lite version a bit more, but this drink is great for those who are used to the powerful sweetness of stevia.

This seems to be a rarity of an energy drink that does not have awful additives in it!  It has no color and has a light, refreshing texture and slightly sweet taste, without being too much.  It has natural, organic ingredients that provide energy rather than artificial ones and no sugar alcohols (erythritol etc) which usually cause me problems.  I therefore felt a nice, natural energy boost without any discomfort.  Loved it!

While I occasionally consume energy drinks, I often worry about the ingredients in conventional varieties which are often made up of chemicals that I can hardly pronounce and rarely recognize. I wonder about the safety and potential effects on my health from those products, and I'm also not particularly fond of the often strongly artificial taste. As such. I was really interested in learning about and trying out Guru Organic Energy, which is made up of organic ingredients and naturally occurring caffeine. Given that I avoid calories in drinks, I chose the Lite version to try, and I was pleasantly surprised. The flavor was different, and although I wouldn't say it was delicious, it was refreshing and not as aversive as other energy drinks I've tried. I didn't feel a huge kick of energy, but caffeine rarely has a tremendous effect on me and I did feel alert if not energetic. Overall, I think the Guru Organic Energy Drink is a preferable choice for those looking for energy beverages over the typical energy drink laden with artificial ingredients. Although I'm not a regular connoisseur of energy drinks, the next time I want one I will choose Guru Organic. #trynatural

GURU Lite is very tasty and refreshing, especially on a hot day. Unlike most Stevia sweetened drinks, the taste is well balanced with no bitter aftertaste. There's a nice lemony flavor and the carbonation is on-point.

I don't usually drink energy drinks, but this one is an exception to the rule. It's organic, low calorie, non-GMO and contains ingredients that I can actually trust. Another big bonus I noticed is that I did not experience a crash afterwards. I read that this has to do with the fact that they use naturally-occurring caffeine from Green Tea and Guarana. I don't know why you would drink any other energy drink than this. Definitely loading up on these again soon!

This product is packed with good, natural ingredients, unlike most energy drinks out there, and still packs the same amount of caffeine! The flavor of this drink is somewhat like a gummy bear, although just slightly watered down from the flavors of other energy drinks, which I didn't mind. I have tried other natural energy drinks in the past which did not agree with me, however I did not have the same issues with this drink. I really enjoyed it. If there is one thing i could say about it, is there wasn't any selection at the store I went to. They had one flavor of the drink, in one size. The drink was also about a dollar more than comparable energy drinks. I would be most likely to buy this product if they offered a multi-pack with a small discount.

I wasn't super happy with the taste it was kind of bitter but just sweet enough that I didnt mind it after a few more sips. This drink definately gave me the boost I was hoping for. Not a jittery jolt but just enough to get me out of my slump. I was also happy to know I wasn't filling my body with harmful stuff to achieve that boost. I would recommend this product to friends, family, and co workers.

I purchased the Lite Guru instead or the regular because it only has 3g of sugar compared to the 37g in the regular one. I really enjoyed this energy drink. It has a great taste and it didn't make me jittery. It gave me just enough energy and I would purchase it again.

A good drink if you are able to find the lite version. The regular version is basically all sugar, which I do not like. The lite version is much better but harder to find. Taste is good, on par with other energy drinks. Not sure if being organic is worth the extra retail cost though.

Really good tasting product! The thing that stood out to me was that it tasted somewhat like redbull, but with a more pleasing aftertaste. It reminded me of cane sugar soda, but much healthier. There are 30g of natural sugar, which is better than most sodas, and there are few ingredients, all of them organic. My only issue was the manufacturer's coupon, which confused the cashier, and in the end, I had to pay sales tax. Other than that, I really enjoyed this experience.

To be honest, I've never been a fan of energy drinks. I usually choose to go with the shots like the 5-hours just because I chug it and it's done. The Guru Energy drink actually has a natural taste though compared to the other energy drinks on the market which is good. The only issue I have with this is availability, This drink is not available a lot of places, which makes it hard to purchase when you do want to indulge. All in all, this is a MUCH better choice for energy drinks, the taste is pleasant and it gave me a nice jolt with absolutely no crash. I would recommend trying this for sure if you could find it! Thanks for the opportunity to taste.

I bought the lite version because I try to stay away from high sugar beverages. I like that the lite only has 3g of sugar and is sweetened with stevia. I enjoyed the taste of the energy drink; it has a light and refreshing cherry flavor. I definitely noticed an increase in energy and alertness after about 15 minutes. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because it's still a little to sweet for me. I would buy it if I needed a quick boost of energy over other brands of energy drinks but I probably would not buy this on a regular basis since I currently purchase drinks like this only occasionally.

I am not a huge energy drink fan, due to the usual caffeinated cough syrup taste and often shakey feeling afterwards. However, with Guru I was actually pleasantly surprised! It tasted much better than other energy drinks that I have tried, and there wasn't such a drastic crash after the caffeine wore off. I like that I didn't experience any shakey feelings or feel ill after drinking. I will definitely be purchasing more when my coffee just isn't doing what I need.

The Guru Energy Drink is a great tasting alternative to other energy drinks. I'm primarily a Red Bull fan but I got to try the Guru Energy Drink.

All in all, 10/10 would buy again.

I don't usually drink energy drinks or coffee because they make my heart race and I get shaky but with half a can of this drink I didn't feel over-caffeinated.

The taste, like Guru's website describes, is very indescribable. It is very sharp and light with a medium amount of carbonation. The caffeine buzz is more "natural"... it has more of an upslope and downslope rather than a sudden cracked out (which is arguably awesome too in its own respect) then big crash sort of feeling. This is because the caffeine in Guru is derived from 125mg of Guaranine (Guarana Herb) rather than synthetically separated then added. There is no mention about how much of the 125mg of Guaranine is real caffeine, but since Red Bull checks in at 80mg / 8.3oz it seems that Guru is in pretty good shape.

I usually don't like energy drinks, because I can't deal with the carbonation. Guru Organic Energy Drink was a nice surprise, because the carbonation isn't that bad - I actually let it sit a little and it got a lot better. The taste is very fruity and mild, and I really like how sweet it is. I tried it on a day when I had to be out early, and it really helped me feeling up while running errands. I'd recommend it and buy it again.

There's two sizes. I used the larger sugar free one before starting my 8am shift. I drank it throughout my shift. I absolutely loved the taste of it! The price isn't to bad either. With some of the energy drinks out there at least this one you know is organic and better for you so it's worth it. Energy wise I def felt it when I first started drinking it. It wasn't overpowering but the right amount of energy. I usually sip it throughout my shift. The only problem I had with it was that after the half way point my energy was decreasing but I would definitely recommend it to my friends.

At first taste I thought it was a bit bitter and had a weird taste but the more I drank it, the better it began to taste. It was very smooth and not as gassy as red bull. I began to feel very energetic as the day went on. By nightfall it began to wore off and I was able to sleep like normal. It had no lasting effects like Red Bull or Monster drinks and it tasted real good.  I can see myself buying it again, especially because it has natural and organic ingredients. I would definitely recommend this energy drink to others.

I didn't know what to expect from this drink, what if the flavor was not as strong as other competitors? Or what if the effect was not as strong or at least the same? But having the promise that it is a natural product, and non-GMO why not giving it a chance? 
The result? It is great! As long as you drink it cold it is very refreshing, the flavor is delicious, and it really gives you a boost of energy, perfect for those moments when you need help to stay awake. Even when I got my coupon to get a free drink, I noticed the price is not that high, making it an even better option. 
I'm definitely buying it again, and I'm recommending it to both friends and family. It is a product of great quality and great flavor. It delivers what it promises and I'm a happy consumer.

It was pretty tasty and I felt it worked almost as good as other energy drinks. Perhaps a little less as well but I felt better about it being natural and that was worth the slightly smaller effect. It didn't make my heart beat too fast or give me any of the weird side effects other energy drinks sometimes do.

I actually tried the Original flavor, not the Lite, but I am interested in going back and trying the Lite. I enjoyed the Original very much, the flavor was not overpowering and medicine-y like some normal energy drinks can be. I also found myself having no real crash after drinking it and just continued about my day as normal.

Very enjoyable! Tastes like a fizzy mélange of Jolt Cola, Double Bubble and Sweetarts -  complex dark cola flavors dance on the palette alongside hints of bubblegum and citrus, zaps you with a refreshing nose-tingling tang. Nice strong caffeine buzz without the jitters. Highly recommended!

A great pick me up...... recommend this as a before workout drink so you can quickly burn the sugar.  I wish they used organic sugar vice corn syrup which is more in keeping with organic ingredients.  The Lite version uses Stevia which is much better.
I like the product and will continue to use as a pre-run supplement, but in the Lite version only.

I would like to point out first that it seems that only the "original" flavor is organic (if that is something that is important to you). It did have a slight Red Bull like taste but overall it is one of the better tasting energy drinks. It didn't make me super jittery but it did give me a lil extra pep to make it through a late night.

I just tried the regular version of the Guru Organic Energy drink and it was quite good. The flavor was sort of similar to a very mild grapefruit flavor. I do feel energized, but I don't feel ill like some energy drinks can make you feel. Guru is refreshing and reading the ingredients the first thing I see is sparkling water. There is nothing chemical or strange in this drink. I would definitely switch over to this from the other drinks I have tried. If you want something light, refreshing, and tasty pick one of these up!

This product worked so well for my energy level. I was dead drag button tired when I drank it and felt steady energy all day. I would give a higher score, but whoo that aftertaste was something else; however it's nothing unbearable, just a slight bitterness. The drink itself is sweet though, the bitterness only comes after. My husband will probably stick to his normal energy drink, but I like this one myself.

For a natural energy drink, Guru was great. I liked that I knew what I was putting in my body and that the lite version of this drink only has 5 calories. However, I don't feel like it amped me up as much as a "regular" energy drink. It was a great substitute for my morning coffee, but I wouldn't rely on it for an all-nighter.

As a monster fanatic and a diabetic I am always happy to try new energy drinks that will give me the energy I need without the sugar that I don't need. Guru is a great substitute for the sugary/no sugar energy drinks.

This is a great way to boost up your energy without any harmful chemicals of other energy drinks. I drank it early in the morning and it immediately gave me a boost of energy, like a cup of coffee usually does, and I did not feel a crash throughout the day. It lasts a good 10-12 hours, by the time I was ready for bed I slept soundly, definitely a great product!

This was a surprisingly pleasant beverage. I don't usually like energy drinks. Every now and again I break down and purchase one as an alternative to my usual coffee, but I'm not a big energy drink person. I think of them as having a rather off taste and an unpleasant effect on my heartbeat. This one, surprisingly, seemed to have neither of those. It was fresh tasting if you can believe it, and I found myself actually enjoying the flavor instead of merely tolerating it. The one detractor is that it did not seem to supply quite the same kick as a normal energy drink. The energy it did supply, however, came without heart palpitations or other unfortunate side effects, and for that I am quite grateful! I may not buy it often, but next time I reach for an energy drink I'll definitely reach for guru and I will not hesitate to suggest it to friends.

I'm glad that I was able to try this. It's honestly not to bad if you are looking for a more natural energy. But that being said there is some downsides. Natural Guarana has a steady rise of alertness and energy. But also comes with a sudden crash once it's all used up. That's because there are no synthetics that carry the Caffeine. The flavor is mellow yet sharp. Definitely has that "natural" flavor. All in all, it's not a bad drink. Definitely a plus for those looking for non synthetics and wanting natural energy.

I was a big coffee drinker until i realized how much sugar and creamer I was consuming in my 'cup of joe'. I also realized the energy crash later was due to my coffee fix. Discovering Guru was the perfect answer for me! The taste takes a little getting used to, (best ice cold) but the energy boost is just right and I don't seem to have the crash later. My son uses it for work-outs, and my employer and I swear it makes us happy! Also, I have gotten so I like the taste. Please don't ever stop making guru!

Not overpowering like most energy drinks that I buy. This has no B vitamins and doesn't taste like a vitamin B drink. Instead it has a real smooth lite flavor.

I like it, I would definitely recommend this product to help support the immune system. #trynatural

I must admit that I am always needing some sort of energy push, and I most definitely can become a connoisseur of energy drinks. Guru Natural Energy Drink came through 100%. The taste was not too sweet, and actually tasted like a flavorful light fruit beverage. Guru was not too heavy and I could feel the pick up immediately. Bottom line is this energy drink is great in taste, gives me the pick up I need, almost immediately, and does not hurt the pocket book, like so many other energy drinks.

I don't usually drink energy drinks since most are full of ingredients that can do more harm than good.  However, I recently attended an all day training for group fitness and I decided it to try out the GURU natural energy drink  to prepare me for the intense physical activities of the day.  Normally, I am sensitive to caffeine, but I didn't particularly feel any jitters or side effects when I drank GURU natural energy drink.  I liked the taste, which didn't have an aftertaste, as what I would expect...and it kept my energy going throughout the day.  Overall, I enjoyed trying this product out, and like that this is a healthier alternative energy drink than what's on the market.

Really surprised at the taste of this energy drink. The ones that I have tasted before were strong and the flavor was not very pleasant but this drink was different. The taste was so refreshing and energizing. Not too mention it's Vegan. I have found my new energy drink to take with me to give me that energy boost that we need every now and then.

This actually worked to give me energy. I work in a physically demanding environment, and after 12 hour days, I really just have enough for the commute and then to crash out when I get home. Not so great when I am the primary caretaker of an energetic toddler. Much to my relief, the GURU drink was offered and for me it was a must have.
It actually worked rather well. The taste was smooth and not funky like a lot of energy drinks tend to be. It gave me the energy to keep pushing as I drank it with my break meal. It takes a lot to pep me up, but surprisingly, this did. Kudos!

A slightly sweet and fizzy all natural energy drink that doesn't make you feel guilty about drinking it. The can was easy to hold and I liked the design on the label, it was very eye-catching. I liked how I felt like I was drinking a soda but without all the extra calories. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a quick and long-lasting pick me up.

When taking all factors into consideration this is best energy drink by I've had hands down. The taste is unique, not artificial at all. The effect is more of a smooth climb with a bonus increase in mental awareness. No initial energy jolt and no hard crash. That being said if you have been up for two days you will not reap the full benefits of any energy drink, get some sleep.

When taking all factors into consideration this is best energy drink by I've had hands down. The taste is unique, not artificial at all. The effect is more of a smooth climb with a bonus increase in mental awareness. No initial energy jolt and no hard crash because instead of just caffeine anhydrous, this uses a blend of guarana, ginseng, and gingko biloba for energy., I can easily say that GURU is among the very best. Using natural, organic ingredients (organic, vegan, no gluten, no GMO's) and natural caffeine, GURU manages to be tastier than most of the competition without having to resort a bevy of artificial flavors.I find the taste enjoyable,  It's not too harsh and has refreshing flavor.

I drink energy drinks on occasion but not all the time. I usually don’t like getting the jitters and some do cause jitters. I also hate the taste of some of them. I really wanted to try Guru because I have never had Organic energy drinks before. I decided to take one after returning from a trip in the afternoon and decided that I wanted to go to yoga that night but wasn’t sure if I had the energy for it. I took it about an hour before going to the gym I ran for 15 minutes and did an hour yoga class.  I was pleasantly surprised at how good it tasted. It had a light sparkling natural taste. I felt really great throughout my workout. I didn’t get this surge or jolt of energy, but I noticed that I didn’t feel tired at all. I also never got the jitters which was my biggest concern. I really like Guru. I'm very impressed.  I would recommend it to any of my friends.

I really loved this product, I am a huge fan of energy drinks. Most conventional ones contain so many terrible ingredients, so it's kind of hard to justify purchasing them. It took a while for me to get a hold of this product since the store is a bit far, I wish they sold this in more locations. I really enjoyed it, it was sweet; but not overwhelming need water feel. It was very smooth and fizzy, and it didn't contain stevia. I usually hate natural organic drinks that contain stevia since they give me a headache; this product didn't do that. I enjoyed every minute of it and didn't want it to end. I would completely recommend this to everyone, I will purchase it on occasion since it's a bit higher in price; although I can justify paying higher for a healthier alternative. Overall I was beyond impressed, I was very surprised by the quality; I truly enjoyed it.

This was a great pick-me-up for a busy day. It didn't give a jolt of caffeine like some other brands, but gave me a little boost. The flavor was crisp and fresh, not thick and syrupy like some other energy drinks. I love that it's sweetened with Stevia instead of a chemical sweetener!

I have tried many different energy drinks in the past & Guru fits right in with the rest of them. The plus side is that this did not taste any different than non natural products. Bubbly with a smooth flavor. I felt awake after drinking it without having any of the "bloated" feeling afterward that some dinks leave me feeling. Overall I was very pleased and would recommend especially if you only want to drink natural energy drinks.

Low calorie natural energy drink. You can not beat it! The taste is not the greatest but what energy does. Thank you for the energy provided!
