Frequently Asked Questions




See below for the most commonly asked questions. If you have any additional questions please contact us at meow@prettylitter.co (not .com) or give us a call at (800) 838-3381.

◄What are the instructions for using Pretty Litter?

Pour the entire contents of the Pretty Litter bag in to a clean litter box. Ensure at least two inches of depth covers the entire surface of the litter box.
PrettyLitter absorbs urine and traps odor. The water in the urine evaporates, hygienically sealing the urine in the tiny microgels.
Remove your cat's feces every day. With the feces sitting in the scooper, shake the remaining litter in the scooper back over the litter box to retain the litter granules. Throw the feces away. Only toss the feces.  The urine moisture evaporates.
Thoroughly mix the litter every day to avoid saturating the same spots in the litter box that cats prefer to urinate in. Thoroughly mixing the litter will make it easier for you to spot color change and keep PrettyLitter's health indicators operating at full capacity.
PrettyLitter granules will continue to be effective throughout the month, evaporating moisture allowing more urine to be absorbed and odors continuously trapped. PrettyLitter health indicators will work just as well on Day 20 as it does on Day 1.
After a month's use, empty the entire litter box content in to a trash bag. If there is any residue on the bottom of the litter box, clean the litter surface before pouring in your new supply of PrettyLitter.
Regularly check the color of the litter. Shades of dark yellow and olive green are an indication of normal health. If you notice any other colors thoroughly mix the litter and monitor your cat's PrettyLitter closely over the next 24 to 48 hours. If color change persists you should consider consulting your Veterinarian.


◄How does 4 pounds of litter last an entire month?

PrettyLitter uses highly absorbent silica microcrystals. Silica is a naturally occurring element that traps odors, absorbs liquid and evaporates humidity. With tens of thousands of highly absorbent microcrystals in each PrettyLitter bag, your cat can continue to urinate in the litter all month long without needing to toss it out. The urine's odor is trapped and the moisture evaporates. All you need to do is toss the feces out. As a result, PrettyLitter doesn't need to clump because you do not need to throw out the urine. Its moisture evaporates in the microcrystals. Compare that to clumping clay litter. Clumping clay litter known as bentonite clay forms clumps through a chemical bonding process when liquid is introduced. As you toss the clumps out you are also tossing the litter attached to it. As a result, you need to keep replenishing the litter box with more litter throughout the month. On average, it takes close to 20 pounds of clay clumping litter to provide a one month supply in one litter box. In addition to the extra weight, clay clumping litter is dusty and awful at scent control. That dust can be harmful to you cat's respiratory system. Also, clumping clay clogs our landfills. PrettyLitter's silica microcrystals are low-dust in the litter box and is safe for your cat.

◄What do the colors indicate?

PrettyLitter color changes may indicate a host of potential health issues all of which are detected through urine.
Red: Detection of blood which may indicate Feline Lower Urinary Tract Disorder (FLUTD), bladder stones/crystals, kidney stones, bladder inflammation, certain types of kidney disease and clotting disorders. In rarer cases it can also mean bladder cancer, an internal injury, poison ingestion, and/or if it's a female cat over four months old who hasn't been spayed, she may be in heat. Blue: High alkaline which may indicate certain types of urinary tract infections.Bright Green: Abnormal acidity which may indicate certain metabolic disorders.
Any color other than a golden yellow or olive green may mean you need to take your cat to your local Veterinarian. 
Sometimes temporary color changes can occur as a result of a new diet, changes in environment or temporary stresses that may cause a cat's pH levels to elevate or drop. If you see a color change, observe the litter over the next 24 to 48 hours. If the color change persists, consider taking your cat to their Veterinarian for a wellness visit. Use the color changes above as a guide to point your Vet in the right direction. Only a licensed Veterinarian can diagnose any specific issue.




◄Is PrettyLitter safe for my cat?

Pretty Litter is feline-safe and eco-friendly. The litter is not absorbed by the bowel, does not swell in the presence of humidity and poses no risk in blocking the digestive tract. In contact with water and gastric fluid it will become a very fine powder and will be eliminated naturally. Even in cases of involuntary ingestion, Pretty Litter presents no danger and is safe.

◄Can PrettyLitter be used for multi-cat households?

Absolutely. In fact, many Pretty Litter customers are multi-cat homes. If you have more than one cat sharing the same litter box and you see a color change, Pretty Litter recommends having a spare litter box and bag of Pretty Litter available so can temporarily separate your little ones' bathroom use to isolate and easily identify which cat may be having an issue. 

◄Is it possible to buy more than four bags at a time? Does PrettyLitter have bulk discounts?

Absolutely. PrettyLitter supplies large multi-cat homes, catteries, rescues, hospitals and shelters across the country. If you are interested in a bulk discount rate or a one year supply of PrettyLitter at a discounted rate just send an email to meow@prettylitter.co and we will get back to you the same day. Please note that's meow@prettylitter.co not .com

◄My bag of PrettyLitter has an orange or yellow tint to it. Is that normal?

That is completely normal, you have nothing to worry about. The tint you see is just the distribution of the health indicators within the white litter. Some bags vary in their tint but your batch is totally fine and working at full capacity. If the health indicators detect an issue and there is a color change from your cat's urine, you'll clearly see it regardless of any tint.

◄What size litter box is PrettyLitter designed for?

Each bag of PrettyLitter is designed for a medium or "average" size litter box. Typically that measures to 15" long and 11" wide. It will provide two inches of depth. If you use a larger litter box you may want to consider buying an extra bag in order to have extra litter to provide proper surface depth.



◄How many bags do I need?

Each bag of PrettyLitter is designed to last one month for one cat in a medium size litter box. If you have several cats sharing the same litter box, fill that litter box with each bag representing each cat. For example, if three cats share an extra large litter box, pour three bags of PrettyLitter into that box. It will last you one month for your three cats.

◄Is PrettyLitter diagnostic?

When you see a change in color you should monitor your cat's health closely and if color change persists you should consult your local veterinarian. PrettyLitter provides a possible early detection for illness, not a diagnosis. A diagnosis can only come from a licensed Veterinarian. If you experience a color change, wait 24 to 48 hours and continue to monitor your cat’s litter. If the color change persists then take your cat to your local Veterinarian.


◄Is my purchase automatically enrolled in automatic shipping every month?

PrettyLitter is a litter club and monthly auto-shipment is designed to provide convenience for our customers, never needing to think about litter again. We're already providing you the best litter out there, so check this off your monthly shopping list. If you would like to opt-out of auto-renewals you can easily manage your account through our website and cancel anytime.  You can also call us at (800) 838-3381 and we'll cancel it for you. 

◄Is it possible for the color to change even if nothing is wrong?

Cats are sensitive creatures and their health can be affected by normal life events like a change in food, weather or short-term stress. These circumstances can make its way to a cat’s urine affecting its pH levels. We suggest monitoring your cat’s PrettyLitter to see if color change persists. If after 24 to 48 hours color change persists, PrettyLitter recommends taking your cat to your local Veterinarian. PrettyLitter will absorb urine, eliminate odor and evaporate moisture during a healthy product lifecycle. When PrettyLitter is at the end of its life cycle because the month is expiring or there isn't enough litter in the litter box to absorb urine and evaporate moisture, the urine can pool at the bottom of the litter box becoming concentrated and causing a reaction that changes the bottom of the litter blue. If you notice the litter is exhibiting signs of slush or turning a blue color, it may be time to change your litter. If you have not gotten a full month life cycle out of PrettyLitter and are experiencing saturation concerns, please contact us about adding more PrettyLitter to your litter box.

◄Will my cat have any problem using PrettyLitter?

Any issues with your cat using Pretty Litter are highly unlikely. PrettyLitter is safe, natural and feels like most litters. Whenever you switch litters it is normal if your cat takes a day or two to adapt. While very rare, if you experience any issue with your cat adapting to PrettyLitter start by filling the litter box with 50% of their old litter and 50% PrettyLitter. Gradually your cat will become used to PrettyLitter and you can stop adding their old litter.

◄How much of Pretty Litter should I use to last a month?

PrettyLitter’s 4-lb bags last an entire month for a medium sized cat. Just pour the entire bag in to your freshly cleaned litter box. It is recommended to use at least 2 inches depth lining the litter tray. Fortunately, an insufficient amount of litter depth will not influence PrettyLitter’s functionality. Either way, it’s best for your cat to have at least 2 inches of depth which one bag of PrettyLitter will provide for a medium sized cat in a litter box fitting their size.

◄Will PrettyLitter work in my self cleaning automated litter box?

PrettyLitter works in most automated self-cleaning boxes. PrettyLitter's microgels have the texture of sand and is similar in texture to fine crystal litters. As long as your automated box can work with other crystal litters, PrettyLitter will work great in an automated self-cleaning litter box.

◄What if my cat is bigger than a medium sized cat?

If your cat is larger and you have a larger litter box as a result, then buy an extra bag of PrettyLitter and use just half of that bag along with the first bag. If you have a cat that loves to dig, that extra bag will get you to at least 3 inches of litter lining the surface of the tray.

◄What do I do with the waste?

PrettyLitter traps the urine and odor while releasing the moisture. The only waste you need to dispose of is solid excrement. When in contact with PrettyLitter, the humidity in excrement is immediately absorbed, which traps odors and dries up the feces making it easier to remove with a litter scoop. Just throw it away like you normally would.

◄How is it that PrettyLitter is so much lighter than most other kitty litters?

PrettyLitter’s patented technology traps odors and urine and has an absorption rate of 150%. What that means is PrettyLitter can be used over and over throughout a month to trap odors and liquid. That is why PrettyLitter avoids the need to be a clumping litter. Clumping Litter turns urine into larger hard clumps that need to be consistently thrown out. This requires more litter, making bags heavier and your need to replace litter more frequently. PrettyLitter only requires you to dispose of fecal waste so our non-clumping formula lasts an entire month at just 3-lbs a bag. Compare that to two trips to the market each month accumulating 20-lbs of litter. Pretty Litter saves you hassle and money.

◄How do I make sure I am using PrettyLitter correctly?

PrettyLitter is designed for very easy use. But to ensure that you have a full one-month supply without odors you need to remove feces frequently, using your scooper to remove any excess litter allowing it to fall back into the litter box. Once you’ve removed the waste just thoroughly mix the litter with your scooper.
Cats have a tendency of urinating in the same area of the litter box; therefore it is necessary to mix the litter so that it is not always the same granules that receive urine.
The yellow color of the crystals may cause you to think that they are no longer efficient but it’s not true. PrettyLitter crystals stay yellow because the pigments, ammonia and the odors are trapped but the humidity evaporates and the granule is functional again. Just use the litter like you normally would for a month by disposing of cat feces frequently and mixing the litter.

◄If the color change tracks outside the litter box, will color get on the floor?

PrettyLitter silica gels absorb and traps urine and changes color internally. If any litter makes its way outside the litter box the color is trapped inside the granules. There is no issue with color getting on anything.

◄Where is PrettyLitter made and what are its ingredients?

PrettyLitter is created, designed and shipped from California. PrettyLitter is manufactured in one of the world's largest and most trusted cat litter plants based in China from silica gel using carefully selected silica mineral sources. In addition, our manufacturing facility uses the highest quality controls and leaves a low carbon foot print.  Silica gel is translucent, micro-pored structure, that is a raw material derived from silica, a naturally occurring mineral. The silica gels are additionally dried and screened, forming the macro-pored silica gel which is used as a highly efficient and clean absorbent.  Our patented health indicators are distributed at an exact ratio within the silica gels to test for acidity, alkalinity, and blood levels.  The health indicators are made from natural materials that use a reagent to create the color change if abnormalities are detected.

◄Do you have international shipping?

For international destinations, the price of shipping will depend on the country and be calculated at checkout.

Why is PrettyLitter Better?






Save money.
Did you know, on average, cat owners spend $22 a month on litter? That $11 bag of litter you buy only lasts on average 2 weeks. PrettyLitter costs less than brand name litter because one bag lasts longer. It works so well, a single 4-pound bag lasts an entire month per cat.



	
		"I've been using this stuff since January, and I love it. One bag for one month with one cat is spot on accurate."
		Kristin A., Los Angeles, CA













It's easier.
PrettyLitter's formula makes it easier for you to use and clean your litter box. Its highly absorbent crystals do not clump, but instead absorbs moisture, traps all odor, and eliminates the urine. That means less work, no odor and less mess. Only scoop the poop!

Less Scooping
Less Dust And Mess
80% Lighter













It keeps tabs on your cat's health by changing color.
All cats are notorious for hiding any illness, so it's often hard to tell if they are sick or in pain. PrettyLitter makes it easy for you to know if your cat is experiencing a health issue before urgent medical care is needed, saving you money, stress and potentially your cat's life. Most common indications are:


Alkaline
						Urinary tract infection, kidney issues.
					

Acidity
						Crystal formations, urinary blockage.
					

Blood
						Internal injury, poison ingestion.

		Denise A., Carney's Pt. NJ

It lasts longer.
PrettyLitter's revolutionary formula means a single 4-pound bag lasts you an entire month. Unlike clumping litter, PrettyLitter absorbs and then eliminates moisture which means you do not need to keep replenishing your litter throughout the month.




	
	
		"I started using Pretty Litter a few months ago, and I'll never go back to clumping litter. This stuff is awesome."
		Anna H, Mason OH
















The best at odor control.
PrettyLitter is odorless and scentless.  When in contact with urine, it traps the odor and then eliminates the moisture. With PrettyLitter, you'll never smell your cat's dirty business again.



	
		"They took to it right away. I love the fact that there is no more smell!!!"
		Elizabeth C, Fremont, CA











Its cleaner and safer.
Did you know that clumping litter uses a chemical agent to create the scoopable clump? When your cat licks their paws the chemical expands within your cat's digestive tract. PrettyLitter uses non-clumping crystals made from naturally occurring minerals that is safe for cats, even if they breathe it or digest it.

Made from natural minerals.
Chemical - free.
Eco-friendly and biodegradable.

















Delivered straight to your front door, every month. We'll pay your shipping.
No more last minute trips to the grocery store or hauling heavy boxes of litter home. PrettyLitter simply arrives at your doorstep right when you need it. Cross that chore off your list forever. No more lifting heavy litter again.




	
		"I've been using this stuff since January, and I love it. One bag for one month with one cat is spot on accurate."

It gives you peace of mind.
"Having lost my cat to an illness, it was a heart breaking experience watching her get ill without having been able to help her early on. I created PrettyLitter to give cat owners the power to keep daily tabs on their cats wellbeing."

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Pretty Litter 
 


Published: 2015.11.17 09:00 AM




Pretty Litter’s product of the same name is a low-cost, lightweight cat litter designed to diagnose a cat’s health issues. If a cat’s health is normal, the litter color will range from pale white to dark yellow, the normal color of urine; if the litter changes to any other color than yellow or to an olive green, then it’s an indication something might be wrong and the pet owner should consult a veterinarian, according to the company.
