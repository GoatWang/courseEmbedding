	Board of Directors



Our Leadership
  The success of The Jewish Federation depends largely on our leadership team of professionals and volunteers. This group works to meet the needs of our community by providing resources and raising support as needed. Volunteer  Julie B. Platt – Chair of the Board Rochelle Cohen – Vice Chair of the Board Frank Maas – Vice Chair of the Board Albert Z. Praw – Vice Chair of the Board Jesse Sharf – General Campaign Chair  Debi Graboff – Sylvia Weisz Women's Philanthropy Co-Chair  Kathy Guccione- Sylvia Weisz Women's Philanthropy Co-Chair  Jill Namm – Valley Alliance Chair George Hess – Valley Alliance Campaign Co-Chair  Lisa Hess – Valley Alliance Campaign Co-Chair   Professional  Jay Sanderson – President & CEO Andrew Cushnir – Executive Vice President – Chief Development Officer  Becky Sobelman-Stern – Executive Vice President – Chief Program Officer  Carol Koransky – Executive Vice President and Executive Director Valley Alliance Ivan Wolkind – Chief Operating and Financial Officer    Julie B. Platt Chair of the Board  Julie Platt has held top leadership roles within our Federation’s Sylvia Weisz Women’s Campaign, including serving as Chair, and was honored with the Lion of Judah Ruby Award for her commitment to community service. Prior to being named Chair of the Board, she served as General Campaign Chair and was previously Chair of our Federation’s Ensuring the Jewish Future Strategic Initiative. Julie is a member of our Federation’s Executive Committee, as well as the Executive Committee of the Jewish Federations of North America. She also serves as a member of the Board of Directors of the Foundation for Jewish Camp.  Julie’s lifelong connection with the Jewish community began at Camp Ramah in Ojai, and today she’s a driving force in raising funds to subsidize tuition for Jewish summer camps, allowing more families to afford this transformative experience for their children.  Outside of the Jewish world, Julie is actively involved with, and an avid supporter of, the University of Pennsylvania, where she graduated and met her husband, Marc. She currently serves as Penn Alumni president.  Julie and Marc have five children, a son-in-law and three young grandchildren. Back to the Top ↑  Rochelle Cohen Vice Chair of the Board  Rochelle Cohen grew up in what she describes as a “Federation household” and has been involved in The Jewish Federation for more than 20 years. Her parents, long-time Federation leaders Janet & Jake Farber, stressed the importance of involvement. Rochelle participated in our Federation’s Super Sunday as a child and then, when she had a family of her own, she decided she had to get involved more directly and give back to the community.   Rochelle serves on the Board and Executive Board of Directors of The Jewish Federation, and has held such important positions for the Valley Alliance as Chair, Vice Chair, President of the Women’s Department, and Women’s Campaign Chair.   What touches Rochelle about her Federation involvement is the contact with people. Rochelle also cherishes her strong ties to Israel. She lived there for four years and has been involved in the Federation’s Tel Aviv/Los Angeles Partnership Steering Committee because she believes the connection between Israel and L.A. is so critical.  Rochelle lives in Sherman Oaks with her husband, Freddy, and has three children, Maya, Karen and Yoni. Back to the Top ↑  Frank Maas Vice Chair of the Board  Francis S Maas is president of F.S. Maas & Company Incorporated, a real estate investment and management firm with holdings in industrial facilities, art studios and multi-tenant residential properties.  Prior to devoting full time to his real estate investments, Mr. Maas practiced law, specializing in real estate transactional matters as a partner in the law firm of Levinson, Lieberman & Maas.  Frank has served on the Board and Executive Committee of the Jewish Federation Council for over 35 years, and is currently a Vice Chair. During those years his leadership positions at the Federation included Secretary of the Board and numerous years as a Vice Chair.  Frank served as President of the Metropolitan Region, Chair of Planning and Allocations, Chair of Budget and Finance as well as many other committees.  In addition, he served as a Vice Chair of the United Jewish Fund and Chair of Legal Services Division and the Business and Professions Division of the annual campaign.  Frank is a past Chair of the Board of the American Jewish University and continues to serve on the AJU’s Executive Committee. He is a member of the Advisory Board of the Jewish Community Foundation and is a Board member on several charitable foundations.  Frank was the first recipient of the Federation’s Bruce I. Hochman Maimonides Torch of Justice award and was honored with a Doctor of Humane Letters (HC) degree from the University of Judaism.  Frank, a native of California, is a graduate of the University of California, Berkeley and received his law degree from the University of Southern California. He is married to Virginia and they are the parents of Monique, married to Bradley Gibbons, and Michael, married to Theresa, and are the proud grandparents of Barry and Emilie.  Each member of the family is also involved in various aspects of the Jewish and general communities. Back to the Top ↑  Albert Z. Praw Vice Chair of the Board  Albert Z. Praw is the Executive Vice President, Real Estate and Business Development, of KB Home, Inc., one of the largest homebuilders in the United States. Albert joined KB Home, Inc. over 25 years ago, and previous to that he was a partner of Sidley & Austin, a national law firm, specializing in real estate transactions and finance.   Albert previously served as our Federation’s Chair of the Finance & Administration Committee, and was a member of the Budget Subcommittee. Albert is also a member of our Executive Committee. Albert’s other involvements in the community include serving as President of Stephen S. Wise Temple, a member of the Board of Directors of Jewish Big Brothers Big Sisters, a member of the Board of Directors of Shaare Zedek Hospital of Jerusalem, a member of the Board of Governors of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, a graduate of the National Young Leadership Cabinet, and a member of the Urban Land Institute.   Albert graduated with honors from University of California, Berkeley, and then received his law degree from UCLA Law School and graduated with Order of Coif honors. Albert and his wife of 43 years, Heidi (a Lion of Judah), are the proud parents of Douglas (married to Dr. Stephanie Smooke Praw), Michael (married to Gantry Praw), Jonathan (married to Darcy Praw) and Dr. Rebecca Praw Share (married to Dr. Michael Share), and the proud grandparents of Maya, Alexandra, Andrew and Jackson.  Back to the Top ↑  Kathy Guccione Valley Alliance Women's Campaign Chair  Kathy Guccione first joined the Board of the Valley Alliance Women’s Department in 2006. Since that time, she has served our Women’s Campaign in a variety of positions. Passionate about the work we do as a Federation, Kathy was honored with the Valley Alliance Women’s Department’s Campaign Award in 2011, given to an individual who has distinguished herself by showing an endless commitment to raising funds for The Jewish Federation. Leading by example, she is a Lion of Judah at the Ruby level.   Prior to her involvement with our Federation, Kathy was very active at Milken Community High School, Stephen S. Wise Temple and Women’s American ORT. Kathy has participated in several Federation missions to Israel including women’s missions in 2007, 2008 and 2013, and on our Centennial Mission to Israel with her husband, Michael.  Kathy and one of her daughters, Stephanie, recently started a business venture together — Pinot’s Palette in Valencia. Kathy’s other daughter, Melissa, is a rabbi in New York. She and Michael also have two sons, Jeremy and David.   Back to the Top ↑  Jay Sanderson President & CEO  Jay Sanderson is President and CEO of The Jewish Federation of Greater Los Angeles and is responsible for its tremendous transformation.  He has been professionally active in the Jewish community for twenty-seven years and offers a wealth of knowledge and experience in new and old media as well as evolving communications technologies.  Jay is recognized as one of America’s leading entrepreneurs and has over 30 years of experience transforming non-profit organizations, and was named to the Forward 50 list.

In 2007, he led JTN’s broadband Initiative, JewishTVNetwork.com, the only fully Jewish video website on the internet, attracting over 1.75 million unique visitors and hosting the largest Kol Nidre service ever. Jay lives in Encino, California, and is married to Laura Lampert Sanderson.  They have two children, Jonah and Isabelle.  Back to the Top ↑  Andrew Cushnir Executive Vice President and Chief Development Officer  Andrew is The Jewish Federation’s Executive Vice President and Chief Development Officer.

He has also led the Federation’s community relations and social services teams, the Planning & Allocations Department, and he began his Federation career as Director of Business Divisions and New Business Initiatives. Before becoming a full-time Jewish community professional, Andrew practiced law at Manatt, Phelps, and Phillips and in the in-house department of SunAmerica Inc. At SunAmerica, he also was the Director of Public Affairs.  Prior to law school Andrew participated in the Coro Fellowship Program, was a Legislative Fellow with the California State Assembly, and served as an assistant director in the Anti-Defamation League’s Los Angeles office.   While practicing law, he was an active Jewish community and civic volunteer leader. He was involved in the design and implementation of The Jewish Federation’s Access young leadership program and later served as Chair of the Federation’s Leadership Development Council, which brought together all of the young leadership programs under the Federation’s banner. He was in the 1997-1999 Los Angeles class of the Wexner Heritage Foundation, as well as a member of the National Young Leadership Cabinet for the Jewish Federations of North America. He has been active in Adat Shalom synagogue where he served as President and Chairman of the Board. Andrew has also served in a number of leadership capacities on the board of the environmental organization, TreePeople. Andrew is married to Sharon Spira-Cushnir, a nonprofit executive.

Becky has spent much of her career working in the Federation system. She started at UJA-Federation of New York (UNITED JEWISH APPEAL) as the Director of the University Programs Department, and moved on to be a Regional Women's Division Director and then the Western Region Director.  During this period, Becky traveled overseas on many missions with donors and Federation investors to convey the impact of their philanthropy. Most recently, Becky served as Vice President of Consulting & Community Development at the Jewish Federations of North America (JFNA), where her leadership was fundamental in energizing 154 Jewish Federations to enhance community impact and Jewish identity programs, foster dynamic connections with Israel, and care for Jews in need. A strong proponent of philanthropy, Becky also volunteers with Freedom School of the Children’s Defense Fund, a literacy program that empowers children to make a difference, both within their own families, and in the greater community. Becky is married to Rabbi Ron Stern, a rabbi at Stephen Wise Temple.

Back to the Top ↑  Ivan Wolkind Chief Operating and Financial Officer  With twenty years of experience in finance and operations, Wolkind’s goal is to help steer the Federation toward a sound financial future, allowing it to make an even greater impact in the local community, Israel and around the world. His experience in finance and operations within the for-profit sector, both domestically and internationally, provide the external perspective to help the Federation operate more efficiently. Prior to the Federation, Wolkind has served as Chief Financial Officer and in other leadership positions with publically and privately held companies, primarily in the technology arena. Most recently he was CFO and COO at Cosmic Toast Studios, a content development company for film and television.

A Community for Professionals in Private Capital



































Leslie Bider Leaves ITU Ventures


August 12, 2008
By PEHub Administrator






Leslie Bider has been named CEO of PinnacleCare, a private health advisory firm. He previously was chief strategist at ITU Ventures and, before that, was chairman and CEO of Time Warner's music publishing arm.   PRESS RELEASE   PinnacleCare, the premier private health advisory firm, announced today the appointment of former Chairman and CEO of Warner/Chappell Music Inc. Leslie E. Bider to the position of Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Bider most recently served as Chief Strategist of ITU Ventures, a leading Los Angeles based venture capital firm. Prior to his recent positions within the investment industry, Mr. Bider served as Chairman and CEO of Warner/Chappell Music, the music publishing arm of Time Warner, Inc.  “Les Bider has incredible experience spanning over 30 years as both a leader and innovator in providing unique services to clients with high expectations who seek the best,“ said PinnacleCare Chairman Bruce Spector. “We look to Les's leadership as we continue to expand our global membership base of individuals, families and business executives who are proactively seeking to safeguard their health and well-being through our trusted health advisory services,“ added Spector.  “Since meeting the founders and experiencing first hand as a member the value of the high touch service PinnacleCare provides, I feel especially fortunate to be associated with the company, and look forward to taking a primary role to spearhead its global expansion,“ said Bider.  From 1987 until 2005, Les played a significant role in the establishment of Warner/Chappell Music through the merger of Warner Bros. Music with the Chappell and Intersong Music Group. Prior to the merger, Mr. Bider was the Chief Operating Officer of Warner Bros. Music, where he was responsible for all worldwide operations and a critical driver of the company's global expansion, including the acquisition of the 20th Century Fox Music catalog that strengthened movie and television licensing revenues. During the time he presided over Warner/Chappell, the company grew from a $30 million a year business to one generating over half a billion dollars a year. He started in 1981 at Warner Bros. Music as Chief Financial Officer after founding and managing Bider & Montgomery, an accounting practice that serviced the media and entertainment industry.  In addition to his corporate duties, Mr. Bider serves on the boards of several publicly traded companies including Douglas Emmett Inc. (NYSE:DEI); OSI Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:OSIS); California Pizza Kitchens Inc. (NASDAQ:CPKI), and 1st Century Bank, N.A. (OTCBB:FCTY). A recipient of the Abe Oleman Publishers Award from the Songwriters Hall of Fame, Mr. Bider is actively involved with many not-for-profit organizations including the MusiCares Foundation, Bogart Pediatric Cancer Research Program, the Wallis Annenberg Center for Performing Arts, and Hebrew Union College, among others. Mr. Bider received his Masters Degree from Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and a BS in accounting from the University of Southern California.  About PinnacleCare  PinnacleCare is the leading private health advisory company, providing its members with teams of dedicated advisors to manage family and executive healthcare, access world-renowned specialists, provide the world's most advanced medical research, coordinate appointments, collect and maintain medical records online and help members enact proven preventive strategies for optimum longevity and health. PinnacleCare serves over 3,000 members worldwide and has offices throughout the United States and abroad. For more information, visit http://www.PinnacleCare.com.
