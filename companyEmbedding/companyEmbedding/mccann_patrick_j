These individuals provide diagnoses and treatments for a wide variety of ailments, and preventative care and early detection for more serious illnesses. Whether you love or hate going to the doctor, the fact is your physician is there to listen to your health concerns, take preventative measures against diseases and advise you on your options for staying in tip-top shape.In 2013, there were more than 1 million doctors of medicine in the U.S., over 854,000 of which were active. Additionally, in 2012, there were about 18,000 active general surgeons in the country. It's important to know which type of physician or surgeon you need, how to choose the best one, and account for other considerations in order to stay healthy.Different Types of PhysiciansPatients can choose from a wide variety of physicians depending on doctor specialty and what problems they are experiencing. Here are a few of the most common types of physicians that you may see in your lifetime:General Practitioner
Your GP is the doctor that you go to for regular checkups, vaccines and to identify health issues. GPs can treat many different illnesses and injuries, from the common cold to a broken arm. If your health requires a second opinion or expert care, the GP will refer you to a specialist who has the skills to focus in on the issue.Cardiologist
Heart attacks and heart disease are some of the most common afflictions seen across the country, making cardiologists important to your long-term health. These physicians specialize in studying and treating the heart and related diseases.Dentist
Other than a GP, the dentist is likely the most common physician you'll ever see. These professionals work with the human mouth, ensuring that your teeth and gum health are up to par. Patients typically go to the dentist twice a year.Dermatologist
Dermatologists are focused on skin-related issues and diseases, from skin cancers, to acute acne, eczema, psoriasis, and general cosmetic concerns like aging and scars. Most will also perform annual or semi-annual mole checks to screen for any signs of melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer.ENT
If you have a number of sinus infections or have had your tonsils taken out, you've likely seen an ENT specialist. ENTs handle ailments related to the ear, nose and throat, often related to taking out tonsils and treating hearing issues.OB/GYN
For many women, their gynecologist and obstetrician are the same person. These professionals work with the female reproductive system to focus on reproductive health, fertility issues, prenatal care, options for new and expectant mothers, neonatal care and childbirth. OB/GYNs can also help in the early detection of breast or cervical cancer.Choosing a PhysicianThere are obviously a number of physicians that you can choose from, but how do you know if they're the best choice for you? Here are a few considerations to help you pick a physician:Look at Your Insurance
Before you get down to the details, you need to verify which doctors are covered by your insurance and whether they are in or out of your carrier's network. Rates may be cheaper if the doc is in network – a doctor can be covered by your insurance but not necessarily in network. Out of network is typically more expensive. Doctors often add and drop plans, so it's important to ensure that your options are compatible with your insurance plan. Doing your homework will help you avoid unexpected expenses. Check for Board Certification
Your physician should be certified through the American Board of Medical Specialties. Doctors must earn a medical degree from a qualified school, complete three to seven years of residency training, be licensed by a state medical board and pass one or more ABMS exams to be certified.Examine the Reviews
Reviews of a doctor can reveal a lot about what your experience may be like. People may grade on staff friendliness, availability and effectiveness of treatment. Looking at these evaluations and getting recommendations from family and friends can direct you toward a physician for your needs.Choosing a SurgeonSurgeons can literally hold your life in their hands, and it's important to find the best one that can put you at ease and treat you effectivelyCompatibility Factor
You need to feel comfortable with your surgeon. It's important to communicate your concerns and that your surgeon can respond adequately. Surgeons should be willing to go over the details of your procedure and answer any questions that you may have. They must take the time to discuss and address your worries.Expertise Level
If you're going in for surgery, you want someone that knows what they're doing and has a high success rate. Ask how often the surgeon performs this surgery and try to find one that regularly does it. This will give you peace of mind that you're in capable hands.Understanding Your InsuranceYour decision on a physician or surgeon can be majorly affected by the insurance plan you have. You may have insurance through employment, your spouse, your parents if you're under 26, or the marketplace if the previous options don't apply to you. It's important to understand how your insurance works to have the full picture of what you'll need to pay for.Your insurance will have a deductible, which is the amount that you're responsible to pay for covered medical expenses. Some plans have coinsurances, where you must pay a certain percentage of the bill, and insurance will cover the rest. Co-pays state a flat rate for certain services, like paying $20 when you visit your GP or a $100 co-pay for an emergency room visit. Once you reach your out-of-pocket maximum, which will differ if you're an individual or within a family plan, your insurance may pay for 100 percent of covered medical expenses for the rest of the plan year.If you plan to go to the doctor, need medication or have been recommended for surgery, call your insurance provider or go online to see what your plan covers. You can choose the best doctor for your needs, understand your options and prevent yourself from being blindsided by medical expenses.Setting Your AppointmentMost doctors require a phone call for an appointment, although some may provide online scheduling as well. Be sure to have your insurance card with you when you set an appointment, and to bring it with you to the actual appointment. They need the ID numbers to verify your coverage, and will usually make a copy of the card for their files so you don't have to show it again unless your insurance changes.When you call, let them know if you're a new patient, as this will require you to complete some paperwork for your first visit. Tell them the reason for your visit, such as your symptoms if you're feeling sick. It's also important to inform them if you have Medicaid and to find out if you need to bring anything to the visit, like current medications or medical records.From here, the receptionist will likely ask what dates and times work best for you. During your call, it's important to be honest about your symptoms and the reason for your visit. This information will help the doctor treat you and give him or her an idea of what to expect. Your appointment may progress faster as a result, and the doctor can come prepared with a list of options to better care for you.RisksDoctors see a number of patients in a day, sometimes in 15-minute increments in areas where the physicians are in high demand. This can leave little time for doctors to perform thorough examinations, and they can end up missing certain problem indicators. While some problems, like a cold or flu, can be diagnosed in this time, more complex ailments require attention, which takes up time. Reviews can illuminate which doctors actively spend the necessary time with their patients and which ones are pressed against the clock to meet demand.Surgery has some more dire risks attached to it, so be sure to talk to your surgeon about the potential issues that can come up as a result of your procedure. If a patient has a reaction to anesthesia, it can cause very serious complications, but this is an uncommon occurrence. Blood clots can be a significant problem after surgery, often caused by inactivity during recovery. Infections, numbness, scarring, swelling and death are all possible, but the likelihood of these issues will vary depending on the type of surgery you're undergoing. Talk to your doctor about your concerns and your risk potential.AftercareSurgery affects people in different ways, but as you begin to emerge from anesthesia, you'll want to alert your nurse to any issues you may have. The nurse will tell you how the procedure went, what effect it will have on your condition, what to expect when you get home and how long it will take to get back to normal. If you start feeling pain, the nurse may give you medication to stop it from getting worse. When possible, it's also advised to move around to avoid blood clots from developing in your legs. This can be as simple as occasionally flexing your knee or rotating your foot. Some surgeries are outpatient procedures, where people are released the same day. For major surgeries, patients may stay at the hospital for a few days to be monitored and address any concerns before being sent home. Discuss with your surgeon the projected length of the hospital stay and what you need to bring.Recovery and Follow-upYour recovery time and follow-up expectations will vary depending on your procedure. For example, you can be expected to be on your feet within a few days of having your wisdom teeth taken out, but it may be weeks before you have fully recovered from a broken foot or heart-valve surgery. Your surgeon will give you a list of things that you'll need to do during this time, including what medications to take and when you'll be able to get back to work and other activities.Every surgery will have a follow-up call or appointment to discuss your recovery and allow you to ask any questions about unusual symptoms or changes in your overall health. If you have a major operation, like heart surgery, it's important to make regular checkups with your doctor or a specialist to ensure that everything is normal. Visiting a doctor will help deter infection and verify that everything is healing as expected. These appointments will give you peace of mind about your state of health and ensure that any issues are caught early on.

The protease encoded by the UL26 gene can process itself and its substrate ICP35, encoded by the UL26.5 gene. To better understand the functions of the protease in infected cells, we have isolated a complementing cell line (BMS-MG22) and constructed and characterized a null UL26 mutant virus, m100. The mutant virus failed to grow on Vero cells and required a complementing cell line for its propagation, confirming that the UL26 gene product is essential for viral growth. Phenotypic analysis of m100 shows that (i) normal amounts of the c and d forms of ICP35 were produced, but they failed to be processed to the cleaved forms, e and f; (ii) viral DNA replication of the mutant proceeded at near wild-type levels, but DNA was not processed to unit length or encapsidated; (iii) capsid structures were observed in thin sections of m100-infected Vero cells by electron microscopy, but assembly of VP5 into hexons of the capsid structure was conformationally altered; and (iv) nuclear localizations of the protease and ICP35 are independent of each other, and the function(s) of Na, at least in part, is to direct the catalytic domain N(o) to the nucleus. Authors: Patrick McCannIdentification of the herpes simplex virus-1 protease cleavage sites by direct sequence analysis of autoproteolytic cleavage productsThe Journal of Biological ChemistryJanuary 1993Herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) encodes a protease responsible for proteolytic processing of the virus assembly protein, ICP35 (infected cell protein 35). The coding region of ICP35 is contained within the gene that encodes the protease, and ICP35 shares amino acid identity with the carboxyl-terminal 329 amino acids of the protease. The HSV-1 protease was expressed in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein containing a unique epitope and the protein A Fc binding domain at its carboxyl terminus. The fusion protease underwent autoproteolytic cleavage at two distinct sites. The size of the cleavage products containing the carboxyl-terminal epitope mapped one cleavage site near the carboxyl terminus of the protease corresponding to the proteolytic processing site of ICP35, and the second site proximal to the amino terminus consistent with previous data. The carboxyl-terminal autoproteolytic cleavage products were partially purified on an IgG affinity column by virtue of the protein A Fc binding domain and subjected to direct amino-terminal sequence analysis. Protein sequencing revealed that cleavage occurs between the Ala and Ser residues at amino acids 610/611 and 247/248 of the HSV-1 protease. The flanking sequences share homology with each other and are highly conserved in homologous proteases of other herpes viruses. Authors: Patrick McCannAutoproteolysis of herpes simplex virus type 1 protease releases an active catalytic domain found in intermediate capsid particles.Journal of VirologyOctober 1993The UL26 gene of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) encodes a 635-amino-acid protease that cleaves itself and the HSV-1 assembly protein ICP35cd (F. Liu and B. Roizman, J. Virol. 65:5149-5156, 1991). We previously examined the HSV protease by using an Escherichia coli expression system (I. C. Deckman, M. Hagen, and P. J. McCann III, J. Virol. 66:7362-7367, 1992) and identified two autoproteolytic cleavage sites between residues 247 and 248 and residues 610 and 611 of UL26 (C. L. DiIanni, D. A. Drier, I. C. Deckman, P. J. McCann III, F. Liu, B. Roizman, R. J. Colonno, and M. G. Cordingley, J. Biol. Chem. 268:2048-2051, 1993). In this study, a series of C-terminal truncations of the UL26 open reading frame was tested for cleavage activity in E. coli. Our results delimit the catalytic domain of the protease to the N-terminal 247 amino acids of UL26 corresponding to No, the amino-terminal product of protease autoprocessing. Autoprocessing of the full-length protease was found to be unnecessary for catalysis, since elimination of either or both cleavage sites by site-directed mutagenesis fails to prevent cleavage of ICP35cd or an unaltered protease autoprocessing site. Catalytic activity of the 247-amino-acid protease domain was confirmed in vitro by using a glutathione-S-transferase fusion protein. The fusion protease was induced to high levels of expression, affinity purified, and used to cleave purified ICP35cd in vitro, indicating that no other proteins are required. By using a set of domain-specific antisera, all of the HSV-1 protease cleavage products predicted from studies in E. coli were identified in HSV-1-infected cells. At least two protease autoprocessing products, in addition to fully processed ICP35cd (ICP35ef), were associated with intermediate B capsids in the nucleus of infected cells, suggesting a key role for proteolytic maturation of the protease and ICP35cd in HSV-1 capsid assembly. Authors: Patrick McCannThe C-terminal 25 amino acids of the protease and its substrate ICP35 of herpes simplex virus type 1 are involved in the formation of sealed capsidsJournal of VirologyJuly 1995The herpes simplex virus type 1 protease and its substrate, ICP35, are involved in the assembly of viral capsids. Both proteins are encoded by a single open reading frame from overlapping mRNAs. The protease is autoproteolytically processed at two sites. The protease cleaves itself at the C-terminal site (maturation site) and also cleaves ICP35 at an identical site, releasing a 25-amino-acid (aa) peptide from each protein. To determine whether these 25 aa play a role in capsid assembly, we constructed a mutant virus expressing only Prb, the protease without the C-terminal 25 aa. Phenotypic analysis of the Prb virus in the presence and absence of ICP35 shows the following: (i) Prb retains the functional activity of the wild-type protease which supports virus growth in the presence of ICP35; (ii) in contrast to the ICP35 null mutant delta ICP35 virus, the Prb virus fails to grow in the absence of ICP35; and (iii) trans-complementation experiments indicated that full-length ICP35 (ICP35 c,d), but not the cleaved form (ICP35 e,f), complements the growth of the Prb virus. The most striking phenotype of the Prb virus is that only unsealed aberrant capsid structures are observed by electron microscopy in mutant-infected Vero cells. Our results demonstrate that the growth of herpes simplex virus type 1 requires the C-terminal 25 aa of either the protease or its substrate, ICP35, and that the C-terminal 25 aa are involved in the formation of sealed capsids. Authors: Patrick McCannHerpes simplex virus type 1 protease expressed in Escherichia coli exhibits autoprocessing and specific cleavage of the ICP35 assembly proteinJournal of VirologyDecember 1992The UL26 gene of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) encodes a protease which is responsible for the C-terminal cleavage of the nucleocapsid-associated proteins, ICP35 c and d, to their posttranslationally modified counterparts, ICP35 e and f. To further characterize the HSV-1 protease, the UL26 gene product was expressed in Escherichia coli. The expressed protease underwent autoproteolytic processing at two independent sites. The first site is shared with ICP35 and results in removal of 25 amino acids from the C terminus of the protease. The second unique site gives rise to protein species consistent with deletion of a 28-kDa fragment at the N terminus. A mutant protease, which showed no activity in a mammalian cell cotransfection assay (F. Liu and B. Roizman, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:2076-2080, 1992), failed to exhibit autoproteolytic processing at either site when expressed in bacteria. The inactive mutant was able to serve as a substrate in a trans assay in which the substrate and protease were coexpressed in bacteria. This experiment demonstrated that the unique N-terminal processing was mediated exclusively by the HSV-1 protease. ICP35 c,d also served as a substrate in this assay and was correctly processed by HSV-1 protease in E. coli. This trans-cleavage assay will aid in the characterization of HSV-1 protease and assist in investigation of the role of proteolytic processing in the virus. Authors: Patrick McCannInvestigation of the specificity of the herpes simplex virus type 1 protease by point mutagenesis of the autoproteolysis sitesJournal of VirologyJanuary 1994The herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) protease is cleaved at two autoprocessing sites during viral maturation, one of which shares amino acid identity with its substrate, ICP35. Similar autoprocessing sites have been observed within other members of the Herpesviridae. Introduction of point mutations within the autoprocessing sites of the HSV-1 protease indicated that specificity resides within the P4-P1' region of the cleavage sites. Authors: Patrick McCannRelease of the catalytic domain N(o) from the herpes simplex virus type 1 protease is required for viral growthJournal of VirologyNovember 1995The herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) protease and its substrate, ICP35, are involved in the assembly of viral capsids and required for efficient viral growth. The full-length protease (Pra) consists of 635 amino acid (aa) residues and is autoproteolytically processed at the release (R) site and the maturation (M) site, releasing the catalytic domain No (VP24), Nb (VP21), and a 25-aa peptide. To understand the biological importance of cleavage at these sites, we constructed several mutations in the cloned protease gene. Transfection assays were performed to determine the functional properties of these mutant proteins by their abilities to complement the growth of the protease deletion mutant m100. Our results indicate that (i) expression of full-length protease is not required for viral replication, since a 514-aa protease molecule lacking the M site could support viral growth; and that (ii) elimination of the R site by changing the residue Ala-247 to Ser abolished viral replication. To better understand the functions that are mediated by proteolytic processing at the R site of the protease, we engineered an HSV-1 recombinant virus containing a mutation at this site. Analysis of the mutant A247S virus demonstrated that (i) the mutant protease retained the ability to cleave at the M site and to trans process ICP35 but failed to support viral growth on Vero cells, demonstrating that release of the catalytic domain No from Pra is required for viral replication; and that (ii) only empty capsid structures were observed by electron microscopy in thin sections of A247S-infected Vero cells, indicating that viral DNA was not encapsidated. Our results demonstrate that processing of ICP35 is not sufficient to support viral replication and provide genetic evidence that the HSV-1 protease has nuclear functions other than enzymatic activity. Authors: Patrick McCannIdentification of a Novel Peptide Substrate of HSV-1 Protease Using Substrate Phage DisplayVirologySeptember 1997The method of substrate phage display was used to select a preferred substrate from three monovalent display libraries using the HSV-1 protease. The display libraries consisted of four random amino acids, six random amino acids, and a biased library containing four amino acids from the P side of the HSV-1 maturation site followed by four random amino acids. A series of consensus peptides was synthesized based upon the results from these screens and tested in peptide cleavage assays. An eight amino acid consensus peptide (LVLASSSF) derived from the phage results was cleaved as efficiently as a 20-mer maturation site peptide. The selected amino acid sequences also allowed the design of a four amino acid paranitroanilide substrate for continuous assay of HSV-1 protease. Similar to HCMV protease, these results define P4 to P1 as a minimal substrate recognition domain for the HSV-1 protease and suggest that P4 to P1 is the minimal substrate domain which all herpesvirus proteases recognize.Authors: Patrick McCannSeparate functional domains of the herpes simplex virus type 1 protease: evidence for cleavage inside capsidsJournal of VirologyJuly 1996The herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) protease (Pra) and related proteins are involved in the assembly of viral capsids and virion maturation. Pra is a serine protease, and the active-site residue has been mapped to amino acid (aa) 129 (Ser). This 635-aa protease, encoded by the UL26 gene, is autoproteolytically processed at two sites, the release (R) site between amino acid residues 247 and 248 and the maturation (M) site between residues 610 and 611. When the protease cleaves itself at both sites, it releases Nb, the catalytic domain (N0), and the C-terminal 25 aa. ICP35, a substrate of the HSV-1 protease, is the product of the UL26.5 gene. As it is translated from a Met codon within the UL26 gene, ICP35 cd are identical to the C-terminal 329-aa sequence of the protease and are trans cleaved at an identical C-terminal site to generate ICP35 e,f and a 25-aa peptide. Only fully processed Pra (N0 and Nb) and ICP35 (ICP35 e,f) are present in B capsids, which are believed to be precursors of mature virions. Using an R-site mutant A247S virus, we have recently shown that this mutant protease retains enzymatic activity but fails to support viral growth, suggesting that the release of N0 is required for viral replication. Here we report that another mutant protease, with an amino acid substitution (Ser to Cys) at the active site, can complement the A247S mutant but not a protease deletion mutant. Cell lines expressing the active-site mutant protease were isolated and shown to complement the A247S mutant at the levels of capsid assembly, DNA packaging, and viral growth. Therefore, the complementation between the R-site mutant and the active-site mutant reconstituted wild-type Pra function. One feature of this intragenic complementation is that following sedimentation of infected-cell lysates on sucrose gradients suggesting that proteolytic processing occurs inside capsids.Authors: Patrick McCannFunctional Conservations of the Alkaline Nuclease of Herpes Simplex Type 1 and Human CytomegalovirusVirologySeptember 1998The herpes simplex virus type 1 UL12 gene product, alkaline nuclease (AN), appears to be involved in viral DNA processing and capsid egress from the nucleus (Shao, L., Rapp, L. M., and Weller, S. K.,Virology196, 146–162, 1993). Although the HSV-1 AN is not absolutely essential for viral replication in tissue culture, conservation of the AN gene in all herpesviruses suggests an important role in the life cycle of herpesviruses. The counterpart of HSV-1 AN for human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is the UL98 gene product. To examine whether the HCMV AN could substitute for HSV-1 AN, we performedtrans-complementation experiments using a HSV-1 amplicon plasmid carrying the HCMV UL98 gene. Our results indicate (i) HCMV AN can complement the growth of the HSV-1 AN deletion mutantUL12lacZvirus intrans;(ii) a new recombinant virus,UL12laZcUL98/99,appears to be generated by the integration of the HCMV UL98 gene into the HSV-1UL12lacZviral genome; (iii) in contrast to its parental HSV-1UL12lacZvirus, capsids formed inUL12lacZUL98/99-infected Vero cells were able to transport from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and mature into infectious viruses. Our results demonstrate a functional conservation of AN between HSV-1 and HCMV.Authors: Patrick McCannNa, an autoproteolytic product of the herpes simplex virus type 1 protease, can functionally substitute for the assembly protein ICP35.Journal of VirologyFebruary 1997The herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) protease and its substrate, the assembly protein ICP35, are involved in virion maturation. Both proteins are encoded by a single open reading frame but are translated independently from 3'-coterminal mRNAs of different sizes and are in frame. The herpesvirus shell assembles around an internal scaffold which is subsequently lost during packaging of the viral genome. The scaffold is composed of ICP35, which is the major component, and autoproteolytically processed forms of the viral protease containing sequences common to ICP35 (Nb). In the baculovirus system, HSV-1 intact capsids can be formed in the presence of the protease or ICP35, indicating that the protease may substitute for ICP35 (Thomsen et al., J. Virol. 68:2442-2457, 1994). This is further supported by the fact that ICP35, in contrast to the protease, is not absolutely essential for viral growth. The processed intermediate of the protease analogous to ICP35 is the 388-amino-acid (aa) protein, Na, which is an N-terminal 59-aa extension of the 329-aa ICP35. To directly examine whether Na can functionally substitute for ICP35 during viral replication, we first constructed a mutant virus, Na delta35, in which 35 aa from the N terminus of Na were deleted. Phenotypic analysis of the mutant showed that this deletion had no effect on protease function. The function of Na was further examined by construction of a plasmid expressing Na alone and testing its ability to complement the growth of the mutant Prb virus in the absence of ICP35. Our results demonstrate that Na can functionally substitute for ICP35 during viral replication.
