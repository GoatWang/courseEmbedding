Tamerica Products, INC
Our company is based in Rancho Cucamonga, CA with warehouses in California and New Jersey. Our main lines are manufactured in Taiwan and China and currently use extensive distribution channels to market our products across North America as well as well as in Latin America.     Most of our distributors are brick and mortar companies that have multiple locations across the country. A number of these distributors however, also have Internet presence with several websites each.     We pride ourselves in our customer service and in our commitment in protecting the business interests of our distributors. We are also known for our products’ excellent quality at competitive prices and for our quick response time.      We take extra steps to enhance your purchasing convenience and experience with us. We hire reputable freight companies to ship our products at the soonest possible time and at the least possible cost to you, the customer/distributor. We encourage our dealers and distributors to stock our products in their own shelves to ensure availability for their customers. At the same time, we do not hesitate to accommodate the occasional drop shipment for customers who do stock our products but have run short on certain items before their next stock order.    We have also launched a Minimum Advertised Price (MAP) program for some of our machines, to serve as a benchmark for maintaining reasonable margins throughout our distribution network.
