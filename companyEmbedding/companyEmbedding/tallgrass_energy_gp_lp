Rockies Express Pipeline (REX)

            Rockies Express Pipeline (REX) is one of the United States’ largest pipelines and is transforming into the nation’s northernmost bi-directional natural gas header system. With 42- and 36-inch diameter lines, REX taps major supply basins in the Rocky Mountain and Appalachian regions and serves energy markets across a vast segment of North America. The completion of the REX Zone 3 Capacity Enhancement project that went in service in January 2017 marked the culmination of a series of projects to convert Zone 3 to bi-directional flow and enabled the pipeline to flow up to 4.4 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas in Zone 3. West-to-east long-haul capacity on REX is 1.8 billion cubic feet per day. REX is a joint venture of Tallgrass Energy Partners (50 percent membership interest), Tallgrass Development, LP (25 percent membership interest) and Phillips 66 (25 percent membership interest). A wholly owned subsidiary of TEP operates the pipeline.  
            REX, which became fully operational in 2009, stretches about 1,700 miles from northwestern Colorado and Wyoming to eastern Ohio and, through numerous interstate pipeline interconnects, provides shippers optionality to many major demand centers and large end-users.
To answer the call for more takeaway capacity from the Marcellus and Utica shale plays in the Appalachian basin, in 2014 REX put into service its Seneca Lateral, making REX Zone 3 bi-directional. In 2015, REX completed its Zone 3 East-to-West project, expanding the Zone 3 bi-directional capability from Monroe County Ohio to Moultrie, Ill. This expansion tripled REX’s Zone 3 east-to-west capacity, giving producers a much-needed outlet for getting their gas to Midwest consumer markets such as Chicago and Detroit, as well as to the Southeast and Gulf Coast areas.
With the completion of the Zone 3 Capacity Enhancement project, REX Zone 3 has the capacity to move 2.6 billion cubic feet of natural gas a day from east-to-west and 1.8 billion cubic feet a day from west-to-east. For local distribution companies, industrial customers, power plants, and third-party pipelines, the bi-directional flow and enhancements mean access to abundant natural gas sources in both the Rockies and Appalachian basins. As the country’s northernmost bi-directional header system, REX will play a crucial role in transforming the nation’s natural gas infrastructure, providing access to emerging U.S. markets as well as access to current high-demand centers, power demand, LNG markets and Mexico.

Tallgrass Energy Partners, LP today announced strategic acquisitions by its Terminals and Water Services businesses and several significant commercial deals that expand and strengthen its Pony Express crude oil pipeline position in the regions it serves. Since the Companys Q1 2017 earnings call on May 2, Tallgrass Energy has now announced or completed acquisitions and growth projects of approximately $350 million.
Todays announcements clearly demonstrate TEPs expansive footprint and ability to grow through strategic and accretive acquisitions as well as through organic commercial development, said David G. Dehaemers Jr., Tallgrass Energy President and Chief Executive Officer. These acquisitions and growth projects enable us to help our customers grow their businesses.
Strategic Acquisitions
Tallgrass Terminals
Tallgrass Terminals, LLC (Tallgrass Terminals) recently acquired an additional 49 percent interest in the Deeprock Development (Deeprock) crude oil terminal at Cushing, Okla., increasing its total membership interest to 69 percent, for a purchase price of approximately $70 million. Deeprock is a 2.3-million-barrel crude oil storage facility in which Kinder Morgan, Inc. (11 percent) and Deeprock Energy Resources (20 percent) remain joint venture partners. Deeprock will continue to be operated by Deeprock Energy. By increasing its ownership to 69 percent, Tallgrass Terminals assumes significant strategic and commercial control over Deeprock. In conjunction with the acquisition, Tallgrass Pony Express Pipeline, LLC (Pony Express) signed an amended lease agreement with Deeprock, reducing its recurring lease charges by an estimated $5 million per year, beginning on July 1, 2017. Tallgrass believes the acquisition will allow it to more effectively pursue the development and growth of its potential crude oil terminal project located on 550 acres in South Cushing, by utilizing some of the existing infrastructure of Deeprock to offer many different services between the two terminals.
Water Services
Tallgrass subsidiary BNN Water Solutions, LLC (BNN) recently acquired a 63 percent interest in an entity that owns freshwater facilities in Weld County, Colo., for $7 million, with a commitment to invest up to an additional approximately $10.5 million in the system over the next few months. We believe these facilities will allow BNN to better serve existing and potential new producer customers in the region.
Organic Growth Projects
Successful Pony Express Platteville Extension Open Season
Pony Express recently held a binding open season to secure committed shipper contracts for crude oil transportation of a new common stream on the proposed extension of Pony Express from Tallgrass Terminalss Buckingham receipt point to a new origin near Platteville, Colo. Pony Express received new short-haul and long-haul binding transportation commitments totaling approximately 30,000 barrels per day from multiple counterparties to support the construction of the Platteville Extension. In conjunction with Pony Express`s development of the Platteville Extension, Tallgrass Terminals will upgrade the Buckingham terminal and build a new terminal in Platteville. The approximately 55-mile extension of Pony Express is expected to begin operations in Q2 2018. Tallgrass Terminals is also moving forward with the development of the new Grasslands Terminal in Platteville, which is expected to be complete in Q4 2018, and will enable Pony Express to batch multiple common streams out of Platteville. Once the Grasslands Terminal is complete, the Platteville Extension is expected to have a capacity of approximately 80,000 barrels per day. The Platteville Extension and Grasslands Terminal, when complete, will provide Pony Expresss shippers and refinery markets with the interconnectivity to source the abundant pipeline-gathered barrels available in the most active drilling region of the DJ basin.
New Pony Express Refinery Connections
Pony Express signed an agreement with CHS, Inc. to connect the 100,000 barrels per day CHS McPherson, Kan., refinery to Pony Expresss mainline. Pony Express has agreed to build connection facilities designed to supply the refinery with multiple common streams of crude oil. Completion of the facilities is expected by the end of the year.
In addition to the CHS connection, construction is progressing on the Holly Frontier El Dorado refinery connection facilities, with completion expected in Q4 2017.
Upon completion of the two new refinery connections, shippers on Pony Express will be able to deliver more than 300,000 barrels per day to three significant refineries directly connected to Pony Express, inclusive of the refinery in Ponca City, Okla. that is already connected to Pony Express.
New Pony Express Supply Connection
Tallgrass Terminals has a signed, 10-year take-or-pay agreement from a new customer to support the construction of a new terminal in the Central Kansas Uplift. Pony Express, in turn, will establish a new supply connection at the new Kansas terminal and another new common stream of crude oil on its mainline. Tallgrass Terminals will build terminaling facilities designed to receive Kansas crude oil production with delivery capabilities in excess of 20,000 barrels per day into the Pony Express mainline. Completion of the facilities is expected in Q1 2018.
Upon completion of these projects, Pony Express will have six different supply sources and five different streams of crude oil capable of being batched on the system.
Pony Express and Tallgrass Terminals expect to invest approximately $145 million in total capital for the construction of the Platteville Extension, Grasslands Terminal, upgrades to the Buckingham Terminal, the CHS and Holly Frontier El Dorado refinery connections and the new Kansas terminal and Pony Express receipt point.
We believe all of this work further positions Pony Express as the most diverse and capable crude oil transportation and logistics system in the regions in which it operates, said Matt Sheehy, Tallgrass Energy Chief Commercial Officer. Diversity of supply and delivery points, multiple batch shipment capability, readily available expansion capacity and an attractive tariff rate solidify Pony Express as a critical part of the countrys crude oil midstream infrastructure that will be utilized for decades to come.
Growing 2017 Acquisition and Growth Capital Program
In addition to the approximately $350 million in acquisitions and growth projects announced or completed since May 2, 2017, Tallgrass is evaluating and developing an additional $200 million in potential projects and acquisitions that could be announced later this year.
Second Quarter 2017 Conference Call
Tallgrass Energy plans to report second quarter 2017 financial results on Wednesday, Aug. 2, 2017, after market close and hold a conference call at 3:30 p.m. Central Time that same day. Tallgrass Energy expects to provide additional details on these and other developments during the conference call on Aug. 2.(c) 2017 All Rights Reversed for Saudi Press Agency Provided by SyndiGate Media Inc.

Tallgrass Energy Partners, LP today announced strategic acquisitions by its Terminals and Water Services businesses and several significant commercial deals that expand and strengthen its Pony Express crude oil pipeline position in the regions it serves. Since the Companys Q1 2017 earnings call on May 2, Tallgrass Energy has now announced or completed acquisitions and growth projects of approximately $350 million.
Todays announcements clearly demonstrate TEPs expansive footprint and ability to grow through strategic and accretive acquisitions as well as through organic commercial development, said David G. Dehaemers Jr., Tallgrass Energy President and Chief Executive Officer. These acquisitions and growth projects enable us to help our customers grow their businesses.
Strategic Acquisitions
Tallgrass Terminals
Tallgrass Terminals, LLC (Tallgrass Terminals) recently acquired an additional 49 percent interest in the Deeprock Development (Deeprock) crude oil terminal at Cushing, Okla., increasing its total membership interest to 69 percent, for a purchase price of approximately $70 million. Deeprock is a 2.3-million-barrel crude oil storage facility in which Kinder Morgan, Inc. (11 percent) and Deeprock Energy Resources (20 percent) remain joint venture partners. Deeprock will continue to be operated by Deeprock Energy. By increasing its ownership to 69 percent, Tallgrass Terminals assumes significant strategic and commercial control over Deeprock. In conjunction with the acquisition, Tallgrass Pony Express Pipeline, LLC (Pony Express) signed an amended lease agreement with Deeprock, reducing its recurring lease charges by an estimated $5 million per year, beginning on July 1, 2017. Tallgrass believes the acquisition will allow it to more effectively pursue the development and growth of its potential crude oil terminal project located on 550 acres in South Cushing, by utilizing some of the existing infrastructure of Deeprock to offer many different services between the two terminals.
Water Services
Tallgrass subsidiary BNN Water Solutions, LLC (BNN) recently acquired a 63 percent interest in an entity that owns freshwater facilities in Weld County, Colo., for $7 million, with a commitment to invest up to an additional approximately $10.5 million in the system over the next few months. We believe these facilities will allow BNN to better serve existing and potential new producer customers in the region.
Organic Growth Projects
Successful Pony Express Platteville Extension Open Season
Pony Express recently held a binding open season to secure committed shipper contracts for crude oil transportation of a new common stream on the proposed extension of Pony Express from Tallgrass Terminalss Buckingham receipt point to a new origin near Platteville, Colo. Pony Express received new short-haul and long-haul binding transportation commitments totaling approximately 30,000 barrels per day from multiple counterparties to support the construction of the Platteville Extension. In conjunction with Pony Express`s development of the Platteville Extension, Tallgrass Terminals will upgrade the Buckingham terminal and build a new terminal in Platteville. The approximately 55-mile extension of Pony Express is expected to begin operations in Q2 2018. Tallgrass Terminals is also moving forward with the development of the new Grasslands Terminal in Platteville, which is expected to be complete in Q4 2018, and will enable Pony Express to batch multiple common streams out of Platteville. Once the Grasslands Terminal is complete, the Platteville Extension is expected to have a capacity of approximately 80,000 barrels per day. The Platteville Extension and Grasslands Terminal, when complete, will provide Pony Expresss shippers and refinery markets with the interconnectivity to source the abundant pipeline-gathered barrels available in the most active drilling region of the DJ basin.
New Pony Express Refinery Connections
Pony Express signed an agreement with CHS, Inc. to connect the 100,000 barrels per day CHS McPherson, Kan., refinery to Pony Expresss mainline. Pony Express has agreed to build connection facilities designed to supply the refinery with multiple common streams of crude oil. Completion of the facilities is expected by the end of the year.
In addition to the CHS connection, construction is progressing on the Holly Frontier El Dorado refinery connection facilities, with completion expected in Q4 2017.
Upon completion of the two new refinery connections, shippers on Pony Express will be able to deliver more than 300,000 barrels per day to three significant refineries directly connected to Pony Express, inclusive of the refinery in Ponca City, Okla. that is already connected to Pony Express.
New Pony Express Supply Connection
Tallgrass Terminals has a signed, 10-year take-or-pay agreement from a new customer to support the construction of a new terminal in the Central Kansas Uplift. Pony Express, in turn, will establish a new supply connection at the new Kansas terminal and another new common stream of crude oil on its mainline. Tallgrass Terminals will build terminaling facilities designed to receive Kansas crude oil production with delivery capabilities in excess of 20,000 barrels per day into the Pony Express mainline. Completion of the facilities is expected in Q1 2018.
Upon completion of these projects, Pony Express will have six different supply sources and five different streams of crude oil capable of being batched on the system.
Pony Express and Tallgrass Terminals expect to invest approximately $145 million in total capital for the construction of the Platteville Extension, Grasslands Terminal, upgrades to the Buckingham Terminal, the CHS and Holly Frontier El Dorado refinery connections and the new Kansas terminal and Pony Express receipt point.
We believe all of this work further positions Pony Express as the most diverse and capable crude oil transportation and logistics system in the regions in which it operates, said Matt Sheehy, Tallgrass Energy Chief Commercial Officer. Diversity of supply and delivery points, multiple batch shipment capability, readily available expansion capacity and an attractive tariff rate solidify Pony Express as a critical part of the countrys crude oil midstream infrastructure that will be utilized for decades to come.
Growing 2017 Acquisition and Growth Capital Program
In addition to the approximately $350 million in acquisitions and growth projects announced or completed since May 2, 2017, Tallgrass is evaluating and developing an additional $200 million in potential projects and acquisitions that could be announced later this year.
Second Quarter 2017 Conference Call
Tallgrass Energy plans to report second quarter 2017 financial results on Wednesday, Aug. 2, 2017, after market close and hold a conference call at 3:30 p.m. Central Time that same day. Tallgrass Energy expects to provide additional details on these and other developments during the conference call on Aug. 2.(c) 2017 All Rights Reversed for Saudi Press Agency Provided by SyndiGate Media Inc.

Press Release














































Tallgrass Energy Increases Quarterly Distributions and Announces Date for Second Quarter 2017 Financial Results

                            Company Release - 7/5/2017 6:45 AM ET



    LEAWOOD, Kan.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
      Tallgrass Energy Partners, LP (NYSE: TEP) and Tallgrass Energy GP, LP
      (NYSE: TEGP) (“Tallgrass”) today announced their quarterly distributions
      for the second quarter of 2017. The distributions will be paid on
      Monday, August 14, 2017, to unitholders and shareholders of record as of
      the close of business on Friday, July 28, 2017.
    

TEP


      The board of directors of TEP’s general partner declared a quarterly
      cash distribution of $0.925 per common unit for the second quarter of
      2017, or $3.70 on an annualized basis. This represents a sequential
      increase of 10.8 percent from the first quarter 2017 distribution of
      $0.835 per common unit and an increase of 22.5 percent from the second
      quarter 2016 distribution of $0.755 per common unit. It is TEP’s 16th
      consecutive increase since its May 2013 IPO.
    

      The increase is consistent with management’s previously announced plan
      to recommend to the board of directors of its general partner increases
      in its second and third quarter 2017 distributions that will aggregate
      to at least $0.10 per unit (or $0.40 per unit on an annualized basis)
      over the first quarter 2017 distribution of $0.835. TEP acquired an
      approximate 25 percent membership interest in Rockies Express Pipeline
      LLC in March 2017.
    

TEGP


      The board of directors of TEGP’s general partner declared a quarterly
      cash distribution of $0.3425 per Class A share for the second quarter of
      2017, or $1.37 on an annualized basis. This represents a 19.1 percent
      sequential increase from the first quarter 2017 distribution of $0.2875
      per Class A share and an increase of 39.8 percent from the second
      quarter 2016 distribution of $0.245 per Class A share. It is TEGP’s
      eighth consecutive increase since its May 2015 IPO.
    

Second Quarter 2017 Financial Results and
      Conference Call


      Tallgrass plans to report second quarter 2017 financial results on
      Wednesday, August 2, 2017, after market close and hold a conference call
      at 3:30 p.m. Central Time that same day.
    

      Tallgrass invites unitholders, shareholders and other interested parties
      to listen to the call through a link posted on the Investor Relations
      section of Tallgrass’s website at www.tallgrassenergy.com.
    

Tax Considerations


      This release is intended to be a qualified notice to nominees and
      brokers under Treasury Regulation Sections 1.1446-4(b)(4) and (d). All
      of TEP’s distributions to foreign investors are attributable to income
      that is effectively connected with a United States trade or business.
      Accordingly, TEP’s distributions to foreign investors are subject to
      federal income tax withholding at the highest effective tax rate.
