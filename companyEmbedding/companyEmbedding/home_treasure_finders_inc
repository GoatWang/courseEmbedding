Home Treasure Finders Inc. Announces Closed Purchase Contract on Warehouse in Denver

DENVER, Sept. 22, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Home Treasure Finders Inc., (OTCBB: HMTF) (OTCQB: HMTF) www.hometreasurefinders.com, a multi-division real estate sales, property management and leasing company, announces closing the purchase of an industrial warehouse in Denver, Colorado. The $850,000 dollar acquisition is subdividable and marks the company's first commercial cannabis acquisition.
President and CEO, Corey Wiegand stated, "We are proud to have closed this transaction in such a creative manner. After much negotiation, the seller agreed to carry financing with a 1.1% down payment enabling us to effectively leverage 98.9% of the building.  We believe our acquisition will provide increased value for our shareholders. We are currently negotiating leases with several fully compliant cultivation companies with the utmost attention to detail, efficiency, and operational compliance.  We believe leasing and other revenues we anticipate to generate from this property will show exceptional value to our shareholders."
Michael Godinez, showing agent for HMTF Commercial Property Management stated, "We are excited to have acquired an asset and have already shown the property to over 30 tenant prospects.  We will continue to expand our operations and plan to provide a state of the art, turn-key, growing facility. We are finalizing the application and vetting process to secure a highly experienced and fully compliant tenant."
According to Loopnet.com, many industrial properties zoned for cannabis in Denver, Colorado have nearly doubled in value since June 2013. HMTF management believes the property will experience an additional increase in value when their planned tenant retrofits are completed.  
Management believes turnkey cultivation properties are capable of generating revenues of up to $75,000 per month. Accordingly, HMTF anticipates releasing the terms of grower contracts, projected cash flow, expected earnings per share, and resulting share price targets within the next few weeks.
HMTF continues to refine and improve their business strategies. Management anticipates continuing to grow their other two divisions; property management and real estate sales and continuing to produce video updates for investor relations on an "as needed basis" (see http://hmtfcannabis.com/talks).
This news release contains "forward-looking statements," as that term is defined in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Statements that are not purely historical are forward-looking statements and include any statements regarding beliefs, plans, expectations or intentions regarding the future.  Actual results could differ from those projected in any forward-looking statements due to numerous factors; such factors include, among others, the inherent uncertainties associated with developing and acquiring land and water resources.  There can be no assurance Home Treasure Finders will be able to raise additional capital, that it will be able to increase the scale of its business, or that its existing resources will be sufficient to meet all of its cash needs.  These forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this news release.  Home Treasure Finders Inc. assumes no obligation to update the forward-looking statements or to update the reasons why actual results could differ from those projected in the forward-looking statements.

Home Treasure Finders Inc. Announces Subsidiary HMTF Cannabis Holdings Inc. Has Executed a Purchase Contract on Warehouse in Denver with Seller Carry Terms (OTCBB: HMTF)

DENVER, July 30, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Home Treasure Finders, Inc. ("HMTF") ("Company") (OTCBB: HMTF) (OTCQB: HMTF) is pleased to announce that since the inception of the Company's third division, HMTF Cannabis Holdings Inc, Home Treasure Finders CEO and Employing Broker, Corey Wiegand has been tirelessly searching for creative financing believed necessary and anticipated in connection with the company's planned five projects. Up until 7/22/2014, the search had been less than fruitful.  Executed land contracts in Commerce City in March, and in Park County in April were terminated without penalty during their due diligence periods. 
"It has been a long road getting to this point. A company like ours has little cash on hand and almost no available credit. I believe that the only way we can get cannabis oriented leasing projects going is by finding seller carry properties just like this one. I have been searching six multiple listing services daily for the last four months and this is the first seller carry warehouse opportunity I have located. I found the listing posted on Craigslist at 10:00 PM on Saturday 7/19/2014, e-mailed the seller at 10:01 PM, was the first to see it on Monday 7/21/2014, and had placed it under contract by 7/22/2104," said Wiegand.   
We plan to initiate a Private Placement in the near future potentially raising up to $200,000 for closing and property upgrades. We plan to consult with electrical and mechanical engineers and leasing candidates and anticipate leasing this warehouse at $2.50 per square foot per month.
We continue to refine our business strategy and anticipate growing our other two divisions; property management and real estate sales  We plan to continue producing weekly video updates, see http://hmtfcannabis.com/talks.
Other HMTF company updates and milestones are as follows;

Announced negotiations with the Carmel Group on 4/21/2014 were suspended and a contract for IR was not signed. 
The Rosewind Corp Joint Venture announced on 4/21/2014 is on hold until Rosewind is able to contract with a third party for scientific research. 
The Home Treasure Finders Inc. business address is 4318 Tennyson St., Denver, CO 80212. 
The Home Treasure Finders Inc. company web URL is http://www.HomeTreasureFinders.com. 
This news release contains "forward-looking statements," as that term is defined in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Statements that are not purely historical are forward-looking statements and include any statements regarding beliefs, plans, expectations or intentions regarding the future. Actual results could differ from those projected in any forward-looking statements due to numerous factors.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
