If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

Regina E. Dugan is an American businesswoman, inventor, and technology developer. She served as the 19th Director of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). In March 2012, she left government to take an executive role at Google. Just prior to the acquisition, it was announced that she would create, and lead, the Advanced Technology and Projects (ATAP) group at Google-owned Motorola Mobility. In January 2014, Google announced the acquisition of Motorola Mobility by Lenovo but retained Dugan and her Advanced Technology and Projects (ATAP) team.[3] In 2016 she left Google and joined Facebook. She will lead a newly formed team called Building 8.[4]

Education[edit]
Dugan obtained her Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees in mechanical engineering from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech) in Blacksburg, Virginia. In May 2013, she was inducted into the Virginia Tech College of Engineering’s Academy of Engineering Excellence.[5]
Dugan was awarded a PhD by the California Institute of Technology (Caltech); her thesis was titled, “Axisymmetric buoyant jets in a cross flow with shear transition and mixing.” [1]
California State University, Fullerton presented Dugan with an honorary degree in 2011.
Career[edit]
Facebook[edit]
In April 2016, Dugan left Google to head Facebook's 'Building 8',[6] a research division similar to Google's ATAP group.
Google[edit]
Dugan’s advanced technology group was not a part of the Lenovo acquisition of Motorola Mobility.[7] In February 2014, Dugan rejoined Google as Vice President of Engineering, Advanced Technology and Projects. ATAP developed Project Tango and Project Ara.
Motorola[edit]
Shortly after the Google acquisition of Motorola Mobility closed, Dugan was tasked with creating the Advanced Technology and Projects group, a skunkworks-inspired team chartered to deliver breakthrough innovations for the company. In an interview with the New York Times, Dugan described ATAP as "a small, lean, and agile group that is unafraid of failure," she said, and that it will "celebrate impatience."[8]
While a part of Motorola, ATAP developed and shipped several products including the Motorola Skip—part of an authentication portfolio that is also exploring digital tattoos and pills[9]—and the augmented reality shorts, Spotlight Stories, which were featured at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival. It was there that ATAP announced the development of Project Ara, a free, open hardware platform for creating highly modular smartphones.
Additionally, in an effort to streamline research projects, foster greater collaboration with the university research community, Dugan and her deputy, Dr. Kaigham (Ken) Gabriel, negotiated the Multi-University Research Agreement with, initially, eight leading public and private universities.[10][11]
DARPA[edit]
Experienced in counterterrorism and defense against explosive threats, Dugan first served as a DARPA program manager from 1996 to 2000. During her first DARPA tour, she directed a diverse $100 million portfolio of programs, including the Dog’s Nose program, which focused on the development of an advanced, field-portable system for detecting the explosive content of land mines.
From July 2009 to March 2012, Dugan served as the 19th Director of DARPA; she was the first woman to lead the Agency. As Director she advanced strategic initiatives in the fields of cyber security, social media, and advanced manufacturing. She also led an active operational deployment in direct support of the war in Afghanistan for which the Agency was awarded the Joint Meritorious Unit Award.
Boards[edit]
In 2013, Regina was appointed to the Board of Varian Medical Systems, Inc. (NYSE: VAR),[12] and in July 2014 she was appointed to the Board of Zynga (NASDAQ: ZNGA).[13]

Innovation[edit]
"Disruptive innovation is the kind that unhinges old ways of operating, juices competition and creates new growth. One of the world’s leading experts on the subject is Regina Dugan," wrote Pattie Sellers in her Postcards blog.[20] Dugan has widely spoken and written about DARPA's non-linear style of innovation, which she brought with her to Motorola Mobility and Google.
"Regina does bring in outside perspective specifically related to projects that are leaps, versus incremental steps," Seattle-based wireless analyst Chetan Sharma recently told Technology Review.[21]
In a New York Times article, titled "New Force Behind Agency of Wonder", John Markoff noted that Dugan is "credited with having a knack for inspiring, and indeed insisting on, creative thinking.[22] DARPA is often discussed as a place of innovation, which was addressed during a Washington Post Live summit on U.S. Competitiveness in Washington, D.C. Talking about DARPA's innovation was likened to talking about Picasso's impressionism.[23][24]
Based on their work at DARPA and then Motorola, Dugan and Gabriel co-wrote "Special Forces Innovation" for the Harvard Business Review's October 2013 issue.[25]
Dugan partly attributes DARPA's success to an unwavering dedication to Pasteur's quadrant. The term, coined by political scientist Donald E. Stokes in his 1997 book by the same name, describes innovation that advances both basic research and solves practical problems. It is contrasted with Bohr's quadrant, which seeks foundational knowledge about the world without any consideration for practical application and with Edison's quadrant in which purely practical problem solving is attempted.
Other work[edit]
Dugan has delivered keynote addresses and moderated panel discussions at events as such as:

TED[26]
All Things Digital D9[27] and D11[28] conferences
Clinton Global Initiative Annual Meeting[29]
Clinton Global Initiative America’s Meeting
EY Strategic Growth Forum
FORTUNE Most Powerful Women Summit[30]
Qualcomm Uplinq[31]
Washington Post Live[32]
World Maker Faire[33]

In December 2013, Dugan was appointed to the Board of Directors of Varian Medical Systems, Inc. (VAR).
Potential conflict of interest[edit]
In March 2011, an article in Wired magazine stated that Dugan held stock in RedXDefense, her previous firm. In accordance with DoD policy, Dugan disclosed and recused from matters involving her former firm. A DARPA spokesperson stated that Dugan had no involvement in a 2010 contract award to RedXDefense, and that the contract was vetted by the agency’s top lawyer to assure there was no conflict. Subsequently the LA Times and Wired reported that her company had received around $1.8M in DARPA contracts and that Dugan held a promissory note from RedXDefense in the amount of $250,000.[34] Others have argued that the Wired reporters' accusations are unjustified.[35] In August, 2011, the Inspector General of the Department of Defense(DoD) began an investigation to ensure the procedures had been followed, and to examine DARPA's general policies on conflict of interest as well as a specific concern that DARPA Director Regina Dugan retains financial ties to her former firm, which has won some $6 million in contracts with the agency, $4.3 million of which was awarded prior to her position as Director.[36]
The Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, Ashton Carter, and the Department of Defense, General Counsel, Jeh Johnson, stated in a letter dated May 2011 addressed to Dugan, "based on what we know, we are satisfied that, given your disqualification from matters related to RedXDefense and the procedures you have put in place, there has been no violation of conflict of interest laws or regulations in the selection or funding of RedXDefense's proposals while you have been Director of DARPA".
Prior to entering the Department of Defense, potential political appointees disclose their business investments and holdings for review.[37] Senior ethics officials in the Office of the Secretary of Defense General Counsel, Standards of Conduct Office (OSDGC, SOCO) determine what procedures are required to address potential conflicts. The procedures are designed to ensure that companies are neither favored nor disfavored and to permit talent to be attracted to government service.

Experienced in counterterrorism and defense against explosive threats, Dugan first served as a DARPA program manager from 1996 to 2000. During her first DARPA tour, she directed a diverse $100 million portfolio of programs, including the Dog’s Nose program, which focused on the development of an advanced, field-portable system for detecting the explosive content of land mines.
From July 2009 to March 2012, Dugan served as the 19th Director of DARPA; she was the first woman to lead the Agency. As Director she advanced strategic initiatives in the fields of cyber security, social media, and advanced manufacturing. She also led an active operational deployment in direct support of the war in Afghanistan for which the Agency was awarded the Joint Meritorious Unit Award.
Boards[edit]
In 2013, Regina was appointed to the Board of Varian Medical Systems, Inc. (NYSE: VAR),[12] and in July 2014 she was appointed to the Board of Zynga (NASDAQ: ZNGA).[13]

Innovation[edit]
"Disruptive innovation is the kind that unhinges old ways of operating, juices competition and creates new growth. One of the world’s leading experts on the subject is Regina Dugan," wrote Pattie Sellers in her Postcards blog.[20] Dugan has widely spoken and written about DARPA's non-linear style of innovation, which she brought with her to Motorola Mobility and Google.
"Regina does bring in outside perspective specifically related to projects that are leaps, versus incremental steps," Seattle-based wireless analyst Chetan Sharma recently told Technology Review.[21]
In a New York Times article, titled "New Force Behind Agency of Wonder", John Markoff noted that Dugan is "credited with having a knack for inspiring, and indeed insisting on, creative thinking.[22] DARPA is often discussed as a place of innovation, which was addressed during a Washington Post Live summit on U.S. Competitiveness in Washington, D.C. Talking about DARPA's innovation was likened to talking about Picasso's impressionism.[23][24]
Based on their work at DARPA and then Motorola, Dugan and Gabriel co-wrote "Special Forces Innovation" for the Harvard Business Review's October 2013 issue.[25]
Dugan partly attributes DARPA's success to an unwavering dedication to Pasteur's quadrant. The term, coined by political scientist Donald E. Stokes in his 1997 book by the same name, describes innovation that advances both basic research and solves practical problems. It is contrasted with Bohr's quadrant, which seeks foundational knowledge about the world without any consideration for practical application and with Edison's quadrant in which purely practical problem solving is attempted.
Other work[edit]
Dugan has delivered keynote addresses and moderated panel discussions at events as such as:

TED[26]
All Things Digital D9[27] and D11[28] conferences
Clinton Global Initiative Annual Meeting[29]
Clinton Global Initiative America’s Meeting
EY Strategic Growth Forum
FORTUNE Most Powerful Women Summit[30]
Qualcomm Uplinq[31]
Washington Post Live[32]
World Maker Faire[33]

In December 2013, Dugan was appointed to the Board of Directors of Varian Medical Systems, Inc. (VAR).
Potential conflict of interest[edit]
In March 2011, an article in Wired magazine stated that Dugan held stock in RedXDefense, her previous firm. In accordance with DoD policy, Dugan disclosed and recused from matters involving her former firm. A DARPA spokesperson stated that Dugan had no involvement in a 2010 contract award to RedXDefense, and that the contract was vetted by the agency’s top lawyer to assure there was no conflict. Subsequently the LA Times and Wired reported that her company had received around $1.8M in DARPA contracts and that Dugan held a promissory note from RedXDefense in the amount of $250,000.[34] Others have argued that the Wired reporters' accusations are unjustified.[35] In August, 2011, the Inspector General of the Department of Defense(DoD) began an investigation to ensure the procedures had been followed, and to examine DARPA's general policies on conflict of interest as well as a specific concern that DARPA Director Regina Dugan retains financial ties to her former firm, which has won some $6 million in contracts with the agency, $4.3 million of which was awarded prior to her position as Director.[36]
The Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, Ashton Carter, and the Department of Defense, General Counsel, Jeh Johnson, stated in a letter dated May 2011 addressed to Dugan, "based on what we know, we are satisfied that, given your disqualification from matters related to RedXDefense and the procedures you have put in place, there has been no violation of conflict of interest laws or regulations in the selection or funding of RedXDefense's proposals while you have been Director of DARPA".
Prior to entering the Department of Defense, potential political appointees disclose their business investments and holdings for review.[37] Senior ethics officials in the Office of the Secretary of Defense General Counsel, Standards of Conduct Office (OSDGC, SOCO) determine what procedures are required to address potential conflicts. The procedures are designed to ensure that companies are neither favored nor disfavored and to permit talent to be attracted to government service.

Regina E. Dugan is an American businesswoman, inventor, and technology developer. She served as the 19th Director of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). In March 2012, she left government to take an executive role at Google. Just prior to the acquisition, it was announced that she would create, and lead, the Advanced Technology and Projects (ATAP) group at Google-owned Motorola Mobility. In January 2014, Google announced the acquisition of Motorola Mobility by Lenovo but retained Dugan and her Advanced Technology and Projects (ATAP) team.[3] In 2016 she left Google and joined Facebook. She will lead a newly formed team called Building 8.[4]

Education[edit]
Dugan obtained her Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees in mechanical engineering from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech) in Blacksburg, Virginia. In May 2013, she was inducted into the Virginia Tech College of Engineering’s Academy of Engineering Excellence.[5]
Dugan was awarded a PhD by the California Institute of Technology (Caltech); her thesis was titled, “Axisymmetric buoyant jets in a cross flow with shear transition and mixing.” [1]
California State University, Fullerton presented Dugan with an honorary degree in 2011.
Career[edit]
Facebook[edit]
In April 2016, Dugan left Google to head Facebook's 'Building 8',[6] a research division similar to Google's ATAP group.
Google[edit]
Dugan’s advanced technology group was not a part of the Lenovo acquisition of Motorola Mobility.[7] In February 2014, Dugan rejoined Google as Vice President of Engineering, Advanced Technology and Projects. ATAP developed Project Tango and Project Ara.
Motorola[edit]
Shortly after the Google acquisition of Motorola Mobility closed, Dugan was tasked with creating the Advanced Technology and Projects group, a skunkworks-inspired team chartered to deliver breakthrough innovations for the company. In an interview with the New York Times, Dugan described ATAP as "a small, lean, and agile group that is unafraid of failure," she said, and that it will "celebrate impatience."[8]
While a part of Motorola, ATAP developed and shipped several products including the Motorola Skip—part of an authentication portfolio that is also exploring digital tattoos and pills[9]—and the augmented reality shorts, Spotlight Stories, which were featured at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival. It was there that ATAP announced the development of Project Ara, a free, open hardware platform for creating highly modular smartphones.
Additionally, in an effort to streamline research projects, foster greater collaboration with the university research community, Dugan and her deputy, Dr. Kaigham (Ken) Gabriel, negotiated the Multi-University Research Agreement with, initially, eight leading public and private universities.[10][11]
DARPA[edit]
Experienced in counterterrorism and defense against explosive threats, Dugan first served as a DARPA program manager from 1996 to 2000. During her first DARPA tour, she directed a diverse $100 million portfolio of programs, including the Dog’s Nose program, which focused on the development of an advanced, field-portable system for detecting the explosive content of land mines.
From July 2009 to March 2012, Dugan served as the 19th Director of DARPA; she was the first woman to lead the Agency. As Director she advanced strategic initiatives in the fields of cyber security, social media, and advanced manufacturing. She also led an active operational deployment in direct support of the war in Afghanistan for which the Agency was awarded the Joint Meritorious Unit Award.
Boards[edit]
In 2013, Regina was appointed to the Board of Varian Medical Systems, Inc. (NYSE: VAR),[12] and in July 2014 she was appointed to the Board of Zynga (NASDAQ: ZNGA).[13]

Dugan was awarded a PhD by the California Institute of Technology (Caltech); her thesis was titled, “Axisymmetric buoyant jets in a cross flow with shear transition and mixing.” [1]
California State University, Fullerton presented Dugan with an honorary degree in 2011.
Career[edit]
Facebook[edit]
In April 2016, Dugan left Google to head Facebook's 'Building 8',[6] a research division similar to Google's ATAP group.
Google[edit]
Dugan’s advanced technology group was not a part of the Lenovo acquisition of Motorola Mobility.[7] In February 2014, Dugan rejoined Google as Vice President of Engineering, Advanced Technology and Projects. ATAP developed Project Tango and Project Ara.
Motorola[edit]
Shortly after the Google acquisition of Motorola Mobility closed, Dugan was tasked with creating the Advanced Technology and Projects group, a skunkworks-inspired team chartered to deliver breakthrough innovations for the company. In an interview with the New York Times, Dugan described ATAP as "a small, lean, and agile group that is unafraid of failure," she said, and that it will "celebrate impatience."[8]
While a part of Motorola, ATAP developed and shipped several products including the Motorola Skip—part of an authentication portfolio that is also exploring digital tattoos and pills[9]—and the augmented reality shorts, Spotlight Stories, which were featured at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival. It was there that ATAP announced the development of Project Ara, a free, open hardware platform for creating highly modular smartphones.
Additionally, in an effort to streamline research projects, foster greater collaboration with the university research community, Dugan and her deputy, Dr. Kaigham (Ken) Gabriel, negotiated the Multi-University Research Agreement with, initially, eight leading public and private universities.[10][11]
DARPA[edit]
Experienced in counterterrorism and defense against explosive threats, Dugan first served as a DARPA program manager from 1996 to 2000. During her first DARPA tour, she directed a diverse $100 million portfolio of programs, including the Dog’s Nose program, which focused on the development of an advanced, field-portable system for detecting the explosive content of land mines.
From July 2009 to March 2012, Dugan served as the 19th Director of DARPA; she was the first woman to lead the Agency. As Director she advanced strategic initiatives in the fields of cyber security, social media, and advanced manufacturing. She also led an active operational deployment in direct support of the war in Afghanistan for which the Agency was awarded the Joint Meritorious Unit Award.
Boards[edit]
In 2013, Regina was appointed to the Board of Varian Medical Systems, Inc. (NYSE: VAR),[12] and in July 2014 she was appointed to the Board of Zynga (NASDAQ: ZNGA).[13]

Innovation[edit]
"Disruptive innovation is the kind that unhinges old ways of operating, juices competition and creates new growth. One of the world’s leading experts on the subject is Regina Dugan," wrote Pattie Sellers in her Postcards blog.[20] Dugan has widely spoken and written about DARPA's non-linear style of innovation, which she brought with her to Motorola Mobility and Google.
"Regina does bring in outside perspective specifically related to projects that are leaps, versus incremental steps," Seattle-based wireless analyst Chetan Sharma recently told Technology Review.[21]
In a New York Times article, titled "New Force Behind Agency of Wonder", John Markoff noted that Dugan is "credited with having a knack for inspiring, and indeed insisting on, creative thinking.[22] DARPA is often discussed as a place of innovation, which was addressed during a Washington Post Live summit on U.S. Competitiveness in Washington, D.C. Talking about DARPA's innovation was likened to talking about Picasso's impressionism.[23][24]
Based on their work at DARPA and then Motorola, Dugan and Gabriel co-wrote "Special Forces Innovation" for the Harvard Business Review's October 2013 issue.[25]
Dugan partly attributes DARPA's success to an unwavering dedication to Pasteur's quadrant. The term, coined by political scientist Donald E. Stokes in his 1997 book by the same name, describes innovation that advances both basic research and solves practical problems. It is contrasted with Bohr's quadrant, which seeks foundational knowledge about the world without any consideration for practical application and with Edison's quadrant in which purely practical problem solving is attempted.
Other work[edit]
Dugan has delivered keynote addresses and moderated panel discussions at events as such as:

TED[26]
All Things Digital D9[27] and D11[28] conferences
Clinton Global Initiative Annual Meeting[29]
Clinton Global Initiative America’s Meeting
EY Strategic Growth Forum
FORTUNE Most Powerful Women Summit[30]
Qualcomm Uplinq[31]
Washington Post Live[32]
World Maker Faire[33]

In December 2013, Dugan was appointed to the Board of Directors of Varian Medical Systems, Inc. (VAR).
Potential conflict of interest[edit]
In March 2011, an article in Wired magazine stated that Dugan held stock in RedXDefense, her previous firm. In accordance with DoD policy, Dugan disclosed and recused from matters involving her former firm. A DARPA spokesperson stated that Dugan had no involvement in a 2010 contract award to RedXDefense, and that the contract was vetted by the agency’s top lawyer to assure there was no conflict. Subsequently the LA Times and Wired reported that her company had received around $1.8M in DARPA contracts and that Dugan held a promissory note from RedXDefense in the amount of $250,000.[34] Others have argued that the Wired reporters' accusations are unjustified.[35] In August, 2011, the Inspector General of the Department of Defense(DoD) began an investigation to ensure the procedures had been followed, and to examine DARPA's general policies on conflict of interest as well as a specific concern that DARPA Director Regina Dugan retains financial ties to her former firm, which has won some $6 million in contracts with the agency, $4.3 million of which was awarded prior to her position as Director.[36]
The Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, Ashton Carter, and the Department of Defense, General Counsel, Jeh Johnson, stated in a letter dated May 2011 addressed to Dugan, "based on what we know, we are satisfied that, given your disqualification from matters related to RedXDefense and the procedures you have put in place, there has been no violation of conflict of interest laws or regulations in the selection or funding of RedXDefense's proposals while you have been Director of DARPA".
Prior to entering the Department of Defense, potential political appointees disclose their business investments and holdings for review.[37] Senior ethics officials in the Office of the Secretary of Defense General Counsel, Standards of Conduct Office (OSDGC, SOCO) determine what procedures are required to address potential conflicts. The procedures are designed to ensure that companies are neither favored nor disfavored and to permit talent to be attracted to government service.

Regina E. Dugan is an American businesswoman, inventor, and technology developer. She served as the 19th Director of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). In March 2012, she left government to take an executive role at Google. Just prior to the acquisition, it was announced that she would create, and lead, the Advanced Technology and Projects (ATAP) group at Google-owned Motorola Mobility. In January 2014, Google announced the acquisition of Motorola Mobility by Lenovo but retained Dugan and her Advanced Technology and Projects (ATAP) team.[3] In 2016 she left Google and joined Facebook. She will lead a newly formed team called Building 8.[4]

Dugan was awarded a PhD by the California Institute of Technology (Caltech); her thesis was titled, “Axisymmetric buoyant jets in a cross flow with shear transition and mixing.” [1]
California State University, Fullerton presented Dugan with an honorary degree in 2011.

In an interview with the New York Times, Dugan described ATAP as "a small, lean, and agile group that is unafraid of failure," she said, and that it will "celebrate impatience."[8]
While a part of Motorola, ATAP developed and shipped several products including the Motorola Skip—part of an authentication portfolio that is also exploring digital tattoos and pills[9]—and the augmented reality shorts, Spotlight Stories, which were featured at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival. It was there that ATAP announced the development of Project Ara, a free, open hardware platform for creating highly modular smartphones.

Axisymmetric buoyant jets in a cross flow with shear: Transition and mixing


Doctoral advisor
E. John List[2]


Regina E. Dugan is an American businesswoman, inventor, and technology developer. She served as the 19th Director of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). In March 2012, she left government to take an executive role at Google. Just prior to the acquisition, it was announced that she would create, and lead, the Advanced Technology and Projects (ATAP) group at Google-owned Motorola Mobility. In January 2014, Google announced the acquisition of Motorola Mobility by Lenovo but retained Dugan and her Advanced Technology and Projects (ATAP) team.[3] In 2016 she left Google and joined Facebook. She will lead a newly formed team called Building 8.[4]

Education[edit]
Dugan obtained her Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees in mechanical engineering from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech) in Blacksburg, Virginia. In May 2013, she was inducted into the Virginia Tech College of Engineering’s Academy of Engineering Excellence.[5]
Dugan was awarded a PhD by the California Institute of Technology (Caltech); her thesis was titled, “Axisymmetric buoyant jets in a cross flow with shear transition and mixing.” [1]
California State University, Fullerton presented Dugan with an honorary degree in 2011.
Career[edit]
Facebook[edit]
In April 2016, Dugan left Google to head Facebook's 'Building 8',[6] a research division similar to Google's ATAP group.
Google[edit]
Dugan’s advanced technology group was not a part of the Lenovo acquisition of Motorola Mobility.[7] In February 2014, Dugan rejoined Google as Vice President of Engineering, Advanced Technology and Projects. ATAP developed Project Tango and Project Ara.
Motorola[edit]
Shortly after the Google acquisition of Motorola Mobility closed, Dugan was tasked with creating the Advanced Technology and Projects group, a skunkworks-inspired team chartered to deliver breakthrough innovations for the company. In an interview with the New York Times, Dugan described ATAP as "a small, lean, and agile group that is unafraid of failure," she said, and that it will "celebrate impatience."[8]
While a part of Motorola, ATAP developed and shipped several products including the Motorola Skip—part of an authentication portfolio that is also exploring digital tattoos and pills[9]—and the augmented reality shorts, Spotlight Stories, which were featured at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival. It was there that ATAP announced the development of Project Ara, a free, open hardware platform for creating highly modular smartphones.
Additionally, in an effort to streamline research projects, foster greater collaboration with the university research community, Dugan and her deputy, Dr. Kaigham (Ken) Gabriel, negotiated the Multi-University Research Agreement with, initially, eight leading public and private universities.[10][11]
DARPA[edit]
Experienced in counterterrorism and defense against explosive threats, Dugan first served as a DARPA program manager from 1996 to 2000. During her first DARPA tour, she directed a diverse $100 million portfolio of programs, including the Dog’s Nose program, which focused on the development of an advanced, field-portable system for detecting the explosive content of land mines.
From July 2009 to March 2012, Dugan served as the 19th Director of DARPA; she was the first woman to lead the Agency. As Director she advanced strategic initiatives in the fields of cyber security, social media, and advanced manufacturing. She also led an active operational deployment in direct support of the war in Afghanistan for which the Agency was awarded the Joint Meritorious Unit Award.
Boards[edit]
In 2013, Regina was appointed to the Board of Varian Medical Systems, Inc. (NYSE: VAR),[12] and in July 2014 she was appointed to the Board of Zynga (NASDAQ: ZNGA).[13]

Innovation[edit]
"Disruptive innovation is the kind that unhinges old ways of operating, juices competition and creates new growth. One of the world’s leading experts on the subject is Regina Dugan," wrote Pattie Sellers in her Postcards blog.[20] Dugan has widely spoken and written about DARPA's non-linear style of innovation, which she brought with her to Motorola Mobility and Google.
"Regina does bring in outside perspective specifically related to projects that are leaps, versus incremental steps," Seattle-based wireless analyst Chetan Sharma recently told Technology Review.[21]
In a New York Times article, titled "New Force Behind Agency of Wonder", John Markoff noted that Dugan is "credited with having a knack for inspiring, and indeed insisting on, creative thinking.[22] DARPA is often discussed as a place of innovation, which was addressed during a Washington Post Live summit on U.S. Competitiveness in Washington, D.C. Talking about DARPA's innovation was likened to talking about Picasso's impressionism.[23][24]
Based on their work at DARPA and then Motorola, Dugan and Gabriel co-wrote "Special Forces Innovation" for the Harvard Business Review's October 2013 issue.[25]
Dugan partly attributes DARPA's success to an unwavering dedication to Pasteur's quadrant. The term, coined by political scientist Donald E. Stokes in his 1997 book by the same name, describes innovation that advances both basic research and solves practical problems. It is contrasted with Bohr's quadrant, which seeks foundational knowledge about the world without any consideration for practical application and with Edison's quadrant in which purely practical problem solving is attempted.
Other work[edit]
Dugan has delivered keynote addresses and moderated panel discussions at events as such as:

TED[26]
All Things Digital D9[27] and D11[28] conferences
Clinton Global Initiative Annual Meeting[29]
Clinton Global Initiative America’s Meeting
EY Strategic Growth Forum
FORTUNE Most Powerful Women Summit[30]
Qualcomm Uplinq[31]
Washington Post Live[32]
World Maker Faire[33]

In December 2013, Dugan was appointed to the Board of Directors of Varian Medical Systems, Inc. (VAR).
Potential conflict of interest[edit]
In March 2011, an article in Wired magazine stated that Dugan held stock in RedXDefense, her previous firm. In accordance with DoD policy, Dugan disclosed and recused from matters involving her former firm. A DARPA spokesperson stated that Dugan had no involvement in a 2010 contract award to RedXDefense, and that the contract was vetted by the agency’s top lawyer to assure there was no conflict. Subsequently the LA Times and Wired reported that her company had received around $1.8M in DARPA contracts and that Dugan held a promissory note from RedXDefense in the amount of $250,000.[34] Others have argued that the Wired reporters' accusations are unjustified.[35] In August, 2011, the Inspector General of the Department of Defense(DoD) began an investigation to ensure the procedures had been followed, and to examine DARPA's general policies on conflict of interest as well as a specific concern that DARPA Director Regina Dugan retains financial ties to her former firm, which has won some $6 million in contracts with the agency, $4.3 million of which was awarded prior to her position as Director.[36]
The Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, Ashton Carter, and the Department of Defense, General Counsel, Jeh Johnson, stated in a letter dated May 2011 addressed to Dugan, "based on what we know, we are satisfied that, given your disqualification from matters related to RedXDefense and the procedures you have put in place, there has been no violation of conflict of interest laws or regulations in the selection or funding of RedXDefense's proposals while you have been Director of DARPA".
Prior to entering the Department of Defense, potential political appointees disclose their business investments and holdings for review.[37] Senior ethics officials in the Office of the Secretary of Defense General Counsel, Standards of Conduct Office (OSDGC, SOCO) determine what procedures are required to address potential conflicts. The procedures are designed to ensure that companies are neither favored nor disfavored and to permit talent to be attracted to government service.

Googler, And Former DARPA Director, Regina Dugan Joins Zynga’s Board Of Directors

Tinder’s Sean Rad To Join Us At Disrupt SF 2014












Zynga is announcing a new addition to its board of directors — Regina E. Dugan, vice president of engineering and head of the Advanced Technology and Projects group at Google.
In a memo sent to the company’s employees, CEO Don Mattrick said Dugan will be “a true catalyst for creative thinking at Zynga.” As highlighted at the recent Google I/O developer conference, Dugan’s team is working on projects like a temporary electronic tattoo that can unlock your smartphone. (She described the group as “pirates trying to do epic shit.”)
Before joining Google/Motorola Mobility, Dugan served as director of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, better known as DARPA — she was the agency’s first female leader. Zynga’s press release highlights a bunch of media-related honors as well, but I’m partial to reporter Liz Gannes’ complimentary description: “Google’s Regina Dugan Is a Badass.”
The appointment follows the departure of LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman and DreamWorks Animation CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg from Zynga’s board last month. Those departures meant that Zynga was no longer in compliance with a NASDAQ listing rule that required boards to have a majority of independent directors, as noted in a regulatory filing. With Dugan’s appointment, Zynga should be compliant again. There are now five independent directors (Dugan, Stanley J. Meresman, Sunil Paul, Ellen F. Smirnoff, and John Doerr, who is now the lead independent director). The other board members are founder and chairman Mark Pincus, Bing Gordon and Mattrick.
Dugan will chair the board’s nominating and governance committee and will also be a member of the product committee. In the release, she said:
I believe we need to play. Zynga is full of creative thinkers who embrace the power of play. Einstein famously stated that ‘combinatory play seems to be the essential feature in productive thought,’ and this spirit is embodied in Zynga’s products, which have brought new technology to games. Games that help people connect, share, rest and energize through play. I look forward to working with Don and the board on the company’s next chapter
Despite some high-profile struggles and layoffs, Zynga actually came in slightly ahead of analyst estimates in its most recent earnings report. At the time, it also announced that Pincus (who was replaced by Mattrick as CEO last year) would be stepping down from an operational role at the company.
Update: You can see the regulatory filing related to Dugan’s appointment here. The filing also mentions Mattrick vesting stock as a result of his first anniversary at the company, and a related stock sale “to satisfy the Company’s statutory tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of the [restricted stock units].”

"What would you attempt to do if you knew you could not fail?" asks Regina Dugan, then director of DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. In this breathtaking talk she describes some of the extraordinary projects — a robotic hummingbird, a prosthetic arm controlled by thought, and, well, the internet — that her agency has created by not worrying that they might fail. (Followed by a Q&A with TED's Chris Anderson)

Regina E. Dugan is an American businesswoman, inventor, and technology developer. She served as the 19th Director of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). In March 2012, she left government to take an executive role at Google. Just prior to the acquisition, it was announced that she would create, and lead, the Advanced Technology and Projects (ATAP) group at Google-owned Motorola Mobility. In January 2014, Google announced the acquisition of Motorola Mobility by Lenovo but retained Dugan and her Advanced Technology and Projects (ATAP) team.[3] In 2016 she left Google and joined Facebook. She will lead a newly formed team called Building 8.[4]

Education[edit]
Dugan obtained her Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees in mechanical engineering from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech) in Blacksburg, Virginia. In May 2013, she was inducted into the Virginia Tech College of Engineering’s Academy of Engineering Excellence.[5]
Dugan was awarded a PhD by the California Institute of Technology (Caltech); her thesis was titled, “Axisymmetric buoyant jets in a cross flow with shear transition and mixing.” [1]
California State University, Fullerton presented Dugan with an honorary degree in 2011.
Career[edit]
Facebook[edit]
In April 2016, Dugan left Google to head Facebook's 'Building 8',[6] a research division similar to Google's ATAP group.
Google[edit]
Dugan’s advanced technology group was not a part of the Lenovo acquisition of Motorola Mobility.[7] In February 2014, Dugan rejoined Google as Vice President of Engineering, Advanced Technology and Projects. ATAP developed Project Tango and Project Ara.
Motorola[edit]
Shortly after the Google acquisition of Motorola Mobility closed, Dugan was tasked with creating the Advanced Technology and Projects group, a skunkworks-inspired team chartered to deliver breakthrough innovations for the company. In an interview with the New York Times, Dugan described ATAP as "a small, lean, and agile group that is unafraid of failure," she said, and that it will "celebrate impatience."[8]
While a part of Motorola, ATAP developed and shipped several products including the Motorola Skip—part of an authentication portfolio that is also exploring digital tattoos and pills[9]—and the augmented reality shorts, Spotlight Stories, which were featured at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival. It was there that ATAP announced the development of Project Ara, a free, open hardware platform for creating highly modular smartphones.
Additionally, in an effort to streamline research projects, foster greater collaboration with the university research community, Dugan and her deputy, Dr. Kaigham (Ken) Gabriel, negotiated the Multi-University Research Agreement with, initially, eight leading public and private universities.[10][11]
DARPA[edit]
Experienced in counterterrorism and defense against explosive threats, Dugan first served as a DARPA program manager from 1996 to 2000. During her first DARPA tour, she directed a diverse $100 million portfolio of programs, including the Dog’s Nose program, which focused on the development of an advanced, field-portable system for detecting the explosive content of land mines.
From July 2009 to March 2012, Dugan served as the 19th Director of DARPA; she was the first woman to lead the Agency. As Director she advanced strategic initiatives in the fields of cyber security, social media, and advanced manufacturing. She also led an active operational deployment in direct support of the war in Afghanistan for which the Agency was awarded the Joint Meritorious Unit Award.
Boards[edit]
In 2013, Regina was appointed to the Board of Varian Medical Systems, Inc. (NYSE: VAR),[12] and in July 2014 she was appointed to the Board of Zynga (NASDAQ: ZNGA).[13]

Innovation[edit]
"Disruptive innovation is the kind that unhinges old ways of operating, juices competition and creates new growth. One of the world’s leading experts on the subject is Regina Dugan," wrote Pattie Sellers in her Postcards blog.[20] Dugan has widely spoken and written about DARPA's non-linear style of innovation, which she brought with her to Motorola Mobility and Google.
"Regina does bring in outside perspective specifically related to projects that are leaps, versus incremental steps," Seattle-based wireless analyst Chetan Sharma recently told Technology Review.[21]
In a New York Times article, titled "New Force Behind Agency of Wonder", John Markoff noted that Dugan is "credited with having a knack for inspiring, and indeed insisting on, creative thinking.[22] DARPA is often discussed as a place of innovation, which was addressed during a Washington Post Live summit on U.S. Competitiveness in Washington, D.C. Talking about DARPA's innovation was likened to talking about Picasso's impressionism.[23][24]
Based on their work at DARPA and then Motorola, Dugan and Gabriel co-wrote "Special Forces Innovation" for the Harvard Business Review's October 2013 issue.[25]
Dugan partly attributes DARPA's success to an unwavering dedication to Pasteur's quadrant. The term, coined by political scientist Donald E. Stokes in his 1997 book by the same name, describes innovation that advances both basic research and solves practical problems. It is contrasted with Bohr's quadrant, which seeks foundational knowledge about the world without any consideration for practical application and with Edison's quadrant in which purely practical problem solving is attempted.
Other work[edit]
Dugan has delivered keynote addresses and moderated panel discussions at events as such as:

TED[26]
All Things Digital D9[27] and D11[28] conferences
Clinton Global Initiative Annual Meeting[29]
Clinton Global Initiative America’s Meeting
EY Strategic Growth Forum
FORTUNE Most Powerful Women Summit[30]
Qualcomm Uplinq[31]
Washington Post Live[32]
World Maker Faire[33]

In December 2013, Dugan was appointed to the Board of Directors of Varian Medical Systems, Inc. (VAR).
Potential conflict of interest[edit]
In March 2011, an article in Wired magazine stated that Dugan held stock in RedXDefense, her previous firm. In accordance with DoD policy, Dugan disclosed and recused from matters involving her former firm. A DARPA spokesperson stated that Dugan had no involvement in a 2010 contract award to RedXDefense, and that the contract was vetted by the agency’s top lawyer to assure there was no conflict. Subsequently the LA Times and Wired reported that her company had received around $1.8M in DARPA contracts and that Dugan held a promissory note from RedXDefense in the amount of $250,000.[34] Others have argued that the Wired reporters' accusations are unjustified.[35] In August, 2011, the Inspector General of the Department of Defense(DoD) began an investigation to ensure the procedures had been followed, and to examine DARPA's general policies on conflict of interest as well as a specific concern that DARPA Director Regina Dugan retains financial ties to her former firm, which has won some $6 million in contracts with the agency, $4.3 million of which was awarded prior to her position as Director.[36]
The Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, Ashton Carter, and the Department of Defense, General Counsel, Jeh Johnson, stated in a letter dated May 2011 addressed to Dugan, "based on what we know, we are satisfied that, given your disqualification from matters related to RedXDefense and the procedures you have put in place, there has been no violation of conflict of interest laws or regulations in the selection or funding of RedXDefense's proposals while you have been Director of DARPA".
Prior to entering the Department of Defense, potential political appointees disclose their business investments and holdings for review.[37] Senior ethics officials in the Office of the Secretary of Defense General Counsel, Standards of Conduct Office (OSDGC, SOCO) determine what procedures are required to address potential conflicts. The procedures are designed to ensure that companies are neither favored nor disfavored and to permit talent to be attracted to government service.

Regina E. Dugan is an American businesswoman, inventor, and technology developer. She served as the 19th Director of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). In March 2012, she left government to take an executive role at Google. Just prior to the acquisition, it was announced that she would create, and lead, the Advanced Technology and Projects (ATAP) group at Google-owned Motorola Mobility. In January 2014, Google announced the acquisition of Motorola Mobility by Lenovo but retained Dugan and her Advanced Technology and Projects (ATAP) team.[3] In 2016 she left Google and joined Facebook. She will lead a newly formed team called Building 8.[4]

Education[edit]
Dugan obtained her Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees in mechanical engineering from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech) in Blacksburg, Virginia. In May 2013, she was inducted into the Virginia Tech College of Engineering’s Academy of Engineering Excellence.[5]
Dugan was awarded a PhD by the California Institute of Technology (Caltech); her thesis was titled, “Axisymmetric buoyant jets in a cross flow with shear transition and mixing.” [1]
California State University, Fullerton presented Dugan with an honorary degree in 2011.
Career[edit]
Facebook[edit]
In April 2016, Dugan left Google to head Facebook's 'Building 8',[6] a research division similar to Google's ATAP group.
Google[edit]
Dugan’s advanced technology group was not a part of the Lenovo acquisition of Motorola Mobility.[7] In February 2014, Dugan rejoined Google as Vice President of Engineering, Advanced Technology and Projects. ATAP developed Project Tango and Project Ara.
Motorola[edit]
Shortly after the Google acquisition of Motorola Mobility closed, Dugan was tasked with creating the Advanced Technology and Projects group, a skunkworks-inspired team chartered to deliver breakthrough innovations for the company. In an interview with the New York Times, Dugan described ATAP as "a small, lean, and agile group that is unafraid of failure," she said, and that it will "celebrate impatience."[8]
While a part of Motorola, ATAP developed and shipped several products including the Motorola Skip—part of an authentication portfolio that is also exploring digital tattoos and pills[9]—and the augmented reality shorts, Spotlight Stories, which were featured at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival. It was there that ATAP announced the development of Project Ara, a free, open hardware platform for creating highly modular smartphones.
Additionally, in an effort to streamline research projects, foster greater collaboration with the university research community, Dugan and her deputy, Dr. Kaigham (Ken) Gabriel, negotiated the Multi-University Research Agreement with, initially, eight leading public and private universities.[10][11]
DARPA[edit]
Experienced in counterterrorism and defense against explosive threats, Dugan first served as a DARPA program manager from 1996 to 2000. During her first DARPA tour, she directed a diverse $100 million portfolio of programs, including the Dog’s Nose program, which focused on the development of an advanced, field-portable system for detecting the explosive content of land mines.
From July 2009 to March 2012, Dugan served as the 19th Director of DARPA; she was the first woman to lead the Agency. As Director she advanced strategic initiatives in the fields of cyber security, social media, and advanced manufacturing. She also led an active operational deployment in direct support of the war in Afghanistan for which the Agency was awarded the Joint Meritorious Unit Award.
Boards[edit]
In 2013, Regina was appointed to the Board of Varian Medical Systems, Inc. (NYSE: VAR),[12] and in July 2014 she was appointed to the Board of Zynga (NASDAQ: ZNGA).[13]

Education[edit]
Dugan obtained her Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees in mechanical engineering from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech) in Blacksburg, Virginia. In May 2013, she was inducted into the Virginia Tech College of Engineering’s Academy of Engineering Excellence.[5]
Dugan was awarded a PhD by the California Institute of Technology (Caltech); her thesis was titled, “Axisymmetric buoyant jets in a cross flow with shear transition and mixing.” [1]
California State University, Fullerton presented Dugan with an honorary degree in 2011.
Career[edit]
Facebook[edit]
In April 2016, Dugan left Google to head Facebook's 'Building 8',[6] a research division similar to Google's ATAP group.
Google[edit]
Dugan’s advanced technology group was not a part of the Lenovo acquisition of Motorola Mobility.[7] In February 2014, Dugan rejoined Google as Vice President of Engineering, Advanced Technology and Projects. ATAP developed Project Tango and Project Ara.
Motorola[edit]
Shortly after the Google acquisition of Motorola Mobility closed, Dugan was tasked with creating the Advanced Technology and Projects group, a skunkworks-inspired team chartered to deliver breakthrough innovations for the company. In an interview with the New York Times, Dugan described ATAP as "a small, lean, and agile group that is unafraid of failure," she said, and that it will "celebrate impatience."[8]
While a part of Motorola, ATAP developed and shipped several products including the Motorola Skip—part of an authentication portfolio that is also exploring digital tattoos and pills[9]—and the augmented reality shorts, Spotlight Stories, which were featured at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival. It was there that ATAP announced the development of Project Ara, a free, open hardware platform for creating highly modular smartphones.
Additionally, in an effort to streamline research projects, foster greater collaboration with the university research community, Dugan and her deputy, Dr. Kaigham (Ken) Gabriel, negotiated the Multi-University Research Agreement with, initially, eight leading public and private universities.[10][11]
DARPA[edit]
Experienced in counterterrorism and defense against explosive threats, Dugan first served as a DARPA program manager from 1996 to 2000. During her first DARPA tour, she directed a diverse $100 million portfolio of programs, including the Dog’s Nose program, which focused on the development of an advanced, field-portable system for detecting the explosive content of land mines.
From July 2009 to March 2012, Dugan served as the 19th Director of DARPA; she was the first woman to lead the Agency. As Director she advanced strategic initiatives in the fields of cyber security, social media, and advanced manufacturing. She also led an active operational deployment in direct support of the war in Afghanistan for which the Agency was awarded the Joint Meritorious Unit Award.
Boards[edit]
In 2013, Regina was appointed to the Board of Varian Medical Systems, Inc. (NYSE: VAR),[12] and in July 2014 she was appointed to the Board of Zynga (NASDAQ: ZNGA).[13]

Innovation[edit]
"Disruptive innovation is the kind that unhinges old ways of operating, juices competition and creates new growth. One of the world’s leading experts on the subject is Regina Dugan," wrote Pattie Sellers in her Postcards blog.[20] Dugan has widely spoken and written about DARPA's non-linear style of innovation, which she brought with her to Motorola Mobility and Google.
"Regina does bring in outside perspective specifically related to projects that are leaps, versus incremental steps," Seattle-based wireless analyst Chetan Sharma recently told Technology Review.[21]
In a New York Times article, titled "New Force Behind Agency of Wonder", John Markoff noted that Dugan is "credited with having a knack for inspiring, and indeed insisting on, creative thinking.[22] DARPA is often discussed as a place of innovation, which was addressed during a Washington Post Live summit on U.S. Competitiveness in Washington, D.C. Talking about DARPA's innovation was likened to talking about Picasso's impressionism.[23][24]
Based on their work at DARPA and then Motorola, Dugan and Gabriel co-wrote "Special Forces Innovation" for the Harvard Business Review's October 2013 issue.[25]
Dugan partly attributes DARPA's success to an unwavering dedication to Pasteur's quadrant. The term, coined by political scientist Donald E. Stokes in his 1997 book by the same name, describes innovation that advances both basic research and solves practical problems. It is contrasted with Bohr's quadrant, which seeks foundational knowledge about the world without any consideration for practical application and with Edison's quadrant in which purely practical problem solving is attempted.
Other work[edit]
Dugan has delivered keynote addresses and moderated panel discussions at events as such as:

TED[26]
All Things Digital D9[27] and D11[28] conferences
Clinton Global Initiative Annual Meeting[29]
Clinton Global Initiative America’s Meeting
EY Strategic Growth Forum
FORTUNE Most Powerful Women Summit[30]
Qualcomm Uplinq[31]
Washington Post Live[32]
World Maker Faire[33]

In December 2013, Dugan was appointed to the Board of Directors of Varian Medical Systems, Inc. (VAR).
Potential conflict of interest[edit]
In March 2011, an article in Wired magazine stated that Dugan held stock in RedXDefense, her previous firm. In accordance with DoD policy, Dugan disclosed and recused from matters involving her former firm. A DARPA spokesperson stated that Dugan had no involvement in a 2010 contract award to RedXDefense, and that the contract was vetted by the agency’s top lawyer to assure there was no conflict. Subsequently the LA Times and Wired reported that her company had received around $1.8M in DARPA contracts and that Dugan held a promissory note from RedXDefense in the amount of $250,000.[34] Others have argued that the Wired reporters' accusations are unjustified.[35] In August, 2011, the Inspector General of the Department of Defense(DoD) began an investigation to ensure the procedures had been followed, and to examine DARPA's general policies on conflict of interest as well as a specific concern that DARPA Director Regina Dugan retains financial ties to her former firm, which has won some $6 million in contracts with the agency, $4.3 million of which was awarded prior to her position as Director.[36]
The Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, Ashton Carter, and the Department of Defense, General Counsel, Jeh Johnson, stated in a letter dated May 2011 addressed to Dugan, "based on what we know, we are satisfied that, given your disqualification from matters related to RedXDefense and the procedures you have put in place, there has been no violation of conflict of interest laws or regulations in the selection or funding of RedXDefense's proposals while you have been Director of DARPA".
Prior to entering the Department of Defense, potential political appointees disclose their business investments and holdings for review.[37] Senior ethics officials in the Office of the Secretary of Defense General Counsel, Standards of Conduct Office (OSDGC, SOCO) determine what procedures are required to address potential conflicts. The procedures are designed to ensure that companies are neither favored nor disfavored and to permit talent to be attracted to government service.

Regina E. Dugan is an American businesswoman, inventor, and technology developer. She served as the 19th Director of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). In March 2012, she left government to take an executive role at Google. Just prior to the acquisition, it was announced that she would create, and lead, the Advanced Technology and Projects (ATAP) group at Google-owned Motorola Mobility. In January 2014, Google announced the acquisition of Motorola Mobility by Lenovo but retained Dugan and her Advanced Technology and Projects (ATAP) team.[3] In 2016 she left Google and joined Facebook. She will lead a newly formed team called Building 8.[4]

By Adam L. Penenberglong ReadIn August, a hypersonic military plane flying at 20 times the speed of sound vanished into the Pacific Ocean, nine minutes after launching from Vandenberg Air Force Base, in Lompoc, California. The unmanned flight was an experiment conducted by DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, a Defense Department division responsible for the development of new military technology. The plane cost millions to build, and this was the second time in two years this kind of craft had been lost. Yet Regina Dugan, DARPA’s cool-blooded director, was not overly vexed. “You can’t lose your nerve for the big failure because you need exactly the same nerve for the big success,” Dugan had earlier told Fast Company during a 90-minute interview at DARPA headquarters, in Arlington, Virginia.advertisementBlistering speed and big splashes–in the Pacific and at the Pentagon–have characterized the 48-year-old Dugan’s tenure as DARPA director. The first woman to hold the role, Dugan has invigorated the agency (whose inventions led to computer networking and GPS, among other technologies that have had transformative impact on civilian life) with initiatives that may fundamentally change the way the military innovates. She has centered DARPA’s focus on the intersection of basic and applied research. She is so focused on speeding up the time from blue-sky idea to delivery of product that she has embraced crowdsourcing for both idea creation and manufacturing. Turning to the masses may seem antithetical to military secrecy, but Dugan’s unorthodox approach fits with another goal of hers: welcoming a wider array of smaller contractors to bid for DARPA projects (including AeroVironment, which fabricated the Nano Hummingbirds on the previous page). In the mini-society known as the military industrial complex, none of this is simple or uncontroversial. Earlier this year, it was revealed that DARPA had awarded a private defense firm that Dugan founded with her father and uncle $6 million in contracts over the past several years, including $1.75 million since she became agency director. Her former firm, in which she still holds a hefty stake, also owes her $250,000 for a loan she made. Dugan says she properly recused herself from all related decisions (“There’s nothing more important to me personally than ethics,” she told Fast Company), but critics worry that her influence played a role; the Department of Defense’s Inspector General is investigating.While her past is attracting attention, Dugan is firmly focused on the future. She shuns the spotlight, so much so that she requested through her deputies that Fast Company not run this story as an interview, fearing that an undue focus on her would diminish the accomplishments of her program managers (in whose ranks she dwelled several years ago). It’s clear that Dugan’s ambition for DARPA is limitless; her vision audacious. But the question remains: Will she succeed, or will her agenda–like that hypersonic vehicle–crash and burn like a short-lived experiment?FC: So, Dr. Dugan, when did you first realize you were good at math and science? Back in advanced calculus class in high school. Whenever I would speak, the other students would make computer sounds in the back of the room. Bleeping and fussing, whirring, all kinds of sounds. At moments like that I thought, Hmm, there’s something different here. advertisementDid you play sports? I did. My father had three girls. We were very close in age, and he coached us all in softball. He always had two of us who were split in the age groups, so I got him every other year as a coach. I played third base–and I was a catcher for a while, which I loved. You’re in every play, and you get really dirty.What attracted you to engineering?advertisement For a while in high school, I thought I would be an architect because I liked the combination of technical discipline with the creative side of architecture. I was curious about everything, pulled in all directions by different subjects. But then I figured out that engineering could be every bit as creative as architecture.You went to Virginia Tech and got your master’s there. Then what?I went to NASA. I actually got my first patent at NASA, for a system designed to refuel satellites in orbit.advertisementDid any of that technology work its way into launches?We did quite a bit of testing, and it might have been successful had time not passed. It just never came about because the need wasn’t there. Refreshing the electronics became more important than refueling.Was there a lesson there? Perhaps in the amount of time it takes for innovations to work their way into the product side?advertisementI had left NASA by the time they made these decisions, so I don’t know the specifics. But I do think that speed is part of the innovation process. If ideas aren’t built on with a sense of urgency, time can pass you by.This isn’t just a problem for the government. It’s a problem for everyone: The difficulty of making new ideas broadly available. And yet some ideas move quickly. Look at the progression of radio, television, the Internet, the iPod, Facebook. The acceleration in getting to millions of users has gone from 38 years to less than 4. That’s something that we’ve paid a lot of attention to: How do we increase the speed at DARPA? That seems a key part of your mission since you got here–that it’s not enough to be doing cutting-edge research.advertisementWhen deputy director Kaigham Gabriel and I got here, we understood that DARPA is one of the gems of the nation. We had been asked to take good care of her. For me, part of that meant really understanding why DARPA has this half-century of success in innovation. And the first element in DARPA’s success is the power that lies at the intersection of basic science and application, in the so-called Pasteur’s Quadrant. Do you know Stokes’s theory of innovation?Absolutely not.Donald E. Stokes wrote a theory of innovation in the late 1990s. Till then, most people thought of innovation as a linear process. You do basic science; then you do more advanced science; then you do the application work; then you commercialize it. What Stokes suggested is that it doesn’t happen that way at all. He preferred to think of it in a quadrant fashion, defining one row as very deep science and the other as light science; the two columns were a low-application drive and a high-application drive. Pasteur’s Quadrant happens at the deep-science-, high-application-drive quadrant. That’s DARPA’s absolute power lane. It’s called Pasteur’s Quadrant because serious concerns about food safety drove his research.

So the way we approach it at DARPA is to say, “Okay, let’s understand the basic science, the phenomenology. How is it that an encounter with a blast injures the brain? What levels of blasts cause what levels of injury? Is it the overpressure? Is it the acceleration? What is it?” A medical person from DARPA researched this and discovered it was the overpressure. And the DARPA physicist says, “We know how to measure that.” Together, they devise this little blast gauge that’s the size of a couple stacks of quarters [the gauge helps doctors measure a soldier’s blast-exposure level, enabling better assessment of injuries]. They develop it in one year, going through four iterations of the electronics. That’s fast.advertisementAll of this leads back to the idea of shipping products. The defense world is like a mini-society. It has to deploy to anyplace in the world on a moment’s notice, and it has to work in a life-or-death situation. That kind of focus, that kind of drive to ship an application, really does inspire greater genius. And the constancy of funding that comes with that–in good times or bad, whether this party or that party is in power–also helps inspire innovation.
You’ve introduced a number of projects that seem to be designed to speed up and open up innovation at DARPA.To increase the speed of innovation here, we want to increase the number of people who can contribute ideas to the creative process. We’re trying to get that going with things like the Adaptive Vehicle Make program, the Accelerated Manufacture of Pharmaceuticals, and a whole host of space-program projects. Then there’s also how we engage with the scientific and business communities. We structure programs so that we can have diversity of involvement from universities to small businesses to large businesses to garage inventors. You’re looking for the maximum number of folks who can contribute ideas to the process. So we’re trying to catalyze and grab the best ideas no matter where they come from, leveraging the most modern concepts of crowdsourcing and harnessing creative power. Look at the semiconductor industry. Those companies could only keep up with Moore’s law by going from hundreds of chip designers focused on eking out every last electron, to hundreds of thousands of designers throughout the industry who could excel at various pieces of the design. When you open up the process like that, the number of people and the diversity of people who can participate goes way up.advertisement

Yet with some of these crowdsourcing experiments [see Turning to the Crowd], you are transparently setting up websites where anyone can upload a video of their experiment. How do you reconcile these two opposing ideas?We have to do both. I’m sure you’re familiar with James Surowiecki’s book [The Wisdom of Crowds]. He has this great story of Francis Galton’s visit to a livestock show in 1906. Galton’s motive was to show that the average person wasn’t very smart. His basic theory was we should leave government to the smart few and not to the masses. So he came upon this contest to guess the weight of a butchered and dressed ox. And what he discovered, quite to his frustration, was that the crowd was, in fact, exceedingly smart. The mean, as predicted by the crowd, was 1,197 pounds, and the actual weight was 1,198 pounds. It was a profound outcome.
When former Secretary of Defense [Robert] Gates and his deputy interviewed you, did they ask how you’d change DARPA? Or is it the case that you were appointed and then made decisions on how best to proceed?advertisementWhen I first arrived, there was a lot of debate about whether the agency would get pulled more in the direction of basic science or more toward applied research. Obviously, I consider that a false choice. Probably the single biggest reason that I came back to serve here was that I believed lack of adaptability is a vulnerability in and of itself. This is something that has to be addressed specifically: the ability to adapt.So getting your employees to buy in is a huge deal. Tell me about your first days on the job.I decided that I had to meet every single person in the agency. At that time, there were 217–I know the number precisely! So I did it in back-to-back 10-minute meetings. The deputy director and I met everyone. advertisementWhat did you get out of that?It was valuable to me, disproportionate to my expectations. These are the musicians in this DARPA orchestra. That sounds like a crazy few weeks.advertisementYes, but that was only the first step. The next was to understand the portfolio of projects. And that was as awesome a task as meeting everyone. And it takes even longer.Are you always a 60-to-80-hour-a-week worker? The first year and the second have been at a really crushing pace. But that kind of intensity is important. I tell young people who ask me about their careers, “Wake up on Saturday and ask yourself, Which job would I go to right now? Then choose that one.” Because what it tells you is that you’re going to your passion; your passion is your work. And I feel that way about my work. advertisementTurning to the crowdThree programs that are accelerating under Dugan’s watchCyber Fast TrackThe government has had trouble keeping up with threats to America’s computer networks, which are constantly evolving. The solution: Deploy unorthodox strategies divined by a motley crew of unconventional players, including hackers, hobbyists, and independent researchers, while cutting bureaucratic red tape. Developers retain intellectual-property rights.
UAVForgeDARPA is crowdsourcing the design and construction of a portable, backpack-size unmanned aerial vehicle to fly into “critical environments” and conduct surveillance. Teams of inventors post their plans to a DARPA website where the crowd can weigh in with suggestions. Top teams are invited to demo their tech at a “fly-off” where the winning group will receive $100,000. A DARPA subcontractor will build prototypes that the inventors can demonstrate in a war-fighter exercise.System F6This crowdsourced approach to space-worthy hardware and software started three years ago with the goal of restructuring the way satellites, which run a minimum of $100 million to launch, are built. Instead of constructing a satellite as one big project, the idea is to break it into constituent pieces that can be built by different vendors of all sizes and specialties. Then each piece could be launched separately until all the parts join up in a virtual satellite formation in orbit, flying for the duration of the mission, and talking to each other wirelessly.Related:
