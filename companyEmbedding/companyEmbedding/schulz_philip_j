Article excerpt

  INTRODUCTION    Today, integrated communication needs to be viewed from a global perspective. Given the speed, span and reach of electronic communication, there are technically no local or national firms, only global ones. The reality is that organizations no longer have any choice. Once they enter the electronic arena, they become global almost instantaneously as witness the growth of Amazon.com, PriceLine, Charles Schwab and other "new economy" brands. This "global without choice" situation creates a two-fold communication scenario for executives:    (a) integrated communication that is created and related primarily at the corporate brand level; and    (b) integrated marketing communication that takes place primarily at the level of the individual brands.    Corporations or firms are brands in their own right. Thus, communication decisions are not just about traditional product branding directed by the midlevel managers, but corporate and organizational brand communication as well which generally is the purview of senior corporate managers. The important point, of course, is that both areas of communication are interactive, synergistic, and generally global. This duality in communications at varying levels of management in the firm has caused much of the disruption in traditional communication planning.    In this conceptual paper, we start by looking at the global environment in which integrated communication (corporate) and/or integrated marketing communication (product or service) will be deployed. We justify the need for the two types of communication, one taking place at the corporate level, the other at the operating marketing level. Obviously for business-to-business firms or those with unitary product or service lines, this distinction may require more analysis, and in some cases, may not even be relevant. But, for those firms with multiple product lines, diverse brands, and brand architectures that rely on the corporate name for support and relevance, the issue is clear and the discussion below appropriate. More importantly, the principles and processes outlined can, we believe, be used in all organizations. The argument that follows is based on that in our book: Global Communications: An Integrated Marketing Approach (Schultz and Kitchen, 2000) and we further develop and expand this argument in Raising the Corporate Umbrella (Kitchen and Schultz, 2001).    THE CONTEXTUAL GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT    Clearly, this paper cannot consider all types of global marketing activity (see Dunning, 1993). As the period from the mid-1980's to the present day has defined the contemporary global economy, this is where we focus attention. It is in this time span, this scenario, and this economy and related marketplaces that corporations are engaged in the battles for market and mind share, competitive positioning, and global dominance. Today, businesses are still progressing through a series of environmental upheavals that are impacting business activity around the world. This has been created by an exponential advance in information technology that potentially is universally accessible; by the dislocation of labor away from the country of origin toward the Asian, Indian, and Eastern European economies; and by the rise of informed streetwise, savvy, and sophisticated consumers at least in the triad regions (i.e. in the USA/Canada, Pacific Rim, and the European Community). These factors are all influenced and impacted by the fluid nature of capital that can flow from one side of the world to the other at the flick of a computer button. And, all this is compounded by rising social issues and growing unrest concerning globalisation, not just in underdeveloped countries but in the U.S.A., Australia, and other apparently globally connected countries.    Dunning (1993) remarks:    The decision-making nexus of the MNE [global firm] in the early 1990's has come to resemble the central nervous system of a much larger group of interdependent, but less formally governed activities, aimed primarily at advancing the globally competitive strategy and position of the core organization. …

YP advertisers receive higher placement in the default ordering of search results and may appear in sponsored listings on the top, side, or bottom of the search results page.Sort:DefaultDefaultDistanceRatingName (A - Z)Sponsored LinksAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your other collection!Error when adding to other collectionThis business was removed from the other collection1. Schulz Philip J10 Station StSimsbury, CT 06070(860) 651-8549No Internet Heading AssignedAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your other collection!Error when adding to other collectionThis business was removed from the other collection2. Schulz Phillip J Cpa100 Pearl StHartford, CT 06103(203) 777-3663No Internet Heading AssignedAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection3. Walsh Philip J175 Powder Forest DrWeatogue, CT 06089(860) 392-5000Legal Service PlansAttorneysAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection4. Carignan, Philip J111 Simsbury RdAvon, CT 06001(860) 678-2094Estate Planning AttorneysAttorneysWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection5. Shine, Philip J1776 Main StSpringfield, MA 01103(413) 734-8240Business Law AttorneysAttorneysWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection6. Philip J Callan Atty1 Monarch PlSpringfield, MA 01144(413) 733-3111AttorneysGeneral Practice AttorneysWebsiteServicesAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection7. Hendel, Philip J, JD101 Saint James BlvdSpringfield, MA 01104(413) 734-6411AttorneysGeneral Practice AttorneysWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection8. Cohen Philip J174 Worthington StSpringfield, MA 01103(413) 737-1462DentistsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection9. Conforti, Philip J, DDS850 N Main Street ExtWallingford, CT 06492(203) 678-4200DentistsBusinesses in related categories to AttorneysAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collectionPREFERRED10. Januszewski, McQuillan, & DeNigris165 W Main StNew Britain, CT 06052(860) 612-8754Wills, Trusts & Estate Planning...WebsiteDirectionsServicesMore InfoFrom Business: The Law Offices of Januszewski, McQuillan and DeNigris was founded by the late Judge Roman Lexton in 1952 to provide Connecticut residents with exceptional legal …Add to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collectionPREFERRED11. Kenny Brimmer & Mahoney20-30 Beaver RdWethersfield, CT 06109(860) 527-4226Personal Injury Law AttorneysWebsiteServices OfferedDirectionsServicesMore InfoFrom Business: Established in 1952, Kenny, Brimmer & Mahoney, LLC ( KB&M ) has established a reputation throughout Connecticut for providing dedicated legal representation in a …Add to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collectionPREFERRED12. David A.

GET DETAILSClickFIND A STORECommunicating Globally: An Integrated Marketing Approachby Schultz, Don E./ Kitchen, Philip J.How can a company effectively communicate its message to customers and prospects all over the world? How can it ensure that its branding messages "travel"? Designed to help executives position and leverage marketing communication in the global arena and use it to their ongoing strategic advantage, Communicating Globally shows how to successfully strategize, select appropriate communication tactics, and then execute a global communication plan that encompasses all sources of communication, both internal and external. Based on the strong theoretical foundations of integrated marketing communication (IMC), Communicating Globally offers a practitioner's perspective on integrated global marketing communication (IGMC) in action through vignettes, four complete case studies of well-recognized multinational brands, and one study case. Praise for Communicating Globally "In the 21st century, the ability of ad agencies to provide worldwide, integrated marketing services for their clients will become essential. Only those marketers and agencies with the ability to brand products and services globally will thrive. Communicating Globally provides a roadmap on how to do it right." O. Butch Drake, president-CEO, American Association of Advertising Agencies "No one can provide a guaranteed formula for future success, but Communicating Globally comes awfully close. By combining an astute knowledge of the global marketplace, emerging trends and technologies, and good old common sense, Don Schultz and Philip Kitchen illuminate the path for successful brand building in the 21st century." Ed Faruolo, vice president, corporate marketing communications, CIGNA Corporation "Don Schultz has done it again! His unique and highly readable approach is a must for companies looking to market globally in the new century. Communicating Globally offers an important road map through the maze of global marketing communications." James R. Gregory, CEO, Corporate Branding, LLC "This book is important because it brings the concept of integrated marketing communications (IMC) into full international focus for the first time. This focus is maintained throughout the whole structure and it makes the book a truly conceptual work. The case studies that illustrate the practical ramification of international IMC yield significant general as well as specific lessons." John Philip Jones, Syracuse University "The 1990's introduced integrated marketing--understanding and communicating relevantly with customers by using information.  Communicating Globally now takes the same principles and adapts them to today's dynamic global marketplace. Even better, it is written in a style that makes it easy for a non-marketer to fully understand the importance of managing a brand."
