LVW Advisors | Independent Investment Advisor    LVW Advisors    





























   Client Login                Read More      Read More               Our Commitment to Serious Investing LVW believes in the acquisition of in-depth market analysis.  The holistic embrace of client service.  An open-source business model that frees us to anticipate your needs.  And last but not least, hard-won independence that brings our model to life.  The market is filled with people who are willing to tell you what they think but we built LVW to show you what we believe in.  That is, the ability to solve institutional and individual client problems holistically, an open-sourced platform that delivers the customized and sophisticated solutions our clients expect and deserve, and a talented team of industry-recognized advisors with a proven ability to deliver results.
        Not Just Theory. Our principles have launched Lori Van Dusen into the elite cadre of Barron’s top financial advisors and are the basic tenets of LVW’s approach to increasing client wealth.  They are also the reason why publications such as Institutional Investor, Barron’s, and Research Magazine have recognized our team as among the best in the industry.
        We Owe You More Than A Hunch. Our structure at LVW is such that we have greater confidence in the market scenarios we develop, and through stress testing them we can buffer downside risk.  As Lori Van Dusen & Joe Zappia realized two decades ago, whether family or institution, the growth of your portfolio must be our primary focus.  LVW is organized to deliver on that core principle and to take it beyond opinion to become a deeply held conviction.
          







About Us -    LVW Advisors    




























   Client Login                Read More      Read More          LVW is the purest expression to date of client-focused strategies that Lori Van Dusen has advocated for more than two decades.  Initially dismissed as naïve, today they are the stated, but often still aspirational practices of financial professionals everywhere.    At LVW, we have two main ideas – and you are at the center of both.  First, we have a complete and undeterred focus on the performance of your investments. Secondly, we believe that individual and institutional clients are best served by an open-source platform of research and other services.  And we achieve these goals with our talented team, starting with senior management who have collaborated since the late 90’s at Citi/Smith Barney.
 
Our open-source approach allows our team to leverage insight and research from providers with subject matter and asset class expertise.  With our focus on you and your investments, we support individual families and institutions with sophisticated strategies in the areas of outsourced CFO and tax services, investment banking and lending, and estate planning and risk management, all done with our client’s interests above all else.  Continuing with our conviction to deliver what we believe are the highest caliber of service, we’ve aligned with the strength of Focus Financial Partners where we leverage resources in the areas of technology, research, and management expertise to deliver the level of client attention high-speed global markets demand.
 
How we began and why.
Our core team worked and met at Citigroup, where we began to form like-minded ideas and values that built upon the sophisticated analytics of institutional and individual wealth advisors, adding an entrepreneurial spirit and a touch of out-of-the-box thinking to the mix.

From there, the team moved to Convergent Wealth Advisors to put these ideas into practice and win the trust of a wide variety of forward-thinking institutions and ultra high-net worth individuals. After three successful years at Convergent, we decided to broaden our resources and take the next step in our evolution as a firm, forming LVW Advisors.

Who we are today.
Today, as always, we’re committed to providing every client with the best possible advice. We have built a state-of-the-art firm by accessing an even broader range of research and investment solutions and integrating them with an ideal blend of traditional and boutique-like thinking.

The result: LVW has raised the bar even higher by providing more objective advice, complete transparency, greater access to vast resources and innovative solutions and the outstanding level of service our discerning clients demand.

The LVW Advisors team:  exceptional in any kind of market.
The speed and magnitude at which the markets have changed over the past few years have provided compelling investment opportunities and significant risks, both of which require not only more vigilant oversight, but also more timely and proactive advice.

For this reason, LVW advisors are specifically chosen for their rare ability to distill research down to those insights best suited for our clients, while identifying tactical opportunities that add value to portfolios. We believe these challenging times have emphasized the importance of constructing a portfolio that can not only benefit from compelling return opportunities, but also provide downside protection.

Learn MoreClose
Our access to timely research has more than tripled.
At LVW Advisors, we’ve concluded that Investment Research is best achieved with an outsourced research model.

It is not practical for companies to carry research on their own P&L. To that end, LVW is moving from having access to 15 research analysts to having 120 analysts across 6 respected institutions. In addition, we have chosen world-class research providers in every category where we invest client assets.

Learn MoreClose
Our process is designed to protect you every step of the way.
LVW maintains rigorous process integrity that starts with an in-depth understanding of each client’s individual situation. We then utilize multi-scenario analysis to stress-test portfolios and rebalance when necessary, using advanced technologies and the same value oriented contrarian approach we’ve used over the last 20 years.
We’ve expanded our partner relationships.
Our boutique approach is backed by the strength of an industry powerhouse, Focus Financial Partners. Focus is a leading partnership of independent, fiduciary wealth management firms. Focus provides unrivaled access to best practices, resources and continuity planning for its partner firms who service individuals, families, employers and institutions with wealth management, benefit and investment consulting services. Focus partner firms maintain their entrepreneurial independence, while they benefit from the synergies, scale, economics and best practices of the market leader to achieve their business objectives.
 
Our ongoing Due Diligence process helps keep you on track.
With LVW, manager due diligence isn’t confined to the selection stage. It’s an ongoing process.

LVW Advisors and our world-class boutique research providers remain in frequent contact with each of our recommended managers and continuously gather and analyze data to determine whether or not each investment remains attractive. Much of the group’s efforts are spent gathering and evaluating information, and assessing the potential benefit or impact this information may have on client-invested funds.

Learn MoreClose
Without your trust, we wouldn’t exist.
At LVW Advisors, we take our collective fiduciary responsibilities very seriously. We stand beside you always acting as a partner you can trust. It’s our commitment to each and every client with whom we work.

While this commitment is integral to the LVW Advisor mission, it is also required by law. As a Registered Investment Advisor (“RIA”), we are obligated to follow the “trust” standard – which makes it mandatory to place the interests of our clients first, something we have always practiced. Because only with genuine trust can your goals become realities.

LVW ADVISORS, (“LVW”) is an SEC-registered investment adviser that maintains a principal office in the state of New York. Registration as an investment adviser does not imply a certain level of skill or training. LVW and its representatives are in compliance with the current registration and notice filing requirements imposed upon SEC registered investment advisers by those states in which LVW maintains clients. LVW may only transact business in those states in which it is notice filed, or qualifies for an exemption or exclusion from notice filing requirements. LVW’s website is limited to the dissemination of general information regarding its investment advisory services to United States residents residing in states where providing such information is not prohibited by applicable law. Accordingly, the publication of LVW’s website on the Internet should not be construed by any consumer and/or prospective client LVW’s solicitation to effect, or attempt to effect transactions in securities, or the rendering of personalized investment advice for compensation, over the Internet. Furthermore, the information resulting from the use of tools or other information on this Internet site should not be construed, in any manner whatsoever, as the receipt of, or a substitute for, personalized individual advice from LVW. Any subsequent, direct communication by LVW with a prospective client shall be conducted by a representative that is either registered or qualifies for an exemption or exclusion from registration in the state where the prospective client resides. For information pertaining to the registration status of LVW, please contact the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on their website at www.adviserinfo.sec.gov. A copy of LVW’s current written disclosure statement discussing LVW’s business operations, services, and fees is available from LVW upon written request. LVW does not make any representations as to the accuracy, timeliness, suitability, completeness, or relevance of any information prepared by any unaffiliated third party, whether linked to LVW’s website or incorporated herein, and takes no responsibility therefore. All such information is provided for convenience purposes only and all users thereof should be guided accordingly.
Important award and accolade disclosure(s):
Barron’s Lists and Recognition. Rankings are based on data provided by over 4,000 of the nation’s most productive advisors. Factors included in the rankings: assets under management, revenue produced for the firm, regulatory record, quality of practice and philanthropic work. Investment performance isn’t an explicit component because not all advisors have audited results and because performance figures often are influenced more by clients’ risk tolerance than by an advisor’s investment-picking abilities.
Financial Times Top 300 RIAs (“FT300”). Selection is based on the FT’s views of the performance of RIAs reporting to the SEC $300 million or more assets under management (“AUM”) in six primary areas, including: AUM, asset growth rate, the firm’s years in existence, SEC compliance record, industry certifications of key employees and online accessibility. AUM and asset growth comprise roughly 80-85% of the advisor’s score. The FT300 is presented as an “elite group” rather than a competitive ranking of 1 to 300. Neither the RIA firms nor its employees paid a fee for inclusion in the FT300.
America’s Top Women Advisors by Forbes. Ranking algorithm is based on quality of practice, such as: telephone and in-person interviews, client retention, industry experience, review of compliance records, firm nominations; and quantitative criteria, such as: assets under management and revenue generated for their firms. Investment performance is not a criteria because client objectives and risk tolerances vary, and advisors rarely have audited performance reports. Rankings are based on the opinions of SHOOK Research, LLC which does not receive compensation from the advisors or their firms in exchange for placement on a ranking. For more information see www.SHOOKresearch.com.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year




How many days after the end-of-quarter date before doing the backtest? (0 - 60) 

DAYS





      Or use day whenever the filing was submitted to the SEC
      (or the last filing when using a group of funds):
Starting Quarter

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
      You can optionally adjust when the backtest actually starts.
    
Starting Quarter:
      
All Available Dates


  Ending Quarter:
