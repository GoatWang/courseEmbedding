Utilizing a systematic, global, absolute return investment approach, the firm places particular emphasis on consistency of returns and tail risk management.

	Our absolute return-focused approach to investment management is grounded in three guiding principles:


		Protect capital in down markets

		Generate competitive returns in up markets

		Strive to outperform over the full investment cycle.

Partners in prosperity


	Clients have been drawn to Spruce for a variety of reasons, but chief among them may be our approach to collaboration. We foster true partnerships that surpass the typical client-advisor relationship, focused on the stability and growth of your investments.

	Together, we develop an Investment Policy Statement (IPS) that outlines your objectives and targets strategic asset allocation. Spruce regularly monitors the relevancy of your IPS, rebalancing investments as necessary to take advantage of changes in the climate.  The portfolio goals include traditional and alternative investment opportunities across the globe.

Wealth preservation and growth

	Serving as a trusted investment advisor for high-net-worth investors, family offices, endowments and foundations, our emphasis is on the preservation of individual and multi-generational wealth.

	Whether clients only require investment guidance, access to alternative investments, or need us to serve in the full capacity as an outsourced chief investment officer, the degree to which we are of service depends entirely on your needs. The Spruce servicing model provides clients with access to Spruce client service personnel by phone-email- or in person, includes consolidated reporting, annual presentations and custom research assignments .

Trust and collaboration

	A sophisticated investor with proprietary risk systems, Spruce has client relationships that total approximately $1.3 billion. Unbeholden to a parent company or majority shareholder, we report directly to you. Our interests are firmly aligned with yours, creating a platform of trust and collaboration upon which to build stability, growth and we believe, the opportunity for ongoing attractive investment returns.

Integrity and excellence


	We believe the caliber of our people sets Spruce apart from other investment firms. Our consistently high bar and strong emphasis on ethics attracts technologically savvy, research-driven and results-oriented investment professionals whose actions are grounded in integrity.

	The firm’s success is built on the expertise and ability of our team to intimately understand our clients’ goals and concerns, respond to market fluctuations, actively modify risk exposures and identify evolving investment opportunities with the goals of capital preservation and growth of your financial assets.

	At Spruce, we seek to create trusting client-advisor relationships. We are singularly committed to our client’s investment experience. This is evident from our initial goal-setting meetings, to the careful construction and monitoring of your portfolio, to proactively informing you of global market events along the way.

	We also believe that excellence is inherent in character, and are proud to have attracted a team of friendly, conscientious, collaborative individuals who are as committed to the success of our clients as they are to one another.
