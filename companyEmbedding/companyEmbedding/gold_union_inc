(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Forward-looking statements  The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. This quarterly report on Form 10-Q contains certain forward-looking statements and our future operating results could differ materially from those discussed herein. Certain statements contained in this discussion, including, without limitation, statements containing the words "believes," "anticipates," "expects" and the like, constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of  Currency and exchange rate  Unless otherwise noted, all currency figures quoted as "U.S. dollars", "dollars" or "$" refer to the legal currency of the United States. Throughout this report, assets and liabilities of the Company's subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated at average rates prevailing during the period. The gains and losses resulting from translation of financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income within the statement of stockholders' equity.  Overview  We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on July 6, 2010 under the name "Advanced Ventures Corp." and are a development stage company. Effective January 6, 2014, we changed our name to "Gold Union Inc."  On July 27, 2010, we entered into an exclusive worldwide patent sale agreement (the "Patent Transfer and Sales Agreement") with Ilanit Appelfeld (the "Seller"), in relation to a patented technology, U.S. Patent Number: 6,743,209 (the "Patent"), for a catheter with a integral anchoring mechanism. The patent and technology were transferred to us in exchange of payment to Ilanit Appelfeld of $17,500 (seventeen thousand five hundred United States Dollars), according to the terms and conditions specified in the Patent Transfer and Sales Agreement related to U.S. Patent Number: 6,743,209.  During the second quarter of 2011 the Company raised gross proceeds of $75,000 pursuant to an effective Form S-1 Registration Statement and issued 37,500,000 post forward stock split shares of common stock that were registered pursuant to the Form S-1 Registration Statement.  During our second fiscal quarter of 2014, we elected to discontinue our business of exploiting the Patent and to consider other business opportunities that may bring quicker and greater value to our stockholders. We initially intended to engage in the business of trading precious metal bullion primarily in the Asia Pacific region. Therefore, effective January 6, 2014, we changed our name to "Gold Union Inc." to more adequately reflect our intended business operations.  During the third fiscal quarter of 2014, we identified an opportunity to enter into the real property development business in Cambodia. On August 28, 2014, we executed a Share Exchange Agreement with G.U. International Limited, a limited company incorporated under the laws of the Republic of Seychelles and our wholly owned subsidiary ("GUI"), and Kao Wei-Chen, an individual representing herself and 8 other individuals (collectively, the "Golden Corridor Shareholders"), which agreement was amended several times to extend the closing date of the acquisition (collectively, the "Share Exchange Agreement"). Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, we, through GUI, purchased 480 shares of Phnom Penh Golden Corridor Trading Co. Limited (the "GC Shares"), from 9 private Golden Corridor Shareholders, representing 48% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Golden Corridor. As consideration, we agreed to issue to the Golden Corridor Shareholders 2,500,000,000 shares of our common stock, at a value of US $0.002 per share, for an aggregate value of US $5,000,000. We consummated the acquisition of the GC Shares on December 31, 2015.  Golden Corridor owns three parcels of land located at National Road 44, Phum Phkung, Chbarmorn Commune, Chbarmorn District, Kampong Speu Province, Kingdom of Cambodia, measuring an aggregate of 172,510 square meters (collectively, the "Properties"). Pursuant to an independent valuation conducted by a third party appraisal firm licensed under the Ministry of Economy and Finance of Cambodia and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Cambodia, the Properties have an estimated value of US $10,350,600 as of April 8, 2014. Golden Corridor intends to develop the Properties into an industrial park for rental income within the next two or three years. Golden Corridor has not yet commenced any significant operations but expects to begin efforts to prepare and submit the relevant planning and development application and information necessary to commence the development process.  As a result of our acquisition of the GC Shares, we elected to cease our metal bullion trading business and enter into the real estate development and rental business located in the Kingdom of Cambodia.  Intellectual Property  We continue to own the rights, title and interests in Patent for a receptacle catheter with integral anchoring means, which Patent is associated with our former business. The Patent was issued on September 1, 2004 and will expire on September 6, 2022.  Employees  We currently do not have any full time or part time employees. Our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Secretary, Lim Yew Chuan, is expected to carry out all administrative functions. Once Golden Corridor begins development activities, we expect Golden Corridor to hire additional officers and employees for such operations.  We do not have any union employees.  Transfer Agent  We have engaged Nevada Agency and Transfer Company as our stock transfer agent. Nevada Agency and Transfer Company is located at 50 West Liberty Street, Reno, Nevada 89501. Their telephone number is (775) 322-0626 and their fax number is  Research and Development  We have incurred minimal research and development expenses to date and do not plan to undertake additional research and development activities during the next twelve months.  Subsidiaries  On July 21, 2014, we formed G.U. Asia Limited, a limited company, under the laws of Hong Kong, for the purpose of conducting business in Asia.  On July 31, 2014, we formed G.U. International Limited, a limited company, under the laws of the Republic of Seychelles. G.U. International Limited holds 48% of the issued and outstanding securities of Golden Corridor.  Financial Condition  During the twelve-month period following the date of this quarterly report, we anticipate that we will not generate any revenue. Accordingly, we will be required to obtain additional financing in order to pursue our plan of operations during and beyond the next twelve months. We believe that debt financing will not be an alternative for funding as we do not have tangible assets to secure any debt financing. We anticipate that additional funding will be in the form of equity financing from the sale of our common stock or shareholder loans. However, we do not have any financing arranged and we cannot provide investors with any assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient funding from the sale of our common stock or shareholder loans to establish our new business.  Results of Operations  Comparison of the three months ended March 31, 2016 and March 31, 2015  The following table sets forth certain operational data for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016:   Three Months ended March 31, 2017 2016 Revenue $ - $ - Operating Expenses: Professional fees 17,068 17,408 General and administrative expenses 3,977 16,629 Loss before income tax (21,045 ) (34,037 ) Income tax expense - - Net loss $ (21,045 ) $ (34,037 ) Net loss attributable to non-controlling interest (2,068 ) (8,647 ) Net loss attributable to non-controlling interest (18,977 ) (25,390 ) Net loss per share - Basic and diluted $ (0.00 ) $ (0.00 ) Weighted average shares outstanding - Basic and diluted 2,663,134,500 2,663,134,500  Net Revenue. We have not generated revenues since inception. We are working to develop our real estate development business in Cambodia and hope to generate revenue as such business develops.  Operating Expenses. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, we incurred operating expenses of $21,045, as compared to $34,037 during the same period ended March 31, 2016. Operating expenses consisted of general and administrative expenses and professional fees.  We expect our operating expenses to increase as we begin our real estate development business.  Net Loss. We incurred a net loss of $21,045 and $34,037 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, and 2016, respectively. The decrease in net loss occurred from a slight decrease in our general and administrative expenses. Net loss during the three months ended March 31, 2017, consisted of net loss of $18,977 attributable to Gold Union Inc. and $2,068 attributable to Golden Corridor. Net loss during the three months ended March 31, 2016, consisted of net loss of $25,390 attributable to Gold Union Inc. and $8,647 attributable to Golden Corridor.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation. We have not attained profitable operations and are dependent upon obtaining financing to our business plans. For these reasons our auditors stated in their report on our audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 that they have substantial doubt we will be able to continue as a going concern. Going concern uncertainties are also expressed in Note 3 of our financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2016.  As of March 31, 2017, our current assets were $88,912 and our current liabilities were $267,998, resulting in a working capital deficit of $179,086. Our current liabilities consisted of $225,003 due to related parties and $42,995 of accounts payables and accrued liabilities. Our long term assets consisted solely of land under development of $630,000.  Stockholders' deficit decreased from $104,507 as of December 31, 2016 to $85,530 as of March 31, 2017.  We have never paid dividends on our Common Stock. Our present policy is to apply cash to investments in product development, acquisitions or expansion; consequently, we do not expect to pay dividends on Common Stock in the foreseeable future.  The success of our growth strategy is dependent upon the availability of additional capital resources on terms satisfactory to management. Our sources of capital in the past have included the sale of equity securities, which include common stock sold in private transactions and public offerings, capital leases and long-term debt. There can be no assurance that we can raise such additional capital resources on satisfactory terms. We believe that our current cash and other sources of liquidity discussed below are adequate to support operations for at least the next 12 months. We anticipate continuing to rely on equity sales of our common shares and shareholder loans in order to continue to fund our business operations. Issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to our existing shareholders. There is no assurance that we will achieve any additional sales of our equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund our plan of operations.  Three months ended 3/31/2017 3/31/2016 Net cash used in operating activities $14,523 $33,908 Net cash provided by financing activities $10,486 $17,279  Net Cash Used In Operating Activities.  We have not generated any revenues since inception. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, net cash used in operating activities was $14,523 as compared to net cash used in operating activities of $33,908 for the three months ended March 31, 2016.  Net Cash Provided By Financing Activities.  During the three months ended March 31, 2017, net cash provided by financing activities was $10,486 as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $17,279 for the same period ended March 31, 2016. Net cash provided by financing activities for the period ended March 31, 2017, consisted of ________________. Net cash provided by financing activities for the period ended March 31, 2016, consisted solely of advances from Vincent Lim, a former director of Gold Union Inc.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  We have no outstanding off-balance sheet guarantees, interest rate swap transactions or foreign currency contracts. We do not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires our management to make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported, including the notes thereto, and related disclosures of commitments and contingencies, if any. We have identified certain accounting policies that are significant to the preparation of our financial statements. These accounting policies are important for an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations. Critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management's subjective or complex judgment, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting the estimate may differ significantly from management's current judgments. We believe the following accounting policies are critical in the preparation of our financial statements.  � Basis of presentation  These accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("US GAAP").  � Use of estimates  In preparing these condensed consolidated financial statements, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the balance sheets and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results may differ from these estimates.  � Land under development  Land under development relating to freehold farmland, is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line basis over the following expected useful lives from the date on which they become fully operational.  Long-lived assets primarily include freehold farmland held for development. In accordance with the provision of ASC Topic 360, "Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets", the Company generally conducts its annual impairment evaluation to its long-lived assets, usually in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist, such as a significant sustained change in the business climate. The recoverability of long-lived assets is measured at the reporting unit level. If the total of the expected undiscounted future net cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset, a loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value and carrying amount of the asset. There has been no impairment charge for the periods presented.  � Related parties  The Company follows subtopic 850-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions.  Pursuant to section 850-10-20 the related parties include a) affiliates of the Company; b) entities for which investments in their equity securities would be required, absent the election of the fair value option under the Fair Value Option Subsection of section 825-10-15, to be accounted for by the equity method by the investing entity; c) trusts for the benefit of employees, such as pension and Income-sharing trusts that are managed by or under the trusteeship of management; d) principal owners of the Company; e) management of the Company;  The financial statements shall include disclosures of material related party transactions, other than compensation arrangements, expense allowances, and other similar items in the ordinary course of business. However, disclosure of transactions that are eliminated in the preparation of consolidated or combined financial statements is not required in those statements. The disclosures shall include: a) the nature of the relationship(s) involved; b) a description of the transactions, including transactions to which no amounts or nominal amounts were ascribed, for each of the periods for which income statements are presented, and such other information deemed necessary to an understanding of the effects of the transactions on the financial statements; c) the dollar amounts of transactions for each of the periods for which income statements are presented and the effects of any change in the method of establishing the terms from that used in the preceding period; and d) amount due from or to related parties as of the date of each balance sheet presented and, if not otherwise apparent, the terms and manner of settlement.  � Fair value of financial instruments  The Company follows paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments and has adopted paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("Paragraph 820-10-35-37") to measure the fair value of its financial instruments. Paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three (3) broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three (3) levels of fair value hierarchy defined by paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification are described below:  Level 1 Quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. Level 2 Pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date. Level 3 Pricing inputs that are generally observable inputs and not corroborated by market data.  Financial assets are considered Level 3 when their fair values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable.  The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. If the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within more than one level described above, the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument.  The carrying amounts of the Company's financial assets and liabilities, such as cash and accounts payable and accrued expenses, approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments.  Transactions involving related parties cannot be presumed to be carried out on an arm's-length basis, as the requisite conditions of competitive, free-market dealings may not exist. Representations about transactions with related parties, if made, shall not imply that the related party transactions were consummated on terms equivalent to those that prevail in arm's-length transactions unless such representations can be substantiated.  � Recent accounting pronouncements  The Company has reviewed all recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and does not believe the future adoption of any such pronouncements may be expected to cause a material impact on its financial condition or the results of its operations.

EF BRIGHT GOLD SHIMMER

Instructions: Direct printing on light or dark garments. Stencils: Use any direct emulsion or capillary film.
Additives: Shimmer Metallic inks are supplied ready to print Reducer/Detackifier (PLRE-9000) may be added if a thinner consistency is required.
Curing: These inks will cure at 300 F (149 C.). Because of the reflective nature of this ink, it requires a longer curing time under the heat to reach the required temperature than standard plastisols.
Recommendation: Caution: Always test this product for curing, adhesion, crocking, opacity, washability and other specific requirements before using in production.
Statement: Union Ink does not knowingly add plasticizers containing the phthalates listed and outlined in California Bill 1108, CPSIA HR-4040 and Oeko-tex Standard 100. The plasticizers identified may include di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), benzyl butyl phthalate (BBP), diisononyl phthalate (DINP), diisodecyl phthalate (DIDP), di-n-octyl phthalate (DnOP), (DIBP) Di-iso-butyl, and (DMP) Dimethylphthalate, including esters of ortho-phthalic acid and are not direct ingredients in the manufacture of our Non-Phthalate Inks. Union Ink does not test the final product for amounts of the aforementioned phthalate plasticizers and esters and encourages all users to conduct testing for their intended use.
Disclaimer: Not all Union products are available in every country. Please check with your local representative for availability. The data presented in this leaflet are in accordance with the present state of our knowledge, but do not absolve the user from carefully checking all supplies immediately on receipt. We reserve the right to alter product constants within the scope of technical progress or new developments. The recommendations made in this leaflet should be checked by preliminary trials because of conditions during processing over which we have no control. Recommendations for use do not constitute a warranty, either express or implied, of the fitness or suitability of the products for a particular purpose.
