Description
Reviews (8)


From the lowest point on earth, Dead Sea Mud is an all natural skin nourishing mask, for any part of the body. Dead Sea Mineral Mud is a wonderful detoxifying treatment for the skin, gently exfoliating and drawing out toxins and impurities. It also contains a rich supply of nutrients and minerals that revitalize the skin and make it more healthy, smoother, clearer, and well moisturized. Some of the essential minerals found in Dead Sea mud are sodium, magnesium, potassium, chloride, iron, and calcium, all of which are agents in keeping the skin healthy, supple and beautiful. You can use it as a face mask, apply it to areas of soreness, use it in your hair to reduce dandruff and nourish the hair follicles, apply it to itchy spots, scars, or dry skin. Dead sea mud also increases the flexibility of the skin, allowing it to smooth over wrinkles and prevent new lines.Directions For Use: We recommend that you apply the Dead Sea Mineral Mud as a face or body mask, and leave it on the skin until the mud is dry (5 to 15 minutes). Rinse it off well, then follow it up with a moisturizer. As the mask dries, you might notice a slight pulling sensation on your skin. This is the mask gently exfoliating, drawing out toxins and impurities. At the same time it is allowing the beneficial ingredients within the mask to absorb into your skin. Which leaves your skin more tone, even in texture, and clear. If you experience irritation, discontinue use. Our Dead Sea Mineral Mud is 100% natural and imported from Israel. Net weight 4 oz.This product has not been evaluated by the FDA and is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any health condition or disease.Ingredients: Dead Sea Mud, DMDM Hydantoin (0.009%). (This preservative has been added to maintain the shelf life of the product. While we always strive to keep our products chemical-free, the nature of Dead Sea Mud requires the addition of a full-spectrum preservative to prevent the growth of bacteria and molds. DMDM has been deemed safe as a preservative by the FDA and falls well within the prescribed limit.)
