XIM’s Peel Bond is a unique, high build, water-based, penetrating, bonding primer/sealer. It is formulated to bond-to and seal a wide range of construction materials. It can reduce the cracking and peeling or the top coat paint by remaining flexible over the life of the paint. It can help reduce the time spent on surface Preparation, however, it is not a complete substitute for all surface preparation and all surface conditions.


                                        Applies up to 30 mils wet

                                    Be sure the surface is clean and dry, free from dust, grease, wax, oil, and other surface contaminants. Clean with a strong detergent, rinse and allow to dry.
