About us.




 
 




          Scientific Energy Improvements (SEI) was founded  in Nettleton, MS.   Nettleton is a small town in Northeast Mississippi just south of Tupelo   (birthplace of Elvis Presley). Our company was formed by Phillip Baulch and Buck   Hester.

Our company roots were planted six years ago with Phillip and Buck's first   business partnership, Digital Impressions. Phillip, a software engineer by trade   and Buck who specializes in web programming and marketing saw an upcoming trend   in direct marketing. They launched Digital Impressions as a full-service direct   marketing, printing and graphics company. Over the years, they assembled a team   of people and built their business on catering to the specific needs of their   customers.


Because of their mutual interest in all things technical, Phillip and Buck   began researching and venturing into the energy-saving product business. With a   marketing structure already in place (from Digital Impressions) they formed SEI   with the intention of providing proven energy-saving products directly to   customers nation-wide. Their philosophy is simple; source American-made products   (whenever possible), market these products through informative zero-pressure   local dinner seminars with highly-trained energy experts and to provide a   quality product at a reasonable price.
Our energy experts are now located throughout the southern and mid-eastern   states. They are meeting daily with people in these areas to show them products   that will not only save on their energy cost but will also increase the comfort   level of their homes.
Phillip and Buck hope that you enjoy learning about our company and will   contact us so that you too can start saving and living more comfortably in your   home. Be on the lookout for an exclusive seminar invitation in your area. We   look forward to seeing you soon.

SEI-100™ is made only from top-of-the-line materials, and with a reflectivity of 97%, SEI-100™ reflects virtually all of the radiant heat from the sun away from your residential home or commercial building, saving you money on your utility bills. SEI-100™ outshines the competition.
Whether you are building a new home or live in an older home, it is never too late to add the energy efficient SEI-100™. The attic is generally the easiest and most common place to install SEI-100™. In this location, our highly reflective Thermal Blanket is very effective at reducing both the heat gained in the summer and lost in the winter to make your home more comfortable and save money on utility bills.





 




 
We understand that purchasing SEI-100 
    is only the first step in saving on your energy usage, the second step is having it installed by a trained and professional installation crew. We have experienced and professional installers so you can enjoy the peace of mind that comes from SEI that not only will you receive the best energy saving products on the market but you will also have them installed by our trained Professional installers.

BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions

                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.
