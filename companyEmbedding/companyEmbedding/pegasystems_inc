History[edit]
Early history[edit]
Alan Trefler founded Pegasystems in 1983 at the age of 28, in Cambridge, Massachusetts.[3] Prior to founding the company, in the early 1980s Trefler had developed computer systems that could play chess.[1] During the company's early years it focused on providing case management, namely for companies such as American Express.[11][1] Trefler recollects that when he started Pegasystems, he wanted to create software that eased the heavy lifting that business people deal with, as well as software that understood how business-people wanted things to work, commenting "it turns out to be a fairly hard problem to solve."[1] An article in Computerworld traces business rules engine to the early 1990s and to products from the likes of Pegasystems, Fair Isaac Corp and ILOG.[12] As a private company, Pegasystems was "bootstrapped" initially, but did not take on outside investors.[1] The company went public in 1996 with initial and secondary public offerings,[13] and began trading on NASDAQ under the symbol PEGA. Raising several millions in funding in the process, going public freed the company from needing to pursue venture capital investments.[1] Pegasystems entered a period of financial trouble in the late 1990s, following a dispute with its accountants, Ernst & Young.[14] After restating their earnings, Pegasystems faced an investigation by the SEC, which was dropped in 2002.[13]
Acquisitions[edit]
In March 2010, Pegasystems acquired the enterprise software company Chordiant for around $161.5 million. Although it had clients such as Citibank, Capital One, MetLife, Cigna, Wellpoint, T-Mobile, and Vodafone and was described as an "innovator" in "applying predictive analytics to customer interactions," Chordiant had struggled in the 2008 recession.[10] The acquisition gave Pegasystems access to new markets such as telecommunications and healthcare, with Pegasystems integrating Chordiant and its customer relationship management (CRM) technology into its existing operations.[4] Pega Cloud was introduced using Amazon Web Services in 2012,[2] and in October 2013, Pegasystems acquired the mobile application developer Antenna Software[15][4] for $27.7 million. Located in New Jersey, Antenna also had bases in Kraków and Bangalore.[15]
In October 2013, Pegasystems was described as a "provider of business process management (BPM) and [CRM] solutions," and had its global development center in Hyderabad.[15] Revenues for the company grew strongly when compared to the rest of the business process management market from 2005 until 2013, with license revenues rising 34% in 2013.[4] The company reported that profit increases in 2013 were "fueled by demand for an upgrade to its main software product," Pega Platform, which was designed so companies could integrate data and software systems.[16] After it released its recent financial results in November 2013, Pegasystems' stock rose 20%,[17] resulting in an 122 percent value increase over the prior year and a record high for the company.[16]
Recent history[edit]
Pegasystems hired a cloud technology proponent to develop its cloud technology strategy in 2014. Over the following year, Pegasystems invested in network operations in North America and India to support its cloud services.[18] In May 2014, Pegasystems acquired the Bangalore-based MeshLabs, a text mining and analytics software startup. The Times of India reported that Pegasystems would integrate MeshLabs's text analytics software "to gather unstructured social media data and decode it into actionable business insights for its clients." The financial details of the transaction were not disclosed.[19] Pegasystems acquired Firefly[disambiguation needed] in June 2014, a co-browsing tool funded by First Round Capital.[20] The startup from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania was the company's first move into the cobrowsing market.[20] By the summer of 2014, Pegasystems remained headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts with 2,700 employees.[20][19] By July 2014 the company was worth around US$1 billion.[3]
By early 2015, Pegasystems remained a publicly traded company[1] on the Nasdaq,[19] with 3,000 employees, 30 offices, and "more than half a billion dollars in revenue."[1] As of February 2015, the company had active partnerships with IT outsourcing companies such as Tata Consultancy Services, InfosysBSE, WiproBSE, HCL Technologies, Accenture and Cognizant.[21] By September of that year, companies who had built teams of Pegasystems specialists included Accenture, Ernst & Young and Cognizant.[18] Between 2005 and 2015, Pegasystems had average sales growth of 21% per year.[22] There was a steady rise in the company's share price in 2015,[23] with higher than expected revenues from the year prior.[24] In January 2016, it was reported that Pegasystems planned on raising its number of employees significantly,[5] and the company announced the acquisition of OpenSpan Inc. in April 2016.[25] Based in Atlanta, Georgia, OpenSpan specialized in robotic process automation and workforce analytics software.[26]

Products and services[edit]
Pegasystems develops and supports software[5] for customer engagement[1] and operations.[5] In particular, as of 2013 Pega specialized in software for business process management (BPM) and customer relationship management (CRM),[4] and was seen as offering more bespoke technology than competitors such as Oracle Corporation or SAP ERP.[30] As of late 2013, Pega’s core software, PegaRULES Process Commander (PRPC), was related to BPM.[4] The company's current core software offering is its Pega 7 platform, which is accessible via cloud technologies.[5] Pega 7 platform is the company's "core offering in the market that mixes business process management, CRM, data analytics, big data (social and mobile)." The company continuously modifies and updates the platform, investing as well in co-browsing and cloud and social media to integrate.[5] In August 2015, the company "made a strategic decision to make its software easier to use," hiring teams with backgrounds in user experience. By September 2015, the company had introduced Pega Express. Pega Express was designed to allow business specialists to quickly build simple applications.[18]
Fortune wrote in August 2015 that Pegasystems' CRM suite "correlates data from existing marketing, sales, and support systems. Whenever a call arrives, an agent is presented with an omnichannel view of the history so he or she receives a heads-up into what the call might be about. That in itself isn't so new, but the software also uses predictive analytics to suggest solutions proactively. In Sprint’s case, agents are presented with several different scenarios of how to handle a call."[8] In 2015, Pegasystems' CRM suite was listed as one of the top five largest in the CRM market by David Roe of CMSWire, alongside Salesforce.com, SAP CRM, Oracle CRM and Microsoft Dynamics CRM.[31] Gartner mentioned Pega in April 2015,[32] and Forrester Research named Pegasystems a "leader in customer service for enterprise clients" in December 2015.[22]

History[edit]
Early history[edit]
Alan Trefler founded Pegasystems in 1983 at the age of 28, in Cambridge, Massachusetts.[3] Prior to founding the company, in the early 1980s Trefler had developed computer systems that could play chess.[1] During the company's early years it focused on providing case management, namely for companies such as American Express.[11][1] Trefler recollects that when he started Pegasystems, he wanted to create software that eased the heavy lifting that business people deal with, as well as software that understood how business-people wanted things to work, commenting "it turns out to be a fairly hard problem to solve."[1] An article in Computerworld traces business rules engine to the early 1990s and to products from the likes of Pegasystems, Fair Isaac Corp and ILOG.[12] As a private company, Pegasystems was "bootstrapped" initially, but did not take on outside investors.[1] The company went public in 1996 with initial and secondary public offerings,[13] and began trading on NASDAQ under the symbol PEGA. Raising several millions in funding in the process, going public freed the company from needing to pursue venture capital investments.[1] Pegasystems entered a period of financial trouble in the late 1990s, following a dispute with its accountants, Ernst & Young.[14] After restating their earnings, Pegasystems faced an investigation by the SEC, which was dropped in 2002.[13]
Acquisitions[edit]
In March 2010, Pegasystems acquired the enterprise software company Chordiant for around $161.5 million. Although it had clients such as Citibank, Capital One, MetLife, Cigna, Wellpoint, T-Mobile, and Vodafone and was described as an "innovator" in "applying predictive analytics to customer interactions," Chordiant had struggled in the 2008 recession.[10] The acquisition gave Pegasystems access to new markets such as telecommunications and healthcare, with Pegasystems integrating Chordiant and its customer relationship management (CRM) technology into its existing operations.[4] Pega Cloud was introduced using Amazon Web Services in 2012,[2] and in October 2013, Pegasystems acquired the mobile application developer Antenna Software[15][4] for $27.7 million. Located in New Jersey, Antenna also had bases in Kraków and Bangalore.[15]
In October 2013, Pegasystems was described as a "provider of business process management (BPM) and [CRM] solutions," and had its global development center in Hyderabad.[15] Revenues for the company grew strongly when compared to the rest of the business process management market from 2005 until 2013, with license revenues rising 34% in 2013.[4] The company reported that profit increases in 2013 were "fueled by demand for an upgrade to its main software product," Pega Platform, which was designed so companies could integrate data and software systems.[16] After it released its recent financial results in November 2013, Pegasystems' stock rose 20%,[17] resulting in an 122 percent value increase over the prior year and a record high for the company.[16]
Recent history[edit]
Pegasystems hired a cloud technology proponent to develop its cloud technology strategy in 2014. Over the following year, Pegasystems invested in network operations in North America and India to support its cloud services.[18] In May 2014, Pegasystems acquired the Bangalore-based MeshLabs, a text mining and analytics software startup. The Times of India reported that Pegasystems would integrate MeshLabs's text analytics software "to gather unstructured social media data and decode it into actionable business insights for its clients." The financial details of the transaction were not disclosed.[19] Pegasystems acquired Firefly[disambiguation needed] in June 2014, a co-browsing tool funded by First Round Capital.[20] The startup from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania was the company's first move into the cobrowsing market.[20] By the summer of 2014, Pegasystems remained headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts with 2,700 employees.[20][19] By July 2014 the company was worth around US$1 billion.[3]
By early 2015, Pegasystems remained a publicly traded company[1] on the Nasdaq,[19] with 3,000 employees, 30 offices, and "more than half a billion dollars in revenue."[1] As of February 2015, the company had active partnerships with IT outsourcing companies such as Tata Consultancy Services, InfosysBSE, WiproBSE, HCL Technologies, Accenture and Cognizant.[21] By September of that year, companies who had built teams of Pegasystems specialists included Accenture, Ernst & Young and Cognizant.[18] Between 2005 and 2015, Pegasystems had average sales growth of 21% per year.[22] There was a steady rise in the company's share price in 2015,[23] with higher than expected revenues from the year prior.[24] In January 2016, it was reported that Pegasystems planned on raising its number of employees significantly,[5] and the company announced the acquisition of OpenSpan Inc. in April 2016.[25] Based in Atlanta, Georgia, OpenSpan specialized in robotic process automation and workforce analytics software.[26]
Educational programs and conferences[edit]
Pega Academy was founded to "provide online resources, classroom training and certification for systems integrators to help them train up new Pega specialists."[18] In 2016, Pegasystems announced the launch of the Pega University Academic Program (UAP), offering training and certification on the Pega 7 platform for educators and students.[27] In November 2016, Pegasystems Inc signed an agreement with TalentSprint to train 10,000 Pega-certified professionals at Indian engineering colleges. At the time, there were 27,000 professionals trained in Pegasystems technology, with 60 percent in India.[28] The first PegaWorld conference was held in 2006.[2] PegaWorld 2016, the company's annual users' conference, brought in 3,500 attendees.[29]

History[edit]
Early history[edit]
Alan Trefler founded Pegasystems in 1983 at the age of 28, in Cambridge, Massachusetts.[3] Prior to founding the company, in the early 1980s Trefler had developed computer systems that could play chess.[1] During the company's early years it focused on providing case management, namely for companies such as American Express.[11][1] Trefler recollects that when he started Pegasystems, he wanted to create software that eased the heavy lifting that business people deal with, as well as software that understood how business-people wanted things to work, commenting "it turns out to be a fairly hard problem to solve."[1] An article in Computerworld traces business rules engine to the early 1990s and to products from the likes of Pegasystems, Fair Isaac Corp and ILOG.[12] As a private company, Pegasystems was "bootstrapped" initially, but did not take on outside investors.[1] The company went public in 1996 with initial and secondary public offerings,[13] and began trading on NASDAQ under the symbol PEGA. Raising several millions in funding in the process, going public freed the company from needing to pursue venture capital investments.[1] Pegasystems entered a period of financial trouble in the late 1990s, following a dispute with its accountants, Ernst & Young.[14] After restating their earnings, Pegasystems faced an investigation by the SEC, which was dropped in 2002.[13]
Acquisitions[edit]
In March 2010, Pegasystems acquired the enterprise software company Chordiant for around $161.5 million. Although it had clients such as Citibank, Capital One, MetLife, Cigna, Wellpoint, T-Mobile, and Vodafone and was described as an "innovator" in "applying predictive analytics to customer interactions," Chordiant had struggled in the 2008 recession.[10] The acquisition gave Pegasystems access to new markets such as telecommunications and healthcare, with Pegasystems integrating Chordiant and its customer relationship management (CRM) technology into its existing operations.[4] Pega Cloud was introduced using Amazon Web Services in 2012,[2] and in October 2013, Pegasystems acquired the mobile application developer Antenna Software[15][4] for $27.7 million. Located in New Jersey, Antenna also had bases in Kraków and Bangalore.[15]
In October 2013, Pegasystems was described as a "provider of business process management (BPM) and [CRM] solutions," and had its global development center in Hyderabad.[15] Revenues for the company grew strongly when compared to the rest of the business process management market from 2005 until 2013, with license revenues rising 34% in 2013.[4] The company reported that profit increases in 2013 were "fueled by demand for an upgrade to its main software product," Pega Platform, which was designed so companies could integrate data and software systems.[16] After it released its recent financial results in November 2013, Pegasystems' stock rose 20%,[17] resulting in an 122 percent value increase over the prior year and a record high for the company.[16]
Recent history[edit]
Pegasystems hired a cloud technology proponent to develop its cloud technology strategy in 2014. Over the following year, Pegasystems invested in network operations in North America and India to support its cloud services.[18] In May 2014, Pegasystems acquired the Bangalore-based MeshLabs, a text mining and analytics software startup. The Times of India reported that Pegasystems would integrate MeshLabs's text analytics software "to gather unstructured social media data and decode it into actionable business insights for its clients." The financial details of the transaction were not disclosed.[19] Pegasystems acquired Firefly[disambiguation needed] in June 2014, a co-browsing tool funded by First Round Capital.[20] The startup from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania was the company's first move into the cobrowsing market.[20] By the summer of 2014, Pegasystems remained headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts with 2,700 employees.[20][19] By July 2014 the company was worth around US$1 billion.[3]
By early 2015, Pegasystems remained a publicly traded company[1] on the Nasdaq,[19] with 3,000 employees, 30 offices, and "more than half a billion dollars in revenue."[1] As of February 2015, the company had active partnerships with IT outsourcing companies such as Tata Consultancy Services, InfosysBSE, WiproBSE, HCL Technologies, Accenture and Cognizant.[21] By September of that year, companies who had built teams of Pegasystems specialists included Accenture, Ernst & Young and Cognizant.[18] Between 2005 and 2015, Pegasystems had average sales growth of 21% per year.[22] There was a steady rise in the company's share price in 2015,[23] with higher than expected revenues from the year prior.[24] In January 2016, it was reported that Pegasystems planned on raising its number of employees significantly,[5] and the company announced the acquisition of OpenSpan Inc. in April 2016.[25] Based in Atlanta, Georgia, OpenSpan specialized in robotic process automation and workforce analytics software.[26]
Educational programs and conferences[edit]
Pega Academy was founded to "provide online resources, classroom training and certification for systems integrators to help them train up new Pega specialists."[18] In 2016, Pegasystems announced the launch of the Pega University Academic Program (UAP), offering training and certification on the Pega 7 platform for educators and students.[27] In November 2016, Pegasystems Inc signed an agreement with TalentSprint to train 10,000 Pega-certified professionals at Indian engineering colleges. At the time, there were 27,000 professionals trained in Pegasystems technology, with 60 percent in India.[28] The first PegaWorld conference was held in 2006.[2] PegaWorld 2016, the company's annual users' conference, brought in 3,500 attendees.[29]
Products and services[edit]
Pegasystems develops and supports software[5] for customer engagement[1] and operations.[5] In particular, as of 2013 Pega specialized in software for business process management (BPM) and customer relationship management (CRM),[4] and was seen as offering more bespoke technology than competitors such as Oracle Corporation or SAP ERP.[30] As of late 2013, Pega’s core software, PegaRULES Process Commander (PRPC), was related to BPM.[4] The company's current core software offering is its Pega 7 platform, which is accessible via cloud technologies.[5] Pega 7 platform is the company's "core offering in the market that mixes business process management, CRM, data analytics, big data (social and mobile)." The company continuously modifies and updates the platform, investing as well in co-browsing and cloud and social media to integrate.[5] In August 2015, the company "made a strategic decision to make its software easier to use," hiring teams with backgrounds in user experience. By September 2015, the company had introduced Pega Express. Pega Express was designed to allow business specialists to quickly build simple applications.[18]
Fortune wrote in August 2015 that Pegasystems' CRM suite "correlates data from existing marketing, sales, and support systems. Whenever a call arrives, an agent is presented with an omnichannel view of the history so he or she receives a heads-up into what the call might be about. That in itself isn't so new, but the software also uses predictive analytics to suggest solutions proactively. In Sprint’s case, agents are presented with several different scenarios of how to handle a call."[8] In 2015, Pegasystems' CRM suite was listed as one of the top five largest in the CRM market by David Roe of CMSWire, alongside Salesforce.com, SAP CRM, Oracle CRM and Microsoft Dynamics CRM.[31] Gartner mentioned Pega in April 2015,[32] and Forrester Research named Pegasystems a "leader in customer service for enterprise clients" in December 2015.[22]
Pegasystems Inc. in March 2016 announced Pega Client Lifecycle Management (CLM), an application "that streamlines and automates corporate client onboarding" for banks by "[orchestrating] complex CLM processes on a global scale in a single application, reducing onboarding time by 70 percent and reducing costs by 60 percent."[33] In September 2016, Pegasystems released enhancements to its Client Lifecycle Management (CLM) and Know Your Customer (KYC) applications.[34] By that time Pegasystems had applied predictive analytics,[35][36] artificial intelligence,[35] and machine learning[37] to its CRM applications for years,[35] and among other products,[35] it is used in Pegasystems' decision management software.[37]
Clients and notable projects[edit]
Pegasystems specializes in the following industries: financial services,[5][38] insurance,[6] life sciences, healthcare,[5] government,[7] manufacturing,[5] high tech,[3] communications and media,[8] energy,[9] and utilities.[9][8] While core areas have traditionally included banking and financial sectors, more recent areas include manufacturing, life sciences and healthcare.[5] As of 2013, other clients included "largely Fortune 500 companies" such as ING, Lloyds Banking Group, BAA,[4] and the state of Maine, which commissioned Pegasystems to create a BPM system to cut administrative costs.[7] By July 2014, PayPal, Cisco Systems, and Phillips were using Pegasystems’ CRM software,[3] and BNY Mellon announced they would be integrating Pega into its operations as part of their efficiency strategy.[38]
In 2015 Pegasystems disclosed that its clients included "six of the top 10 global communications companies, eight of the top 10 credit-card companies, and eight of the top 10 global banks."[8] Among them were American Express, HSBC, United Health Group,[8][21] JPMorgan Chase,[8] General Motors, Barclays, Pfizer, General Electric,[18] and Cisco Systems.[21][4][3] In 2015, American International Group debuted a customer complaints application from Pegasystems,[39] and also that year Sprint used Pegasystems to focus and rework its customer relations strategy.[8] Between 2010 and 2015, ME Bank worked with Pegasystems on a rebuild of its technology systems utilizing process automation. According to the bank, the time to open a new deposit account decreased from five days to five minutes.[40] On June 9, 2015, it was reported that The Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) had "chosen to implement customer decisioning software" developed by Pegasystems.[41][36]
In 2016 Philips and Pegasystems worked together "to create a new wireless patient remote monitoring system," and by July, Philips had supplied devices to 700,000 patients.[42] Pegasystems began work on a CRM platform for the state of Maine in 2016, building on earlier projects.[7] Other clients include Heineken,[43] the New Jersey Courts,[44]AIG Japan,[39] Hanover Insurance Group, Cigna,[6] MKB Brnadstof,[45] Wüstenrot & Württembergische Gruppe,[46] Trancelerate,[6][47] British Gas,[9] Allianz,[42] and OnStar.[29]

History[edit]
Early history[edit]
Alan Trefler founded Pegasystems in 1983 at the age of 28, in Cambridge, Massachusetts.[3] Prior to founding the company, in the early 1980s Trefler had developed computer systems that could play chess.[1] During the company's early years it focused on providing case management, namely for companies such as American Express.[11][1] Trefler recollects that when he started Pegasystems, he wanted to create software that eased the heavy lifting that business people deal with, as well as software that understood how business-people wanted things to work, commenting "it turns out to be a fairly hard problem to solve."[1] An article in Computerworld traces business rules engine to the early 1990s and to products from the likes of Pegasystems, Fair Isaac Corp and ILOG.[12] As a private company, Pegasystems was "bootstrapped" initially, but did not take on outside investors.[1] The company went public in 1996 with initial and secondary public offerings,[13] and began trading on NASDAQ under the symbol PEGA. Raising several millions in funding in the process, going public freed the company from needing to pursue venture capital investments.[1] Pegasystems entered a period of financial trouble in the late 1990s, following a dispute with its accountants, Ernst & Young.[14] After restating their earnings, Pegasystems faced an investigation by the SEC, which was dropped in 2002.[13]
Acquisitions[edit]
In March 2010, Pegasystems acquired the enterprise software company Chordiant for around $161.5 million. Although it had clients such as Citibank, Capital One, MetLife, Cigna, Wellpoint, T-Mobile, and Vodafone and was described as an "innovator" in "applying predictive analytics to customer interactions," Chordiant had struggled in the 2008 recession.[10] The acquisition gave Pegasystems access to new markets such as telecommunications and healthcare, with Pegasystems integrating Chordiant and its customer relationship management (CRM) technology into its existing operations.[4] Pega Cloud was introduced using Amazon Web Services in 2012,[2] and in October 2013, Pegasystems acquired the mobile application developer Antenna Software[15][4] for $27.7 million. Located in New Jersey, Antenna also had bases in Kraków and Bangalore.[15]
In October 2013, Pegasystems was described as a "provider of business process management (BPM) and [CRM] solutions," and had its global development center in Hyderabad.[15] Revenues for the company grew strongly when compared to the rest of the business process management market from 2005 until 2013, with license revenues rising 34% in 2013.[4] The company reported that profit increases in 2013 were "fueled by demand for an upgrade to its main software product," Pega Platform, which was designed so companies could integrate data and software systems.[16] After it released its recent financial results in November 2013, Pegasystems' stock rose 20%,[17] resulting in an 122 percent value increase over the prior year and a record high for the company.[16]
Recent history[edit]
Pegasystems hired a cloud technology proponent to develop its cloud technology strategy in 2014. Over the following year, Pegasystems invested in network operations in North America and India to support its cloud services.[18] In May 2014, Pegasystems acquired the Bangalore-based MeshLabs, a text mining and analytics software startup. The Times of India reported that Pegasystems would integrate MeshLabs's text analytics software "to gather unstructured social media data and decode it into actionable business insights for its clients." The financial details of the transaction were not disclosed.[19] Pegasystems acquired Firefly[disambiguation needed] in June 2014, a co-browsing tool funded by First Round Capital.[20] The startup from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania was the company's first move into the cobrowsing market.[20] By the summer of 2014, Pegasystems remained headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts with 2,700 employees.[20][19] By July 2014 the company was worth around US$1 billion.[3]
By early 2015, Pegasystems remained a publicly traded company[1] on the Nasdaq,[19] with 3,000 employees, 30 offices, and "more than half a billion dollars in revenue."[1] As of February 2015, the company had active partnerships with IT outsourcing companies such as Tata Consultancy Services, InfosysBSE, WiproBSE, HCL Technologies, Accenture and Cognizant.[21] By September of that year, companies who had built teams of Pegasystems specialists included Accenture, Ernst & Young and Cognizant.[18] Between 2005 and 2015, Pegasystems had average sales growth of 21% per year.[22] There was a steady rise in the company's share price in 2015,[23] with higher than expected revenues from the year prior.[24] In January 2016, it was reported that Pegasystems planned on raising its number of employees significantly,[5] and the company announced the acquisition of OpenSpan Inc. in April 2016.[25] Based in Atlanta, Georgia, OpenSpan specialized in robotic process automation and workforce analytics software.[26]
Educational programs and conferences[edit]
Pega Academy was founded to "provide online resources, classroom training and certification for systems integrators to help them train up new Pega specialists."[18] In 2016, Pegasystems announced the launch of the Pega University Academic Program (UAP), offering training and certification on the Pega 7 platform for educators and students.[27] In November 2016, Pegasystems Inc signed an agreement with TalentSprint to train 10,000 Pega-certified professionals at Indian engineering colleges. At the time, there were 27,000 professionals trained in Pegasystems technology, with 60 percent in India.[28] The first PegaWorld conference was held in 2006.[2] PegaWorld 2016, the company's annual users' conference, brought in 3,500 attendees.[29]
Products and services[edit]
Pegasystems develops and supports software[5] for customer engagement[1] and operations.[5] In particular, as of 2013 Pega specialized in software for business process management (BPM) and customer relationship management (CRM),[4] and was seen as offering more bespoke technology than competitors such as Oracle Corporation or SAP ERP.[30] As of late 2013, Pega’s core software, PegaRULES Process Commander (PRPC), was related to BPM.[4] The company's current core software offering is its Pega 7 platform, which is accessible via cloud technologies.[5] Pega 7 platform is the company's "core offering in the market that mixes business process management, CRM, data analytics, big data (social and mobile)." The company continuously modifies and updates the platform, investing as well in co-browsing and cloud and social media to integrate.[5] In August 2015, the company "made a strategic decision to make its software easier to use," hiring teams with backgrounds in user experience. By September 2015, the company had introduced Pega Express. Pega Express was designed to allow business specialists to quickly build simple applications.[18]
Fortune wrote in August 2015 that Pegasystems' CRM suite "correlates data from existing marketing, sales, and support systems. Whenever a call arrives, an agent is presented with an omnichannel view of the history so he or she receives a heads-up into what the call might be about. That in itself isn't so new, but the software also uses predictive analytics to suggest solutions proactively. In Sprint’s case, agents are presented with several different scenarios of how to handle a call."[8] In 2015, Pegasystems' CRM suite was listed as one of the top five largest in the CRM market by David Roe of CMSWire, alongside Salesforce.com, SAP CRM, Oracle CRM and Microsoft Dynamics CRM.[31] Gartner mentioned Pega in April 2015,[32] and Forrester Research named Pegasystems a "leader in customer service for enterprise clients" in December 2015.[22]
Pegasystems Inc. in March 2016 announced Pega Client Lifecycle Management (CLM), an application "that streamlines and automates corporate client onboarding" for banks by "[orchestrating] complex CLM processes on a global scale in a single application, reducing onboarding time by 70 percent and reducing costs by 60 percent."[33] In September 2016, Pegasystems released enhancements to its Client Lifecycle Management (CLM) and Know Your Customer (KYC) applications.[34] By that time Pegasystems had applied predictive analytics,[35][36] artificial intelligence,[35] and machine learning[37] to its CRM applications for years,[35] and among other products,[35] it is used in Pegasystems' decision management software.[37]
Clients and notable projects[edit]
Pegasystems specializes in the following industries: financial services,[5][38] insurance,[6] life sciences, healthcare,[5] government,[7] manufacturing,[5] high tech,[3] communications and media,[8] energy,[9] and utilities.[9][8] While core areas have traditionally included banking and financial sectors, more recent areas include manufacturing, life sciences and healthcare.[5] As of 2013, other clients included "largely Fortune 500 companies" such as ING, Lloyds Banking Group, BAA,[4] and the state of Maine, which commissioned Pegasystems to create a BPM system to cut administrative costs.[7] By July 2014, PayPal, Cisco Systems, and Phillips were using Pegasystems’ CRM software,[3] and BNY Mellon announced they would be integrating Pega into its operations as part of their efficiency strategy.[38]
In 2015 Pegasystems disclosed that its clients included "six of the top 10 global communications companies, eight of the top 10 credit-card companies, and eight of the top 10 global banks."[8] Among them were American Express, HSBC, United Health Group,[8][21] JPMorgan Chase,[8] General Motors, Barclays, Pfizer, General Electric,[18] and Cisco Systems.[21][4][3] In 2015, American International Group debuted a customer complaints application from Pegasystems,[39] and also that year Sprint used Pegasystems to focus and rework its customer relations strategy.[8] Between 2010 and 2015, ME Bank worked with Pegasystems on a rebuild of its technology systems utilizing process automation. According to the bank, the time to open a new deposit account decreased from five days to five minutes.[40] On June 9, 2015, it was reported that The Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) had "chosen to implement customer decisioning software" developed by Pegasystems.[41][36]
In 2016 Philips and Pegasystems worked together "to create a new wireless patient remote monitoring system," and by July, Philips had supplied devices to 700,000 patients.[42] Pegasystems began work on a CRM platform for the state of Maine in 2016, building on earlier projects.[7] Other clients include Heineken,[43] the New Jersey Courts,[44]AIG Japan,[39] Hanover Insurance Group, Cigna,[6] MKB Brnadstof,[45] Wüstenrot & Württembergische Gruppe,[46] Trancelerate,[6][47] British Gas,[9] Allianz,[42] and OnStar.[29]

Rules engines have been around since the early 1990s when companies such as Pegasystems Inc. in Cambridge, Mass., Fair Isaac Corp. in Minneapolis and ILOG in Mountain View, Calif., sold them. They were typically used in rules-heavy industries such as finance and insurance. Over the past few years, however, many vendors have entered the market, and more companies are looking at rules engines as a way to gain greater flexibility in business operations.

Pegasystems, Inc. Key Developments

Pegasystems and Accenture Team to Offer Communications Service Providers (CSPs) Intelligent Customer Decisioning as a Service to Improve Customer Engagement
Jul 19 17
Pegasystems Inc. and Accenture launched Intelligent Customer Decisioning as a Service, a cloud-based solution designed to advance marketing strategies for telecommunications providers. With Intelligent Customer Decisioning as a Service, Communications Service Providers (CSPs) gain a fully operational business team from Accenture to run effective real-time marketing campaigns on Pega’s AI-driven decisioning marketing solutions. As CSPs fight for every customer, many lack the resources to implement advanced one-to-one marketing capabilities to attract new customers while reducing churn. Intelligent Customer Decisioning as a Service helps CSPs improve subscriber retention, acquisition rates, and sales practices by combining Pega® Marketing for Communications and Pega® Customer Decision Hub with Accenture’s consulting, managed services, and deep industry expertise across technology, digital, and marketing. Leveraging Pega technology that optimizes customer engagement, Accenture’s teams execute AI-driven marketing strategies for clients to achieve performance goals, without disrupting day-to-day operations or requiring additional resources.

Pegasystems Inc. announced a third quarterly cash dividend of $0.03 per share, maintaining the company’s current dividend program. The third quarter 2017 dividend will be paid on July 17, 2017 to shareholders of record as of July 3, 2017.


Pegasystems Enables Deployment of Pega Solutions on Microsoft Azure
Jun 6 17
Pegasystems Inc. has announced that organizations can run and deploy Pega solutions on Microsoft Azure. This provides Pega clients additional choice, flexibility, and support to configure their cloud environment to best suit their needs and builds on recently announced partnerships with Pivotal and Amazon Web Services (AWS) that further extend Pega's cloud choice initiative and eliminate vendor lock-in common with other software providers. Pega's flexible approach provides clients with multiple supported cloud options, including Pega Cloud - Pega's fully managed cloud platform optimized for Pega software. Clients can now run Pega software on Azure as a fully supported cloud platform. This provides Pega clients better integration with Azure and full access to Pega's 24/7 global customer support. Many software vendors offer clients no cloud option except their own, which locks them in with no flexibility to switch as their needs change. While Pega solutions have always been cloud agnostic, these integrations help clients protect and leverage their investments with enhanced integration and support to ensure their software runs optimally on their cloud of choice.  Pega clients can run Pega software on their cloud of choice and move seamlessly between cloud infrastructures as their business needs and drivers change. Pega also continues to support configurations in public, private, and hybrid cloud environments. Microsoft Azure is an open, flexible, enterprise-grade cloud computing platform. Its cloud services enable users to build, deploy, and manage applications anywhere, using the tools, applications, and frameworks of their choice.

History[edit]
Early history[edit]
Alan Trefler founded Pegasystems in 1983 at the age of 28, in Cambridge, Massachusetts.[3] Prior to founding the company, in the early 1980s Trefler had developed computer systems that could play chess.[1] During the company's early years it focused on providing case management, namely for companies such as American Express.[11][1] Trefler recollects that when he started Pegasystems, he wanted to create software that eased the heavy lifting that business people deal with, as well as software that understood how business-people wanted things to work, commenting "it turns out to be a fairly hard problem to solve."[1] An article in Computerworld traces business rules engine to the early 1990s and to products from the likes of Pegasystems, Fair Isaac Corp and ILOG.[12] As a private company, Pegasystems was "bootstrapped" initially, but did not take on outside investors.[1] The company went public in 1996 with initial and secondary public offerings,[13] and began trading on NASDAQ under the symbol PEGA. Raising several millions in funding in the process, going public freed the company from needing to pursue venture capital investments.[1] Pegasystems entered a period of financial trouble in the late 1990s, following a dispute with its accountants, Ernst & Young.[14] After restating their earnings, Pegasystems faced an investigation by the SEC, which was dropped in 2002.[13]
Acquisitions[edit]
In March 2010, Pegasystems acquired the enterprise software company Chordiant for around $161.5 million. Although it had clients such as Citibank, Capital One, MetLife, Cigna, Wellpoint, T-Mobile, and Vodafone and was described as an "innovator" in "applying predictive analytics to customer interactions," Chordiant had struggled in the 2008 recession.[10] The acquisition gave Pegasystems access to new markets such as telecommunications and healthcare, with Pegasystems integrating Chordiant and its customer relationship management (CRM) technology into its existing operations.[4] Pega Cloud was introduced using Amazon Web Services in 2012,[2] and in October 2013, Pegasystems acquired the mobile application developer Antenna Software[15][4] for $27.7 million. Located in New Jersey, Antenna also had bases in Kraków and Bangalore.[15]
In October 2013, Pegasystems was described as a "provider of business process management (BPM) and [CRM] solutions," and had its global development center in Hyderabad.[15] Revenues for the company grew strongly when compared to the rest of the business process management market from 2005 until 2013, with license revenues rising 34% in 2013.[4] The company reported that profit increases in 2013 were "fueled by demand for an upgrade to its main software product," Pega Platform, which was designed so companies could integrate data and software systems.[16] After it released its recent financial results in November 2013, Pegasystems' stock rose 20%,[17] resulting in an 122 percent value increase over the prior year and a record high for the company.[16]
Recent history[edit]
Pegasystems hired a cloud technology proponent to develop its cloud technology strategy in 2014. Over the following year, Pegasystems invested in network operations in North America and India to support its cloud services.[18] In May 2014, Pegasystems acquired the Bangalore-based MeshLabs, a text mining and analytics software startup. The Times of India reported that Pegasystems would integrate MeshLabs's text analytics software "to gather unstructured social media data and decode it into actionable business insights for its clients." The financial details of the transaction were not disclosed.[19] Pegasystems acquired Firefly[disambiguation needed] in June 2014, a co-browsing tool funded by First Round Capital.[20] The startup from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania was the company's first move into the cobrowsing market.[20] By the summer of 2014, Pegasystems remained headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts with 2,700 employees.[20][19] By July 2014 the company was worth around US$1 billion.[3]
By early 2015, Pegasystems remained a publicly traded company[1] on the Nasdaq,[19] with 3,000 employees, 30 offices, and "more than half a billion dollars in revenue."[1] As of February 2015, the company had active partnerships with IT outsourcing companies such as Tata Consultancy Services, InfosysBSE, WiproBSE, HCL Technologies, Accenture and Cognizant.[21] By September of that year, companies who had built teams of Pegasystems specialists included Accenture, Ernst & Young and Cognizant.[18] Between 2005 and 2015, Pegasystems had average sales growth of 21% per year.[22] There was a steady rise in the company's share price in 2015,[23] with higher than expected revenues from the year prior.[24] In January 2016, it was reported that Pegasystems planned on raising its number of employees significantly,[5] and the company announced the acquisition of OpenSpan Inc. in April 2016.[25] Based in Atlanta, Georgia, OpenSpan specialized in robotic process automation and workforce analytics software.[26]
Educational programs and conferences[edit]
Pega Academy was founded to "provide online resources, classroom training and certification for systems integrators to help them train up new Pega specialists."[18] In 2016, Pegasystems announced the launch of the Pega University Academic Program (UAP), offering training and certification on the Pega 7 platform for educators and students.[27] In November 2016, Pegasystems Inc signed an agreement with TalentSprint to train 10,000 Pega-certified professionals at Indian engineering colleges. At the time, there were 27,000 professionals trained in Pegasystems technology, with 60 percent in India.[28] The first PegaWorld conference was held in 2006.[2] PegaWorld 2016, the company's annual users' conference, brought in 3,500 attendees.[29]
Products and services[edit]
Pegasystems develops and supports software[5] for customer engagement[1] and operations.[5] In particular, as of 2013 Pega specialized in software for business process management (BPM) and customer relationship management (CRM),[4] and was seen as offering more bespoke technology than competitors such as Oracle Corporation or SAP ERP.[30] As of late 2013, Pega’s core software, PegaRULES Process Commander (PRPC), was related to BPM.[4] The company's current core software offering is its Pega 7 platform, which is accessible via cloud technologies.[5] Pega 7 platform is the company's "core offering in the market that mixes business process management, CRM, data analytics, big data (social and mobile)." The company continuously modifies and updates the platform, investing as well in co-browsing and cloud and social media to integrate.[5] In August 2015, the company "made a strategic decision to make its software easier to use," hiring teams with backgrounds in user experience. By September 2015, the company had introduced Pega Express. Pega Express was designed to allow business specialists to quickly build simple applications.[18]
Fortune wrote in August 2015 that Pegasystems' CRM suite "correlates data from existing marketing, sales, and support systems. Whenever a call arrives, an agent is presented with an omnichannel view of the history so he or she receives a heads-up into what the call might be about. That in itself isn't so new, but the software also uses predictive analytics to suggest solutions proactively. In Sprint’s case, agents are presented with several different scenarios of how to handle a call."[8] In 2015, Pegasystems' CRM suite was listed as one of the top five largest in the CRM market by David Roe of CMSWire, alongside Salesforce.com, SAP CRM, Oracle CRM and Microsoft Dynamics CRM.[31] Gartner mentioned Pega in April 2015,[32] and Forrester Research named Pegasystems a "leader in customer service for enterprise clients" in December 2015.[22]
Pegasystems Inc. in March 2016 announced Pega Client Lifecycle Management (CLM), an application "that streamlines and automates corporate client onboarding" for banks by "[orchestrating] complex CLM processes on a global scale in a single application, reducing onboarding time by 70 percent and reducing costs by 60 percent."[33] In September 2016, Pegasystems released enhancements to its Client Lifecycle Management (CLM) and Know Your Customer (KYC) applications.[34] By that time Pegasystems had applied predictive analytics,[35][36] artificial intelligence,[35] and machine learning[37] to its CRM applications for years,[35] and among other products,[35] it is used in Pegasystems' decision management software.[37]
Clients and notable projects[edit]
Pegasystems specializes in the following industries: financial services,[5][38] insurance,[6] life sciences, healthcare,[5] government,[7] manufacturing,[5] high tech,[3] communications and media,[8] energy,[9] and utilities.[9][8] While core areas have traditionally included banking and financial sectors, more recent areas include manufacturing, life sciences and healthcare.[5] As of 2013, other clients included "largely Fortune 500 companies" such as ING, Lloyds Banking Group, BAA,[4] and the state of Maine, which commissioned Pegasystems to create a BPM system to cut administrative costs.[7] By July 2014, PayPal, Cisco Systems, and Phillips were using Pegasystems’ CRM software,[3] and BNY Mellon announced they would be integrating Pega into its operations as part of their efficiency strategy.[38]
In 2015 Pegasystems disclosed that its clients included "six of the top 10 global communications companies, eight of the top 10 credit-card companies, and eight of the top 10 global banks."[8] Among them were American Express, HSBC, United Health Group,[8][21] JPMorgan Chase,[8] General Motors, Barclays, Pfizer, General Electric,[18] and Cisco Systems.[21][4][3] In 2015, American International Group debuted a customer complaints application from Pegasystems,[39] and also that year Sprint used Pegasystems to focus and rework its customer relations strategy.[8] Between 2010 and 2015, ME Bank worked with Pegasystems on a rebuild of its technology systems utilizing process automation. According to the bank, the time to open a new deposit account decreased from five days to five minutes.[40] On June 9, 2015, it was reported that The Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) had "chosen to implement customer decisioning software" developed by Pegasystems.[41][36]
In 2016 Philips and Pegasystems worked together "to create a new wireless patient remote monitoring system," and by July, Philips had supplied devices to 700,000 patients.[42] Pegasystems began work on a CRM platform for the state of Maine in 2016, building on earlier projects.[7] Other clients include Heineken,[43] the New Jersey Courts,[44]AIG Japan,[39] Hanover Insurance Group, Cigna,[6] MKB Brnadstof,[45] Wüstenrot & Württembergische Gruppe,[46] Trancelerate,[6][47] British Gas,[9] Allianz,[42] and OnStar.[29]

Rules engines have been around since the early 1990s when companies such as Pegasystems Inc. in Cambridge, Mass., Fair Isaac Corp. in Minneapolis and ILOG in Mountain View, Calif., sold them. They were typically used in rules-heavy industries such as finance and insurance. Over the past few years, however, many vendors have entered the market, and more companies are looking at rules engines as a way to gain greater flexibility in business operations.

History[edit]
Early history[edit]
Alan Trefler founded Pegasystems in 1983 at the age of 28, in Cambridge, Massachusetts.[3] Prior to founding the company, in the early 1980s Trefler had developed computer systems that could play chess.[1] During the company's early years it focused on providing case management, namely for companies such as American Express.[11][1] Trefler recollects that when he started Pegasystems, he wanted to create software that eased the heavy lifting that business people deal with, as well as software that understood how business-people wanted things to work, commenting "it turns out to be a fairly hard problem to solve."[1] An article in Computerworld traces business rules engine to the early 1990s and to products from the likes of Pegasystems, Fair Isaac Corp and ILOG.[12] As a private company, Pegasystems was "bootstrapped" initially, but did not take on outside investors.[1] The company went public in 1996 with initial and secondary public offerings,[13] and began trading on NASDAQ under the symbol PEGA. Raising several millions in funding in the process, going public freed the company from needing to pursue venture capital investments.[1] Pegasystems entered a period of financial trouble in the late 1990s, following a dispute with its accountants, Ernst & Young.[14] After restating their earnings, Pegasystems faced an investigation by the SEC, which was dropped in 2002.[13]
Acquisitions[edit]
In March 2010, Pegasystems acquired the enterprise software company Chordiant for around $161.5 million. Although it had clients such as Citibank, Capital One, MetLife, Cigna, Wellpoint, T-Mobile, and Vodafone and was described as an "innovator" in "applying predictive analytics to customer interactions," Chordiant had struggled in the 2008 recession.[10] The acquisition gave Pegasystems access to new markets such as telecommunications and healthcare, with Pegasystems integrating Chordiant and its customer relationship management (CRM) technology into its existing operations.[4] Pega Cloud was introduced using Amazon Web Services in 2012,[2] and in October 2013, Pegasystems acquired the mobile application developer Antenna Software[15][4] for $27.7 million. Located in New Jersey, Antenna also had bases in Kraków and Bangalore.[15]
In October 2013, Pegasystems was described as a "provider of business process management (BPM) and [CRM] solutions," and had its global development center in Hyderabad.[15] Revenues for the company grew strongly when compared to the rest of the business process management market from 2005 until 2013, with license revenues rising 34% in 2013.[4] The company reported that profit increases in 2013 were "fueled by demand for an upgrade to its main software product," Pega Platform, which was designed so companies could integrate data and software systems.[16] After it released its recent financial results in November 2013, Pegasystems' stock rose 20%,[17] resulting in an 122 percent value increase over the prior year and a record high for the company.[16]
Recent history[edit]
Pegasystems hired a cloud technology proponent to develop its cloud technology strategy in 2014. Over the following year, Pegasystems invested in network operations in North America and India to support its cloud services.[18] In May 2014, Pegasystems acquired the Bangalore-based MeshLabs, a text mining and analytics software startup. The Times of India reported that Pegasystems would integrate MeshLabs's text analytics software "to gather unstructured social media data and decode it into actionable business insights for its clients." The financial details of the transaction were not disclosed.[19] Pegasystems acquired Firefly[disambiguation needed] in June 2014, a co-browsing tool funded by First Round Capital.[20] The startup from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania was the company's first move into the cobrowsing market.[20] By the summer of 2014, Pegasystems remained headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts with 2,700 employees.[20][19] By July 2014 the company was worth around US$1 billion.[3]
By early 2015, Pegasystems remained a publicly traded company[1] on the Nasdaq,[19] with 3,000 employees, 30 offices, and "more than half a billion dollars in revenue."[1] As of February 2015, the company had active partnerships with IT outsourcing companies such as Tata Consultancy Services, InfosysBSE, WiproBSE, HCL Technologies, Accenture and Cognizant.[21] By September of that year, companies who had built teams of Pegasystems specialists included Accenture, Ernst & Young and Cognizant.[18] Between 2005 and 2015, Pegasystems had average sales growth of 21% per year.[22] There was a steady rise in the company's share price in 2015,[23] with higher than expected revenues from the year prior.[24] In January 2016, it was reported that Pegasystems planned on raising its number of employees significantly,[5] and the company announced the acquisition of OpenSpan Inc. in April 2016.[25] Based in Atlanta, Georgia, OpenSpan specialized in robotic process automation and workforce analytics software.[26]
Educational programs and conferences[edit]
Pega Academy was founded to "provide online resources, classroom training and certification for systems integrators to help them train up new Pega specialists."[18] In 2016, Pegasystems announced the launch of the Pega University Academic Program (UAP), offering training and certification on the Pega 7 platform for educators and students.[27] In November 2016, Pegasystems Inc signed an agreement with TalentSprint to train 10,000 Pega-certified professionals at Indian engineering colleges. At the time, there were 27,000 professionals trained in Pegasystems technology, with 60 percent in India.[28] The first PegaWorld conference was held in 2006.[2] PegaWorld 2016, the company's annual users' conference, brought in 3,500 attendees.[29]
Products and services[edit]
Pegasystems develops and supports software[5] for customer engagement[1] and operations.[5] In particular, as of 2013 Pega specialized in software for business process management (BPM) and customer relationship management (CRM),[4] and was seen as offering more bespoke technology than competitors such as Oracle Corporation or SAP ERP.[30] As of late 2013, Pega’s core software, PegaRULES Process Commander (PRPC), was related to BPM.[4] The company's current core software offering is its Pega 7 platform, which is accessible via cloud technologies.[5] Pega 7 platform is the company's "core offering in the market that mixes business process management, CRM, data analytics, big data (social and mobile)." The company continuously modifies and updates the platform, investing as well in co-browsing and cloud and social media to integrate.[5] In August 2015, the company "made a strategic decision to make its software easier to use," hiring teams with backgrounds in user experience. By September 2015, the company had introduced Pega Express. Pega Express was designed to allow business specialists to quickly build simple applications.[18]
Fortune wrote in August 2015 that Pegasystems' CRM suite "correlates data from existing marketing, sales, and support systems. Whenever a call arrives, an agent is presented with an omnichannel view of the history so he or she receives a heads-up into what the call might be about. That in itself isn't so new, but the software also uses predictive analytics to suggest solutions proactively. In Sprint’s case, agents are presented with several different scenarios of how to handle a call."[8] In 2015, Pegasystems' CRM suite was listed as one of the top five largest in the CRM market by David Roe of CMSWire, alongside Salesforce.com, SAP CRM, Oracle CRM and Microsoft Dynamics CRM.[31] Gartner mentioned Pega in April 2015,[32] and Forrester Research named Pegasystems a "leader in customer service for enterprise clients" in December 2015.[22]
Pegasystems Inc. in March 2016 announced Pega Client Lifecycle Management (CLM), an application "that streamlines and automates corporate client onboarding" for banks by "[orchestrating] complex CLM processes on a global scale in a single application, reducing onboarding time by 70 percent and reducing costs by 60 percent."[33] In September 2016, Pegasystems released enhancements to its Client Lifecycle Management (CLM) and Know Your Customer (KYC) applications.[34] By that time Pegasystems had applied predictive analytics,[35][36] artificial intelligence,[35] and machine learning[37] to its CRM applications for years,[35] and among other products,[35] it is used in Pegasystems' decision management software.[37]
Clients and notable projects[edit]
Pegasystems specializes in the following industries: financial services,[5][38] insurance,[6] life sciences, healthcare,[5] government,[7] manufacturing,[5] high tech,[3] communications and media,[8] energy,[9] and utilities.[9][8] While core areas have traditionally included banking and financial sectors, more recent areas include manufacturing, life sciences and healthcare.[5] As of 2013, other clients included "largely Fortune 500 companies" such as ING, Lloyds Banking Group, BAA,[4] and the state of Maine, which commissioned Pegasystems to create a BPM system to cut administrative costs.[7] By July 2014, PayPal, Cisco Systems, and Phillips were using Pegasystems’ CRM software,[3] and BNY Mellon announced they would be integrating Pega into its operations as part of their efficiency strategy.[38]

Rules engines have been around since the early 1990s when companies such as Pegasystems Inc. in Cambridge, Mass., Fair Isaac Corp. in Minneapolis and ILOG in Mountain View, Calif., sold them. They were typically used in rules-heavy industries such as finance and insurance. Over the past few years, however, many vendors have entered the market, and more companies are looking at rules engines as a way to gain greater flexibility in business operations.

History[edit]
Early history[edit]
Alan Trefler founded Pegasystems in 1983 at the age of 28, in Cambridge, Massachusetts.[3] Prior to founding the company, in the early 1980s Trefler had developed computer systems that could play chess.[1] During the company's early years it focused on providing case management, namely for companies such as American Express.[11][1] Trefler recollects that when he started Pegasystems, he wanted to create software that eased the heavy lifting that business people deal with, as well as software that understood how business-people wanted things to work, commenting "it turns out to be a fairly hard problem to solve."[1] An article in Computerworld traces business rules engine to the early 1990s and to products from the likes of Pegasystems, Fair Isaac Corp and ILOG.[12] As a private company, Pegasystems was "bootstrapped" initially, but did not take on outside investors.[1] The company went public in 1996 with initial and secondary public offerings,[13] and began trading on NASDAQ under the symbol PEGA. Raising several millions in funding in the process, going public freed the company from needing to pursue venture capital investments.[1] Pegasystems entered a period of financial trouble in the late 1990s, following a dispute with its accountants, Ernst & Young.[14] After restating their earnings, Pegasystems faced an investigation by the SEC, which was dropped in 2002.[13]
Acquisitions[edit]
In March 2010, Pegasystems acquired the enterprise software company Chordiant for around $161.5 million. Although it had clients such as Citibank, Capital One, MetLife, Cigna, Wellpoint, T-Mobile, and Vodafone and was described as an "innovator" in "applying predictive analytics to customer interactions," Chordiant had struggled in the 2008 recession.[10] The acquisition gave Pegasystems access to new markets such as telecommunications and healthcare, with Pegasystems integrating Chordiant and its customer relationship management (CRM) technology into its existing operations.[4] Pega Cloud was introduced using Amazon Web Services in 2012,[2] and in October 2013, Pegasystems acquired the mobile application developer Antenna Software[15][4] for $27.7 million. Located in New Jersey, Antenna also had bases in Kraków and Bangalore.[15]
In October 2013, Pegasystems was described as a "provider of business process management (BPM) and [CRM] solutions," and had its global development center in Hyderabad.[15] Revenues for the company grew strongly when compared to the rest of the business process management market from 2005 until 2013, with license revenues rising 34% in 2013.[4] The company reported that profit increases in 2013 were "fueled by demand for an upgrade to its main software product," Pega Platform, which was designed so companies could integrate data and software systems.[16] After it released its recent financial results in November 2013, Pegasystems' stock rose 20%,[17] resulting in an 122 percent value increase over the prior year and a record high for the company.[16]
Recent history[edit]
Pegasystems hired a cloud technology proponent to develop its cloud technology strategy in 2014. Over the following year, Pegasystems invested in network operations in North America and India to support its cloud services.[18] In May 2014, Pegasystems acquired the Bangalore-based MeshLabs, a text mining and analytics software startup. The Times of India reported that Pegasystems would integrate MeshLabs's text analytics software "to gather unstructured social media data and decode it into actionable business insights for its clients." The financial details of the transaction were not disclosed.[19] Pegasystems acquired Firefly[disambiguation needed] in June 2014, a co-browsing tool funded by First Round Capital.[20] The startup from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania was the company's first move into the cobrowsing market.[20] By the summer of 2014, Pegasystems remained headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts with 2,700 employees.[20][19] By July 2014 the company was worth around US$1 billion.[3]
By early 2015, Pegasystems remained a publicly traded company[1] on the Nasdaq,[19] with 3,000 employees, 30 offices, and "more than half a billion dollars in revenue."[1] As of February 2015, the company had active partnerships with IT outsourcing companies such as Tata Consultancy Services, InfosysBSE, WiproBSE, HCL Technologies, Accenture and Cognizant.[21] By September of that year, companies who had built teams of Pegasystems specialists included Accenture, Ernst & Young and Cognizant.[18] Between 2005 and 2015, Pegasystems had average sales growth of 21% per year.[22] There was a steady rise in the company's share price in 2015,[23] with higher than expected revenues from the year prior.[24] In January 2016, it was reported that Pegasystems planned on raising its number of employees significantly,[5] and the company announced the acquisition of OpenSpan Inc. in April 2016.[25] Based in Atlanta, Georgia, OpenSpan specialized in robotic process automation and workforce analytics software.[26]
Educational programs and conferences[edit]
Pega Academy was founded to "provide online resources, classroom training and certification for systems integrators to help them train up new Pega specialists."[18] In 2016, Pegasystems announced the launch of the Pega University Academic Program (UAP), offering training and certification on the Pega 7 platform for educators and students.[27] In November 2016, Pegasystems Inc signed an agreement with TalentSprint to train 10,000 Pega-certified professionals at Indian engineering colleges. At the time, there were 27,000 professionals trained in Pegasystems technology, with 60 percent in India.[28] The first PegaWorld conference was held in 2006.[2] PegaWorld 2016, the company's annual users' conference, brought in 3,500 attendees.[29]
Products and services[edit]
Pegasystems develops and supports software[5] for customer engagement[1] and operations.[5] In particular, as of 2013 Pega specialized in software for business process management (BPM) and customer relationship management (CRM),[4] and was seen as offering more bespoke technology than competitors such as Oracle Corporation or SAP ERP.[30] As of late 2013, Pega’s core software, PegaRULES Process Commander (PRPC), was related to BPM.[4] The company's current core software offering is its Pega 7 platform, which is accessible via cloud technologies.[5] Pega 7 platform is the company's "core offering in the market that mixes business process management, CRM, data analytics, big data (social and mobile)." The company continuously modifies and updates the platform, investing as well in co-browsing and cloud and social media to integrate.[5] In August 2015, the company "made a strategic decision to make its software easier to use," hiring teams with backgrounds in user experience. By September 2015, the company had introduced Pega Express. Pega Express was designed to allow business specialists to quickly build simple applications.[18]
Fortune wrote in August 2015 that Pegasystems' CRM suite "correlates data from existing marketing, sales, and support systems. Whenever a call arrives, an agent is presented with an omnichannel view of the history so he or she receives a heads-up into what the call might be about. That in itself isn't so new, but the software also uses predictive analytics to suggest solutions proactively. In Sprint’s case, agents are presented with several different scenarios of how to handle a call."[8] In 2015, Pegasystems' CRM suite was listed as one of the top five largest in the CRM market by David Roe of CMSWire, alongside Salesforce.com, SAP CRM, Oracle CRM and Microsoft Dynamics CRM.[31] Gartner mentioned Pega in April 2015,[32] and Forrester Research named Pegasystems a "leader in customer service for enterprise clients" in December 2015.[22]
Pegasystems Inc. in March 2016 announced Pega Client Lifecycle Management (CLM), an application "that streamlines and automates corporate client onboarding" for banks by "[orchestrating] complex CLM processes on a global scale in a single application, reducing onboarding time by 70 percent and reducing costs by 60 percent."[33] In September 2016, Pegasystems released enhancements to its Client Lifecycle Management (CLM) and Know Your Customer (KYC) applications.[34] By that time Pegasystems had applied predictive analytics,[35][36] artificial intelligence,[35] and machine learning[37] to its CRM applications for years,[35] and among other products,[35] it is used in Pegasystems' decision management software.[37]
Clients and notable projects[edit]
Pegasystems specializes in the following industries: financial services,[5][38] insurance,[6] life sciences, healthcare,[5] government,[7] manufacturing,[5] high tech,[3] communications and media,[8] energy,[9] and utilities.[9][8] While core areas have traditionally included banking and financial sectors, more recent areas include manufacturing, life sciences and healthcare.[5] As of 2013, other clients included "largely Fortune 500 companies" such as ING, Lloyds Banking Group, BAA,[4] and the state of Maine, which commissioned Pegasystems to create a BPM system to cut administrative costs.[7] By July 2014, PayPal, Cisco Systems, and Phillips were using Pegasystems’ CRM software,[3] and BNY Mellon announced they would be integrating Pega into its operations as part of their efficiency strategy.[38]
In 2015 Pegasystems disclosed that its clients included "six of the top 10 global communications companies, eight of the top 10 credit-card companies, and eight of the top 10 global banks."[8] Among them were American Express, HSBC, United Health Group,[8][21] JPMorgan Chase,[8] General Motors, Barclays, Pfizer, General Electric,[18] and Cisco Systems.[21][4][3] In 2015, American International Group debuted a customer complaints application from Pegasystems,[39] and also that year Sprint used Pegasystems to focus and rework its customer relations strategy.[8] Between 2010 and 2015, ME Bank worked with Pegasystems on a rebuild of its technology systems utilizing process automation. According to the bank, the time to open a new deposit account decreased from five days to five minutes.[40] On June 9, 2015, it was reported that The Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) had "chosen to implement customer decisioning software" developed by Pegasystems.[41][36]
In 2016 Philips and Pegasystems worked together "to create a new wireless patient remote monitoring system," and by July, Philips had supplied devices to 700,000 patients.[42] Pegasystems began work on a CRM platform for the state of Maine in 2016, building on earlier projects.[7] Other clients include Heineken,[43] the New Jersey Courts,[44]AIG Japan,[39] Hanover Insurance Group, Cigna,[6] MKB Brnadstof,[45] Wüstenrot & Württembergische Gruppe,[46] Trancelerate,[6][47] British Gas,[9] Allianz,[42] and OnStar.[29]

Rules engines have been around since the early 1990s when companies such as Pegasystems Inc. in Cambridge, Mass., Fair Isaac Corp. in Minneapolis and ILOG in Mountain View, Calif., sold them. They were typically used in rules-heavy industries such as finance and insurance. Over the past few years, however, many vendors have entered the market, and more companies are looking at rules engines as a way to gain greater flexibility in business operations.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
