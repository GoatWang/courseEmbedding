An Alternative Path to Current Income

NorthStar Income is a public, non-traded real estate investment trust (REIT) that originates, invests in and manages a diversified portfolio of commercial real estate debt, commercial real estate securities and select equity investments. We believe the scarcity of available capital is creating significant investment opportunities – those that offer attractive yields relative to their risk.

Warren Buffett."Never invest in a business you don't understand". Warren Buffett.“In the business world, the rear-view mirror is always clearer than the windshield”. Warren Buffett.Warren Buffett famously said, "Never invest in a business you don't understand." That's one reason that I have never hit the BUY button for Northstar Realty Finance (NRF). I'm sure that the New York-based REIT is a sound business, but the complex structure seems to provide less transparency, often distorting the true value of the company.
I'll admit I'm not an expert when it comes to understanding NRF, especially the various components of the REIT - from SPEs, VIEs, PEs, CDOs, CMOs, and CMBS (I provide explanations for these terms in my newsletter) - it gets downright perplexing.
However, I am intrigued with NRF and its diversified commercial real estate portfolio with 82% of total assets invested in real estate (and 74% is invested in direct real estate investments). In 2015, the company generated 70% of total revenue from real estate and substantially all assets are invested in and revenues are generated from real estate (excluding the European Portfolio).
Another famous line from Warren Buffett,
One of the things we try very hard to do at Berkshire, is to stay within what I call our circle of competence.
NRF is a seemingly complicated platform that invests in multiple asset classes across commercial real estate (or CRE). The following table presents NRF's investments as of December 31, 2014, adjusted acquisitions and commitments to purchase real estate through February 24, 2015:

On February 26, 2015, NRF announced that its board had approved a plan to spin-off the European real estate business into a newly formed publicly traded REIT, Northstar Realty Europe Corp. (NRE) expected to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange and potentially in Europe. European Spin (NRE) is expected to be completed in the second half of 2015.

As part of NRF's real estate strategy, the REIT explores a variety of real estate investments, both directly and through joint ventures, in order to purchase real estate bolstered by attractive returns.
I consider NRF somewhat of an "incubator" of sorts in which the company provides capital for a diverse platform utilizing equity and non-recourse (non mark-to-market financing available through commercial mortgage-backed securities), CMBS, and agency financing markets.
As I examine NRF as a potential investment, I ask myself whether I would want to own an "incubator" or a REIT that invests in a "circle of competence." It's true that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B) is merely a collection of differentiated businesses that all enjoy "circle of competence" attributes (but each of his businesses also have dedicated management).
So why wouldn't NRF qualify as a similar Berkshire conglomerate that owns a variety of real estate sectors - each demonstrating a uniquely positioned value thesis?
External Management Doesn't Excite Me
NRF is externally managed and the company has engaged Northstar Asset Management Group Inc. (NSAM) to provide asset management and other services pursuant to a long-term management agreement and other ancillary agreements. Last year, NSAM spun-off from NRF.
The ability for NRF to achieve investment objectives and to make distributions to stockholders will depend in substantial part upon the performance of NSAM and its ability to provide asset management and other services.
NRF pays NSAM an annual base management fee regardless of the performance of the portfolio. Consequently, NRF is required to pay NSAM significant base management fees in a particular quarter despite experiencing a net loss or a decline in the value of its portfolio during that quarter.
Also NSAM has the ability to earn incentive fees each quarter based on NRF's cash available for distribution (or CAD) which may create an incentive for NSAM to invest in assets with higher yield potential, which are generally riskier or more speculative, or sell an asset prematurely for a gain and pay down borrowings, in an effort to increase its short-term net income and thereby increase the incentive fees to which it is entitled.

The compensation payable to NSAM will increase as a result of future issuances of equity securities, even if the issuances are dilutive to existing stockholders. NRF's base management fee to NSAM is equal to 1.5% per annum of the sum of (source 10-K):
• cumulative net proceeds of all future common equity and preferred equity issued by us;
• equity issued by us in exchange or conversion of exchangeable senior notes based on the stock price at the date of issuance;
• any other issuances by us of common equity, preferred equity or other forms of equity, including but not limited to limited partnership interests in an operating partnership (excluding equity-based compensation, but including issuances related to an acquisition, investment, joint venture or partnership); and
• our cumulative CAD in excess of cumulative distributions paid on our common stock, LTIP units or other equity awards beginning the first full calendar quarter after the spin-off.

Overview of Northstar's Real Estate
NRF's portfolio is primarily comprised of healthcare, hotel, manufactured housing communities, net lease, multifamily properties and international real estate, with a current focus on Europe. As of December 31, 2014, approximately 42% of NRF's real estate investments are concentrated in medical office buildings MOBs) and other healthcare-related facilities.
Following the completion of the acquisition of the Griffin-American Portfolio, NRF significantly increased its ownership of healthcare real estate properties in the portfolio.
NRF's Healthcare portfolio is being run by James F. Flaherty III who was previously the CEO of HCP, Inc. (NYSE:HCP). It's worth noting that if Flaherty were at HCP today he would be dealing with the difficulties associated with the HCR ManorCare exposure. It was Flaherty who negotiated the HCR deal and now current CEO, Lauralee Martin, is having to manage the risks (created by Flaherty). Here's a snapshot of the NRF Healthcare portfolio:


NRF's Healthcare portfolio should generate around $430 million in NOI in 2015. It's important to note that NRF outsources all of its asset management functions. That's a key differentiator when you consider the fact that peers like Healthcare Trust of America (NYSE:HTA) are almost 100% internalized (in its management services). In other words, I view NRF as an "asset aggregator" and not much of a "risk manager." Ask yourself what you are actually getting when you invest in NRF.

NRF's second largest exposure is in the Lodging sector. Recently, the company entered into an agreement to acquire a $170 million hotel portfolio consisting of nine upscale extended stay and premium branded select service hotels containing over 1,000 rooms located in New England markets, in New Hampshire and Massachusetts. These new investments should produce positive earnings in the months ahead from the seasonality in NRF's $3 billion hotel portfolio.

NRF currently relies upon Island to manage most of the hotels. For this reason, NRF is unable to directly implement strategic business decisions with respect to the daily operation and marketing of the hotels, such as decisions with respect to the setting of room rates, repositioning of a hotel, food and beverage pricing and certain similar matters.


As a result, NRF has limited recourse under its management agreements and the cash flow from the hotels may be affected adversely if managers fail to provide quality services and amenities or if they or their affiliates fail to maintain a quality brand name. Also, because NRF's management agreements are long-term agreements, they may not be able to terminate these agreements if the manager is not performing adequately.
NRF's manufactured housing business consists of 29,036 pad rental sites in 123 communities. In 2015, NRF is expected to generate around $114 million of NOI from manufactured housing. Around 89% of NOI is generated from pad rental sites.

NRF's fourth largest asset sector is triple net lease industrial, office and retail that should generate a combined $63 million in NOI in 2015. It would be interesting to see if NRF looks to acquire any assets from American Realty Capital Properties (ARCP). Also, I would not be surprised to see NRF make a run to acquire Cole Capital from ARCP. That would provide NRF with a gateway to the Net Lease sector very quickly.

Rounding out the asset-level business, NRF owns 4,500 multi-family units that should generate around $26 million of NOI in 2015.


Northstar's European Spin
As of the end of the first quarter, approximately 84% of NRF's $19.3 billion of total assets are directly or indirectly owned real estate (or 82% if you exclude the European assets that will be spinning off in the European focused REIT.
As illustrated below, NRF has an extremely robust pipeline of attractive European real estate investment opportunities and NRE will be very well positioned for future growth. The spin-off of Northstar Realty Europe is expected to be beneficial for Northstar Realty shareholders:

The spread between real estate yields and interest rates in Europe is at historically wide levels. Recent quantitative easing measures announced by the European Central Bank are expected to drive spreads towards historical averages.

Property price appreciation in the U.S. has outpaced Europe as market fundamentals bottomed and began to improve much earlier in U.S. markets. European real estate values are still well below the peak from last cycle.


The spin-off of Northstar Europe is expected to result in immediate value creation for Northstar Realty shareholders:

The $2 billion European real estate portfolio consists of 49 predominately office properties located across nine countries. Approximately 5 million square feet, 91% occupied and weighted average remaining lease term of 5 years. The European portfolio should generate around $106 million of NOI in 2015.

Northstar's Latest Results
NRF's results for the first quarter of 2015 including CAD (cash available for distribution) of $136.5 million or $0.44 per share (CAD is the best indicator of operating performance and is an important factor when evaluating our dividend).
In Q1 NRF's investments totaled approximately $19.3 billion, including assets of deconsolidated CDOs and investments that Northstar has either acquired or in contract to acquire subsequent to quarter end. Excluding the $2 billion portfolio expected to be contributed to the European spin-off, total investments are approximately $17.3 billion.
NRF had approximately $1 billion of potential liquidity (in Q1).
Northstar Is Far From An Intelligent REIT Alternative
Warren Buffett said,
Risk comes from not knowing what you're doing.
I'll admit I now have a headache from researching NRF (or maybe it's because I have been in Las Vegas too long). Regardless, I failed to mention that in addition to its real estate portfolio, NRF derives other income from PE investments that own limited partnership interests in real estate private equity funds acquired in the secondary market (managed by institutional quality Sponsors). The PE deals, referred to as fund interests, account for around 6.7% of NRF's assets (~$1.2 billion in 2014).

Essentially, NRF is what I would call a "spread investor" and unlike owning a dedicated REIT that has an internalized management team, NRF is much more a "financial engineering" operation.
For some investors, NRF could be a good stock to own; however, to the less sophisticated investor (like me) there are many moving parts to consider with this security and I just don't see the value proposition - or the "thrill of victory is not worth the agony of defeat." Take a look at the dividend history:

That's a good indicator that a value investor wouldn't own this stock. But what about the market timers?
To be fair, it's important to understand that NRF has evolved from a mortgage REIT to an Equity REIT (effective December 2014) and the over complex REIT has just over a year under its belt in the Equity REIT space. Just last week, the company announced it will be added to the MSCI U.S. REIT Index, effective at the close on May 29.
As I ponder NRF - and its above average dividend yield of 8.7% - I consider the closest peers (the Healthcare REITs) and the fact that these close cousins all have dedicated management teams, so all they do is to go to work every day to create shareholder value. These peers also have no conflicts of interest (like NRF) and all they do is invest in one asset class. History has shown that owning a REIT with dedicated management supported by a "circle of competence" will outperform.


Perhaps a better option (for global exposure) will be NRF's spin-off REIT in Europe. As David White wrote,
Once companies are spun-off from their parents, the newly traded entity can focus on growth and do whatever management thinks is in the right interest of the spin-off and its shareholders, and not in the interest of the parent company. The change in incentives can be a powerful catalyst for valuation growth.
Over the last 12 months, NRF's share price has performed well. That doesn't mean it's a good stock, but Long investors should be satisfied with the Total Return prospects.

It's seems ironic perhaps that over the last 3 years the two worst performers were HCP and NRF. As I mentioned, HCP was previously led by the current CEO (Flaherty) now Vice Chairman of the Board of Northstar Healthcare Income, Inc. (overseeing NRF's healthcare business).
Furthermore, I suggest that much of the decline in HCP's share price was as a result of HCP's previous management team and poor decision to invest in higher risk assets with an overweight exposure in HCR ManorCare. Simply said, I would not want to invest in a business where the Coach's track record was subpar (especially since a majority of NRF's revenue is derived from healthcare).

As Warren Buffett said, "In the business world, the rear-view mirror is always clearer than the windshield." Given the reasons noted (1) no circle of competence, (2) no dedicated management team, (3) externally-advised, and (4) unproven track record, I'm not going to pursue the tempting yield associated with NRF. I'm not comfortable with the alignment of interests and there are simply too many moving pieces. NRF is a complex REIT and even if I could begin to understand how all of the pieces of the puzzle are put together, there is no way that I could ever "sleep well at night."

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
