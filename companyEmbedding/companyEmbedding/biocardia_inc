Enabling Devices: Helix System


Enabling Devices: Morph Products







Product Pipeline Overview
BioCardia  is developing two comprehensive biotherapeutic candidates for cardiac  regenerative medicine, with an initial focus on heart failure resulting from a heart  attack:

CardiAMP – autologous minimally processed bone marrow cells (a patient’s own cells)
CardiALLO –allogenic culture expanded mesenchymal stem cells derived from bone marrow  (donor-derived)   

Both  programs have demonstrated safety and efficacy in clinical studies. They provide compelling and synergistic approaches to replicating the  natural response of bone marrow cells  to cardiac injury. CardiAMP harnesses the potential of autologous  minimally processed bone marrow cells, using a companion diagnostic to  identify patients most likely to benefit from the therapy.  CardiALLO  utilizes younger universal donor mesenchymal stem  cells and may be appropriate for patients who are not optimal  candidates for the CardiAMP therapy. 
                  
The company currently has several commercial devices, which are used as part of  its biotherapeutic solutions, and can be used for other interventional  procedures. The Helix transendocardial delivery system is also being  used by several clinical  partners in biotherapeutic clinical  trials.

Morph Access Innovations - Overview
Access Innovations is a stand alone business built on  steerable thin walled catheter shaft technology.  This technology platform has countless applications in vascular access and is competitive with far more expensive robotic and magnetic techniques to control catheters.
The Morph catheter family is a fully scalable platform. We are working hard to enable it to be available to physicians who can benefit from its ability to navigate through tortuous anatomy, customize the shape of the catheter to the patient's anatomy and their clinical needs during the procedure, and to have stellar back up support once positioned. 
Morph Universal Deflectable Guides and Morph AccessPro Steerable Introducers Sheaths can improve physician control and reduce procedural times and radiation exposure.   These in turn have potential to enhance patient safety. There has been a growing body of literature that plaque emboli is dislodged during procedures due to catheter manipulation. Instead of using multiple preshaped catheters and potentially scraping the soft curves along the aorta, the Morph guides and sheaths enable a physician to use a catheter that is inserted in a straight configuration and deflected into the desired shape when at the target lesion or vessel.   It is estimated that the Morph catheters pay for themselves in any procedure where they save 2 minutes of expensive procedure room time.  The maximal control and minimal manipulation approach the Morph steerable guides and sheaths is intended to provide should have benefits to patient, physician, hospital, and insurer.

BioCardia - Helix Biotherapeutic Delivery






























Overview








Market Opportunity

Heart failure is a clinical condition in which the output of blood from the heart is insufficient to meet the metabolic demands of the body. In 2015, the American Heart Association, or AHA, report on heart disease statistics estimated that there are 5.7 million Americans over the age of 20 that have heart failure. Heart failure is increasingly prevalent due to the aging population and the increase in major cardiovascular risk factors, including obesity and diabetes. The AHA also estimates that one in five adults will develop heart failure after the age of 40. During heart failure progression, the heart steadily loses its ability to respond to increased metabolic demand, and mild exercise soon exceeds the heart’s ability to maintain adequate output. Towards the end stage of the disease, the heart cannot pump enough blood to meet the body’s needs at rest. At this stage, fluids accumulate in the extremities or in the lungs making the patient bedridden and unable to perform the activities of daily living. The long-term prognosis associated with heart failure is approximately 50% mortality at five years following the initial diagnosis. Hospitalizations for heart failure are expensive, and the risk of death increases with each recurrent heart failure related hospitalization. In 2014, the Journal of the American College of Cardiology reported that the one- and six month readmission rates after heart failure-related hospitalization are close to 25% and 50%, respectively. In 2010, the AHA estimated that the direct and indirect cost of heart failure in the United States was $39 billion, half of which was related to repeated hospitalizations, and by 2030 the total cost of heart failure in the United States is projected to increase to $70 billion. The Affordable Care Act recently established the “Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program,” which requires The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to reduce payments to hospitals with excessive heart failure readmissions. As such, there is growing pressure on hospitals to reduce readmissions for heart failure.
Heart failure is classified in relation to the severity of the symptoms experienced by the patient. The most commonly used classification system, established by the New York Heart Association, or NYHA, is as follows:
• Class I (mild): patients experience no or very mild symptoms with ordinary physical activity;
        • Class II (mild): patients experience fatigue and shortness of breath during moderate physical activity;
        • Class III (moderate): patients experience shortness of breath during even light physical activity; and
        • Class IV (severe): patients are exhausted even at rest.
Despite guideline-directed therapies employing a wide range of pharmacologic, device, and surgical options, many patients deteriorate over time and develop advanced heart failure symptoms that cannot be effectively managed by existing medical therapies. At the end stage of heart failure, current treatment options include heart transplant surgery or implantation of a left ventricular assist device, or LVAD, a battery operated mechanical circulatory device used to partially or completely replace the function of the left ventricle of the heart. LVADs are used for patients awaiting a heart transplant or as a destination therapy for patients with NYHA Class IV heart failure who may never receive a heart transplant. Both of these end-stage treatment options require invasive open-chest surgery and can cost in excess of $150,000 per procedure, as reported by the Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation.
There are approximately 2.9 million NYHA Class II and Class III heart failure patients, of which we estimate approximately 60% are patients with ischemic systolic heart failure. Of this subset of 1.7 million patients, we estimate that approximately 70%, or over 1.2 million patients, will have a cell potency score sufficient to qualify for treatment with CardiAMP.

CardiAMP Pivotal Heart Failure Trial Initiated at Two US Centers

December 29 2016
 SAN CARLOS, CA –BioCardia®, Inc. [OTC:BCDA], a leader in the development of comprehensive solutions for cardiovascular regenerative therapies, today announced the initiation of the CardiAMP Heart Failure pivotal trial, a randomized, controlled, multi-center study of up to 260 patients evaluating CardiAMP cell therapy at up to 40 clinical sites in the United States.
The trial has been initiated at two world-class centers: Johns Hopkins University, under the leadership of Dr. Peter Johnston and Dr. Gary Gerstenblith, and the University of Florida at Gainesville, under the leadership of Dr. David Anderson and Dr. Carl Pepine.
“We are honored to be working with the leading clinical research teams at each of these important centers to advance a therapeutic strategy that has great promise to help patients suffering from heart failure developed after a heart attack,” said Eric Duckers, MD, BioCardia Chief Medical Officer.  
The CardiAMP Therapy for heart failure integrates a biomarker panel, a cell processing system for autologous bone marrow-derived cells, and a unique transendocardial delivery system. This therapy will be reviewed under the PMA regulations by the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) division.  More information is available at www.clinicaltrials.gov, trial identifier: NCT02438306.

BioCardia, Inc. Signs Merger Agreement with Tiger X Medical, Inc., Secures Funding to Support Further Development of CardiAMP® Cell Therapy System for the Treatment of Heart Failure | Business Wire


























































BioCardia, Inc. Signs Merger Agreement with Tiger X Medical, Inc., 
      Secures Funding to Support Further Development of CardiAMP® Cell 
      Therapy System for the Treatment of Heart Failure






August 23, 2016 08:34 AM Eastern Daylight Time



SAN CARLOS, Calif. & MIAMI--(BUSINESS WIRE)--BioCardia, Inc., a clinical-stage regenerative medicine company 
      developing novel therapeutics for cardiovascular diseases, announced 
      today that it has entered into a definitive agreement to merge with 
      Tiger X Medical, Inc. (OTCPink: CDOM). The combined entity, which will 
      change its name to BioCardia following the closing, will trade on the 
      OTC Markets and will focus solely on the business of BioCardia.
    


      The combined entity is expected to have $23 million in cash at closing, 
      which will be used to support the ongoing Phase III Heart Failure Trial, 
      for the commercialization and development of other product candidates, 
      and for general corporate purposes. OPKO Health Inc. (NASDAQ: OPK) will 
      become a significant stockholder in Tiger X Medical and will also serve 
      as an advisor to the business.
    

      “Our CardiAMP cell therapy is seeking to address an enormous unmet need 
      – a treatment for heart failure that develops after a patient has had a 
      heart attack. The merger will provide resources necessary to continue 
      our Phase III development of CardiAMP,” said Dr. Peter Altman, 
      BioCardia’s CEO.
    

      BioCardia is commencing a Phase III study of its CardiAMP cell therapy 
      system for the treatment of heart failure. The Food and Drug 
      Administration (FDA) has approved the study under an Investigational 
      Device Exemption (IDE). The Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services 
      (CMS) have approved this IDE Nationally as qualified for CMS 
      reimbursement.
    

      The CardiAMP cell therapy for heart failure integrates a proprietary 
      biomarker panel to identify candidates likely to respond to therapy, a 
      cell processing system which prepares a proprietary, high-dosage 
      formulation of autologous bone marrow-derived cells and a unique 
      transendocardial delivery system that ensures efficient and consistent 
      targeted delivery.
    

      The CardiAMP clinical trial is a randomized, controlled, multi-center 
      study of 250 patients evaluating CardiAMP Therapy at up to 40 clinical 
      sites in the United States. It follows two previous clinical studies 
      sponsored by BioCardia supporting the CardiAMP Therapy. Additional 
      details are available via ClinicalTrials.gov, 
      using identifier: NCT02438306.
    

      Results from the trial will be reviewed under the PMA regulations by the 
      FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) division.
    

      About BioCardia®:
    

      BioCardia, Inc., headquartered in San Carlos, CA, is a privately-held 
      company developing regenerative biologic therapies to treat
