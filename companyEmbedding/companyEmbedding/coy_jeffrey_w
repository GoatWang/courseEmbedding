Residence
Shippensburg, Pennsylvania


Jeffrey W. Coy is a member of the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board and a former Democratic member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives.
He is a 1969 graduate of Shippensburg Area Senior High School.[3] He earned a degree from Shippensburg University in 1973.[3] He serves as a director for the Shippensburg-based Orrstown Bank.[4]
Coy was first elected to represent the 89th legislative district in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives in 1982.[5] He served as Democratic (Majority) Caucus Chairman from 1993 through 94 as the majority party.[6] In 1995, he was elected to serve as Democratic (Minority) Caucus Secretary.[6] He was re-elected 11 times in a heavily Republican district.[7]
Coy announced his intention not to seek re-election in early 2004.[8] In August, Coy was nominated by the House Democrat leader Bill DeWeese[9] to become a member of the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board, a controversial nomination because of a provision of the Pennsylvania Constitution prohibiting legislators from serving on such boards "during the time for which he was elected."[8] Senate Republicans interpreted the phrase to mean the entire two-year legislative term, which would expire on November 30, 2004, and suggested that the Democrats appoint a placeholder until the end of the legislative term. Coy's resignation from his seat would satisfy the constitution.[8] Coy resigned his legislative seat effective September 2, 2004 and was appointed to the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board effective the next day.[2][10]

Coy is a member of the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board and a former Democratic member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives.He is a 1969 graduate of Shippensburg Area Senior High School.[3] He earned a degree from Shippensburg University in 1973.[3] He serves as a director for the Shippensburg-based Orrstown Bank.[4]Coy was first elected to represent the 89th legislative district in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives in 1982.[5] He served as Democratic (Majority) Caucus Chairman from 1993 through 94 as the majority party.[6] In 1995, he was elected to serve as Democratic (Minority) Caucus Secretary.[6] He was re-elected 11 times in a heavily Republican district.[7]Coy announced his intention not to seek re-election in early 2004.[8] In August, Coy was nominated by the House Democrat leader Bill DeWeese[9] to become a member of the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board, a controversial nomination because of a provision of the Pennsylvania Constitution prohibiting legislators from serving on such boards "during the time for which he was elected."[8] Senate Republicans interpreted the phrase to mean the entire two-year legislative term, which would expire on November 30, 2004, and suggested that the Democrats appoint a placeholder until the end of the legislative term. Coy's resignation from his seat would satisfy the constitution.[8] Coy resigned his legislative seat effective September 2, 2004 and was appointed to the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board effective the next day.[2][10]References^ "SESSION OF 1983 - 167TH OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY - No. 1" (PDF).
