	Nantucket Home began in 1975 after owners Rick and Nan Tofanelli returned from an inspirational trip to the island of Nantucket.  They fell in love with the Northeastern folk-art movement and upon returning to Chico, they opened a little store on Third Street in Chico, California.  Some might remember the shop as “Nantucket Quilt” where one could find island-made baskets, early American antique-furniture and of course, vintage quilts and fabrics. 

	With an appreciation of the craft of quilting, Rick and Nan began a wholesale division of quilts called “Nantucket Cotton”.  The Chico-based textile business was a success and the line was quickly picked up by well-known retailers such as Neiman Marcus, Macy’s and Horchow.

	Nantucket Cotton’s line expanded to include children’s clothing, holiday décor, pot holders, quilts and travel bags to name a few, and the success of the little retail shop soon forced a big move across the street.  The move allowed the businesses to expand in many ways: custom-made bedding became available, there was plentiful space for Rick’s finds of antique furniture, and Nan saw the necessity of an interior designer on staff.
	After the introduction of custom bedding, came beds, then sofas, gifts and home accessories.  Along the way, Rick and Nan decided that their hearts were in interiors.  Over the next 30 years, the original hole-in-the-wall store evolved to a full interior design studio, an area rug gallery and a sophisticated furniture showroom.

	In 2008, Nan took on the renovation of Chico’s original Cadillac dealership to be the ultimate location of Nantucket Home, merging three showrooms into one.  Still in the heart of downtown, the 13,000 square foot open-beamed showroom is the perfect organic backdrop for their distinctive product.  Offering a full interior design studio, an impressive showroom and as the ideal locale for parties and events, it’s evident that Rick and Nan’s passion for design and love of community can be discovered and shared here at 6th and Broadway.



"We are an eclectic blend.  We are traditional.  We are inspired by the Asian arts.  We are past, present and future. We are vintage.  We can be contemporary. We are definitely transitional.  We are Ralph Lauren, Shabby Chic & Thomas O’Brien all rolled into one.  We are a family.  We are dedicated to our clients and the products we share.  We are what you are.  We are a life aesthetic. We are home…"

With much respect and thanks for appreciating innovation, artfulness and good design,

-Nan and Rick Tofanelli, with help from their growing family

The Official Bug Spray of Summer

 
The Official Bug Spray of Summer

Nantucket SpiderNatural, DEET-Free Insect RepellentsAbout Us
Nancy Jack and Jeffrey Busch are lifelong friends who teamed up to create an effective natural alternative to deet-based bug repellents for their family and friends.
An environmental lawyer, Nancy’s trust in available repellents was shattered 20 years ago when she was on an outdoor business site visit that was particularly buggy. A well-intentioned coworker passed around a popular chemical based repellent that Nancy sprayed on her legs. To her deep dismay, the nylons she was wearing quickly dissolved. This unfortunate and thought-provoking incident was the ember that eventually sparked the idea for a natural repellent, Nantucket Spider. Nancy spends her summers in the buggiest parts of Canada, which has served as an ideal laboratory for testing various essential oils for their repellent qualities.
While Jeffrey, a public interest lawyer, really appreciates and respects all wildlife critters, he is able to enjoy them even more when they aren’t biting him or his family. On a particularly mosquitoy summer evening out on Jetties Beach, Nantucket─after an afternoon sharing the shore with a few too many horseflies─Jeffrey found himself wondering if some natural predator, like a spider, could keep the bugs in check. Yes, he decided. A Nantucket spider was sorely needed. Something natural that could safely protect him and his family.
Together, Nancy and Jeffrey developed a repellent using the perfect blend of natural ingredients that will repel most biting insects commonly found in New England — one that has proven itself effective against bugs not only on Nantucket and coastal New England, but also wherever mosquitoes or biting flies are a problem. Nantucket Spider repellent doesn’t just works great, it also smells and feels light and fresh.
If you have already tried Nantucket Spider on you, your family, or your dogs, we know why you are on this website. If you haven’t yet tried it, we are sure you are going to love it!  Try also our new outdoor products — garden incense sticks, jewelry and outdoor diffusing pure essential oils.
We know that you’ll be happy working with us. Look around our website and if you have any comments or questions, please feel free to contact us. And, check back later for new updates. There’s much more to come!
We hope to see you again soon!
