LUMA’s State of Digital Media at DMS 16The media business has changed.

Why Chris Copeland Left GroupM For Yieldbot

 


“For many years we stuck as many ads on a page as possible and eventually I knew we would get tuned out. We need to become more respectful of publishers and their value. More respectful of consumers and their worth even if it means everyone needs to pay, change and invest more. I don’t know if ad blockers forced this moment, but whether it’s the load time of a page, volume of ads or lack of relevancy there’s a lot to figure out.”

Ad Blockers Are Making Money Off Ads (And Tracking, Too)

 


“The ad-block profiteers are building for-profit companies whose business models are premised on impeding the movement of commercial, political, and public-service communication between and among producers and consumers. They offer to lift their toll gates for those wealthy enough to pay them off, or who submit to their demands that they constrict their freedom of speech to fit the shackles of their revenue schemes.”
– Randall Rothenberg
President and CEO, Interactive Advertising Bureau

Association of National Advertisers

 


The annual financial impact of bot fraud ranged between $250,000 and $42 million for the 49 participating advertisers and averaged about $10 million per participant.  The advertising industry overall could lose approximately $7.2 billion globally to bots in 2016.

The US Bankruptcy Court gave an order approving the sale of substantially all the assets of MediaShift, Inc. on January 29, 2016. The debtor has been authorized to sell substantially all its assets to MediaShift Holdings, Inc., the stalking horse bidder for a purchase price of $11.77 million. The purchase price consists of a credit bid of $11.07 million and cash price of $0.70 million. The debtor did not receive any other competing bids for the purchase of its assets and therefore MediaShift Holdings emerged as the winning bidder.

The US Bankruptcy Court gave an order to MediaShift, Inc. to obtain DIP financing on a final basis on December 30, 2015. As per the order, the debtor has been authorized to obtain a senior secured, super priority revolving credit facility in the amount of $0.43 million from MediaShift Holdings, Inc. The DIP loan would carry an interest rate of 12% p.a., along with an additional 4% p.a. interest in the event of default. The DIP facility would mature either on January 31, 2016 or on the date of close of any sale of all or substantially all of the debtors’ assets, whichever is earlier. Adequate protection would be provided to the DIP lenders in the form of super-priority administrative expense claims which is subject to a carve-out of $0.05 million towards unpaid professional fees / administrative expenses and first priority lien upon and security interest in the debtor’s collateral. The proceeds shall be used for working capital and general corporate purposes and to pay the costs and expenses related to the administration of the cases. George C.

To qualify as a qualified bidder, interested parties should submit their bids by January 21, 2016. The initial minimum overbid should be at least $0.5 million more than the initial purchase price. The debtor has scheduled an auction on January 25, 2016. At the auction, the first subsequent increment would be $0.15 million and the subsequent bids would be in increment of $0.1 million. The stalking horse bidder would be entitled to an expense reimbursement of $0.2 million in the event the winning bid exceeds stalking horse bid by at least $5 million leading to termination of agreement.
