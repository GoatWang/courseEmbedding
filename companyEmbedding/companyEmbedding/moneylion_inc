MoneyLion Enhances Product Line with New Suite of Tools to Help 
      Consumers Manage and Improve Their Financial Health




      - Redesigned mobile app tracks spending, saving and borrowing while 
      offering personalized recommendations on how to improve financial 
      fitness and achieve financial goals
    





May 26, 2017 11:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Mobile personal finance and consumer lending platform, MoneyLion, 
      today launched new features designed to make the financial goals of its 
      1 million-plus users easier to achieve. As part of the launch, MoneyLion 
      also redesigned its website and mobile app.
    


      “Our mission is to bring our users closer to their financial goals by 
      making money more approachable,” said Diwakar Choubey, CEO and 
      co-founder of MoneyLion. “These new features address the widespread need 
      among consumers for smarter tools that simplify and personalize 
      financial advice, all the while making it easier to build better habits 
      and make good financial decisions more consistently.”
    

      MoneyLion is launching its new features to address the financial 
      challenges consumers face today. A Federal 
      Reserve study showed that 46 percent of Americans don’t have $400 
      saved for an emergency, and two-thirds of Americans were unable to pass 
      a financial literacy test according to another 
      study. MoneyLion’s new features have been designed to help users 
      overcome these challenges by simplifying their day-to-day relationship 
      with money and making it easier to build positive, sustainable financial 
      habits.
    

      MoneyLion has introduced the following new app features in a refreshed 
      interface to help reduce the friction consumers face when it comes to 
      their finances:
    


Simple, data-driven advice, wherever you go: From the moment 
        users open the MoneyLion mobile app, they receive personalized 
        recommendations that encourage positive financial behaviors based on 
        their individual spending habits and credit profile. These 
        recommendations are refreshed daily with the user’s latest data to 
        ensure they remain aligned to their current financial situation and 
        objectives.
      

Streamlined borrowing experience: MoneyLion’s personal loan 
        process has been streamlined to improve speed, convenience and lower 
        the cost of borrowing. Customers can receive a loan offer in as little 
        as 15 seconds, access funds as quickly as the same business day, and 
        now have even more options for reducing their interest rates.
      

New ways to improve credit health: In addition to the free 
        credit score already available to every user, MoneyLion now offers 
        full credit reports from TransUnion® and Equifax, and access to credit 
        counseling and repair options. Customers can also avoid credit 
        surprises with expanded push notifications alerting them to changes to 
        their credit.
      


      “We want to be the financial GPS for Americans who are looking for 
      guidance on how to become more resilient and better prepared to reach 
      their financial goals,” added Choubey.
    

      “We’re using AI and machine learning to power a uniquely personalized 
      experience that helps simplify the complexity of finances. Through these 
      updates, we aim to help our users prevent more immediate roadblocks, 
      like overdraft fees or late payment fees, which tend to have lasting 
      implications on their finances down the road.”
    

      These latest updates build on the financial progress and behavioral 
      changes users have already made with MoneyLion. According to data 
      collected in 2016, MoneyLion has helped its users improve their 
      financial health in the following ways:
    


        Customers have earned over $5 million in savings via MoneyLion’s rate 
        reduction and rewards program, which enables users to earn points for 
        demonstrating good financial behavior.
      

        Loan takers who make use of the platform’s free credit monitoring 
        tools were 28 percent less likely to default.
      

        MoneyLion’s platform and products have helped customers save on 
        average about $46 per month on overdraft fees. It’s estimated that 
        these fees cost American consumers about $11 billion every year 
        according to Banks.org.
      

        Users enrolled in MoneyLion’s credit health tools were 6 times more 
        likely to see an increase in credit score than a decrease.
      


      MoneyLion is available on Android and iPhone from Google 
      Play and the App 
      Store.

MoneyLion brings traditional banking ever closer to obsolescence

HTC Vive announces $10 billion VR Venture Capital Alliance












The lingo of personal finance is rapidly changing. Mint has replaced our nagging parents and significant others who think our spending is out of control. Wealthfront and Betterment took away our personal wealth managers. Heck, we don’t even have to go to a bank anymore to get a loan with SoFi or Lending Club.

Since 2013, CEO Diwakar Choubey and his team have been developing MoneyLion to combine personal loans with credit monitoring and personalized financial nudges.
The way something is presented is often more important than what is being presented. MoneyLion wants to get people spending better by presenting information differently.
Users can simulate their future credit score in MoneyLion. Having a window into the future can help people counteract forces like hyperbolic discounting. For non-CogSci folks, this is how researchers explain why people can easily see the value in setting their alarm for 6am at night but find it hard in the morning to see the same inherent value and wind up smashing the snooze button 3 times.
In a financial context, people are really bad at anticipating future frustration. If I buy an Apple Watch with my credit card now, my brain doesn’t want me to be able to imagine the bill in my mailbox.
Customers check their credit score on MoneyLion an average of 3.9 times a month. This degree of transparency makes people sweat in the short-run but reduces the likelihood of bad decision making that induces long-term elevated stress.
The platform also leverages data to recommend loans when they are most needed. If spending patterns appear incongruent with prior months, MoneyLion can suggest a small loan to smooth things over. A user can receive overdraft warnings within the app and take a $200 advance in about 15 minutes.
Tim Hong, one of the key behavioral architects of the platform, wants MoneyLion to dream big. Many of the tedious financial tasks we all dread can be streamlined with readily available technology.
How can we prevent fraud? Facial recognition of course. Need a verification photo for a loan application? Just take a selfie.
“One of the problems we saw in consumer finance was that marketplace lenders were spending lots of money to acquire customers for one transaction,” said Choubey.
MoneyLion uses rewards to incentivize users to stick with the platform. The idea of rewards is not new in banking, nearly every credit card offers benefits or cash back. A large variety of data enables MoneyLion to offer a wide breadth of rewards for building good financial habits. Reward redemptions on the platform have been growing at 39% month over month.
MoneyLion recommends action-steps that it believes are correlated with lower default rates. The platform mines transaction data from users that link their bank accounts. This allows MoneyLion to recommend spending habits. How guilty would you feel if the app you used to manage your finances got on your case about all those Venti Pumpkin Spice Lattes you’ve been sneaking in after lunch.
MoneyLion competes with the likes of SoFi and Lending Club but Choubey argues his company is going after a different customer.
“SoFi has a handle on those with a 750 Fico and above, we want to focus on the middle 70 percent,” noted Choubey.
Over 100,000 loans have been written on MoneyLion and 11 percent of those users have taken credit according to Choubey. Users can exercise a lot of freedom with loans. They can leverage endorsements from friends and family to lower interest rates and prepay loans at any time. Loan prepayment is often looked down upon by lending platforms because they eat away at revenue by truncating interest payments.
“We don’t charge an origination fee like Lending Club,” added Choubey
MoneyLion holds some of its loans on balance sheet and funds them through wholesale markets. Its loan business has been growing by 3X year over year in both originations and volume.
MoneyLion is on the lookout to close additional partnerships. The company has already locked-down 25-30 partnerships and has plans to work with a wealth management platform like Wealthfront and Betterment to tackle the other side of the balance sheet.
