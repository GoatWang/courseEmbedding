                                         said its Chief Executive Jim Morgan will retire by the end of the year and will be succeeded by Reece Kurtenbach, currently the company's executive vice president. Mr. Morgan has served as Daktronics' president and CEO since 2001. He has been with the company, which makes scoreboards, displays and sound systems, since its first year of operation in 1969. Messrs. Morgan and Kurtenbach will work together to ensure a smooth transition, the company said. The transition date will be no later than the end of calendar year 2013 and Mr. Morgan will continue to serve on Daktronics' board. "Reece is well-qualified to be the company's next President and Chief Executive Officer, based on his demonstrated capability in business unit and product development leadership," Mr. Morgan said. Mr. Kurtenbach is currently responsible for the company's live events and international business units. He joined the company full-time in 1991 and was named executive vice president last year. Last week, Daktronics reported its fiscal third-quarter profit rose 63%, helped by a tax benefit and lower expenses, though revenue from several major segments dropped. Daktronics's revenue has generally improved over the past two years, thanks in part to increased demand in its live events and transportation segments. But cost overruns and some delays in booking orders have lately been pressuring its bottom line. Shares were off 1.4%, to $9.95 in recent trading. The stock is up 7.6% over the past 12 months.

Wall Street's 'fear gauge'--the VIX--just logged its second-lowest close in history
              
              One measure of fear on Wall Street on Friday booked its second-lowest finish ever, according to FactSet data. The CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX, wrapped up the session down 2.3% at 9.36, marking the lowest close since the so-called "fear gauge" ended at 9.31 in December 1993 at 9.31. The gauge flirted with the lowest reading in history at 9.30, before bucking up a touch. The VIX is based on options contracts on the S&P 500 30-days in the future. The metric's historical average is 20 and it has continued to mostly slump in 2017, with the majority of its readings below 10 being put in this year, as stocks have reached repeated records since President Donald Trump's Election Day victory in November. That dynamic, lower readings for VIX and elevated stock prices, have suggested to market participants that investors are becoming increasingly complacent. Friday's VIX slide came as many major equity benchmarks closed lower, but not far from records, including the Dow Jones Industrial Average , the S&P 500 index , and the Nasdaq Composite Index , which all finished less than 1% shy of all-time closing highs.

Newspaper publisher McClatchy Co. reports Q2 loss, but growth in digital business
              
              Newspaper publisher McClatchy Co.  reported second-quarter earnings before the market opened on Friday and said digital-only subscribers grew nearly 14% from the previous year's first quarter. The company reported a net loss of $37.4 million, or $4.91 per share for the second quarter, compared with a loss of $14.7 million, or $1.89 per share during the same quarter a year ago. The adjusted loss per share was 79 cents. McClatchy's revenue hit $225.1 million in the quarter, down 7% compared with the prior year. Total advertising revenue revenues were down 11% compared with the same quarter last year, while digital-only advertising revenue grew by 10%. The company said that the rate of decline in total advertising slowed in the quarter. "As I have mentioned before, achieving a normalized operating environment takes some time in digital transitions," McClatchy Chief Executive Craig Forman said in a statement. "While we continue to see strong headwinds in print advertising, we also are seeing our digital efforts in all aspects of the business moderate those headwinds." McClatchy's average total unique visitors to the company's online products grew close to 15% to 66 million in the quarter. Shares of McClatchy were inactive in morning trade on Friday, but have declined more than 34% in the year to date, while the S&P 500 index  have gained more than 10%.

Revenue rose to $1.36 billion from $1.13 billion, beating the FactSet consensus of $1.26 billion. Off-road and snowmobile sales rose to $845.5 million from $799.3 million, above the FactSet consensus of $761.7 million, while motorcycle sales fell 13% to $198 million but beat expectations of $192 million. The company raised its 2017 sales growth outlook to 12% to 14% from 10% to 13% and its adjusted EPS outlook to $4.35 to $4.50 from $4.25 to $4.50. "The powersports industry remained very competitive and headwinds persist, but we were encouraged by the return to growth in our Side-by-Side business and continued strength and aggressive share gains for Indian Motorcycles," said Chief Executive Scott Wine. On Wednesday, the company said it recalled 25,600 ATVs after reports of fuel leaks and fires. The stock, which wasn't active in premarket trade, has rallied 12.2% year to date, while the S&P 500  has gained 10.5%.

Tesla stock initiated as neutral/high risk at Citi with price target 10% above current price
              
              Citigroup initiated coverage of electric car maker Tesla Inc.  Thursday, with a neutral/high risk rating and $357 stock price target. That's equal to about 10% upside from its current level. "We're positive on Tesla's position as a Car of the Future leader and view the upside case to still be significant, however, we prefer to wait for a better entry point either through: (a) A stronger balance sheet, which in our view would more favorably tilt the 12-month risk/reward equation, all-else-equal; or (b) convincing signs of a smooth Model 3 ramp with limited Model S cannibalization," analyst Itay Michaeli wrote in a note. The analyst said he is "fundamentally bullish" on Tesla, but that both bull and bear cases for the stock have merit. On the bull side, the company has had initial product success, brand appeal, speed of innovation and tech/software leadership," he wrote. The next 12 months rely on Tesla achieving Model 3 conversions and meeting margin goals, while continuing to cement its leadership in self-driving. Tesla shares were slightly lower premarket, but have gained 52% in 2017, while the S&P 500  has gained 10.5%.

Polaris recalls tens of thousands of ATVs after reports of fire, fuel leaks
              
              Recreational vehicles company Polaris Industries Inc.  recalled about 25,600 all-terrain vehicles (ATVs) after reports of fuel leaks and fires. The recall involves 2014 Sportsman 570 model ATVs sold from April 2014 through May 2017 for $6,500 to $7,700 in several colors, which were made by Polaris in the U.S., according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission. The recall follows 30 reports of fuel leaks and four incidents involving a fire, although no injuries had been reported. "Consumers should immediately stop using the recalled ATVs and contact Polaris to schedule a free repair," the company said in a statement. "Polaris is contacting all known purchasers directly." The stock, which was up 1.2% in afternoon trade, has rallied 12.9% year to date, while the S&P 500  has gained 10.4%.

Super Micro warns of profit shortfall, stock falls more than 10%

					Super Micro Computer Inc.  fell more than 10% in late trading Thursday after disclosing that profit came up short of projections, partly due to the high cost of memory chips. The high-performance computing company said that adjusted profit will be 35 cents to 37 cents a share, lower than previous guidance of 40 cents to 50 cents a share. The announcement noted three causes for a nine-cent downfall per share: "expiring customer agreements with unfavorable DRAM and SSD pricing; urgent new projects with unanticipated R & D expense from major partners with NRE to be recovered in later quarters; and tax impact due to our global corporate tax structure." The cost for dynamic random access memory, or DRAM, and solid-state drives, or SSDs, have spiked in the past year, harming profit for many computer companies. Super Micro said it would report revenue at or above the high end of its previous guidance range of $655 million to $715 million, with expectations for sales now at $712 million to $717 million. Chief Executive Charles Liang promised more details when the company fully reports earnings on Aug. 3. Super Micro stock declined to around $24.15 after closing with a 2.3% increase at $27.10.

Apple's stock ends seesaw session with a loss to snap win streak at 9 sessions

					Apple Inc.'s stock  ended a seesaw session Thursday in negative territory, snapping its win streak at nine sessions despite continued gains in the broader technology sector. The stock rallied as much as 0.5% to an intraday high of $151.74 in the opening minutes, then fell as much as 0.5% to an intraday low of $150.19 at about 10:40 a.m. ET, then turned positive again around midday before falling to close at $150.34. The nine-session losing streak was the longest since the nine-session stretch ending Aug. 25, 2014. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100  ticked up 0.1%, marking a 10th straight gain. Apple's stock has rallied 29.8% year to date, while the Nasdaq 100 has climbed 21.8% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average  has gained 9.4%.

Qualcomm forecast disappoints amid Apple fight

					Qualcomm Inc.  met expectations with its quarterly earnings report Wednesday, but shares fell as the company's forecast excluded any sales related to Apple Inc.  products and came in less than expected amid a legal battle with the iPhone maker. Qualcomm reported fiscal third-quarter net income of $866 million, or 58 cents a share, on revenue of $5.37 billion. Qualcomm was expected on average to report adjusted earnings of 83 cents a share on revenue of $5.28 billion, according to a FactSet analyst survey. Qualcomm's forecast was more highly anticipated, however, amid a big fight between Qualcomm and Apple over the licensing fees Qualcomm commands for its patented technologies, but Qualcomm did not include licensing fees in its forecast. "Our financial guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 excludes QTL revenues related to the sale of Apple products by Apple's contract manufacturers as well as the other licensee in dispute as we expect the recent actions taken by these licensees will continue until the respective disputes are resolved," the company said in its release. Qualcomm predicted adjusted earnings of 75 cents to 85 cents 
a share on sales of $5.4 billion to $6.2 billion. Analysts on average expected the fourth-quarter forecast to call for adjusted earnings per share of 93 cents on revenue of $5.51 billion, according to FactSet. Qualcomm shares dipped about 3% in late trading after the report was released, following a 0.9% gain in regular trading.

Apple's stock gains to stretch win streak to 9 sessions
              
              Apple Inc.'s stock  edged up 0.4% in morning trade Wednesday, but that slight gain put it on track to match the longest win streak in three years. The stock is headed for the ninth-straight gain, the longest such streak since the nine-day stretch ending Aug. 25, 2014. There hasn't been a 10-session win streak since Oct. 18, 2010. J.P. Morgan analyst Rod Hall reiterated on Wednesday his overweight rating and price target of $165, which is 9.6% above current levels. He said that production of new iPhone to be released in the fall appear to be off to a slow start, but he believes those concerns are already reflected in the stock price. "Importantly, we do not believe that Apple's production schedule is still changing materially with most current delay reports simply dated reverberations of decisions Apple made back in the spring," Hall wrote in a note to clients. Apple's stock has now climbed 5.6% during its current win streak, but was still 3.5% below the May 12 record close of $156.10. Year to date, it's up 30%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average  had gained 9.3%.

Tech companies hoarded the most cash of any sector in 2016: Moody's
              
              U.S. tech companies continued to hoard the most cash of any sector in 2016, according to a Moody's Investors Service report published Wednesday. Apple Inc. , Microsoft Corp. , Google , Cisco Inc.  and Oracle Corp.  led the pack with a combined total of $594 billion, the rating agency said in a new report. Apple alone held $246 billion, or 13.2% of the total corporate cashpile, up 12.8% from $216 billion in 2015. Overall, non-financial companies had $1.84 trillion in cash at year-end, up 9.2% from the year-earlier period. Overseas cash is about $1.3 trillion, or 70% of the total, said the report. The most cash-rich sectors are tech, health care, consumer products and energy with a combined $1.46 trillion, or 79% of the total. The tech sector had a combined $871 billion. "Offshore cash holdings will continue to grow absent tax reform," said Moody's.

Cray to slash workforce by about 14%, most by the end of the week
              
              Cray Inc.  disclosed Wednesday it plans to cut 190 jobs, which is about 14% of its workforce, as part of a restructuring plan aimed at cutting costs by $25 million a year. The supercomputing company said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that the "vast majority" of the job cuts will be effective July 21. The cuts will affect "all organizations and major geographies" of the company. Cray said it expects to record restructuring charges of $10 million, most of which will be recorded during the third quarter. The stock, which was still inactive in premarket trade, has lost 8.7% year to date, while the SPDR Technology Select Sector ETF  has run up 18% and the S&P 500  has gained 9.9%.

Apple announces new leader in China amid sagging sales
              
              Apple Inc.  announced Tuesday evening that Isabel Ge Mahe will take on a new role as leader of the company's efforts in China, amid a sales downturn for the iPhone maker in the world's most populous country. Mahe, previously vice president of wireless technologies for the tech giant, will take over the newly created role of vice president and managing director of Greater China, the company said in an announcement. "Apple is strongly committed to invest and grow in China, and we are thrilled that Isabel will be bringing her experience and leadership to our China team," Chief Executive Tim Cook said in the release. Apple sales in China have declined for five consecutive quarters after a 14% drop in the most recent earnings report, as Asian smartphone manufacturers have become more competitive in the region. Apple is scheduled to report earnings for its fiscal third quarter on Aug. 1. The company's stock finished off an eighth consecutive positive trading session Tuesday, its longest winning streak in three years; shares have now gained 29.6% so far this year, while the Dow Jones industrial average  has increased 9.2% and the S&P 500 index  has gained 9.9%.

Broadcom, Brocade merger delayed
              
              Brocade Communications Systems Inc.  said late Tuesday the closing of its deal with Broadcom Ltd.  has been delayed to give a U.S. government inter-agency committee more time to go over the proposed deal. Broadcom agreed to buy Brocade last year, and shareholders approved the deal in January. Earlier this week, however, following discussions with the U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment, the companies agreed to withdraw and re-file a voluntary notice to the committee to allow more time for a review. Once the committee accepts the notice, a new 30-day review period will start, and that may be followed by a 45-day investigation period, Brocade said. Shares of Brocade rose 0.2% in late trading and ended the day down 0.5%; shares of Broadcom rose 0.5% in the late session and ended the regular session up 0.8%. "Brocade and Broadcom have been and will continue to be actively engaged with CFIUS during its review of the proposed acquisition. There can be no assurances, however, that CFIUS will ultimately agree that the parties may proceed with the proposed acquisition," they said. The delay also affects Extreme Networks Inc. , which had agreed to buy Brocade's data-center networking business from Broadcom. Extreme said in a statement it expects to close its transaction with Broadcom within two to three business days of the completed acquisition of Brocade by Broadcom.

Apple's stock reverses higher to post longest win streak in 3 years 
              
              Shares of Apple Inc.  erased an early loss to close up 0.3% Tuesday, to stretch its winning streak to eight sessions. That's the longest such streak since the nine-session stretch ending Aug. 25, 2014. The stock was down as much as 0.6% at the intraday low of $148.67 around 10:05 a.m. ET, the started rising to close just below its intraday high of $150.13. The stock has rallied 5.2% during its streak, but is still 4% away from the May 12 record close of $156.10. Apple's win streak matches that of the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 , which has also gained for eight straight sessions, matching the eight-day win streak it managed seven weeks ago. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average  has declined two straight days, and in three of the past eight sessions.

IBM revenue continues to fall
              
              International Business Machines Corp.  sales declined year-over-year for the 21st consecutive quarter, the tech company announced Tuesday, but the company's cloud revenue continued to grow. IBM reported profit of $2.3 billion, or $2.48 a share, on sales of $19.3 billion for its second quarter, with earnings falling 7% from the same quarter a year ago and revenue dropping 5%. After adjusting for acquisition- and retirement-related expenses, the company claimed earnings of $2.97 a share, up 1% from a year ago. Analysts on average expected adjusted profit of $2.74 a share on sales of $19.5 billion. Cloud revenue gained 15% from last year to $3.9 billion, and IBM maintained its outlook for the full year. Shares, which closed with a 0.7% gain at $154, declined about 2% after the results were announced.

Apple's stock leads Dow gainers after analyst boosts price target
              
              Shares of Apple Inc.  surged 0.8% in morning trade Monday, enough to pace the Dow Jones Industrial Average's  gainers, after Morgan Stanley raised its price target, to be the third highest among the 44 analysts surveyed by FactSet. The stock's price gain of $1.23 was adding about 8.5 points to the price of the Dow's, which was down 14 points. Analyst Katy Huberty bumped her price target up to $182 from $177. The new target is 21% above current levels, 12% above the average target of the 44 analysts surveyed by FactSet of $162.12. When Apple reports on Aug. 1, Huberty expects the company to provide a "weaker-than-consensus" outlook for its fourth quarter ending in September, because of the slightly later iPhone launch than typical--October shipment rather than the usual September. But that delay "creates a dynamic of much better-than-normal December and March quarter seasonality, providing an attractive set up for the stock looking beyond the September guide," Huberty wrote in a note to clients. The stock has rallied 5.9% over the past three months, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100  has climbed 8.4% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average  has gained 4.8%.

About Us
ReeseHitches.com is a Midwest based, family owned business that specializes in trailer hitches and towing products for light duty to heavy duty applications. Our company opened for business in 1957 as a manufacturer of trailer hitches and has grown to become an ISO 9001-2008 certified company and a leading supplier of hitches, trailer parts and truck accessories to customers throughout North America. Unlike some other e-commerce sites, we are not just marketers of other company's products who take your order and then drop ship those products to you. We stock everything we sell on this website. That means faster service, better order fill and tighter quality control.
Choosing the right trailer hitch can be a real challenge and having someone to guide you through that process can be a great help. The professional customer service team here at ReeseHitches.com is here to help. Give us a call or drop us an email and we'll be happy to put our years of experience and hands-on product knowledge to work for you. 
Thanks for stopping by. If you don't find what you're looking for please let us know. We have access to thousands of hard-to-find parts available from leading manufacturers throughout the world. Our friendly and courteous staff will be happy to help you find whatever you need.
We are an independent authorized dealer for Reese products, not affiliated with Horizon Global Corp.

Cancel or Change Your Order
If you need to cancel or change your order please contact us as soon as possible to do so. 
If you need to cancel your order after it is already been shipped to you - we will need to work with you to make sure that your order is cancelled in our system, UPS is notified, and ensure that you "refuse the shipment" from UPS. If UPS actually delivers the product to you, then contact us to work out how we will get the product back from you. You may incur some of the shipping charges to get the products back to us.

Safe Shopping Guarantee
Is it safe to use my credit card on your website?
Yes, shopping on this website is very safe. Every credit card purchase on this web site is covered by our Safe Shopping Guarantee. See Guarantee details below.
Why is this website so safe to shop on?
Safe Technology: Our secure socket layer computer software (SSL) is the industry standard and among the best computer software available today for secure internet transactions. The computer software that we use encrypts your credit card number so that it cannot be read as the information travels over the Internet.
We have been approved by GoDaddy.com as an SSL Secure and Authentic site. GoDaddy.com is one of the Industry Leaders in providing technology that protects your information. We accept all Major Credit Cards on this site – and, to be able to do this we had to pass very stringent security tests to ensure to the Major Credit Card Providers (Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Discover) that your information would be safe and secure on our website.
If you are still not comfortable ordering via the Internet, please call us to place your order with one of our Customer Service Representatives.
Safe Shopping Guarantee Details:
Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, your bank cannot hold you liable for more than $50.00 of fraudulent charges. If your bank does hold you liable for any of this $50.00, we will cover the entire liability for you, up to the full $50.00. We will only cover this liability if the unauthorized use of your credit card resulted through no fault of your own from purchases made on our website while using the secure server.
In the event of unauthorized use of your credit card, you must notify your credit card provider in accordance with its reporting rules and procedures.

Shipping Information
We use UPS for most of our shipments. We want you to get your products as fast as possible and in excellent condition. That is why we normally use UPS - the leader in the package delivery business to get you your order as soon as possible. 98% of our orders get to our customers within 4 - 5 business days. Remember, none of the major package delivery carriers (UPS included) deliver on the weekends.
Depending on the size of your package and its destination, we may at our discretion ship your order via another carrier.
We do have a few restrictions on our shipping. We cannot ship to Puerto Rico, P.O. Boxes or to APO/FPO addresses. We can ship to Hawaii - 2nd Day UPS Air. We currently do not ship to Mexico, Canada or anywhere outside North America. We reserve the right to add shipping expense onto orders that are special case orders - this is very rare, but we needed to state it here and we would advise you of these charges at the time of your order. If you have any questions about our shipping policies - please do not hesitate to call us.
Special free freight offers are available and are valid on most orders.  Some oversized items and truck shipments may have additional charges applied.  Again, we will advise you at the time of your order of any exceptions.
All truck freight shipments must be shipped to a commercial business address.  Truck shipments to residential addresses will have additional service charges applied.
Refused shipments that we have not been notified of in advance will be charged for outbound and return freight charges and may require additional handling charges of up to 15%.

About Us
ReeseHitches.com is a Midwest based, family owned business that specializes in trailer hitches and towing products for light duty to heavy duty applications. Our company opened for business in 1957 as a manufacturer of trailer hitches and has grown to become an ISO 9001-2008 certified company and a leading supplier of hitches, trailer parts and truck accessories to customers throughout North America. Unlike some other e-commerce sites, we are not just marketers of other company's products who take your order and then drop ship those products to you. We stock everything we sell on this website. That means faster service, better order fill and tighter quality control.
Choosing the right trailer hitch can be a real challenge and having someone to guide you through that process can be a great help. The professional customer service team here at ReeseHitches.com is here to help. Give us a call or drop us an email and we'll be happy to put our years of experience and hands-on product knowledge to work for you. 
Thanks for stopping by. If you don't find what you're looking for please let us know. We have access to thousands of hard-to-find parts available from leading manufacturers throughout the world. Our friendly and courteous staff will be happy to help you find whatever you need.
We are an independent authorized dealer for Reese products, not affiliated with Horizon Global Corp.

Cancel or Change Your Order
If you need to cancel or change your order please contact us as soon as possible to do so. 
If you need to cancel your order after it is already been shipped to you - we will need to work with you to make sure that your order is cancelled in our system, UPS is notified, and ensure that you "refuse the shipment" from UPS. If UPS actually delivers the product to you, then contact us to work out how we will get the product back from you. You may incur some of the shipping charges to get the products back to us.

Safe Shopping Guarantee
Is it safe to use my credit card on your website?
Yes, shopping on this website is very safe. Every credit card purchase on this web site is covered by our Safe Shopping Guarantee. See Guarantee details below.
Why is this website so safe to shop on?
Safe Technology: Our secure socket layer computer software (SSL) is the industry standard and among the best computer software available today for secure internet transactions. The computer software that we use encrypts your credit card number so that it cannot be read as the information travels over the Internet.
We have been approved by GoDaddy.com as an SSL Secure and Authentic site. GoDaddy.com is one of the Industry Leaders in providing technology that protects your information. We accept all Major Credit Cards on this site – and, to be able to do this we had to pass very stringent security tests to ensure to the Major Credit Card Providers (Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Discover) that your information would be safe and secure on our website.
If you are still not comfortable ordering via the Internet, please call us to place your order with one of our Customer Service Representatives.
Safe Shopping Guarantee Details:
Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, your bank cannot hold you liable for more than $50.00 of fraudulent charges. If your bank does hold you liable for any of this $50.00, we will cover the entire liability for you, up to the full $50.00. We will only cover this liability if the unauthorized use of your credit card resulted through no fault of your own from purchases made on our website while using the secure server.
In the event of unauthorized use of your credit card, you must notify your credit card provider in accordance with its reporting rules and procedures.

Sales Receipts & Invoices
We include a sales receipt in all of the packages that we ship from our Minnesota warehouse. At times, to get your product to you even faster - we will have your package sent to you directly from the manufacturer's warehouse. In this case there will not be a sales receipt / invoice in the package that you will receive. If this happens, please do not hesitate to contact us to get a copy of your invoice. And, always remember that you will receive an email receipt when you place your order with us with all of the details of your order. This is an official receipt for your records.

Shipping Information
We use UPS for most of our shipments. We want you to get your products as fast as possible and in excellent condition. That is why we normally use UPS - the leader in the package delivery business to get you your order as soon as possible. 98% of our orders get to our customers within 4 - 5 business days. Remember, none of the major package delivery carriers (UPS included) deliver on the weekends.
Depending on the size of your package and its destination, we may at our discretion ship your order via another carrier.
We do have a few restrictions on our shipping. We cannot ship to Puerto Rico, P.O. Boxes or to APO/FPO addresses. We can ship to Hawaii - 2nd Day UPS Air. We currently do not ship to Mexico, Canada or anywhere outside North America. We reserve the right to add shipping expense onto orders that are special case orders - this is very rare, but we needed to state it here and we would advise you of these charges at the time of your order. If you have any questions about our shipping policies - please do not hesitate to call us.
Special free freight offers are available and are valid on most orders.  Some oversized items and truck shipments may have additional charges applied.  Again, we will advise you at the time of your order of any exceptions.
All truck freight shipments must be shipped to a commercial business address.  Truck shipments to residential addresses will have additional service charges applied.
Refused shipments that we have not been notified of in advance will be charged for outbound and return freight charges and may require additional handling charges of up to 15%.

Why do we ask for your phone number?
