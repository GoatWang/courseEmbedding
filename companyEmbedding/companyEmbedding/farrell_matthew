Since I've had some major life changes in the past 2 years (marriage, new job) I decided to invest in professional preparation this year - and boy was it worth it! I met with Anil briefly for a free consultation. He quickly skimmed my tax info and gave me a price on the spot. A few days later - I've got my completed return and the peace of mind that someone who knows a lot more than me has taken care of the whole mess on my behalf. What more could you ask for?Highlights:-They automatically assess your situation to see if filing separately or jointly is best if your married.-They have a secure online system to exchange documents after the preparation. This means no sensitive info is exchanged over email - and if you want, your only trip to the office is the initial consultation!-They work extended hours in the evening to accommodate nine-to-fivers.-Anil is super nice, straightforward and responds quickly to email.Lalit Abichandani CPA "Your Tax Advisor"Lalit A. ratedLalit Abichandani CPA has been our accountant for over 20 years. He is extremely knowledgeable in all aspects of Tax, Accounting and Legal Issues in running a business. His clarity of thought and deep understanding of business issues help him offer great solutions to any business question or problem. We have a long-standing trust in his thought leadership, and always seem to go with his recommendations. The responsiveness and excellence in quality of services provided by him and his team members have made it a pleasure to work with them over the last two decades. I would recommend him without hesitation. Mohit S.212 Tax & Accounting ServiceseJesse F. ratedAs a professional young artist in New York City, I needed a trusted firm to handle setting up my LLC and help me with the many questions I had. After some research I found 212 Tax Services. They handled setting up my LLC with such care and patience that I also asked if they could handle my taxes for the year. Their services have eased my mind and made tax season run so smoothly.  I recently got married as well and now my wife and I have 212 Tax services to help us in our growing future. 212 Tax & Accounting ServiceseBarbara S. ratedAs a self-employed expat living in Europe, my finances are fairly tricky, but 212 Tax & Accounting Services went out of their way to check international tax law and make sure my taxes were in order – not an easy task in my case! It’s a huge relief knowing that I’ve found professionals who know what they’re doing and whom I can trust. They’ve helped me file my taxes for several years now and I am very satisfied. Highly recommended whether you’re in the NY area or even overseas.212 Tax & Accounting ServiceseBálint P. rated2015 tax year was a big year for us with my wife, we just got married and we changed jobs as well, with an extra hint of complexity of working in all states in the tri-state area and living in NYC. There was no standard way to handle the joint filing together we wanted someone who we can trust. Anil and the 212 Tax & Accounting team was very helpful, extremely professional, secure and efficient in delivering our tax returns. I highly recommend them!212 Tax & Accounting ServiceseErin C. ratedI used 212 Tax for my personal taxes this year, and can't recommend Anil and his team (especially Wendy) highly enough. I came to them with a somewhat complex tax situation, and they were able to handle it very professionally and with ease. They worked quickly and were very responsive via email, phone and in person whenever I had questions. Look forward to using them again next year.212 Tax & Accounting ServiceseLawrence T. ratedI can't say enough great things about Anil and his team at 212 Tax Services. With easy-to-use worksheets for expenses and expenditures, 212 Tax Services always make my taxes easy to understand. They even e-file and automatically pay my taxes for me, which is a huge convenience when it comes to this busy time of year. I would highly recommend.212 Tax & Accounting Serviceserlreardon ratedThey did a fantastic job. They...They did a fantastic job. They turned my return over a weekend (the weekend before taxes were due also) and required little input from me. It was so great to be able to hand over this knowing that I was in safe hands. Thanks very much!212 Tax & Accounting Servicesejoshdi ratedArmel Tax is one of the best accounting firms I have ever used. They were very professional, knowledgeable about my specific tax situation and finished my return extremely quickly. I would gladly use them again!Lall & Associates PCAndrew D. ratedBest law firm.. All office workers (Lawyers) are very approachable. They made me feel at ease and they will make you feel that they care for you and will not let you down. Highly Recommended.

Matt Farrell to be Promoted to Church & Dwight CEO in 2016

Jim Craigie to Continue as Non-Executive Chairman

 EWING, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 7, 2015--
      The Board of Directors of Church & Dwight Co., Inc. (NYSE:CHD) today
      announced that, effective January 1, 2016, James R. Craigie will retire
      from the position of Chief Executive Officer. He will continue serving
      as non-executive Chairman and a member of the board. Matthew T. Farrell,
      the Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, will be
      promoted to Chief Executive Officer and elected to the company’s Board
      of Directors.
    

      “Jim Craigie has served as CEO since he joined the company in 2004 and
      as chairman and CEO since 2007. Jim has done a superb job throughout his
      tenure, growing the business with a focus on new product innovation,
      accretive acquisitions, and total shareholder return. Jim has assembled
      an excellent management team and the Company is well-positioned for the
      future,” said Robert D. LeBlanc, the lead director of the board. “I’m
      very pleased that the board and management’s focus on succession
      planning have enabled us to have such a well-respected leader as Matt
      ready to fill the CEO role, and that we have the opportunity to have an
      orderly transition in our leadership while Jim continues on the Board.”
    

      “Matt Farrell has been our Chief Financial Officer since he joined the
      company in 2006 and has held the position of Chief Operating Officer
      since November 2014. I have worked very closely with Matt for the past
      eight years and know that he is exactly the right person to be our next
      CEO,” Craigie said. “Matt has the strategic thinking, leadership
      ability, and devotion to execution necessary to lead Church & Dwight
      into the future.”
    

      “I am honored to have the opportunity to lead this great company and
      continue our strategy of creating shareholder value through innovation
      and accretive acquisitions,” Farrell said. “Church & Dwight people
      possess a unique blend of creativity, initiative, and work ethic. We
      have a veteran leadership team and terrific brands. This is a winning
      formula for employees, consumers, and shareholders and gives me great
      confidence in our future success.”
