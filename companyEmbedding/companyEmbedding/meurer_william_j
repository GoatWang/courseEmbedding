Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Kentucky:













Does William J Meurer carry a valid contracting license?



Although the state of Kentucky does not require contractors to be licensed, local jurisdictions may have stricter regulations governing licensing. 
William J Meurer currently holds license ME23209, 0120 (Electrician, Enrolled), which was Active when we last checked. 











Your liability risk when hiring William J Meurer



Kentucky does not require contractors to carry general liability or workers' compensation insurance. Regardless, it is advisable to hire contractors with active policies for both forms of insurance. Be sure to request a copy of the insurance certificates for your records.











Financial recourse when hiring William J Meurer



Kentucky does not require contractors to obtain a surety bond. Homeowners can file complaints with the Kentucky Office of the Attorney General's Consumer Protection department.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work.You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Kentucky, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid,they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.
