Zomedica Pharmaceuticals Corp. Announces Executive Changes
Jul 10 17
Zomedica Pharmaceuticals Corp. announced that Bruk Herbst has joined the company as Chief Commercial Officer. In this new company position, he is responsible for delivering and executing Zomedica's commercial strategy, as well as leading the company's business groups across multiple functional areas, including sales, marketing, and customer support and service operations. Prior to joining Zomedica, Herbst was the Executive Senior Vice President of Sales and Marketing at i4C Innovations. Before that, he served as Executive Senior Director and Head of U.S. Sales at IDEXX Laboratories, where he was responsible for in-clinic and reference lab diagnostics, point of care solutions, and information technologies and digital radiography solutions. Herbst also held commercial leadership roles in patient monitoring, pharmacy and diagnostics with Omnicare Specialty Care Group and Life Systems. Concurrently, Chief Operations Officer Stephanie Morley, DVM, will transition into a dual role of Chief Operations Officer and Vice President of Product Development. Morley will lead the company's veterinary and innovation strategies, product development activities, research and development, as well as facilitate new business opportunities to ensure the delivery of affordable, high quality veterinary products by aligning customer needs, translational technologies, and corporate objectives. To further enhance its customer-centric mission, Zomedica recently formed a seven-member veterinary advisory committee comprised of four veterinarians, two licensed veterinary technicians/nurses, and one hospital administrator from various geographic regions across the United States. This committee will function as a dedicated focus group for Zomedica to extend its in-house voice of customer representation with respect to product development, technology evaluation and acquisition, marketing and sales, industry best practices, and more. Additionally, William C. MacArthur, MS, DVM, has retired as Chief Medical Officer.

Gerald 
	Solensky, Jr.


	President & Chief Executive Officer

 


	Zomedica Pharmaceuticals Corp.
	(TSX-V:ZOM)

www.zomedica.com

 


	Interview conducted by:


	Lynn Fosse, Senior Editor, CEOCFO Magazine, Published  October 17, 2016

 


CEOCFO:
Mr. Solensky, would you tell us about Zomedica Pharmaceuticals?


Mr. Solensky: 
	Our focus is to improve worldwide companion animal health by increasing the 
	number of successful veterinarians on the planet. We believe that pet health 
	is dependent upon vet health so we are focusing on the unmet needs of 
	clinical veterinarians, sometimes referred to as small animal veterinarians 
	that predominately care for dogs and cats.

 


CEOCFO: 
	Are there specific needs based on the characteristics of companion animals?


Mr. Solensky: 
	Well right now, 41% of drugs found in the veterinarians pharmacy cabinet 
	are FDA Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) approved animal drugs. The 
	remaining 59% are unapproved animal drugs, meaning approved human drugs used 
	off label. This reliance on human drugs leads to issues with 
	safety/efficacy, patient compliance, price, and availability when treating 
	pet patients. Were working to create a FDA-CVM approved drug pipeline that 
	will address all of these issues and support the high medical standards of 
	veterinarians. And there is a need for new solutions, or new tools, such as 
	devices and diagnostics, which can positively impact the standard of care 
	while giving vets the opportunity to lower costs, increase productivity and 
	grow revenue.

 


CEOCFO: 
	That is a tall order, how are you doing this?


Mr. Solensky: 
	One of the primary areas Zomedica has differentiated itself from our 
	competition is by having clinical or practicing veterinarians as members of 
	our executive leadership team to represent the voice of the customer. These 
	customer advocates help ensure that our product pipeline reflects the needs 
	of the veterinarians while also considering market requirements and our 
	corporate objectives. And so, we are building a diversified portfolio of 
	products comprised of the discovery, development and commercialization of 
	innovative drugs alongside novel drug delivery systems, devices and 
	diagnostics. To help us identify products and services that are economically 
	and professionally beneficial, we are developing a Voice of the VetTM 
	program as the mechanism for integrating veterinary customers into the 
	product development lifecycle.

 


CEOCFO: 
	What might you learn and what have you learned, having veterinarians so 
	closely involved that might have been overlooked in the past?


Mr. Solensky: 
	A great example that I learned as we developed Zomedicas business strategy 
	is that clinical veterinarians are dealing with compassion fatigue, margin 
	pressures, disproportionate student debt and other factors that impact their 
	professional and personal satisfaction. Moreover, statistics show an 
	alarmingly high risk of suicide in the veterinary profession, possibly 
	attributed to these aforementioned challenges. While these challenges are 
	widely talked about within the veterinary community, it is not widespread 
	knowledge with the larger population or even amongst pet owners.

 


CEOCFO: 
	What are you working on right now?


Mr. Solensky: 
	We are always focused on building a business and the most important asset of 
	the business is its people. Our C level executives and senior management 
	team are making sure that we achieve our milestones and benchmarks per our 
	strategic plan. What we have accomplished since going public are on pare 
	with expectations.

ˇ        
	
We have 
	opened two Investigational New Animal Drug Applications with the FDA Center 
	of Veterinarian Medicine for ZM-006 targeting a metabolic disorder and 
	ZM-012, an anti-infective.

ˇ        
	
We filed for 
	a provisional application for patent for a novel formulation of ZM-006.

ˇ        
	
We have 
	entered into a joint research collaboration with CTX Technology, Inc. with 
	the intent to develop IP for alternative drug delivery technology.

ˇ        
	
We are 
	actively looking at in-licensing and M&A opportunities involving appropriate 
	technologies for introduction into the veterinary space.

ˇ        
	
In the near 
	future we will launch our Voice of the VetTM program.

ˇ        
	
We are 
	investigating opportunities to cross-list to a U.S. exchange.

 


CEOCFO: 
	Would you tell us about the novel drug delivery system?


Mr. Solensky: 
	Depending on the path by which a drug is taken into the animals body there 
	could be side effects, and/or it could be challenging to administer, both of 
	which can affect a drugs effectiveness. Our novel drug delivery technology 
	will be a new approach for delivering a pharmaceutical compound so it can 
	safely achieve its desire therapeutic effect. In other words, a new way to 
	dose an animal.

 


CEOCFO: 
	What is wrong with the way delivery is done now?


Mr. Solensky: 
	Its not that the current delivery method is wrong. Many drugs are 
	formulated in a way that minimizes effectiveness because the dosage form or 
	route of delivery is not ideal for the animal. In human medicine, I like to 
	equate this to giving an infant a pill to swallowits not ideal for a 
	number of reasons. We have taken a strong look at that from the veterinary 
	perspective and how it can be improved considering the varying species and 
	size of animals.

 


CEOCFO: Is 
	it easy to get veterinarians attentions as compared to human medicine?


Mr. Solensky: 
	I think its important to understand that veterinary medicine is very 
	different than human medicine for a number of reasons such as:

ˇ        
	
Veterinarians 
	serve as both clinician and pharmacist

ˇ        
	
Veterinarians 
	treat multiple species of variable sizes

ˇ        
	
And cost of 
	care in veterinary medicine is often not subsidized by third-party payers

 

I will say, 
	veterinarians are extremely hard workers. They work long hours, its a 
	physically demanding job, it requires vets to get dirty, and there is never 
	enough time in the day. Throw in some compassion fatigue and moral stress 
	caused by ethical dilemmas and you can start to see how it becomes 
	challenging to be the best doctor, the best pharmacist, and operate a 
	profitable practice all at the same time.

 


CEOCFO: 
	What is the plan for gaining interest from the veterinarian community?


Mr. Solensky: 
	The Voice of the VetTM program that we are rolling out in 
	the near future is one that we hope will capture the attention of our 
	veterinary customers. I would say that in order to build brand awareness we 
	need to emphasize that we are clinical vets creating products for clinical 
	vets. And once we have their attention, its imperative to deliver solutions 
	and tools that positively impact the animals in their care and clinic 
	operations.

 


CEOCFO: 
	What was the reaction when Zomedica became a public company?


Mr. Solensky: 
	We were one of the fastest veterinary pharmaceutical companies to evolve 
	from formation to public listing on a North American exchange. To do this, 
	we were able to accelerate the customary pathways to entering the capital 
	markets here in the United States by going through Canada. By listing first 
	in Canada on the TSX Venture Exchange:

ˇ        
	
We were able 
	to capitalize on the currency exchange that has been favorable for United 
	States shareholders in the Canadian marketplace.

ˇ        
	
It was a 
	prime opportunity for a life sciences company to access an accredited, 
	sophisticated and diversified investor base within a market saturated by the 
	oil/gas/mining industries.

ˇ        
	
We were able 
	to maintain a tremendous amount of competitive advantage by accelerating our 
	capital market strategy via an international environment prior to launch in 
	the United States. 

 

We are new, 
	and that newness generates a lot of curious interest in wanting to know what 
	Zomedica is all about and where we are going. Just like with any other 
	sophisticated or accredited investor appetite within the investment 
	community, they want to make sure we are a legitimate and credible 
	organization. I think we have been transparent in our dealings with both the 
	exchange and investor community. And I believe we will be an organization to 
	be looking out for in the near future.

 


CEOCFO: 
	What was the genesis of the company?


Mr. Solensky: 
	The genesis started back in 2011 following a lengthy career in the banking 
	industry followed by a stretch as a turn-around CEO. I started to explore a 
	possible career change in veterinary medicine because of my desire to be a 
	veterinarian as a child. After shadowing a mentor of mine for about six 
	months, completing eight hundred hours of observation time, I started to 
	recognize the issues that challenge todays veterinarians. Some of these 
	points I previously mentioned such as compassion fatigue, margin pressures 
	and disproportionate student debt which impacts veterinarians both 
	personally and professionally. I thought there was a niche for something 
	that could combine my finance and business background with the world of 
	science and animal medicine. I started by building the most important asset, 
	the team, starting with William MacArthur, MS, DVM, our Chief Medical 
	Officer and Director of R&D who has a rather senior and well pedigreed 
	background and is a biotech expert. Next on board was Stephanie Morley, DVM, 
	our Chief Operations Officer who previously served as a clinical 
	veterinarian; she also brought a tremendous amount of value-add in the 
	business strategy of the organization. And together, we started to form the 
	core business principles with the goal of building a company that would be 
	recognized in our space as an industry leader. I am fortunate and grateful 
	to be part of this team.

 


CEOCFO: 
	What surprised you so far?


Mr. Solensky: 
	What surprised me was realizing the truth of the ever cliché phrase the joy 
	is in the journey and the roller coaster ride that ensues when people are 
	inspired and buy into a shared vision. My vision and passion was due to my 
	desire to pursue something in the animal health world and to shake up things 
	in challenging the process along the way. My fortune was finding those team 
	members that share the same vision and passion. I think a lot of what weve 
	accomplished in the past year and our success has been by building an 
	organizational culture that believes in our purpose and continuously 
	challenges the status quo.

 


CEOCFO: 
	Why should investors and pet owners pay attention to Zomedica?


Mr. Solensky: 
	Investors should pay attention because the companion animal market for 
	pharmaceuticals, biologicals and parasiticides was an estimated US$9.8 
	billion with Westernized areas such as North America, Europe and Japan 
	representing the greatest market opportunity. The United States is the 
	single largest companion animal market on the planet at an estimated US$4.2 
	billion. To be in on an early-stage growth organization like ours with a 
	company built around people who have the ability to execute, I think most 
	investors would want to participate and be long-term shareholders for its 
	ROI opportunity. 

 

While our 
	target market is the veterinarian, pet owners might be interested to know 
	that we are targeting products proven safe and effective for their 
	four-legged friends that have not typically been offered in the past. At the 
	end of the day, I think that our investors that have embarked on this 
	journey with us will be rewarded and are looking forward to what the future 
	will bring for Zomedica.

For the three months ended March 31, 2016, the loss was attributed to R&D expenses of $222,712, G&A expenses of $452,521 and professional fees of $244,837.G&A expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2017 were $827,025 compared to $452,521 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to the ramping up of business, as ZoMedica Pharmaceuticals Inc. was incorporated on May 14, 2015. The majority of these current period expenses related to the addition of personnel accounting for salaries of $556,863, which included share-based compensation expense of $161,591 primarily as a result of the granting of options to purchase an aggregate of 535,000 shares of common shares in February 2017 that all vested immediately upon the date of grant. Other expenses included travel and accommodation of $78,342 and rent of $43,621. Zomedica expects G&A expenditures in 2017 and future periods will be higher as activity levels increase.Expenditures for R&D for the three months ended March 31, 2017 were $616,449 compared to $221,712 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to the ramping up of R&D activities related to the establishment of labs, the hiring of full-time employees, new product candidates development, and contracted outsourcing activities. The increases were primarily due to contracted outsourced activities of $247,845, salaries of $170,912, and consulting fees of $92,444 relating to an increased level of lab activities, including in vitro and in vivo work, to support the further development of its product candidates ZM-012, ZM-006, ZM-007 and ZM-011, as well as research testing the feasibility of the liquid biopsy technology for veterinary application as a canine cancer diagnostic.The Company expects R&D expenditures in 2017 will be significantly higher than in 2016, due to the initiation of pilot and pivotal studies to support the opened INADs, as well as work related to additional veterinary pharmaceutical candidates, diagnostic developments and technologies.Professional fees for the three months ended March 31 2017 were $381,536 compared to $244,837 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to expenses in connection with the preparation of Form S-1 relating to the resale or other disposition by selling shareholder, and initiating the approval process for listing on the NYSE MKT.Liquidity and Outstanding Share CapitalZomedica had cash of $1,767,035 as at March 31, 2017 compared to $3,226,680 as at December 31, 2016.

For the three months ended March 31, 2017, cash flows used in operating activities amounted to $1,553,802. The largest use of cash within the operating activities in the current period was employees’ wages and benefits, and various consultants related to the preparation of Form S-1 relating to the resale or other disposition by selling shareholders.Read MoreAs at March 31, 2017, Zomedica had an unlimited number of authorized common shares with 84,418,182 common shares issued and outstanding.
