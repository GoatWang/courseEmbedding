EDTECH 


 








Our training solutions teach students, and workers in the private and public sectors around the world how to listen and understand English in all forms of technical communication – reading, writing, listening and speaking.
ELL Technologies’ product suite offers:

Contextual-based training – to master the nuances of different cultures, business and living environments
Achievement tests to reinforce learning, measure progress and practice skills
Compliance with SCORM – for easy integration and reporting
Many levels of dynamic, vibrant and interactive lessons from kindergarten students to adult learners












MEETING CHANGE WITH INNOVATION
Lingo Media has been continually acquiring, developing and refining flexible and innovative English language learning solutions to meet the changing needs of language learning. Our diverse range of educational products include fully online or computer-based lessons and activities, enrichment features, print materials, teachers’ materials, and sophisticated assessment tools.





RESULTS THAT MATTER
Through our courses, more than 20 million learners in more than 10 countries have significantly improved their English language skills. They are connecting and communicating with other English speakers around the world.

















SPEECH RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY
One of the biggest challenges in learning to speak English can be limited opportunity to interact with other English speakers. Our virtual conversation tool in our Speaking Lab enables learners to participate in a simulated scenario with an avatar before engaging in a conversation with a real life partner. This unique technology can only be found in our programs.

Lingo Media: Going Global


Lingo Media is committed to preparing graduates for the international workplace and to helping faculty advance an intercultural perspective. That’s why we’re building partnerships with institutions from around the world. We also benefit from being located in Toronto, one of the world’s most ethnically diverse centres of trade, culture and commerce. This proximity to a multicultural community provides invaluable practical experience in the creation of lesson plans and teaching ideas.
For those that missed it recently, Gale, a leading provider of research and education resources to libraries and an arm of Cengage Learning, has entered into a commercial distribution partnership with ELL Technologies Ltd., a subsidiary of Lingo Media. Through the agreement, Gale will have exclusive international rights to market, sell and distribute ELL Technologies’ Scholar English language training program to university and college libraries, public libraries, and private schools. The product will be co-branded as Gale Lingo and will be available in the second quarter of 2016.
“Gale’s focus is to create products that incorporate content with global relevance and appeal from our vast network of partnerships with leading institutions around the world,” said Terry Robinson, senior vice-president and managing director of Gale International. “Given that many advanced scholarly research pursuits in higher education today are conducted in English, there is an increasing demand globally for students to learn English and, with this new distribution agreement, we are pleased to broaden our offering by bringing to the library market the innovative learning techniques that Scholar provides.”
With its scale, educational publishing expertise, and existing relationships in international and domestic markets, Gale brings tremendous value to Lingo Media, particularly in the higher education space. It enables us to expand the reach and impact of our mission to Change the way the world learns English.

LMDCF Maintains Scalability for Continued Product Relevance and Growth   The need to understand and use English increases each day across the globe. Lingo Media Corp. meets this demand by developing online and print technologies to help people learn the language. So far, the company established a strong relationship with China’s education system, helping 300 million students, and seeks to expand its reach to Latin America.    Lingo Media uses two business units, ELL Technologies and Lingo Learning, to teach English from kindergarten to adulthood. The first is a virtual software that provides contextual-based training, achievement tests, and interactive lessons to users. The other offers print educational texts that make teaching easier while offering 350 program titles that can suit any eager student.    For continued success, the company assures its scalability in the EdTech industry. The benefits of its electronically based coursework start with its real-time reporting and feedback of progress while dealing with the tedious parts of teaching so educators can focus on the important intellectual areas. For continued scalability, both Lingo Media’s programs can be accessed across many devices and therefore can be used across the world. Part of Lingo Media’s scalability is the assurance that software can run in any environment while adapting to all skill levels. Kindergartners and adults alike have benefited from these programs. The company also takes feedback from customers so that lessons are continuously updated to keep content relevant.    Lingo Media strives to develop its electronic learning resources while expanding its market. It believes that English can break down global barriers that may hinder development and business relationships. Both ELL Technologies and Lingo Learning provide educational tools that people of all ages can benefit. The company’s scalability factors into its goals of advancing education and expanding its brand.    For more information, please visit www.lingomedia.com
