Development



LefamulinNabriva is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company engaged in the research and development of novel antibiotics to treat serious infections, with a focus on the pleuromutilin class of antibiotics. Nabriva is developing is lead product candidate, lefamulin, to be the first pleuromutilin antibiotic available for systemic administration in humans. We are developing both intravenous (IV) and oral formulations of lefamulin for the treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) and intend to develop lefamulin for additional indications other than pneumonia.Lefamulin is a semi-synthetic compound that inhibits the synthesis of bacterial protein, which is required for bacteria to grow. Lefamulin acts by binding to the peptidyl transferase center, or PTC, on the bacterial ribosome in such a way that it interferes with the interaction of protein production at two key sites known as the “A” site and the “P” site, resulting in the inhibition of bacterial proteins and the cessation of bacterial growth. Lefamulin’s binding occurs with high affinity, high specificity and at molecular sites that are different than other antibiotic classes.
We believe the preclinical studies and clinical trials we have conducted to date suggest that lefamulin’s novel mechanism of action is responsible for the lack of cross resistance observed with other antibiotic classes and may result in slow development of bacterial resistance to lefamulin over time. As a result of the favorable safety and tolerability profile we have observed in our clinical trials to date, we believe lefamulin will present fewer potential complications relative to the use of current therapies. Based on our research, we also believe that the availability of both intravenous (IV) and oral formulations of lefamulin, and an option to switch to oral treatment, could reduce the length of a patient’s hospital stay and the overall cost of care. Nabriva owns exclusive, worldwide rights to lefamulin.
Attributes that make lefamulin well suited for use as a first-line empiric monotherapy for the treatment of CABP include:Novel mechanism of actionTargeted spectrum of activity covering key CABP pathogens, including against multi-drug resistant pathogensPotential for slow development of bacterial resistance over timeAchievement of substantial drug concentrations in lung tissue and fluidsConvenient dosing regimen – potential for switching from IV to oral treatmentFavorable safety and tolerability profileWe intend to further pursue the development of lefamulin for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) and are developing a formulation of lefamulin that is appropriate for pediatric use. We believe that lefamulin’s product profile also provides the opportunity to expand to additional indications beyond pneumonia, such as sexually transmitted infections (STIs), ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (VABP), hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia (HABP), osteomyelitis and prosthetic joint infections.BC-7013BC-7013 is a semi-synthetic compound derived from pleuromutilin with the potential to be developed for the topical treatment of Gram-positive infections, including uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections (uSSIs). We have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial for BC-7013.Research ProgramOur pleuromutilin research program is based on our large and diverse proprietary compound library. We believe that our expertise in the areas of medicinal chemistry, pharmacology and toxicology have enabled targeted discovery of novel pleuromutilins through modification of side chains and core positions in the mutilin moiety. These modifications have resulted in alterations in microbial activity, ADME and toxicity of the semi-synthetic molecules.
 
We are actively pursuing an in-house discovery program to sustain our pipeline with future product candidates. The aim of this program is the development of novel pleuromutilins with enhanced affinity for the bacterial ribosome directed at increasing the antimicrobial potency and broadening the spectrum of activity to include rare strains with known mechanisms of resistance to the pleuromutilin class (e.g. cfr or Vga mutants). We believe next generation pleuromutlins have the potential to exhibit improved antibacterial activity and a pharmacokinetic profile that may make them well suited for the treatment of respiratory tract infections, acute/complicated bacterial skin infections, sexually transmitted infections and biothreat organisms.

Nabriva - Overview

Overview



Meeting the demand for new antibioticsNabriva is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company engaged in the research and development of novel antibiotics to treat serious infections, with a focus on the pleuromutilin class of antibiotics. Our goal is to become a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company focused on the research, development and commercialization of novel anti-infective products. The key elements of our strategy to achieve this goal are to:complete Phase 3 clinical development of lefamulin for CABP;maximize the commercial potential of lefamulin for CABP;pursue the continued development of lefamulin in additional indications;advance the development of other pleuromutilin product candidates and possibly compounds in other classes; andevaluate business development opportunities and potential collaborations with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies.LefamulinNabriva is developing its lead product candidate, lefamulin, to be the first pleuromutilin antibiotic available for systemic administration in humans. We are developing both intravenous (IV) and oral formulations of lefamulin for the treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) and intend to develop lefamulin for additional indications other than pneumonia.
Nabriva’s lead pleuromutilin product candidate, lefamulin, is being studied in two global, registrational Phase 3 clinical trials for the treatment of moderate to severe CABP. We believe that lefamulin is well suited for use as a first-line empiric monotherapy for the treatment of CABP because of its novel mechanism of action; spectrum of activity, including against multi-drug resistant pathogens; achievement of substantial drug concentrations in lung tissue and fluids; availability as both an intravenous (IV) and oral formulation; and favorable safety and tolerability profile.
We have completed a Phase 2 clinical trial for acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI), in which IV lefamulin achieved a high cure rate against multi-drug resistant Gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). In addition, in preclinical studies, lefamulin showed potent antibacterial activity against a variety of Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria and atypical bacteria, including multi-drug resistant strains.
The preclinical studies and clinical trials we have conducted to date suggest that lefamulin’s novel mechanism of action is responsible for the lack of cross resistance observed with other antibiotic classes and may result in slow development of bacterial resistance to lefamulin over time. As a result of the favorable safety and tolerability profile we have observed in our clinical trials to date, we believe lefamulin will present fewer potential complications relative to the use of current therapies.BC‑7013Through our research and development efforts, we have identified a topical pleuromutilin product candidate, BC-7013, for which we have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial. We believe that this pleuromutilin compound is well suited for the topical treatment of a variety of Gram-positive infections, including uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections (uSSSIs).Research ProgramOur pleuromutilin research program is based on our large and diverse proprietary compound library. We believe that our expertise in the areas of medicinal chemistry, pharmacology and toxicology have enabled targeted discovery of novel pleuromutilins through modification of side chains and core positions in the mutilin moiety. These modifications have resulted in alterations in microbial activity, ADME and toxicity of the semi-synthetic molecules.
 We are actively pursuing an in-house discovery program to sustain our pipeline with future product candidates. The aim of this program is the development of novel pleuromutilins with enhanced affinity for the bacterial ribosome directed at increasing the antimicrobial potency and broadening the spectrum of activity to include rare strains with known mechanisms of resistance to the pleuromutilin class (e.g. cfr or Vga mutants). We believe next generation pleuromutlins have the potential to exhibit improved antibacterial activity and a pharmacokinetic profile that may make them well suited for the treatment of respiratory tract infections, acute/complicated bacterial skin infections, sexually transmitted infections and biothreat organisms.Corporate HistoryNabriva was incorporated as a spin-off from Sandoz GmbH Antibiotics Research Institute (ABRI) in Vienna, Austria and commenced operations in February 2006. The new organization included small molecule assets, including pleuromutilin structure activity relationships (SAR) knowledge and was focused on synthesis of pleuromutilins for systemic human use.  Following identification of our lead compound lefamulin and based on the clinical results of lefamulin for Acute Skin and Skin Structure Infections (ABSSSI), we believed that targeted in vitro spectrum of activity for the common pathogens causing Community Acquired Bacterial Pneumonia (CABP), would allow us to develop lefamulin as the first pleuromutilin IV and oral antibiotic for human systemic administration for CABP.  
In 2014, we opened our US office in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania and completed an IPO on the NASDAQ under the ticker NBRV in September 2015. With net proceeds from our IPO, we initiated two global, registrational Phase 3 clinical trials of lefamulin for the treatment of moderate to severe CABP. 
Based on our estimates regarding patient enrollment, we expect to have top-line data available for the LEAP 1 trial in the third quarter of 2017.  Additionally, based on current projections, we continue to expect to complete patient enrollment for LEAP 2 in the fourth quarter of 2017 and anticipate receiving top-line data for LEAP 2 in the first quarter of 2018. If the results of these trials are favorable, including achievement of the primary efficacy endpoints of the trials, we expect to submit applications for marketing approval for lefamulin for the treatment of CABP in both the United States and Europe in the second half of 2018.
As of March 15, 2017 Nabriva employed 59 employees at its headquarters in Dublin, Ireland and at its locations in Vienna, Austria and King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, United States.

We love IPOs
The IPO market provides a magical window into the most exciting technologies, emerging consumer trends and important business developments - all testing their mettle in the crucible of the public markets. We are constantly learning and researching to deliver the best insights available.










We are independent
We have no vested interests driving our work. All the investment banks and brokers on a deal are paid to do a sales and marketing job. Our job is to remain objective and use a fact-based approach to evaluate the potential for an IPO.










We get the best ratings
IPO Candy has been recognized since 2009 as the single best place to get commentary, analysis and assets in the IPO market. The most common write-in comment we get from users is that they "love what we do."










We share everything we know
With three decades of research under our belt we want to share what we have learned and the best practices we have discovered. Our IPO University contains texts, videos and resources to share our process and help everyone develop their skills.
