The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Dow industrials nail first support, S&P 500 digests the technical breakout
U.S. stocks are slightly higher early Wednesday, digesting the mid-2017 technical breakout ahead of Thursday’s ECB policy directive, U.K. general election, and scheduled political testimony in the U.S.  Against this backdrop, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has effectively nailed first support (and drawn buyers), while the S&P 500’s corresponding pullback remains conspicuously flat.

          Lumentum Holdings Inc. Announces Pricing of $400 Million Convertible Notes Offering         










MILPITAS, Calif., March  03, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lumentum Holdings Inc. (“Lumentum”) (NASDAQ:LITE) today announced the pricing of $400 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2024 (the “notes”) in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act").  The size of the offering was increased from the previously announced $350 million in aggregate principal amount.  Lumentum granted the initial purchasers of the notes a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional $50 million aggregate principal amount of the notes, solely to cover over-allotments, if any.  The sale of the notes to the initial purchasers is expected to settle on March 8, 2017, subject to customary closing conditions, and is expected to result in approximately $393.3 million in net proceeds to Lumentum after deducting the initial purchasers’ discount and estimated offering expenses payable by Lumentum (assuming no exercise of the initial purchasers’ option).
The notes will be senior, unsecured obligations of Lumentum.  The notes will bear interest at a rate of 0.250% per year.  Interest will be payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on September 15, 2017.  The notes will mature on March 15, 2024, unless earlier repurchased or converted.
Lumentum intends to use the net proceeds of the offering for general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures, including manufacturing capacity expansion, and working capital.
The initial conversion rate for the notes is 16.4965 shares of Lumentum common stock (“common stock”) per $1,000 principal amount of notes (which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $60.62 per share) and is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events.  Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding December 15, 2023, the notes will be convertible at the option of the noteholders upon satisfaction of specified conditions and during certain periods.  Thereafter, until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day preceding the maturity date, the notes will be convertible at the option of the noteholders at any time regardless of these conditions.  Conversions of the notes will be settled in cash, shares of common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, with the form of consideration at Lumentum’s election.  However, the notes will not be convertible into Lumentum’s common stock, and Lumentum will satisfy its conversion obligation solely in cash, until such time as Lumentum satisfies certain restrictions contained in the indenture for the notes.  The initial conversion price represents a premium of approximately 32.5% over the last reported sale price of Lumentum’s common stock on March 2, 2017 of $45.75 per share.
The notes will be offered to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Act.  Neither the notes nor the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes, if any, have been, nor will be, registered under the Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from such registration requirements.
This announcement is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy any of these securities and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation, or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation, or sale is unlawful.
