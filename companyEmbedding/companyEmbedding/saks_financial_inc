SAKS INCORPORATED Revenue and Financial Data

   Once one of the top US department store operators, Saks Incorporated has retrenched to focus on its luxury Saks Fifth Avenue business. The company dismantled an empire of some 375 middle-market department stores under 10 different banners (including Bergner's, Carson Pirie Scott, and Parisian) to stake its future on a dwindling number of Saks Fifth Avenue stores, while growing its off-price sister chain, Off 5th, and its online business. The divestments positioned the department store chain squarely in the luxury market. Founded in 1919 as Profitt's, the firm bought renowned luxury retailer Saks Holdings and adopted the high-dollar Saks name. Saks is owned by Hudson's Bay Company, owner of Lord & Taylor.

Saks Fifth Ave.-Neiman Marcus Merger Talk Reportedly Hits A Roadblock
May 4 17
Neiman Marcus may soon find itself tangling with a lawsuit instead of a suitor. Merger talks between Neiman Marcus Group, Inc. and the owner of archrival Saks Fifth Avenue, which is Saks Incorporated have hit a roadblock as Neiman faces a possible lawsuit over a recent maneuver to shield three of its stores from creditors. Dallas-based Neiman — which said in March it is weighing a possible sale of the company amid a tanking luxury market — has been courted by Saks Fifth Avenue owner Hudson’s Bay Co., which has been exploring an unusual deal to buy the company without assuming Neiman’s $4.6 billion in debt. But talks between the two have reportedly stalled as Neiman’s term loan lenders and bondholders are weighing a suit over Neiman’s decision in March to move its stores in San Antonio and Longview, Texas, and in McLean, Va., into a subsidiary that protects them from creditors in the event of a bankruptcy


Saks Fifth Avenue OFF 5TH to Open 18th Store in California at Woodland Hills
Aug 3 16
Saks Fifth Avenue OFF 5TH announced the opening of its new store at the Woodland Hills Shopping Centre in Woodland Hills, California, on 4 August 2016. This new 30,000 square foot store is reportedly the company's 18th store in California. This new location will offer sought after fashion brands and one-of-a-kind designer finds, for men, women and kids. Also, new arrivals will be shipped to the store almost daily, providing customers with fresh merchandise every time they shop.


Saks Incorporated Reopens its Saks Off 5th Store
Apr 21 16
Saks Off 5th, the outlet store of the Saks Fifth Avenue, is reopening on April 21, 2016 in downtown Minneapolis, just across the street from a location it closed last year. The decision to close the Minneapolis store was made before Saks was acquired by Hudson's Bay Co. The 40,000-square-foot space will be divided into 24,000 square feet on the street level and 16,000 square feet on the skyway level. That is a bit larger than the 28,000-square-foot Saks Off 5th outpost that anchors Twin Cities Premium Outlets in Eagan. The downtown location will include the same selection of women's, men's and kids apparel and accessories as Eagan, but it will have a larger selection of shoes and handbags.

History[edit]
Proffitt's Inc.[edit]
Proffitt's Inc. began as five Proffitt's stores in the Knoxville, Tennessee metropolitan area. After going public under the symbol PRFT on the NASDAQ stock exchange in 1987, Proffitt's Inc. grew by acquiring several department stores. In 1989 the company purchased 18 Hess's locations in Tennessee, Virginia, Kentucky, and Georgia. From 1994 to 1998, the company added McRae's, Younkers, Parisian, Herberger's, Carson Pirie Scott, Boston Store, and Bergner's chains, as well as additional stores from Loveman's, Parks-Belk, and Brody's, which were converted into existing store nameplates. After acquiring Parisian, Proffitt's relocated its corporate headquarters to Birmingham, Alabama from Knoxville in October 1997. Although the full Saks company no longer has a store in Mississippi, Saks operates its data services from the former McRae's headquarters in Jackson, Mississippi.
Saks, Inc.[edit]
In September 1998, the company acquired the holding company for the luxury retailer Saks Fifth Avenue, Saks Holdings, Inc., and subsequently changed its legal name to Saks, Incorporated. The acquisition brought the Saks Fifth Avenue and Off 5th franchises, as well as Folio, a mail-order business and Saks.com, an online retailer. The former Saks Fifth Avenue properties became the Saks Fifth Avenue Enterprises division of the company with the larger Birmingham-based department store division becoming the Saks Department Store Group. The company's main-line department store group was made up of its Southern Department Store Group: McRae's and Proffitt's,the Northern Department Store Group: Bergner's, Boston Store, Carson Pirie Scott, Herberger's and Younkers, the company's Specialty Department Store Group Parisian, and the company's Saks Fifth Avenue Enterprises which included Saks Fifth Avenue and Off 5th. In 2001, the company recorded record revenues of $6.6 billion, making it a member of the Fortune 500 and one of the largest operators of department stores in the United States. The company was also a primary sponsor of the Bruno's Memorial Classic golf tournament, now known as the Regions Charity Classic. The company moved its headquarters to Midtown Manhattan, New York City in 2007.[4] Several of Saks' management still live in Birmingham. In 2005, vendors filed against Saks alleging unlawful chargebacks. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigated the complaint for years, and according to the New York Times "exposed a tangle of illicit tactics that let Saks ... keep money it owed to clothing makers", inflating Saks' yearly earnings up to 43% and abusively collecting around $30 million from suppliers over seven years.[5] Saks settled with the SEC in 2007, after firing three or more executives involved in the fraudulent activities.[6][5]
Divestments[edit]
By 2005, Saks Incorporated began to seek a narrower focus towards the luxury-oriented retail synonymous with its Saks Fifth Avenue stores. The decision resulted in a July 2005 sale of its combined 47 Proffitt's and McRae's stores to Belk for approximately $622 million.
On October 31 that same year, Saks announced that it was selling the 142 stores within its Northern Department Store Group, including Carson Pirie Scott, Bergner's, Younkers, Herberger's, and Boston Store to Bon-Ton Stores, Inc., for $1.1 billion; the transaction was complete as of March 6, 2006.[7]
On August 2, 2006, Saks Incorporated announced that it had agreed to sell its upscale 38 Parisian stores, along with two regional distribution centers and Birmingham corporate headquarters to Belk, which rebranded them under their own name in the third quarter of 2007.
On November 5, 2008, Saks announced the closure of the unprofitable Club Libby Lu chain.[8]
In late August 2010, the UK tabloid Daily Mail reported that a private equity buyer was mulling a $1.7 billion takeover bid for Saks Incorporated.[9]

On July 29, 2013, Toronto-based Hudson's Bay Company announced that it will buy Saks Incorporated for USD 2.9 billion.[10]
Restatements[edit]
In March, 2005, Saks announced to restate financial results from fiscal 1999 through the third quarter of fiscal 2004 to correct some accounting errors related to its previously recorded operating leases.[11]

History[edit]
Proffitt's Inc.[edit]
Proffitt's Inc. began as five Proffitt's stores in the Knoxville, Tennessee metropolitan area. After going public under the symbol PRFT on the NASDAQ stock exchange in 1987, Proffitt's Inc. grew by acquiring several department stores. In 1989 the company purchased 18 Hess's locations in Tennessee, Virginia, Kentucky, and Georgia. From 1994 to 1998, the company added McRae's, Younkers, Parisian, Herberger's, Carson Pirie Scott, Boston Store, and Bergner's chains, as well as additional stores from Loveman's, Parks-Belk, and Brody's, which were converted into existing store nameplates. After acquiring Parisian, Proffitt's relocated its corporate headquarters to Birmingham, Alabama from Knoxville in October 1997. Although the full Saks company no longer has a store in Mississippi, Saks operates its data services from the former McRae's headquarters in Jackson, Mississippi.
Saks, Inc.[edit]
In September 1998, the company acquired the holding company for the luxury retailer Saks Fifth Avenue, Saks Holdings, Inc., and subsequently changed its legal name to Saks, Incorporated. The acquisition brought the Saks Fifth Avenue and Off 5th franchises, as well as Folio, a mail-order business and Saks.com, an online retailer. The former Saks Fifth Avenue properties became the Saks Fifth Avenue Enterprises division of the company with the larger Birmingham-based department store division becoming the Saks Department Store Group. The company's main-line department store group was made up of its Southern Department Store Group: McRae's and Proffitt's,the Northern Department Store Group: Bergner's, Boston Store, Carson Pirie Scott, Herberger's and Younkers, the company's Specialty Department Store Group Parisian, and the company's Saks Fifth Avenue Enterprises which included Saks Fifth Avenue and Off 5th. In 2001, the company recorded record revenues of $6.6 billion, making it a member of the Fortune 500 and one of the largest operators of department stores in the United States. The company was also a primary sponsor of the Bruno's Memorial Classic golf tournament, now known as the Regions Charity Classic. The company moved its headquarters to Midtown Manhattan, New York City in 2007.[4] Several of Saks' management still live in Birmingham. In 2005, vendors filed against Saks alleging unlawful chargebacks. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigated the complaint for years, and according to the New York Times "exposed a tangle of illicit tactics that let Saks ... keep money it owed to clothing makers", inflating Saks' yearly earnings up to 43% and abusively collecting around $30 million from suppliers over seven years.[5] Saks settled with the SEC in 2007, after firing three or more executives involved in the fraudulent activities.[6][5]
Divestments[edit]
By 2005, Saks Incorporated began to seek a narrower focus towards the luxury-oriented retail synonymous with its Saks Fifth Avenue stores. The decision resulted in a July 2005 sale of its combined 47 Proffitt's and McRae's stores to Belk for approximately $622 million.
On October 31 that same year, Saks announced that it was selling the 142 stores within its Northern Department Store Group, including Carson Pirie Scott, Bergner's, Younkers, Herberger's, and Boston Store to Bon-Ton Stores, Inc., for $1.1 billion; the transaction was complete as of March 6, 2006.[7]
On August 2, 2006, Saks Incorporated announced that it had agreed to sell its upscale 38 Parisian stores, along with two regional distribution centers and Birmingham corporate headquarters to Belk, which rebranded them under their own name in the third quarter of 2007.
On November 5, 2008, Saks announced the closure of the unprofitable Club Libby Lu chain.[8]
In late August 2010, the UK tabloid Daily Mail reported that a private equity buyer was mulling a $1.7 billion takeover bid for Saks Incorporated.[9]

SAKS INCORPORATED Company Profile

   Once one of the top US department store operators, Saks Incorporated has retrenched to focus on its luxury Saks Fifth Avenue business. The company dismantled an empire of some 375 middle-market department stores under 10 different banners (including Bergner's, Carson Pirie Scott, and Parisian) to stake its future on a dwindling number of Saks Fifth Avenue stores, while growing its off-price sister chain, Off 5th, and its online business. The divestments positioned the department store chain squarely in the luxury market. Founded in 1919 as Profitt's, the firm bought renowned luxury retailer Saks Holdings and adopted the high-dollar Saks name. Saks is owned by Hudson's Bay Company, owner of Lord & Taylor.

History[edit]
Proffitt's Inc.[edit]
Proffitt's Inc. began as five Proffitt's stores in the Knoxville, Tennessee metropolitan area. After going public under the symbol PRFT on the NASDAQ stock exchange in 1987, Proffitt's Inc. grew by acquiring several department stores. In 1989 the company purchased 18 Hess's locations in Tennessee, Virginia, Kentucky, and Georgia. From 1994 to 1998, the company added McRae's, Younkers, Parisian, Herberger's, Carson Pirie Scott, Boston Store, and Bergner's chains, as well as additional stores from Loveman's, Parks-Belk, and Brody's, which were converted into existing store nameplates. After acquiring Parisian, Proffitt's relocated its corporate headquarters to Birmingham, Alabama from Knoxville in October 1997. Although the full Saks company no longer has a store in Mississippi, Saks operates its data services from the former McRae's headquarters in Jackson, Mississippi.
Saks, Inc.[edit]
In September 1998, the company acquired the holding company for the luxury retailer Saks Fifth Avenue, Saks Holdings, Inc., and subsequently changed its legal name to Saks, Incorporated. The acquisition brought the Saks Fifth Avenue and Off 5th franchises, as well as Folio, a mail-order business and Saks.com, an online retailer. The former Saks Fifth Avenue properties became the Saks Fifth Avenue Enterprises division of the company with the larger Birmingham-based department store division becoming the Saks Department Store Group. The company's main-line department store group was made up of its Southern Department Store Group: McRae's and Proffitt's,the Northern Department Store Group: Bergner's, Boston Store, Carson Pirie Scott, Herberger's and Younkers, the company's Specialty Department Store Group Parisian, and the company's Saks Fifth Avenue Enterprises which included Saks Fifth Avenue and Off 5th. In 2001, the company recorded record revenues of $6.6 billion, making it a member of the Fortune 500 and one of the largest operators of department stores in the United States. The company was also a primary sponsor of the Bruno's Memorial Classic golf tournament, now known as the Regions Charity Classic. The company moved its headquarters to Midtown Manhattan, New York City in 2007.[4] Several of Saks' management still live in Birmingham. In 2005, vendors filed against Saks alleging unlawful chargebacks. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigated the complaint for years, and according to the New York Times "exposed a tangle of illicit tactics that let Saks ... keep money it owed to clothing makers", inflating Saks' yearly earnings up to 43% and abusively collecting around $30 million from suppliers over seven years.[5] Saks settled with the SEC in 2007, after firing three or more executives involved in the fraudulent activities.[6][5]
Divestments[edit]
By 2005, Saks Incorporated began to seek a narrower focus towards the luxury-oriented retail synonymous with its Saks Fifth Avenue stores. The decision resulted in a July 2005 sale of its combined 47 Proffitt's and McRae's stores to Belk for approximately $622 million.
On October 31 that same year, Saks announced that it was selling the 142 stores within its Northern Department Store Group, including Carson Pirie Scott, Bergner's, Younkers, Herberger's, and Boston Store to Bon-Ton Stores, Inc., for $1.1 billion; the transaction was complete as of March 6, 2006.[7]
On August 2, 2006, Saks Incorporated announced that it had agreed to sell its upscale 38 Parisian stores, along with two regional distribution centers and Birmingham corporate headquarters to Belk, which rebranded them under their own name in the third quarter of 2007.
On November 5, 2008, Saks announced the closure of the unprofitable Club Libby Lu chain.[8]
In late August 2010, the UK tabloid Daily Mail reported that a private equity buyer was mulling a $1.7 billion takeover bid for Saks Incorporated.[9]

On July 29, 2013, Toronto-based Hudson's Bay Company announced that it will buy Saks Incorporated for USD 2.9 billion.[10]
Restatements[edit]
In March, 2005, Saks announced to restate financial results from fiscal 1999 through the third quarter of fiscal 2004 to correct some accounting errors related to its previously recorded operating leases.[11]
