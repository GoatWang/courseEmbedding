With that I present our CEO, Mr. Barry Karfunkel.
Barry Karfunkel
Good morning, and thank you all for joining our third quarter 2016 earnings conference call.
Since our last call we have continued to deliver strong premium growth, driven by organic growth efforts and our recent acquisitions. We experienced an overall combined ratio of 94.6, which was impacted by $15 million of losses from the Louisiana floods and an additional $4 million of losses related to the late-reported claims from the second quarter Texas hail event.
Our gross written premium for personal auto was $385 million, up from $308 million in Q3 of 2015, driven by premium from ARS, which we started writing on our own paper; the recently closed Century-National acquisition, and $40 million of organic growth, equating to a 13% organic growth rate.
As I have previously mentioned, nonstandard auto is a business that we have had great success with by leveraging our superior IT infrastructure, analytics and product management capabilities and claims practices. It is a line of business where many of our competitors are struggling, and that presents a significant amount of organic growth and M&A opportunities.
Our homeowner business continues to do well, and has gross written premium of $136 million, up from $103 million in the third quarter of 2015, driven by the recently closed Century-National acquisition and approximately 10 points of organic growth.

While still small, our NatGen Premier product, which services the high-net-worth customer base, continues to do well, and is being well received in the marketplace as agents continue to praise our platform's ease of use.
Our RV and commercial vehicle businesses continue to perform well, and we see high growth prospects for our small fleet personal-type commercial use vehicles. In our lender-placed business we have had a nice pipeline of multiple mortgage servicers that we're in discussions with, and we look forward to growing our new business.
Our accident and health business has seen good topline growth, driven by the Assurant acquisition, which we remain extremely pleased with, as well as organic growth. We earned $4.7 million of operating earnings in our A&H segment, despite posting a significant loss in our legacy stop loss business, which, as we have previously mentioned, are no longer writing new business through.
Since our last call we have closed on Standard Mutual, which brings us a nice block of standard and preferred business in Illinois and Indiana, as well as local project expertise and agent relationships, adding geographic diversification to our preferred business.
On Tuesday of this week we closed on Direct General, a direct marketing nonstandard carrier in the Southeastern states. With Direct General, we add a brand that has great recognition in its markets and a highly talented staff that is analytically driven and a great culture fit, that has the ability to price, market, sell and service nonstandard auto business through an omnichannel marketing approach.
With all of our acquisitions we continue to fully integrate our shared services, which leverages our fixed operating expenses across the combined entity. We also benefit from the unique qualities of each business, which adds to the scope of our capabilities at National General.
In closing, we continue to build a very special business that we expect to see strong results from.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Mike Weiner, our CFO, for further detail on our financial performance.
Mike Weiner
Thank you, Barry.
Third quarter 2016 net income was $20 million, versus $39 million in the third quarter of 2015. Operating earnings were $34 million, versus $44 million in last year's quarter. Operating EPS was $0.31, compared to $0.43 in the prior year's quarter, based on weighted average shares outstanding of $108 million as of September 30, 2016.
Our third quarter results were impacted by some abnormal items, which I'd like to walk you through now. First, Louisiana flooding. In August, prolonged rainfall in an area surrounding Baton Rouge and Lafayette resulted in more than 20 inches of precipitation over a 48-hour period in some areas. In that flooding followed our auto, RV and lender-placed book were impacted by approximately $15 million pretax, or $0.09 after tax. Roughly half those losses were in our lender-placed book, where locales affected had very low NFIP participation rates.
Development on Texas hailstorms from the first and second quarter included an additional $4 million in costs associated with the hail event in both Dallas and San Antonio, which increased our original estimates due to late-reported claims. This had a $0.02 negative impact on our EPS, and we have subsequently filed increases in rates on our Texas property book.
Increase in severity losses in the Northeast, we experienced an uptick in fire losses from our legacy mono-line homeowner product, which had roughly $4 million, or $0.02 per share impact in the quarter. We have looked at these 24 unique claims that came in during the quarter and see nothing that concerns us on a go-forward basis. We are also seeing strong organic growth within our auto line, which resulted in our loss ratio being elevated by roughly a point.

Finally, we completed a $200 million preferred equity offering in July, with the majority of the proceeds used to support the acquisition of Direct General, which closed just this week. The third quarter we had not fully deployed the capital that increased our dividends, which resulted in approximately $0.03 per share in the quarter.
Now I'd like to give some additional detail about our two operating segments. Within property and casualty, net written premium grew 52%, to $680 million, driven by 13% organic growth in our auto business; approximately 10% organic growth in our home product; and $100 million in premium from National General Lender Services, which closed on October 1, 2015; $61 million from our Century-National acquisition, which closed on June 30, 2016; and $14 million from Assigned Risk Solution, which we began writing the business on our paper in the first quarter of this year.
Within our auto product, we continue to experience loss cost trends that are moderately better than the overall industry. This quarter we experienced an uptick in BI frequency along with the rest of the industry. We feel that we have a handle on this trend that we are seeing, and we are managing the increases through ratings and claims initiatives that we have implemented over the past few quarters.
BI severity has been elevated over the last few quarters, though we are doing better than the industry overall. We attribute this to our mix of business. We are looking at the relationships between rate and earnings and loss cost trends, and they are currently in parity for our book.
Service and fee income grew 28%, to $66 million, driven by our underlying premium growth, acquisitions completed over the past quarter, including Century-National and National General Lender Services, and growth of fees earned in the attorney-in-fact that managed the reciprocal exchanges.
The P&C combined ratio was 95%, compared to 89% in 3Q 2015, excluding amortization of intangible assets, with the increase in both loss and expense ratios driven by the aforementioned items. The loss ratio was 66%, compared to 60% in 3Q 2015, with the majority of that increase driven by the Louisiana flood losses; late-reported claims from the second quarter Texas hail; and higher severity losses in our mono-line home book. The expense ratio was 29%, which was in line with 3Q 2015.
Within our accident and health segment, net written premium grew 158%, to $87 million, which benefited from Assurant Health contributing $46 million of net written premium to the current year and strong growth in our domestic operations, with a total of $34 million in net premiums written, compared to $24 million in 3Q 2015, as we continue to transfer business previously written for the third quarter carriers onto our paper - third-party carriers onto our own paper.
Service and fee income grew 104% to $40 million, driven by the additional fee income from the Assurant Health acquisition and strong growth within our agencies and our HST Agency.
The accident & health combined ratio was 95% versus 98% in 3Q 2015, excluding noncash amortization of intangible assets. The loss ratio was 73%, versus 74% in the prior-year quarter. The result reflects the higher losses within our legacy small group self-funded book, which we are no more - which we are offsetting by strong results in our ongoing Assurant book.
The expense ratio was 22% versus 23% in the prior-year quarter, reflecting the continued growth and maturization of our A&H segment, coupled with the increase in service and fee income, which is a contra-expense item. We continue to believe we now have the needed scale in this segment to generate meaningful returns going forward.
Lastly, with regard to Hurricane Matthew, we expect to recognize approximately $25 million to $40 million in pretax losses from the events that occurred in the fourth quarter, with the majority of the losses coming from flooding that impacted the Carolinas. The range of our loss is driven by a lender-placed book, which tends to have a late claim reporting cycle which differs than our traditional P&C business.

I would now like to turn the call over to the moderator and open it up for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And your first question is coming from Randy Binner. Sir your line is live.
Weston Bloomer
Hi, this Weston Bloomer on for Randy. My question's on in the A&H segment. Underwriting income was pretty good there, especially with the TABS business and A&H transitioning to NatGen paper. Were losses pretty elevated there, and kind of what was the main offset from the Assurant book? How should we think about that kind of going forward as it transitions in 4Q 2016?
Mike Weiner
Yes, you're 100% right in terms of so the negative that impacted us was the runoff of our legacy TAB book. So to remember what that business is, this is a level-funding stop-loss book that we have ceased writing on.
So we additionally adjust and take reserves, and we think the block will be running off by, at the latest, the first quarter of next year. The Assurant book was the driver of that business going forward for us.
So we think the earnings power of this business is going to be substantially increased as we go into next year. We're also just starting open enrollment, which I think started this week, which will be a nice driver for both our supplemental businesses as well as our level-fund and stop-loss business. And, again, we think the TABS business with this quarter is put behind us.
Weston Bloomer
Okay, great. That's helpful. And then transitioning to kind of the expense ratio and acquisition ratio in the quarter, I apologize if I missed this, but it seemed a little elevated. Is that more mix-related, and do you expect that to continue going forward?
Mike Weiner
Well, it's ultimately going to stabilize out once we integrate all of our acquisitions. But, unfortunately, it'll still be up and down a little next quarter. We have two things - next year, excuse me - we have two things going on. We have our large business that's coming in from the Direct General acquisition on the auto side. We'll have increased or elevated integration costs associated with that.
However, to our benefit is the integration costs that we've incurred on both the Assurant acquisition and the QBE acquisition are in their late stages. We expect to get off of just on our largest of those acquisitions, the QBE, our transition services agreement, which results in a notable double count in our expenses, we hope to be through that by the early part of next year.
Again, what we like to think about in our business on a blended basis is that we look to run the business at a targeted loss ratio of 62.5 across all of our products and a 30 expense ratio. We're starting our planning process for 2017 now, but our early indications indicate that's really the best run rate for us going forward.
Weston Bloomer
Okay, thanks. That's very helpful. I'll jump back in the queue if I have any more questions. Congrats on the quarter.
Operator
Your next question is coming from Kai Pan. Please announce your affiliation and pose your question.
Kai Pan
Morgan Stanley. Good morning. Thank you. So, thank you for all the detailed explanation for the loss ratio improvement. If I look at it year over year it's about 5.7 points increase in loss ratio, 2.4 coming from Louisiana, 1.2 coming from the Texas hail as well as Northeast storms, and then you mentioned a 1 point from new business penalty. There's probably still another point. Is that coming from - is there any impact from these elevated sort of loss cost trends or slightly increasing loss cost trends?
Mike Weiner
Yes, it's a great point, and that's roughly what we're seeing in terms of what our role forward is. So, as I talked about a little is that we have seen, same as the industry, an increase in BI frequency that's hit us through the quarter. On a sequential basis just that BI frequency has increased about 2 points. So that really makes up a big piece of the difference in terms of your walk.

We have taken rate. We've taken it in the past and we're going to continue to take it. So we think about it that we believe on a go-forward or a rolling 12-month basis loss cost trends and rate taken will be in parity for us going forward. And, unfortunately, it's somewhat of a timing issue at this point right now.
But, again, we're seeing the same as the industry, with increased frequency, notably on BI. BI severity has for the industry as a whole as well as us, and we're looking at fast-track data on it for the industry has been continually increasing quarter over quarter. But we've taken adequate amount of rate for that.
Okay. Then you see a step back from the quarter and look at the full year. 2013, the P&C loss ratio around 66%, 2014 64% and 2015 62%. This years it looks like including Matthew probably going back up to 64%. So what do you think of like going forward? You just said looking around like 62.5% loss ratio. Does that contemplate any increase in terms of like cash activity that looks like this year we were particularly hit harder by several storms?
Mike Weiner
Yes, so that's a great question. So when we go through our planning processing and talk about that we work with our outside advisors, particularly the reinsurance company, to predict what is a fair CAT count load that we put into our businesses. So we typically have that in our number. And we're looking at that CAT load. It'll go up a little. But that 62.5% does include that.
We're looking at it at a trailing 5-year number. And then on top of it is what makes it not just increase like that is that we continue to shift our business. As I said, we're bringing on $500-some-odd million of auto business, which will help push that down a little, versus any increase we'll have in that trailing five-year CAT impact to us.
Kai Pan
Okay, great. If I may ask about the Direct General acquisition, you just closed on it, it is a little bit different from your agency distribution model. So I just wonder from two perspectives, one is that how that impacts your integration plan, and how much that's worth, because their combined ratio is north of 100%, how quickly you can improve that. And then secondly what kind of opportunity this affords you in terms of a brand-new platform.
Mike Weiner
Yes, so let me answer the first two and then I'll turn it over to Barry in terms of what the opportunity might be. So, again, their - you're correct in terms of their combined ratio when we acquired the business it was running 100. We feel very strongly that it's coming on profitable, just when you do some very low-hanging fruit like redoing the reinsurance structure and general management tasks like that.
What our goal is that over the first 12 months of that acquisition we will take the business from a high-90s combined ratio to get that to our 92 to 94 target ratio for our mono-line auto segment. I can tell you just being out there this week and talking to the folks and all of these things we have in place, we really feel good about that business going forward. Barry?
Barry Karfunkel
As far as going forward and the opportunity with Direct General, it's a great business. Our businesses really complement each other. We're huge opportunities to be able to leverage Direct General's as well as National General's respective product strengths where they've got presence in states where we currently aren't in, vice versa.
We've got product strengths. Vis-Ã -vis our products strengths, they're really underpenetrated in from a marketing and storefront basis. We target different slices of the nonstandard market opportunity to be able to cross-sell different products through the storefront, so whether it's A&H, etc. So going forward we see tremendous amounts of opportunity in this business.

Kai Pan
Great. Thanks. Lastly, if I may, just quick number question, what's that $22 million impairment related to on the investment side?
Mike Weiner
Yes, so we took some OTTI impairments on some positions that we have, primarily some of these positions where on utilities and on some overseas shipping businesses that we had a position in. These were fixed-income instruments. So looking at our OTTI policy, we needed to impair them at this time.
Kai Pan
Okay, great. Well, thanks so much for all the answers.
Operator
Your next question is coming from Meyer Shields. Please announce your affiliation and pose your question.
Meyer Shields
Great. KBW, and thanks so much. So, Mike, you talked about how rate increases are basically keeping pace with loss cost inflation. Given the fact that a lot of competitors are struggling, wouldn't there be an opportunity for margin expansion? Or how are you thinking about that?
Mike Weiner
Well, we are seeing, because - I'll answer it a little differently - we are seeing that our organic growth is certainly higher and our mono-line vehicle business higher than we target. I've always talked about our targeting a growth in that business in the low to mid 3%, 4%, 5%, 6%, and we're getting a number double of that, simply because we have, again, in the auto side we have a lot of small regional competitors that are just really struggling right now. With our sophisticated pricing and our expense efficiencies, we're continuing to gain share with that.
So what we're going to do at this point right now is that let that business come to us. We will continue to defend our core ratio to get to our 92 to 94. I think if we do that in the segment that we operate under with some of the pressures on those other competitors we'll still be able to get the higher than anticipated normal market growth, as I talked about, of that 4% to 6%.
Meyer Shields
Okay, that's helpful. And if I can go back to the CAT provision, is there any way of quantifying not the dollar impact of these storms but the difference between what you would expect and what you're seeing in terms of CATs and weather?
Mike Weiner
Yes, well, in terms of what the projections were and where it actually came in?
Meyer Shields
Or in terms of the provisions within pricing.
Mike Weiner
The provision versus the pricing. I'm trying to think about this now. It is certainly notionably higher than what we had anticipated for the quarter. However, it is much lower than our retention that we have in the business.
So just on the property side, I don't know if I'm answering this the way you wanted to, but on the property side, on some of our properties, we have about a 5% or 6% CAT load, and we've been just hit for the last three quarters with these many CAT events that are hitting us, and $15 million here, $15 million here, and obviously a much larger number is coming in the fourth quarter.
Meyer Shields
No, that's exactly what I was looking for. And then one last question, if Direct General's, I don't know, Hurricane Matthew losses end up higher than their preclose estimate, who bears that risk?
Mike Weiner
Well, we do an opening balance sheet adjustment. When I gave you that - first of all, when I gave you that estimate between the 25 and 40 that does include it. We have got constant reports from them throughout the close on every one of those. But that'll ultimately go on the closing balance sheet.
But, again, we've looked at it. Their losses are de minimus. They don't have the same concentration risk that we had in North Carolina. So it's really a nonevent for us in terms of that. Again, the vast majority of what has hit us with Hurricane Matthew, about two-thirds of it's going to be coming through our lender-placed business.
Meyer Shields
Okay, and that's property rather than auto.

Mike Weiner
That's correct.
Meyer Shields
Okay. Thanks so much.
Operator
And your last question is coming from Matt Carletti. Please announce your affiliation and pose your question.
Matt Carletti
Hi, it's Matt Carletti with JMP. Good morning. Just a couple of questions. Just following up on the Matthew estimate of losses, I just want to make sure that I'm understanding this right. In the LPI book, am I right that the policy there does cover flood, where a more traditional homeowner's policy might not, or usually doesn't?
Mike Weiner
Yes, so a very good question, so if the current property, right, has - is in a flood area and has an NFIP policy, right, those numbers on those policies are escrowed and paid and we don't actually pay for that. Right?
Matt Carletti
Okay.
Mike Weiner
However, a large amount of the impact that we're estimating were not in required flood areas where an NFIP put policy there. And ourselves and the industry as a whole in lender-placed does cover that.
The variability around the losses in that business, the reason we have such a wide range, is unlike a traditional home product when there's somebody living in the home or whatnot, and in some cases these are, as well - there's a lot of vacant properties - it takes a much longer reporting cycle to get there. So, and on average it takes about 60 or some-odd days to get a report in.
And on vacant properties many of the lenders will go out and hire third-party TPAs to inspect it. So that's - that process is happening as we speak.
Matt Carletti
Got you. Okay, that makes sense. A couple of other questions, just on the A&H business, the stop loss books, obviously the new Assurant book and you're running off the old kind of NatGen book, where are we in that runoff process? It feels like we should be getting to the end of it, but just is next quarter the end, or do we have more to go?
Mike Weiner
No, listen, we reserved that book. We think it's all behind us at this point right now.
Matt Carletti
Okay, great, perfect. And then last question, just Northeast losses, like you're mentioning 26 individual claims, and you looked at them and didn't really see any kind of common themes, or at least anything to worry about, were there any common themes in terms of the causes of what was driving the losses or some sort of characteristics about them, or did they really just looked, for lack of a better word, just very random to you?
Mike Weiner
They looked very random, to the extent we actually pulled each one of the losses, the management team. These were some fires that happened, some floods, an electrical event. Two or three of them were fires that jumped from one home or one building to the others, which is then a subrogation opportunity to do. One was a high-valued home that had a broken pipe and flooded, just very random.
There was really no trend there. It's not like we had ice damming in the roofs or something like that, or fraud or anything like that. We spent a lot of time analyzing it. That's why we feel so comfortable that it is just a unique string of bad luck we had in the Northeast on this.
Matt Carletti
All right. That color is really helpful. Congrats on the quarter, and best of luck.
Operator
We do have another question coming from Kai Pan. Please announce your affiliation and pose your question.
Kai Pan
Again, Morgan Stanley. Thank you for taking the follow-up. Just bigger picture, you mentioned in your opening remark about potential acquisition opportunities. I just wonder, one, is that which are you are looking at, like in terms of business line or geographic areas you're looking at. And then secondly, how do you balance management resources between looking out for acquisitions as well as at the same time you are integrating these large acquisitions done in the recent period?

Mike Weiner
Yes, so two very good questions. Many of the acquisitions that we target or we monitor, and we have a portfolio on, really are unique situations that come to us. The ones we're looking at right now are disproportionately probably weighted to auto at this point right now, and particularly nonstandard mono-line auto.
The key for us is to not bite off more than we can chew, right? And that's what is the most fundamental thing that we - what we focus on every day. Every one of the acquisitions we do has a very detailed integration process that goes through, both from a technology, a human resource side, and whatnot.
And, as I've always said, from beginning to end it takes approximately 18 months. So we're aggressively starting. We had a little bit of a head start on some of the Direct General stuff.
So what we try to do is be able to overlay any acquisition to where we are right now in terms of our resource allocations, to be very, very cognizant of that. And, quite frankly, if we can't integrate it and get the return and get it to what we want to do over a very short period of time, 12 to 18 months, then we won't do it.
Barry Karfunkel
Just to add to that, our operations team has a very regimented plan on integrating these acquisitions, and we start preparing for it on our side as soon as - at signing of the deal. So that's on the National General side. By the time the deal has closed we've made very significant progress, and that really enables - that regimented plan really enables us to take a very strong approach and integrate these acquisitions while really leveraging the many strengths that we bring to bear.
Kai Pan
Great. Thanks again.

Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to National General Holdings Corp fourth quarter earnings call. My name is Christine Worley, and I am the Director of Investor Relations at National General.

Members of our management team may include statements other than historical facts in their remarks. Such statements may include the plans and objectives of management for future operations, including those relating to future changes in the Companyâs business activities and earnings results or potential.

Reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measurements and related information is provided in the press release for our fourth quarter 2016 earnings, which is available on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.nationalgeneral.com.
With that I present our CEO, Mr. Barry Karfunkel.
Barry Karfunkel
Good morning and thank you all for joining our fourth quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Well, our first quarter earnings results were lower than we would like to see primarily due to cash activity on our auto and lender-placed insurance lines of business, Iâm extremely excited about how weâve position National General for the future.
The personal auto insurance sector as a whole is facing pressure and by leveraging our superior technology, claims, and pricing capabilities weâre seeing a high organic growth rates both this quarter and for the year.
As a result of our Direct General acquisition, we now have the ability to market nonstandard auto directly to the consumer, while the Nationwide renewal rates transaction opens up the new marketing channel, where National General will be the first nonstandard option for their exclusive agents.
Iâm pleased to report that was completed the migration of Direct Generalâs claims on to our platform, eliminating a significant expense and more importantly enabling us to have to required claims controls in place which drive our underwriting performance.

With respect to our Nationwide renewal rates transaction, we begin to receive their internet leads in the first quarter. Weâre encouraged by the level of engagement of their exclusive and independent agents thus far and expect to see more meaningful topline benefit later in the year. As we complete the quote automation process between our respective platforms, which will enhance that ease of use for their agents to quote our products.
Our commercial vehicle book of business continues to do extremely well, weâve added to our book of business with the Century-National transaction and we expect to get some added commercial vehicle protection as a result of the Nationwide transaction. While the commercial vehicle industry as a whole as struggle to maintain profitability, our commercial vehicle business is primarily focused on the personal use type vehicles, we were able to leverage our expertise from personal vehicle and it continues to perform very well.
Weâve had made significant progress in our homeowners business over the past year with growth coming from new partnerships as well as expanding our product offerings, including our premier line which serves as the high net worth market. In 2016 we diversified our book of business which has historically been highly concentrated in the Northeast. As a result of our Century-National and Standard Mutual acquisitions, we now have an established presence on the West Coast and in the Midwest.
We believe we currently have a solid state footprint to support strong growth into the future. Our lender-placed business declined through the loss of in auto collateral protection client, we maintain relationship with that client and our full tracking this year auto loans. However, they made a corporate decision to stop placing lender-placed insurance on their auto loans. In recent months, weâve signed on few new accounts and [indiscernible] prospect that we expect to convert on in the future.
Turning to our A&H segment, we posted a wonderful Q4, which is indicative of future earnings potential to acquire to insurance lines of business proceed great results, and our agencies have experienced solid top line growth.
Turning to our outlook for 2017, we looked further enhancing our position within our respective markets. We look forward to emerging our legacy non-standard auto data with Direct General on a single database, which will enhanced our product offerings and enable us to enter certain states that perform very well for Direct General through the independent agency channel.
With our homeownersâ product, we look forward to continued growth and will be doing a fair amount of work to upgrade our product specification, while making progress on integrating the Century-National and Standard Mutual platforms. With our lender-placed lines of business, weâll be investing in making our tracking platform more client centric, which will also reduce our expenses going forward. For 2017, our margins for this book of business should be below target, while we work to enhance our platform and our topline.
For Accident and Health, weâre completely of insurance platform and we will be investing and upgrading our platform to ensure that it is best-in-class. Our agencyâs margins remain pressured in this environment of low commission rates in the Accident and Health segment. Nonetheless, they contribute the solid amounts of underwriting income for our carriers. We also see the potential opportunity to leverage our Direct General distribution to increased Accident and Health revenue in the future.
Lastly, with our acquisition of Quotit, a leading individual health insurance comparative rater. We see the opportunity to leverage that in some platform that could be a basis for strong independent agency technology offerings and provide us with strong software as a service licensing fee revenue. In terms of acquisitions as of now, I donât proceed us having acquisitive year that weâve had in 2016 rather we see a lot of opportunity for smaller tuck-in acquisitions, which have the potential to significantly enhance our existing business.

In closing, 2016 was the year of transformative growth for National General. Weâve had a fantastic top line results and position to Accident and Health for wonderful future results, while adding new capabilities with our acquisitions, which will play a significant role in our future growth. Iâve never been more excited about the future of National General than Iâm today.
With that, Iâd like to turn the call over to Mike Weiner, our CFO, for further detail on our financial performance.
Mike Weiner
Thank you, Barry. Fourth Quarter 2016 net income was $31 million versus $14 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. Operating earnings were $33 million versus $42 million in last yearâs quarter. Operating EPS was $0.30 compared to $0.39 in the prior yearâs quarter based on weighted average shares outstanding of $109 million as of December 31, 2016.
Our fourth quarter results were impacted by some unusual items, which Iâd like to walk you through. Firstly, Hurricane Matthew, weâve experienced $14 million in losses associated with Hurricane Matthew which struck the Southeastern close to United States in October of 2016. This fell below our previous announced expected range as losses from our lender-placed book where below our initial indications. The majority of the losses emanated from our order book which was impacted by the flooding that took place in North Carolina.
Development on the Louisiana flooding, we recorded an additional $2 million in losses related to the flooding in Louisiana that occurred in August 2016. A $5 million impact due to the runoff of that lender-placed auto clients Barry mentioned. We continue to see very strong organic growth within our auto line, which has resulted in a loss ratio being elevated by roughly one point in a new business.
Now Iâd like to give you some additional detail on our two operating segments. Firstly, within Property and Casualty, net written premium grew 22% to $643 million driven by 17% of organic growth $59 million from the Direct General acquisition, $43 million from the Century-National acquisition, $12 million from Standard Mutual, and $13 million from the Assigned Risk Solutions, which we began right in the business on our own paper in the first quarter of this year.
We reported $47 million in net written premium from our Lender Services product, down from $126 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 with the majority of that decline related to the previous mentioned auto client. The top line impact in this quarter was artificially high as the product is high cancellation rates and includes the refund of premiums from previous quarters. Moving forward, we will continue to provide loan tracking services for that client. As Barry mentioned in his remarks, we have recently signed a few lender-placed clients, which should have a positive impact on the top line results in the near future.
Service and fee income grew 49% to $82 million, driven by underlying premium growth acquisitions completed in the past year particularly Direct General and the growth of fees earned by the attorney-in-fact that managed the reciprocal exchanges. The Property and Casualty combined ratio was 98% compared to 92% in 4Q 2015 excluding amortization of intangibles assets with the increase in both the loss ratio and expense ratio driven by the aforementioned items. The loss ratio was 67% compared to 65% in 4Q 2015 with the majority of that increase was driven by catastrophic losses from both Hurricane Matthew in the fourth quarter as well as the operating adjustment and losses from the Louisiana flood that occurred in the third quarter.
The expense ratio was 31% compared to 27% in 4Q 2015 with the uptick driven by less lender-placed product to spread the fixed expense base over as well as increased incorporate and integration expenses. Within Accident and Health segment, net written premium grew 9% to $97 million, which benefited from strong growth in our domestic operations with a total of $39 million in net premiums written compared to $13 million in 4Q 2015 as we continue to transfer business previously written on third-party carriers onto our own paper.

Service and fee income declined $27 million to $44 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, primarily driven by a shift in products written during the quarter in response to changes in short-term medical regulations, which will earn in on a deferred basis throughout the year 2017. Accident and Health combined ratio was 85% versus 104% in 4Q 2015 excluding cash amortization of intangible assets. The loss ratio was 63% versus 93% in the prior yearâs quarter.
The results reflect a more normalized level of the small group self-funded product and strong results from our supplemental products and our European accident books. The expense ratio was 22% versus 12% in the prior yearâs quarter, partially driven by lower fee income in the quarter, which is a contra-expense item. In our earnings release, we disclosed that we expect to file a Form 12b-25 with the SEC on or before March 2, which states that we will be unable to file our 10-K in a timely manner. We are delayed in our filing due to more time needed to complete our year-end audit. We do not anticipate any changes from the previously reported results and expect our 10-K to be filed on or before March 16.
I would now like to turn the call over to the moderator and open it up for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Matt Carletti [JMP Securities]. Sir, please announce your affiliation. Your line is live.
Matt Carletti
Hi, thank you. Iâm Matt Carletti with JMP. Good morning.
Barry Karfunkel
Good morning.
Matt Carletti
Couple of questions: first one, just talking about the health side of the business, your potential impacts or potential changes coming through ACA. I know that we donât know what those are going to be, but I just curious if could give us a little color on how you are thinking about how your business is situated for kind of some of the changes that are at least being discussed?
Barry Karfunkel
On the carrier side of things, we should be pretty unchanged, donât first see a lot of impact. Itâs more on the agency side of things. Weâre again depending on what kind of change happens exactly with Affordable Care Act if we were to enter into an environment where the minimum loss ratios from selling major medical were to go way or be decreased then that would ultimately provide more room for commission payments and allow commission payments to go back somewhat to what they were historically before the Affordable Care Act that should potentially be able to provide a boost otherwise donât foresee a significant impact.
Mike Weiner
Yes, I would add to that, we wiped â it out every possible alternative that we can think about now using everything thatâs out there in the market. Unfortunately, itâs says everyone knows a little gray and weâre following things very, very closely. I think the key thing that I alluded to earlier was that we have acquired through these years and the acquisitions and whatnot a phenomenal distribution force.
And that distribution force for whatever product becomes available that we think will be able to utilize that quite substantially. And then be in a situation to sell on to the top of that those supplemental products. So I think weâre well positioned to pay that â to no matter what happens going forward, which is a good place to be.
Matt Carletti
Great. And then one other question just shifting businesses â and your up market homeowners product, I mean you guys were Iâd say an early mover there in the sense that when thereâs a lot of consolidation took place a couple of years ago, you guys really kind of put your foot on the gas building that business. More recently at least on the outside office is analysts and investors have heard some of your peer companies talk about trying to push into that market Iâm just curious, what if anything have you seen for â that happening from a competitive standpoint.

I recognize you guys are only in certain geographies which over there, so maybe youâre not seeing them, but I just be curious kind of how the competition is sits, now itâs changed, from where you stand.
Mike Weiner
Yes, weâve heard the same things as well but we continue to go to market and we continue to look at the other companies that are being quoted against and those new competitors just turn out there yet. So itâs the same competitors that we all heard of, they were there quite frankly prior to us. I think the key for us in this space and thatâs been something that Barry and myself have been very pleasantly surprised with is that, or while we think weâve a phenomenal product as we know, we have phenomenal product and we focused on that mass outflow in space as opposed to the high, high value.
Itâs really what our technologies being allowing us to do in terms of â excuse me, a real time quoting and binding and working with the agents, thatâs really propelled growth that weâve add in there. Still small in the business but the growth rate has been phenomenal with us. And as we have, weâre bringing on additional states and we have both East Coast and West Coast marketing teams out there. So we still feel very bullish about that and getting back to original question. We havenât really seen those competitors yet potentially later in the year where they might be out there.
Matt Carletti
Okay, great. Thank you very much for answers. Congrats on a nice year and best of luck in 2017.
Mike Weiner
Thank you.
Barry Karfunkel
Thank you.
Operator
Your next question is coming from Randy Binner. Please announce your affiliation. Your line is live.
Randy Binner
Hi, Randy Binner with FBR. And Iâve had a little bit of connection issues earlier on the call. So, could you just repeat, what the nature of the decline loss was in lender-placed and maybe provide a little bit more color on, did the new accounts that youâve been able to write there?
Mike Weiner
Sure. Let me talk about the first one. This was obviously a lender-placed business the vast majority of the business it is placing a lender-placed property business, would you owe a CPI business that focuses on working with both small and very large banks in terms of placing auto on a lender-placed side. One particular client of ours has decided to continue to track the business, but has decided to stop lender placing the business, which is not regulatorily required as in you have in the mortgage business, which are required to maintain any chance to different regulatory scheme on that.
So whatâs happens to us financially on that is that we donât have the new business that goes forward and remember how these businesses work, is in many cases your lender placing the business and you have cancellations that come up. So those cancellations are moving through now as well as some fixed costs that we had in the quarter to finish up that book of business. So thatâs a smaller piece of the business, actually the lowest of all the margins of the businesses that we operate under.
But the good news in part of the businesses, as far as integration continues to go well in terms of what weâre doing and investing in it. Weâre now at the point and itâs taken us longer so, than we anticipated to winning some new accounts we have actually signed some new accounts in the current quarter and are working on RFPs quite aggressively on some additional accounts that will come in later in the year.
The problem is is that thereâs a long leave time even from the clients that weâve signed in the quarter until we have meaningful premium earnings on that. In addition to it, as Barry alluded to in his original comments, weâre investing in our state-of-the-art platform in that space to be a key competitor out there in the industry if not become at one point in the industry later.

Randy Binner
And just to clarify that. So that client â these are â did you say it was automobiles â
Mike Weiner
Thatâs correct.
Randy Binner
So they want to track on, but others does this like take the collateral risk themselves basically, is it right?
Mike Weiner
Thatâs correct. You got it.
Randy Binner
Okay. Okay, thatâs fine. So they didnât put it to your competitor?
Mike Weiner
Absolutely not.
Randy Binner
Yes. Okay, thatâs good. And then, in commercial auto, I guess Iâd kind of like to dig into this a little more. Why you all â I think your commercial auto books is different than what we see generically in the market in part because you focus on ours and contractors and other vehicles that donât move around the same way like a long-haul truck would. And so, is that kind of the key difference and why you havenât had issues there like the rest of the industry?
Mike Weiner
Yes.
Randy Binner
Any commentary on why you assumed you may be having a different result than a lot of the big riders that would be helpful.
Mike Weiner
Yes, because itâs â weâre using the word commercial auto. And perhaps, may be we shouldnât, may be we should think of creating something new, but the vast majority of the book is these audition vehicles. So weâre not doing long-haul trucking, weâre not doing short-haul trucking, weâre not doing box trucking, right; the vast majority of the business are individual entrepreneurs, plumbing â plumbers and roofers and that type of thing. Itâs just a different business than weâve seen.
In addition to it is we had a relatively small, very well underwritten book. So we bought this business back in 2010, we acquired a book and we spent probably close to two to three years, manually underwriting every risk there in developing a phenomenal underwriting team. And weâve grown that organically and maybe through some acquisitions like on the nation-wide thing which will start showing some sign of it, but again, itâs an audition small commercial book which is just different.
Barry Karfunkel
And weâre really able to leverage our auto insurance â private passenger auto insurance data, itâs really be able to price that book more effective lease and larger commercial riders that are not necessarily heavy for expertise and pricing auto.
Mike Weiner
Yes. And weâre also using the segmentation in all of our auto underwriting tools that weâre doing on now which is really applying that to it. Thatâs why itâs much more came to our auto business than to the market commercial auto.
Randy Binner
All right, that makes sense. Letâs jump into just cover more items there [indiscernible] and I think it seems like a one-time some â one-time issue maybe there where you paid out some incentive fees. Can you just elaborate on that kind of what that was and what the size of the impact was?
Mike Weiner
Yes, I donât think it was that material, it was really just we have some performance-related fees that we paid it out â we paid out in the current quarter. So we expect that to get back to a normal run going forward.
Randy Binner
Well, how much did you payout though?
Mike Weiner
I donât have the number off the top of my head. It wasnât that material.
Randy Binner
Okay. And then finally on the â yes, I guess on just the 10-K delay. I guess I take it from your comments that this is its like a volume of work problem was all the M&A that closed in the back half of last yearâs. Is that kind of a fair way to characterize what the delay is?
Mike Weiner
Yes, absolutely. We just have a lot of work and a lot of volume; itâs not one thing in specific that weâre dealing with here. So we just need more time to work with our auditors through the auto process and we donât expect any changes with the reported results. And thereâs also some new disclosures out there that insurance companies are dealing with that have slowed down the process a bit.

Randy Binner
All right. Thanks a lot.
Operator
And your last question is coming from Meyer Shields. Sir, your line is live.
Meyer Shields
Good morning. Can you hear me?
Mike Weiner
Yes.
Meyer Shields
Okay. Sorry, Iâm having some phone trouble. Mike, can you elaborate a little more on sort of like the basic personal auto pressure that most of the industry has seen in terms of frequency and severity in terms of what you guys are?
Mike Weiner
Yes, absolutely. Weâre a little unique versus others in that. What weâve really seen is weâve seen an increase as â same really story as I told last quarter, but it hasnât really subsided. Weâve seen an increase in BI severity which has really impacted our book.
Frequency, so weâve seen an increase in BI frequency which is kind of unique to versus others. Weâve taken on a lot of, Iâd like to call it, early claims in the programs that allow us to settle these things earlier. But weâre seeing some continuing increases in BI frequency thatâs continued, but the trend is in line again what we saw in the prior quarter and we continue to grade that as equal to it as we move forward.
Meyer Shields
Okay, thatâs helpful. And Barry, youâve gave some I guess optimistic expectations for Accident & Health. Were you using the fourth quarter results or the full year 2016 as that base?
Barry Karfunkel
Fourth quarter results.
Meyer Shields
Wow! Okay, fantastic. Thanks much.
Barry Karfunkel
Sure.
Operator
And you have no more questions in queue.
Christine Worley
