About | Two Sigma














































About
More than 1,100 people who believe the scientific method is the best way to approach investing. Ideas backed up with information. And improved by iteration. That’s Two Sigma.
We’re not your typical investment manager. We follow principles of technology and innovation as much as principles of investment management. Fields like machine learning and distributed computing guide us. Since 2001, we’ve searched for ways that these kinds of technologies can make us better at what we do. We never stop researching and developing.
In the process, we work to help real people. Through our investors, we support the retirements of millions around the world. And we help fund breakthrough research, education and a wide range of charities and foundations.

Co-Chairmen


        
          David Siegel and John Overdeck are recognized pioneers in the fields of technology and investment management. They have more than 40 years of experience in the development of computer-driven, model-based trading systems. Together, David and John run the company.  They work together to drive the mission and strategy for Two Sigma, nurture talent and shape the company’s unique culture.
        




David Siegel, Co-Chairman
Prior to co-founding Two Sigma, David was Chief Technology Officer and Managing Director at Tudor Investment Corporation. After earning his doctorate, David joined D. E. Shaw & Co. and rose to become the company's first chief information officer. While at D. E. Shaw & Co., he founded and served as president of FarSight Financial Services, the world's first integrated personal financial services website, which was acquired by Merrill Lynch. A graduate of Princeton University, David received a PhD in computer science from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he studied at its Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. David has had a lifelong interest in building intelligent computational systems and continues to actively pursue this mission at Two Sigma today.
He currently sits on the Board of Directors of the Hamilton Insurance Group, the Scratch Foundation, NYC FIRST and NAF. In addition, David is a trustee of Carnegie Hall, an Executive Advisory Committee Member of the NSF/MIT Center for Brains, Minds & Machines and an advisory board member of Stanford’s Center on Philanthropy and Civil Society.
David is also a member of the Cornell Tech Board of Overseers and a member of the Corporation Visiting Committee for the MIT Media Laboratory.



John Overdeck, Co-Chairman
John began his career at D.E. Shaw & Co, where he rose to Managing Director. While at D. E. Shaw, he directed the firm’s Japanese equity and equity-linked investments and supervised the firm’s London investment management affiliate.  Following D.E. Shaw and before starting Two Sigma, John spent two years at Amazon.com, first serving as Vice President and technical assistant to Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos. He went on to lead customer relationship management at Amazon.com, directing Amazon’s renowned personalization, community, and targeted marketing features and technology.  He also led critical efforts to make Amazon’s customer technology more scalable.
A lifelong math enthusiast, John won a silver medal for the United States in the 27th International Mathematics Olympiad. He earned a B.S. in Mathematics (with distinction) and a M.S. in Statistics from Stanford University. John currently serves on the Board of Directors of the Hamilton Insurance Group. In addition to his family’s charitable activities, John also serves on the boards of the Robin Hood Foundation, the Institute for Advanced Study and is the acting Chair of the National Museum of Mathematics. 



Founders
Two Sigma Investments was founded in 2001 by David Siegel, John Overdeck and Mark Pickard. They shared the belief that innovative technology and data science could help discover value in the world's data to consistently deliver value for clients.
It is this belief that drives Two Sigma's ongoing development of new technologies that synthesize and integrate vast amounts of data, yielding results that seek to drive smarter investing and more consistent returns.

Why CollegeXpress?
So, you clicked on that orange button to see if we’re legit, right? Or, maybe you’re deciding if you should use this site instead of the hundreds of other college sites out there. Well, that’s why we created this page: to answer your questions and prove that CollegeXpress is definitely the place you want to be.
We know what college is all about-academics, personal growth, professional opportunities, and fun-because we’ve been there. When we built CollegeXpress, we kept all of that in mind, creating the kind of site we wish we had when we were looking for schools.
And one of the site’s best features? It’s completely…FREE! 
Who are you guys, anyway?
Carnegie Communications is an educational publisher. Every year, thousands of students across the United States and around the world discover their colleges using our magazines and websites. Nothing makes us happier than when that happens.
We’ve been in the education business a long time. Here are some of the things we publish.

Private Colleges & Universities magazine-published since 1986
Wintergreen Orchard House college guides-published since 1978

CollegeXpress was first launched in 1995. Here’s one of our first logos.

Here’s another from 1998 -what were we thinking back then?!

And one from 2000 …

And 2004 …

Yet, even though we’ve been around a long time, many of the brains behind CollegeXpress are recent grads. So you get the experience of an established company with the perspective of people just like you. We also incorporate as much user feedback as possible, so the site has all the information you need.
Where does your information come from?
The college profiles are written by the colleges themselves, and they provide the photos, like these. 
The college and scholarship data is from Wintergreen Orchard House, a major database compiler of college, graduate, and scholarship data. We send surveys to every two- and four-year college and university in the country to collect the most up-to-date data available. We work to make sure every statistic, deadline, address-you name it-is as current as possible.
College experts, like deans of admission or financial aid, or college counselors, write most of our articles. Here are two of our favorites.

Joan Isaac MohrVice President and Dean of Admissions at Quinnipiac University

Dr. Michael MiloneNationally recognized research psychologist and award-winning educational writer
Those not authored by such VIPs are usually researched and written by our staff. And most of our other bloggers are recent grads or current college students, so they know exactly what you’re going through!
Where do your Lists and Rankings come from?
These lists are unlike any college rankings you’ve ever seen. In fact, they’re less like “rankings” and more like collections of schools organized by their strengths. Here are some examples: The Happy Colleges, Colleges that Meet the Financial Needs of Students, 10 Cool Colleges for Entrepreneurs, Colleges Most Like Hogwarts.

The lists come from a book called The College Finder by Steven Antonoff, an educational consultant from Denver, Colorado.
Steve was the Dean of Students and Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid at the University of Denver. He is now a certified educational planner with experience working with over 3,000 students. He researched the lists with help from our Wintergreen Orchard House editors and also polled experts in higher education to develop the rest.
Some lists were generated using your input. Well, maybe not your input personally, but we poll our users to create new lists based on their recommendations. Additionally, some of our lists are used with permission from outside sources, which you’ll find referenced at the bottom of the page. 
We want to make one last thing perfectly clear: no one pays to be on these lists, not even our featured colleges (see “What is a featured college?”); all lists were developed using the methodologies outlined above.
Who are the “Experts” you’re referring to on the site?
In our Ask the Experts and Lists and Rankings sections, you’ll find more expert advice than you can shake a stick at. Our experts are admission representatives, high school counselors, educational planners, and other industry pros. Here are a few.

Cyndy McDonaldFounder, Higher Educational Consultants Association (HECA)

Julie McCullohDean of Admission, Gonzaga University

Keith BermanPresident/Certified Educational Planner, Options for College
Some of the experts have experience in a particular area, like financial aid or students with learning disabilities, while others work at colleges or universities.
Who else guides you in developing your services?
We have a pretty cool advisory board; some of them have been working with us since 1986!
What is a featured college?
We’re able to bring you this site for free through the support of the featured colleges and sponsors you see, and they’re labeled as such in our lists and search results. They are great schools, we’re happy to represent them, and we made it easier and faster for our featured colleges to recruit you. When you search college profiles and click “Yes, connect me!” colleges will send you brochures and other cool stuff about their campuses.
Here are just a few!

Need more info?
You can find even more answers on our FAQs page!
And, if you still need information click here to e-mail a question and we’ll get back to you right away.
We’re still working to make CollegeXpress the best college resource out there, and if you have any feedback, we’d love to hear it via e-mail, Facebook, and Twitter.

Take a look at some of the most commonly asked essay questions and use them to prepare for your applications. Brainstorm ideas, do some research or create your own “stock” of application essays from the commonly used questions below.
Current Events and Social Issues To test your skills at problem-solving and check how up-to-date you are on current issues, many applications include questions about problems and issues facing society.

What do you consider to be the single most important societal problem? Why?
Pick a controversial problem on college campuses and suggest a solution.
What do you see as the greatest threat to the environment today?

Personal Achievements Colleges are looking for students who have achieved in some area of their lives. So you shouldn’t be surprised to find essay topics that ask you to brag a little.

Describe how you have demonstrated leadership ability both in and out of school.
Discuss a special attribute or accomplishment that sets you apart.
Describe your most meaningful achievements and how they relate to your future goals.

Background and Influences Who you are is closely tied to where you’ve been and who you’ve known. To learn more about you, some admissions committees will ask you to write about your background and major influences.

Pick an experience from your own life and explain how it has influenced your development.
 Who in your life has been your biggest influence and why?
How has your family background affected the way you see the world?
 How has your education contributed to who you are today?

Future Plans and Goals Colleges look for applicants with vision and motivation, so they might ask about your goals and aspirations.

Briefly describe your long- and short-term goals.
 Where do you see yourself 10 years from now?
Why do you want to get a college education?

Choose a person or persons you admire and explain why.
