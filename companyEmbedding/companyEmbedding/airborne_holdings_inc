Airborne: technology leader in advanced composites


 


Airborne is a technology leader in advanced composites, specialized in the industrialisation of engineering and manufacturing of durable fiber reinforced composites for Space, Aeronautics and Marine industries. With our 20 years heritage in composites, we provide our clients with high-end composite solutions either directly through advanced manufacturing of components or by developing industrialisation packages which we implement at manufacturers of choice. Airborne’s focus is on high-end composite components, at high production rates at radically low conversion costs. 









News and press releases

 










From Manual to Digital Composites Production

 


While manual manufacturing is still the global standard for the composites industry, Airborne has gained a reputation of being a true innovator of automation processes. How? We call it the ‘Prove and Move’ concept: we provide automated composites solutions through three phases.
 
 







Transfer traditional manufacturing to Airborne
Airborne’s proposition is the following: You, our client, partner with Airborne in order to benefit from our automation development. A suitable programme is selected. Airborne transfers your production to the Airborne facility.
 
 







Airborne automates the process
Initially we will use traditional, manual methods for production. During this phase, our engineers closely analyse the manufacturing process in order to identify the steps which are critical to quality. Based upon this knowledge, automated manufacturing lines will be developed and qualified.
 
 







Select future manufacturing location
After successful qualification, the initial production will be taken over by the automated production line. After an agreed period, the choice is yours:

Airborne continues to manufacture in our own facility
Airborne installs a production line in your facility
Airborne installs a production line at a supplier of your choice

 
 


How automating composites works

 














Digital Factory Composites Field Lab

 


As the demand for industrialisation of composite production of small ‘table-sized’ parts is growing exponentially, Airborne brings the composites industry to the next level applying digital manufacturing. Through a digital platform we connect predictive material engineering, product engineering, process engineering, dynamic machine programming and quality assurance. To shape the new composites future Airborne has opened its Digital Factory Composites Field Lab in 2015 with partners Siemens and Kuka.
 
 















Our Clients

 


Airborne has been engineering and manufacturing composites for more than two decades. We are considered worldwide to be the most knowledgeable partner and supplier for high-end composites structures, as well as a true innovator. That is why companies such as Airbus Defence and Space, Allseas, Damen Shipyards, Thales, ASML, SABIC, Royal Netherlands Airforce, Shell, GKN/Fokker and General Dynamics are our trusted clients.

Makers of Airborne Settle FTC Charges of Deceptive Advertising; Agreement Brings Total Settlement Funds to $30 Million





      Consumers Have Until September 15 to Apply for Refunds

For Release


August 14, 2008 


 
Airborne Health, Inc., the Bonita Springs, Florida maker of the popular Airborne Effervescent Health Formula, an effervescent tablet marketed as a cold prevention and treatment remedy, has agreed to pay up to $30 million to settle Federal Trade Commission charges that it did not have adequate evidence to support its advertising claims. The FTC’s lawsuit also names Victoria Knight-McDowell, the former schoolteacher who invented Airborne, and her husband Thomas John McDowell. If the settlement is approved by the court, it will prohibit the defendants from making false and unsubstantiated cold prevention, germ-fighting, and efficacy claims. The monetary judgment will be satisfied by the defendants’ adding $6.5 million to the funds they have already agreed to pay to settle a related private class-action lawsuit, bringing the total settlement fund to $30 million. “There is no credible evidence that Airborne products, taken as directed, will reduce the severity or duration of colds, or provide any tangible benefit for people who are exposed to germs in crowded places,” said Lydia Parnes, Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection.  The FTC complaint and agreed-upon final order follow settlement last November of the class-action lawsuit, Wilson v. Airborne, Inc. et al., which is pending in federal court in the Central District of California. In that case, the defendants have agreed to pay up to $23.51 million, which will be used for consumer refunds and attorneys’ fees. If the class action suit funds are exhausted, up to $6.5 million in additional funds for consumer redress will become available as a result of the FTC order. One redress administrator will manage both pools of funds and consumers will receive a single refund check. The Wilson class action settlement provides refunds for purchases of Airborne-branded products (including Airborne Effervescent Health Formula, Airborne On-the-Go, Airborne Power Pixies, Airborne Nighttime, Airborne Jr., Airborne Gummis, and Airborne Seasonal Relief) made between May 1, 2001 and November 29, 2007. More information on the Wilson settlement, eligibility requirements, and procedures for filing a claim online or by mail can be found at www.airbornehealthsettlement.com. Consumers have until September 15, 2008 to apply for a refund for up to six product purchases. The defendants have marketed Airborne Original Effervescent Formula as a dietary supplement containing 17 ingredients, including vitamins A, C, E, zinc, and selenium. Airborne products have been advertised nationally in print media and on radio and television. They have been sold by grocery stores, drug stores, and mass merchandisers.  According to the FTC’s complaint, there is no competent and reliable scientific evidence to support the claims made by the defendants that Airborne tablets can prevent or reduce the risk of colds, sickness, or infection; protect against or help fight germs; reduce the severity or duration of a cold; and protect against colds, sickness, or infection in crowded places such as airplanes, offices, or schools. The FTC complaint also states that the individual defendants in the case, company founders Victoria Knight-McDowell and Thomas John McDowell, made false claims that Airborne products are clinically proven to treat colds.  If consumer refund claims are not paid on time in the Wilson lawsuit, or if the defendants have not paid at least $23.5 million to settle any other similar class-action lawsuit by December 31, 2009, the defendants must pay the entire $30 million to the FTC, which will administer its own consumer redress program. In addition to prohibiting the defendants from making claims that are false, misleading, or unsubstantiated by competent and reliable scientific evidence, and providing additional funds for consumer redress, the order authorizes the Commission to monitor the defendants’ compliance with the order.  The Commission vote authorizing the staff to file the complaint and agreed-upon final order was 3-1, with Commissioner J. Thomas Rosch dissenting. These documents were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California on August 13, 2008. The complaint and agreed-upon final order name the following defendants: Airborne Health, Inc., also doing business as Airborne, Inc. and Knight-McDowell Labs; Airborne Holdings, Inc.; Victoria Knight-McDowell; and Thomas John McDowell, also known as Rider McDowell. The FTC’s complaint and agreed-upon final order can be found at: http://www.ftc.gov/os/caselist/0723183/080814airbornecomplaint.pdf. NOTE: The Commission files a complaint when it has “reason to believe” that the law has been or is being violated, and it appears to the Commission that a proceeding is in the public interest. The complaint is not a finding or ruling that the defendant has actually violated the law. The stipulated final order is for settlement purposes only and does not constitute an admission by the defendants of a law violation. A stipulated final order requires approval by the court and has the force of law when signed by the judge. The Federal Trade Commission works for consumers to prevent fraudulent, deceptive, and unfair business practices and to provide information to help spot, stop, and avoid them. To file a complaint in English or Spanish, visit the FTC’s online Complaint Assistant or call 1-877-FTC-HELP (1-877-382-4357). The FTC enters complaints into Consumer Sentinel, a secure, online database available to more than 1,500 civil and criminal law enforcement agencies in the U.S. and abroad. The FTC’s Web site provides free information on a variety of consumer topics.

SIMI VALLEY, Calif., Dec. 27, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Airborne Wireless Network (OTC QB: ABWN) is pleased to announce it has entered into an agreement with Electric Lightwave Holdings, Inc. ("Electric Lightwave"). This agreement creates a mutually beneficial relationship pursuant to which the ground segment of our contemplated Infinitus Super Highway™ will be supported by Electric Lightwave's 12,500-mile fiber optics cable and data center network, which is located throughout the Western United States, including an undersea cable link to the Hawaiian Islands.








Furthermore, we believe this agreement is significant, as it provides us access to strategic properties on which we may construct our ground stations.
With this agreement, we have moved closer toward creating the Infinitus Super Highway™.
Jason T. de Mos, our Vice President of Business Development and Aviation Compliance, said, "This agreement will allow our contemplated Infinitus Super Highway™, once implemented, to reach the end users.  Without a ground link, users would have no way to access our network.  This agreement with Electric Lightwave Holdings, Inc. provides that initial link to the ground, paving the way for ground segment partnerships for the remainder of the United States."
Also, pursuant to this agreement, Electric Lightwave has agreed to assist us with introductions and other support and advisory services during our testing phases through and including final system rollout.
On November 30, 2016, Zayo Group Holdings, Inc. announced it has entered into an agreement to acquire Electric Lightwave, formerly known as Integra Telecom, for $1.42 billion in cash.  We do not believe that Zayo's acquisition of Electric Lightwave will affect our agreement with Electric Lightwave.
About Airborne Wireless NetworkAirborne Wireless Network intends to create a high-speed broadband airborne wireless network by linking commercial aircraft in flight.  Each aircraft participating in the network will act as an airborne repeater or router sending and receiving broadband signals from one aircraft to the next creating a digital superhighway in the sky.  Airborne Wireless Network intends is to be a high-speed broadband internet pipeline to improve coverage connectivity.  Airborne Wireless Network does not intend to provide retail customer coverage to end users, but, instead, will act as a wholesale carrier with target customers, such as internet service providers and telephone companies. 
Currently, the world's connectivity is achieved by use of undersea cables, ground based fiber and satellites. Airborne Wireless Network believes that Airborne Wireless Network's airborne digital highway is the logical solution to fill the world's connectivity void.  Once the network is developed and fully implemented, its uses are limitless. Airborne Wireless Network, once developed, should provide low cost, high-speed connectivity to rural areas, island nations, ships at sea, oil platforms, in addition to connectivity to commercial and private aircraft in flight.

("Electric Lightwave"). This agreement creates a mutually beneficial relationship pursuant to which the ground segment of our contemplated Infinitus Super Highway™ will be supported by Electric Lightwave's 12,500-mile fiber optics cable and data center network, which is located throughout the Western United States , including an undersea cable link to the Hawaiian Islands.Furthermore, we believe this agreement is significant, as it provides us access to strategic properties on which we may construct our ground stations.With this agreement, we have moved closer toward creating the Infinitus Super Highway™.Jason T. de Mos, our Vice President of Business Development and Aviation Compliance, said, "This agreement will allow our contemplated Infinitus Super Highway™, once implemented, to reach the end users.  Without a ground link, users would have no way to access our network.  This agreement with Electric Lightwave Holdings, Inc. provides that initial link to the ground, paving the way for ground segment partnerships for the remainder of the United States ."Also, pursuant to this agreement, Electric Lightwave has agreed to assist us with introductions and other support and advisory services during our testing phases through and including final system rollout.On November 30, 2016 , Zayo Group Holdings, Inc. announced it has entered into an agreement to acquire Electric Lightwave, formerly known as Integra Telecom, for $1.42 billion in cash.  We do not believe that Zayo's acquisition of Electric Lightwave will affect our agreement with Electric Lightwave.About Airborne Wireless NetworkAirborne Wireless Network intends to create a high-speed broadband airborne wireless network by linking commercial aircraft in flight.  Each aircraft participating in the network will act as an airborne repeater or router sending and receiving broadband signals from one aircraft to the next creating a digital superhighway in the sky.  Airborne Wireless Network intends is to be a high-speed broadband internet pipeline to improve coverage connectivity.  Airborne Wireless Network does not intend to provide retail customer coverage to end users, but, instead, will act as a wholesale carrier with target customers, such as internet service providers and telephone companies.Currently, the world's connectivity is achieved by use of undersea cables, ground based fiber and satellites. Airborne Wireless Network believes that Airborne Wireless Network's airborne digital highway is the logical solution to fill the world's connectivity void.  Once the network is developed and fully implemented, its uses are limitless. Airborne Wireless Network, once developed, should provide low cost, high-speed connectivity to rural areas, island nations, ships at sea, oil platforms, in addition to connectivity to commercial and private aircraft in flight.For further information see: www.airbornewirelessnetwork.comContact:info@airbornewirelessnetwork.com 805-583-4302About Electric Lightwave Holdings, Inc.Electric Lightwave is the largest regional fiber-based network services provider in the western United States .
