            Can one person install the shed?
        


Asked by: Anonymous

            Home Depot does not have any service that will come out and install it for you.  You will have to just do the best you can by yourself and with some other help. It can be done in one day if you have two others helping and if you start early enough.

            Can the doors be placed at the end of the unit?
        
Asked by: Shortround

            Based on the design of the door hinges and the roof design, that's a negative.

Instructions not perfect but you can find good videos on YouTube. I am 71 years old and I managed to build it by myself in three days with no effort. So far it has withstood our normal 50 MPH wind gust here in Nevada with no problems.

In past years we have gone through two of the Shelter Logic 10 X 20 buildings.  The first one was taken out by snow and wind got the second one.  Neither one lasted a year.  Last year we bit the bullet and purchased this lifetime 15 X 8.  My son and I put it up in about 10 working hours spread over several days due to his work schedule and my physical limitations.  Snowfall and wind this past winter here in southern Oregon have been brutal.  This building has remained intact and bone dry throughout the worst Mother Nature threw at us this year.  I did "cheat" a little and use my Ryobi 18v drill/driver set at its lowest torque and slowest speed for the hundreds of screws,  Was super careful and had no problem.  Instructions OK.  Take your time.  Definitely worth the money especially if the elements are a concern.

The product states it comes with a "floor", but it does not state you have to construct your own floor first. This added a cost of $400.00 to the cost of construction of a shed with so many parts. Be prepared to spend many, many hours of manpower on it, whether you do it yourself or have it done.

        Great Shed
We bought this shed, and so far it has been fantastic! As others say, it has a lot of parts and screws, but this is what keeps it all together. I've built things for years, and understand the engineering that must have taken place to design this shed. Way to go, is all I can say.

The end product is good, but installing it was a nightmare. One of the roof pieces wouldn't fit so we had to cut into it to make it work. Took twice a long to install shed. Very frustrating.

satisfied customer
2 sometimes 3 of my neighbors came to help me put up my new shed. Its instructions were very easy to follow and the shed went up in 1 day. I would recommend this shed to anyone. The hardest part was cutting my lawn out, (hired a young man), and leveling a stone dust base. I had to level, pack, water, re-level several times to get the level that I desired. I do wish that they had a roll up door option for the end as I am working on constructing my own.RC Newburyport, MA

8 X 15 Storage shed
We have had ours for over a year now and are very pleased with it.  We liked the fact that is all plastic with some metal supports so it does not have to be painted.  We have not had any problems with it and would recommend it to our friends.

 Q: How well does this hold up in the heat?
 Asked by: Admin


 
			  - 2/1/2017

 A: This shed has a durable High Density Polyethylene construction, which makes it less hot than metal sheds, but it still might get a bit stuff inside. The two vents provide airflow, and the windows also open halfway to help air it out.

 Q: Could I connect 2 of these together to have one that is 30 feet long?
 Asked by: Luke


 
			  - 11/28/2016

 A: Could I connect 2 of these together to have one that is 30 feet long? A: The parts are not made to connect with another shed, but you could buy multiple of either the 6422, 60142, or 6424 extension kits. Keep in mind however, if you want your shed to look symmetrical you will need to buy an extension kit for each side. Also if you extend your shed too far it may void the warranty.

 Q: Can I paint this to match my house?
 Asked by: Customer


 
			  - 8/26/2016

 A: Many hardware stores sell paint that is designed for plastic. However, lifetime (the manufacturer) does not recommend painting the sheds and if it is not done correctly the paint begins to chip and flake away. It would be a good idea to reach out to professional painting store for specific advice.

 Q: Can this shed be placed directly on a concrete pad without flooring?
 Asked by: Luke


 
			  - 7/6/2016

 A: It includes the flooring, but a concrete pad is ideal. The flooring is still necessary since it holds the shed together.

 Q: Do you know someone that can build it in the Glen Allen, VA (23060) area? Can small stones (pebble size) be used to put it on or is concrete the best-interested in the 8X15?
 Asked by: David


 
			  - 4/29/2016

 A: The manufacturer recommends placing the shed on a flat structure such as a wooden foundation made of treated 2x4's and OSB board that you can pick up from your local home improvement store.  The instructions show just how to build it and what materials are needed.  The other recommendation is a concrete slab.  The concrete slab is more pricey to erect.  Some customers put it on cinderblocks, pea gravel, or other flat structures.  The important thing is to make sure it is flat and drains well.  If it isn't flat you may run into issues with your doors closing properly.  Feel free to contact us with any other questions. For assembly you can call 855-544-8854.

 Q: I plan on pouring a concrete slab to put shed on. How do I anchor the building to the slab ?
 Asked by: CH Bryant


 
			  - 3/7/2016

 A: The instruction manual explains how to do this. On the interior there are 4 spots where you drill a hole into the concrete and attach it with the concrete anchor (sold separately from your local hardware store). Putting it on a concrete slab is ideal. Anchoring your shed is completely optional.

 Q: How insulated is the interior of the shed?
 Asked by: customer


 
			  - 2/23/2016

 A: These are not insulated. They are blow molded so there is a little bit of natural insulation, but not enough to consider it "insulation".

 Q: Do you ship to Canada?
 Asked by: Admin


 
			  - 8/12/2015 1:12:01 AM

 A: Yes, we can ship this item to Canada. However, as our cost to do so is very high, Canadian customers are frequently able to get the product across the border cheaper than we can. If you have a United States address we can ship to, you will typically save money bringing it across the border, paying the required fees, than for us to ship directly to you. Shipping costs on the shed is noted in the "Check Ship Rates" link at the top of the listing.

 Q: Do I need to pull the boxes off the truck?
 Asked by: Admin


 
			  - 8/12/2015

 A: Most of the delivery trucking companies we use for this shed will have machines on the back of their trucks, called lift gates, which will lower the boxes to the ground for you. However, in rare instances, the freight truck will not have that machine handy. In those cases, the boxes will need to be pulled off one at a time. Please make sure you plan your appointment accordingly so you can get sufficient help.

Thank you for your feedback.
If you need help or have a question for Customer Service, please visit the Help Section.Building Sets from Amazon.comIntroduced early in life, the love of learning can last for years and years. The building sets from Amazon.com help girls and boys learn how to set goals, plan ahead and overcome challenges. You’ll be amazed at the things kids can think of and then create using even the simplest building blocks. 
From advanced LEGO sets to larger and simpler DUPLO blocks and Megabloks, we have something perfect for every age level. Build castles, pillboxes, racecars, barns and more. Building sets never get old, you can always take old creations apart and keep building and rebuilding an infinite possibility of machines, buildings and vehicles. 
If you want a little more direction, Amazon.com offers plenty of specific building sets to recreate the Space Needle, the Empire State Building, the Guggenheim Museum, Frank Lloyd Wright’s Fallingwater, and more. It’s a great way to study modern architectural design and engineering while having a blast. The completed building sets of local land marks look great on office desks or at home.   
We have building sets for almost anything you can imagine, including Ferris wheels, roller coasters, the White House, Transformers, spooky graveyards and scenes from your favorite adventure movies. Our Tegu blocks also make a great office desk toy to help you decompress before or after difficult meetings. These building blocks are made with just magnets and high-quality natural woods; they’ll look beautiful lying around when they’re not in use.

Building sets can begin a lifelong hobby of construction and engineering. They help you develop reasoning and planning skills that are invaluable to your daily life. If you’re looking for a way to spend more time with your kids, building sets could be the perfect solution.
