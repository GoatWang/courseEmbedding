About HTG Molecular Diagnostics (NASDAQ:HTGM)
HTG Molecular Diagnostics, Inc. is a commercial-stage company that develops and markets a technology platform to facilitate the routine use of complex molecular profiling. The Company's HTG Edge and HTG EdgeSeq platforms, consisting of instrumentation, consumables and software analytics, are used in sample profiling applications, including tumor profiling, molecular diagnostic testing and biomarker development. The Company's HTG Edge and HTG EdgeSeq platforms automate the molecular profiling of genes and gene activity using its nuclease protection chemistry on a range of biological samples. The Company's HTG EdgeSeq chemistry, together with its HTG Edge or HTG EdgeSeq instrumentation and software, automates and adapts its nuclease protection chemistry to enable analysis using next generation sequencing (NGS) instrumentation. The HTG EdgeSeq system utilizes substantially the same sample preparation reagents as its original chemistry, but allows for read out on an NGS instrument.

What are analysts saying about HTG Molecular Diagnostics stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about HTG Molecular Diagnostics stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "HTG Molecular Diagnostics, Inc. is engaged in developing and marketing a technology platform which consists of instrumentation, consumables and software analytics for sample profiling applications including tumor profiling, molecular diagnostic testing and biomarker development. Its products include HTG Edge System, HTG Edge Assays and HTG Assay Direct. HTG Molecular Diagnostics, Inc. is headquartered in Tucson, Arizona.   " (7/18/2017)
2. HC Wainwright analysts commented, "We note that the launch of this new assay comes on schedule and expands the company’s existing menu following the launch of HTG EdgeSeq EGFR, KRAS and BRAF Mutation Assays for research use. Investors may recall that this assay was designed for retrospective gene expression profiling (GEP) to complement traditional immunohistochemistry (IHC) testing, allowing investigators to assess mRNA expression of large numbers of biomarkers—up to 470 mRNA targets in this case—when formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) sample availability is limited. Importantly, small and minimally invasive tissue biopsies are the trend nowadays in diagnostics, and within this setting, EdgeSeq PATH Assay allows for a more comprehensive profiling than conventional IHC. This may potentially lead to new GEP-based diagnostic or prognostic tests in oncology and beyond, in our view." (6/29/2017)

Consensus Ratings for HTG Molecular Diagnostics (NASDAQ:HTGM) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings.

What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.
