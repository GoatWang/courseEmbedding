About to move cross-country and looking for mover recommendations (or tips). Not much furniture, mostly boxes. Thanks in advance!

Oh and also looking for clean moving boxes if you've got any lying around!

Hi, Lynda. Good luck with your move :)! Interconex, Inc. 383 Main Avenue, 6 th Floor Norwalk, CT  06851 USA Aida Acevedo ph 203.295.2253 email aida.acevedo@interconex.com website www.interconex.com Chicago-area office Interconex - Bartlett 236 Hardt Circle Bartlett, IL  60103 USA ph 1.800.242.8514 or 630.246.7100 email info@interconex.com or rates@interconex.com or salesinfo@interconex.com My brother used Interconex to move from Chicago to San Fransisco (along with his family and the related accoutrement) in 2013 and they were very pleased with the service. His co paid for the move, so I’m not sure of the cost/how competitive the prices are.
