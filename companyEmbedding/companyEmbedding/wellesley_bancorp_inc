WELLESLEY, Mass., July 27, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Wellesley Bancorp, Inc. (Nasdaq Capital Market: WEBK) (the "Company"), the holding company for Wellesley Bank (the "Bank"), reported net income of $937 thousand and $1.8 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, respectively.  These results compare to net income of $727 thousand and $1.5 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively. The results for the quarter represent an increase of 28.9%, as compared to the prior year second quarter results.  Diluted earnings per share were $0.38 and $0.74 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, respectively.  Total assets were $732.3 million at June 30, 2017, an increase of $37.1 million, or 5.3%, from December 31, 2016 as loans increased $41.6 million, funded by an increase in core deposits and long-term debt.  








Thomas J. Fontaine, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "We are pleased with our continued growth in our balance sheet and earnings.  Our credit quality and the net interest margin continue to remain strong and stable."  
Second Quarter EarningsNet income increased $210 thousand, or 28.9%, for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2016, as net interest income increased, partially offset by a decrease in non-interest income and an increase in  non-interest expenses.  Net interest income increased $662 thousand, or 13.6%, to $5.5 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, as compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2016.  This increase was driven primarily by the growth of our loan portfolio, partially offset by higher interest expense from the growth of borrowings and deposits.  The yield on earning assets for the second quarter ended June 30, 2017 was 3.98%, an increase of one basis point from the comparable quarter in 2016.  Deposit and borrowing costs were 0.96% for the second quarter 2017, compared to 0.97% for the second quarter 2016.  The net interest margin was 3.21% for the 2017 quarter, compared to 3.19% for the 2016 quarter, reflecting the increase in earning asset yields and the decrease in deposit and borrowing costs between the two periods.
Non-interest income totaled $449 thousand for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, a decrease of $61 thousand, or 12.0%, compared to the prior year period.  Wealth management fees increased $70 thousand, or 29.4%, compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2017, primarily due to an increase in assets under management.  Total assets under management at Wellesley Investment Partners, including the Bank's investment portfolio, were $339.5 million at the end of the second quarter 2017, as compared to $289.3 million at June, 2016.  Income from mortgage banking activities decreased $87 thousand, primarily due to lower sales of fixed rate mortgage loans from the previous year.  Customer commercial loan swap fees decreased $42 thousand due to lower volume in 2017.
Total non-interest expenses increased $258 thousand to $4.3 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2017.  Salaries and employee benefits increased $123 thousand from the prior year period due to several strategic hires late in 2016.    FDIC insurance costs increased $68 thousand, due to growth and new quarterly assessment rates in 2017.  Data processing expense increased $43 thousand and other general administrative costs, such as advertising and insurance, increased $100 thousand due to expanding business volumes and operations. Professional fees decreased $96 thousand, as one time charges were incurred during 2016 for certain staffing searches.  
Year to Date EarningsNet income for the six months ended June 30, 2017 increased $359 thousand, or 24.6%, compared to net income for the six months ended June 30, 2016 due to increased net interest income and non-interest income, partially offset by higher non-interest expenses.  Net interest income increased $1.1 million, or 11.1%, to $10.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017, as compared to $9.7 million in the comparable 2016 period.  The increase was largely due to increased loan income resulting from growth in our portfolio.  Our earning asset yield was 3.95% in the six month period ended June 30, 2017 as compared to 3.99% in the 2016 period.  Deposit and borrowing costs decreased two basis points to 0.95% in the current period from 0.97% for the 2016 period.  Our net interest margin was 3.18% for the 2017 six month period, compared to 3.20% for the 2016 period.
Non-interest income totaled $970 thousand, an increase of $115 thousand, or 13.5%, as income from wealth management fees in 2017 increased $154 thousand compared to 2016 due to an increase in assets under management.  Income from mortgage banking activities decreased $76 thousand as compared to the comparable 2017 period due to lower mortgage sales.  Fees on commercial loan swaps increased $38 thousand from 2016 to 2017 due to increased volume.
For the six months ended June 30, 2017, non-interest expenses increased $645 thousand to $8.6 million, as compared to $8.0 million in 2016.  Salaries and employee benefits increased $430 thousand, or 9.2%, attributable to the recognition of six full months of expenses related to our Newton Centre office along with several strategic hires in late 2016.  FDIC insurance costs increased $138 thousand based on growth and new assessment rates.  Occupancy and equipment expense increased $53 thousand resulting from normal rent increases and the 2016 spring opening of our Newton Centre office.  Data processing expense increased $48 thousand and other general administrative costs increased $90 thousand due to expanding business volumes and operations. Professional fees decreased $114 thousand, as one time charges were incurred during 2016 for certain staffing searches.  
Balance Sheet GrowthTotal assets were $732.3 million at June 30, 2017, representing an increase of $37.1 million compared to $695.3 million at December 31, 2016.  The increase was primarily related to growth in the loan portfolio and an increase in the level of securities available for sale.  On the liability side, deposits increased $12.4 million, and long-term debt and short-term borrowings increased $20.8 million, as compared to December 31, 2016.   
Gross loans totaled $623.1 million at June 30, 2017, an increase of $41.6 million, or 7.1%, as compared to December 31, 2016.  Residential mortgage loans increased $29.1 million to $297.1 million at June 30, 2017, primarily due to growth in our adjustable-rate mortgage portfolio.  Our portfolios of commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans increased $2.7 million and $1.1 million, respectively, continuing our diversification focus.  Construction loans increased $7.9 million to $118.3 million at June 30, 2017, compared to $110.4 million at December 31, 2016.  
Deposits increased $12.4 million to $535.2 million at June 30, 2017.  The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in money market accounts of $13.6 million and certificate of deposits of $2.1 million.  NOW and demand deposit balances increased $1.3 million.  We have emphasized commercial deposit accounts in our business development efforts and have experienced growth in the number of accounts.  Commercial deposit balances tend to be more volatile, fluctuating with customers' needs. Savings accounts decreased $4.6 million as compared to December 31, 2016.  Long-term debt and short-term borrowings, consisting entirely of advances from the FHLB, increased $20.8 million as compared to December 31, 2016. 
Stockholders' equity increased $2.5 million to $57.7 million, primarily due to earnings and the impact of stock compensation plans during the six month period, offset by dividends paid.  At June 30, 2017, the Company's ratio of stockholders' equity to total assets was 7.87%, compared to 7.94% at December 31, 2016.

        Wellesley Bancorp, Inc. Reports Results for the Three and
        Six Months Ended June 30, 2017
      

        PR Newswire
      

        WELLESLEY, Mass., July 27, 2017
      



WELLESLEY, Mass.,
        July 27, 2017 /PRNewswire/ --
        Wellesley Bancorp, Inc. (Nasdaq Capital Market: WEBK) (the
        "Company"), the holding company for Wellesley Bank (the "Bank"), reported
        net income of $937 thousand
        and $1.8 million for the
        three and six months ended June 30,
        2017, respectively.  These results compare to
        net income of $727 thousand
        and $1.5 million for the
        three and six months ended June 30,
        2016, respectively. The results for the quarter
        represent an increase of 28.9%, as compared to the prior
        year second quarter results.  Diluted earnings per
        share were $0.38 and
        $0.74 for the three and six
        months ended June 30, 2017,
        respectively.  Total assets were $732.3 million at June 30, 2017, an increase of
        $37.1 million, or 5.3%, from
        December 31, 2016 as loans
        increased $41.6 million,
        funded by an increase in core deposits and long-term
        debt.  
      






Thomas J. Fontaine,
        President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "We are
        pleased with our continued growth in our balance sheet and
        earnings.  Our credit quality and the net interest
        margin continue to remain strong and stable." 
      

Second Quarter EarningsNet income
        increased $210 thousand, or
        28.9%, for the quarter ended June
        30, 2017 compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2016, as net interest income
        increased, partially offset by a decrease in non-interest
        income and an increase in  non-interest
        expenses.  Net interest income increased $662 thousand, or 13.6%, to $5.5 million for the quarter ended
        June 30, 2017, as compared to
        the quarter ended June 30,
        2016.  This increase was driven primarily by the
        growth of our loan portfolio, partially offset by higher
        interest expense from the growth of borrowings and
        deposits.  The yield on earning assets for the second
        quarter ended June 30, 2017
        was 3.98%, an increase of one basis point from the
        comparable quarter in 2016.  Deposit and borrowing
        costs were 0.96% for the second quarter 2017, compared to
        0.97% for the second quarter 2016.  The net interest
        margin was 3.21% for the 2017 quarter, compared to 3.19%
        for the 2016 quarter, reflecting the increase in earning
        asset yields and the decrease in deposit and borrowing
        costs between the two periods.
      

        Non-interest income totaled $449
        thousand for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, a decrease of $61 thousand, or 12.0%, compared to the
        prior year period.  Wealth management fees increased
        $70 thousand, or 29.4%,
        compared to the quarter ended June
        30, 2017, primarily due to an increase in assets
        under management.  Total assets under management at
        Wellesley Investment Partners, including the Bank's
        investment portfolio, were $339.5
        million at the end of the second quarter 2017, as
        compared to $289.3 million at
        June, 2016.  Income from mortgage banking activities
        decreased $87 thousand,
        primarily due to lower sales of fixed rate mortgage loans
        from the previous year.  Customer commercial loan swap
        fees decreased $42 thousand
        due to lower volume in 2017.
      

        Total non-interest expenses increased $258 thousand to $4.3 million for the quarter ended
        June 30, 2017.  Salaries
        and employee benefits increased $123
        thousand from the prior year period due to several
        strategic hires late in 2016.    FDIC
        insurance costs increased $68
        thousand, due to growth and new quarterly assessment
        rates in 2017.  Data processing expense increased
        $43 thousand and other
        general administrative costs, such as advertising and
        insurance, increased $100
        thousand due to expanding business volumes and
        operations. Professional fees decreased $96 thousand, as one time charges were
        incurred during 2016 for certain staffing searches. 
      

Year to Date EarningsNet income for the
        six months ended June 30,
        2017 increased $359
        thousand, or 24.6%, compared to net income for the
        six months ended June 30,
        2016 due to increased net interest income and
        non-interest income, partially offset by higher
        non-interest expenses.  Net interest income increased
        $1.1 million, or 11.1%, to
        $10.8 million for the six
        months ended June 30, 2017,
        as compared to $9.7 million
        in the comparable 2016 period.  The increase was
        largely due to increased loan income resulting from growth
        in our portfolio.  Our earning asset yield was 3.95%
        in the six month period ended June
        30, 2017 as compared to 3.99% in the 2016 period.
         Deposit and borrowing costs decreased two basis
        points to 0.95% in the current period from 0.97% for the
        2016 period.  Our net interest margin was 3.18% for
        the 2017 six month period, compared to 3.20% for the 2016
        period.
      

        Non-interest income totaled $970
        thousand, an increase of $115
        thousand, or 13.5%, as income from wealth management
        fees in 2017 increased $154
        thousand compared to 2016 due to an increase in
        assets under management.  Income from mortgage banking
        activities decreased $76
        thousand as compared to the comparable 2017 period
        due to lower mortgage sales.  Fees on commercial loan
        swaps increased $38 thousand
        from 2016 to 2017 due to increased volume.
      

        For the six months ended June 30,
        2017, non-interest expenses increased $645 thousand to $8.6 million, as compared to $8.0 million in 2016.  Salaries and
        employee benefits increased $430
        thousand, or 9.2%, attributable to the recognition
        of six full months of expenses related to our Newton Centre office along with
        several strategic hires in late 2016.  FDIC insurance
        costs increased $138 thousand
        based on growth and new assessment rates.  Occupancy
        and equipment expense increased $53
        thousand resulting from normal rent increases and
        the 2016 spring opening of our Newton Centre office.  Data
        processing expense increased $48
        thousand and other general administrative costs
        increased $90 thousand due to
        expanding business volumes and operations. Professional
        fees decreased $114 thousand,
        as one time charges were incurred during 2016 for certain
        staffing searches. 
      

Balance Sheet GrowthTotal assets were
        $732.3 million at
        June 30, 2017, representing
        an increase of $37.1 million
        compared to $695.3 million at
        December 31, 2016.  The
        increase was primarily related to growth in the loan
        portfolio and an increase in the level of securities
        available for sale.  On the liability side, deposits
        increased $12.4 million, and
        long-term debt and short-term borrowings increased
        $20.8 million, as compared to
        December 31,
        2016.   
      

        Gross loans totaled $623.1
        million at June 30,
        2017, an increase of $41.6
        million, or 7.1%, as compared to December 31, 2016.  Residential
        mortgage loans increased $29.1
        million to $297.1
        million at June 30,
        2017, primarily due to growth in our adjustable-rate
        mortgage portfolio.  Our portfolios of commercial real
        estate and commercial and industrial loans increased
        $2.7 million and $1.1 million, respectively, continuing
        our diversification focus.  Construction loans
        increased $7.9 million to
        $118.3 million at
        June 30, 2017, compared to
        $110.4 million at
        December 31,
        2016.  
      

        Deposits increased $12.4
        million to $535.2
        million at June 30,
        2017.  The increase was primarily attributable to an
        increase in money market accounts of $13.6 million and certificate of deposits
        of $2.1 million.  NOW
        and demand deposit balances increased $1.3 million.  We have emphasized
        commercial deposit accounts in our business development
        efforts and have experienced growth in the number of
        accounts.  Commercial deposit balances tend to be more
        volatile, fluctuating with customers' needs. Savings
        accounts decreased $4.6
        million as compared to December 31, 2016.  Long-term debt
        and short-term borrowings, consisting entirely of advances
        from the FHLB, increased $20.8
        million as compared to December 31, 2016.
      

        Stockholders' equity increased $2.5
        million to $57.7
        million, primarily due to earnings and the impact of
        stock compensation plans during the six month period,
        offset by dividends paid.  At June 30, 2017, the Company's ratio of
        stockholders' equity to total assets was 7.87%, compared to
        7.94% at December 31, 2016.

Forward Looking StatementsThis press
        release contains certain forward-looking statements about
        the Company and the Bank.  Forward-looking statements
        include statements regarding anticipated future events and
        can be identified by the fact that they do not relate
        strictly to historical or current facts.  They often
        include words such as "believe," "expect," "anticipate,"
        "estimate," and "intend" or future or conditional verbs
        such as "will," "would," "should," "could," or "may." 
        Forward-looking statements, by their nature, are subject to
        risks and uncertainties.  Certain factors that could
        cause actual results to differ materially from expected
        results include increased competitive pressures, changes in
        the interest rate environment, general economic conditions
        or conditions within the securities markets, and
        legislative and regulatory changes that could adversely
        affect the business in which the Company and the Bank are
        engaged.
