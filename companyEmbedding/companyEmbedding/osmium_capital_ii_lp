Osmium Partners






 















          Established in 2002, Osmium Partners, LLC is a leading investment management firm headquartered in the San Francisco Bay Area. We focus on investing in high-quality, small capitalization public equities via an exhaustive, bottom-up research process.
        










Investment Strategy









          We seek to generate strong, risk-adjusted returns by investing in undervalued, small capitalization companies across US equity markets.
          Our research process is based on eight simple factors involving balance sheet strength, aligned interests, attractive reinvestment
          opportunities, a low valuation, and reasonable growth prospects. As engaged owners, we actively discuss corporate strategy and capital
          structure with management teams and boards of directors. We prefer to conduct these discussions in private, but we will publicly debate
          important items with all shareholders when appropriate.
