Objectives of Seed Tackifier:

Tack seeds in place
Minimize Fugitive Dust during seed germination
Retain moisture for healthy seed growth

 
Our pine rosin emulsion is extremely effective at binding surface fines and holding seeds in place during the early stages of a re-seeding program.  In wide open areas such as TMA’s the winds can be strong and persistent making it difficult to keep the seeds in place.  Without a tackifier, the seeds simply blow away.
Application of ENS Solutions’ pine rosin emulsion on top of the seeds will hold the seeds and dust in place until the plants can take hold.

PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE – ROAD BASE STABILIZATION
 








Objectives of Road Base Stabilization:

Extend life of surface treatment
Reduce maintenance costs
Save time and money during construction

 
Enssolutions’ pine rosin emulsion is extremely effective at stabilizing road bases.  By stabilizing the road base, you will extend the life of your surface treatment and reduce maintenance of your roadway.  With chloride stabilization you need to wait 10 days, with little to no rain, for the base to cure.  With our emulsion there is no cure period and no delays!

New Series of Products with ECO
7:10 pmens-admin 

         



ECO advanced nanotechnology is modernizing the way we stabilize soils and aggregates in addition to controlling dust and erosion for a whole new generation. ECO applications are extensive ranging from simple backyard trails and construction sites to heavy-lift military cargo runways.

Once applied to the soil or aggregate, the copolymer molecules coalesce forming bonds between the soil or aggregate particles. The key advantage of ECO Polymer originates with its long, nanoparticle molecular structure that link and cross-link together. As the water dissipates from the soil or aggregate, a durable and water resistant matrix of flexible solid-mass is created. Once cured, ECO becomes completely transparent, leaving the natural landscape to appear untouched. 

 





 



ENS Solutions | Advantages to Help Your Solar Operation
11:10 amens-admin 

         



Why work with Enssolutions?
Our customers tell us four things that make us different:

PERFORMANCE
Our Pine Pitch outperforms other products, especially in traffic areas due to its non-water soluble and thermoelastic properties.
It does not fracture like polymers, or wash away like salts and lignins.

INNOVATION
A diverse line of innovative products custom-designed for performance and value creation

RELIABILITY
Consistent, dependable quality from a corporate principle of operational excellence

KNOWLEDGE
Analytical and technological capabilities to evaluate the best products that meet our customer’s needs.

To find out how we can use these advantages to help your solar operation, please contact us by phone at:
877.520.6767 or by email office@enssolutions.com

 





 



TerraTOP Specialized Pine Pitch Emulsion
11:10 amens-admin 

         



Terra T.O.P. is a unique blend of a lignin and T.O.P. Pine Pitch Emulsion, that creates a long lasting road surface that holds up to rain and traffic at an economic discount from just a straight T.O.P. Pine Pitch Emulsion application. In the Sulfite process the lignins are sulfonated and become water soluble, on their own they can leach or fail after a short period of time with traffic and rain but by adding T.O.P. Pine Pitch Emulsion, it becomes a much stronger stabilizer. This helps bind the lignin to the aggregate creating a non water soluble surface that is water resistant. The lignin helps the Pine Pitch penetrate deeper into the surface to give the roadway a stronger more durable surface that will hold up to weather and traffic. This blend will last longer than just regular Lignin or Lignin mixed with Mag Chlorides on their own.

Here are some important facts and details:
– TerraT.O.P. meets or exceeds PM-10 standards
– Improving travel safety
– Conserving water – constant watering no longer required
– Improving public relations
– Convenient application – Can drive on the treated area next day
– Long-term cost savings – higher residual and reduced future application rates
– Non-toxic ingredients – not harmful to humans, animals or plants
– Custom blends for specific climates or soil types
– Reduced Carbon Footprint
– Saves money on labor and equipment cost
– Reduces dust in agriculture areas where dust mites are a factor
– Fewer potholes and less wash boarding
– Increased low bearing capacity, a firmer road surface without loose gravel.

PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE – RAP/GSA PAVING
 









Objectives of Paving with RAP/GSA:

Cost effective alternative to hot-mix
Save money by using millings from pavement rehabilitation jobs
Reduce emissions by using pine rosin which has no VOC’s

 
Enssolutions’ pine rosin emulsion is extremely effective at bonding recycled asphalt millings.  This application provides a truly sustainable, green solution through the re-use of old pavement bonded with product made from a renewable resource.  Controlled lab testing has shown that use of our pine rosin emulsion produces a stronger surface than asphalt emulsion.  In situ testing side by side with an asphalt emulsion bonded lane has demonstrated a durable surface at least equal to the asphalt emulsion after more than 4 years under temperatures ranging from -25°C to +35°C (-13°F to 95°F).
