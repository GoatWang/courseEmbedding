How do I choose a lawyer?Consider the following: 
Comfort Level - Are you comfortable telling the lawyer personal
information? Does the lawyer seem interested in solving your problem? 
Credentials - How long has the lawyer been in practice? Has
the lawyer worked on other cases similar to yours? 
Cost - How are the lawyer's fees structured - hourly or flat
fee? Can the lawyer estimate the cost of your case? 
City - Is the lawyer's office conveniently located?
Not sure what questions to ask a lawyer?Here are a few to get you started:

How long have you been in practice?
How many cases like mine have you handled?
How often do you settle cases out of court?
What are your fees and costs?
What are the next steps?

JOIN THE LISTClickFIND A STORECold War Laboratory: Rand, The Air Force, And The American State, 1945 1950by Collins, Martin J.In 1946, before the start of the Cold War with the Soviet Union, the Army Air Forces established Project RAND   a groundbreaking 'think tank' designed to link leaders in the military and aircraft industry. Modern war was now total war, a contest between entire societies, and demanded the commitment of peacetime preparation. Martin J. Collins examines the critical years of this experiment through an evolving cast of key individuals and investigates in-depth the scientific and social birth of systems analysis.20th Century, Military ScienceCondition: --HPB condition ratingsNew: Item is brand new, unused and unmarked, in flawless condition.Fine/Like New (F): No defects, little usage.
