HAMILTON, N.J. and PLANO, Texas, Nov. 19, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Bai Brands, makers of Bai 5, a line of all-natural, five-calorie, antioxidant-infused beverages, and Dr Pepper Snapple Group (NYSE:   DPS) today announced a major distribution agreement.
Dr Pepper Snapple Group (NYSE:  DPS), a leading producer of flavored beverages in the Americas and an innovator in the non-carbonated beverages sector, has extensive direct to store and warehouse delivery capabilities.

"Our relationship with Dr Pepper Snapple Group will allow us to rapidly roll-out Bai to new markets and into the hands of those consumers."
"We have tested the Bai brand in select markets with great success over the last several quarters," said Jeff Conrad, Vice President of Market Development for DPS.

"Over many years, DPS has expertly assembled what we feel is the most competitive route to market for beverages in this country," said Ken Kurtz, President of Bai Brands. "The great taste, all natural ingredients and use of the coffeefruit as a source of antioxidants are driving strong consumer demand for Bai, and so we are very pleased to work with DPS to complete our national distribution footprint."

Evolution of Dr Pepper Snapple
Dr Pepper Snapple was formed in 2008 with the spinoff of Cadbury Schweppes Americas Beverages (or CSAB) from Cadbury Schweppes Plc. Formed in 2003, Cadbury Schweppes Americas Beverages combined Cadbury Schweppes’ four North American beverage businesses, namely Dr Pepper/Seven Up, Inc., Snapple Beverage Corp., Mott’s LLP, and Bebidas Mexico, bringing more than 50 leading brands under its portfolio.



The company’s flagship brand, Dr Pepper, a nonalcoholic beverage with a unique blend of 23 flavors, was created in 1885 by a pharmacist named Charles Alderton.
Competitive scenario
In an industry highly dominated by The Coca-Cola Company (KO) and PepsiCo Inc. (PEP), Dr Pepper Snapple has rapidly emerged as the third-largest soft drink maker in the United States. In addition to the two behemoths, the company also competes with Nestlé S.A., Kraft Foods Group Inc. (KRFT), Campbell Soup Company (CPB), Monster Beverage Corporation (MNST), and Cott Corporation (COT).
Instead of having exposure to only one company, you can diversify your holdings through ETFs. For instance, the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLP) has holdings in beverage companies such as Dr Pepper Snapple, PepsiCo, and Coca-Cola.
In this series on Dr Pepper Snapple, we’ll discuss the company’s products, growth strategy, distribution strategy, recent performance, and future prospects.
