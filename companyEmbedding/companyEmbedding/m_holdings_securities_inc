The Vision



Our Founders saw that traditional life insurance products and distribution systems weren't serving their most valuable clients. They started M Financial Group in 1978 with the goal of creating products and services for affluent clients that would return the value to those who created it. Nearly four decades later, M Financial continues to deliver value to clients on a daily basis.

How We Do It



We create exclusive life insurance products that affluent and corporate clients deserve. By segmenting the experience data that drives product pricing, and by investing our own capital into the policies placed by our Firms, we create pricing efficiencies that can't be matched.

Our mission is simple: to treat existing clients as well as new clients. Everything we do is designed to advocate on behalf of Member Firm clients: due care, product development, underwriting, reinsurance, and in-force management. We care about our clients, their success, and the sustainability of the solutions we provide.

About M Financial






Our Founding





In 1978, four visionaries came together to form M Financial Group with an idea that clients with better experience characteristics deserved access to better pricing.
Life insurance carriers at the time used delivery systems and products that helped them retain the value created by the most profitable policies, instead of returning it to those clients who helped create it.
So M Financial was established with a new distribution network of entrepreneurial Member Firms. Working together with select carriers, we created better products for affluent clients and distributed them through this exclusive network of Member Firms.
In the decades since, we have cultivated an exclusive community of Member Firms across the U.S., in the U.K., and in the UAE, and have expanded our solutions beyond life insurance to include Disability Insurance, Long-Term Care Insurance, Annuities, Corporate Benefits, Wealth Management, and International Insurance Solutions.






In everything we do, we are guided by five core values, ensuring we remain true to the original mission of creating the best solutions for our clients.







Core Values

Yesterday's best will not be good enough tomorrow.


We connect the dots in ways no one else has seen before. We work tirelessly to identify better, more efficient ways to enhance the quality of your life—by leveraging the experience of some of the nation's smartest, most experienced firms whose clients always expect more. This drives our passion for innovation.






We make each other better by being our best for clients.


Companies measure success in many ways, but how clients feel about us is what really counts. Our Firms strive for excellence in the services, expertise, and customized products they provide their clients. We support their efforts to continually enhance the client experience with unique products, process efficiency, and leading-edge technology.






We willingly share information, ideas, and insight.


Exceeding clients' expectations requires team effort. Member Firms happily collaborate with attorneys, CPAs, family offices, other advisors, and one another to develop strategies that address specific planning objectives. From estate tax to income planning, business succession to asset protection, our Firms bring the ideas, insight, and execution that their clients deserve.






We step forward when called upon and do what we say we will do.


Leadership is about doing what you say, not saying what you do. To advocate for the interests of Member Firm clients, we participate in the legislative and regulatory processes that impact their families and businesses, and ours. Additionally, we strive to help clients and advisors better understand opportunities that provide the best solutions, and the role our innovative products and services play in capturing those opportunities.






If you succeed, we succeed.


French economist Frederic Bastiat said, "If you wish to prosper, let your customer prosper." It is one thing to say you advocate for clients, but another to do it. Innovative products, underwriting, reinsurance, due care, in-force management, and technology are how we do it. Member Firm clients place their trust in us and that trust pays off when we create meaningful value for them, their families, and their businesses.

For nearly four decades, our Founders' five core values have fueled our differentiation, and they continue to guide us each and every day.

Fourteen Member Firm Principals have served as President of AALU; dozens more have served on the AALU Board and various committees.


Since 1957, AALU has been the trusted, influential voice in Washington, D.C. representing the most successful life insurance professionals. With a singular focus on the issues impacting life insurance products, professionals, and clients, AALU has a heritage of leadership and success ensuring that life insurance continues to be taxed appropriately. AALU’s mission is to promote, preserve, and protect advanced life insurance planning for the benefit of its members, their clients, the industry, and the general public.






M Financial is the only producer organization that is an active member of the American Council of Life Insurers (ACLI).


As a Washington, D.C.-based trade association with approximately 300 member companies operating in the United States and abroad, the American Council of Life Insurers (ACLI) advocates in federal, state, and international forums for public policy that supports the industry marketplace and the 75 million American families that rely on life insurers’ products for financial and retirement security. ACLI members offer life insurance, annuities, retirement plans, long-term care and disability income insurance, and reinsurance, representing more than 90 percent of industry assets and premiums.






Our involvement in FSI reflects the growing diversity of our business and the value others place on the expertise and influence resident within the M Community.


The Financial Services Institute (FSI) was founded in 2004 with a clear mission: to ensure all individuals have access to competent and affordable financial advice, products, and services delivered by a growing network of independent financial advisors and independent financial services firms. Everything FSI does starts and ends with working to create a healthier, more business-friendly regulatory environment for independent financial services firms and independent financial advisors who provide affordable, unbiased advice to hard-working Main Street Americans.






Our collective service on various TAC boards and committees is consistent with our commitment to client advocacy.


The American College (TAC) mission is to raise the level of professionalism of its students and, by extension, the financial services industry as a whole. By imparting expert knowledge—and by emphasizing that such knowledge must be regularly renewed and ethically applied—TAC seeks to strengthen not only its students’ professionalism, but also the financial security of individuals, families, businesses, and the societies they serve.
