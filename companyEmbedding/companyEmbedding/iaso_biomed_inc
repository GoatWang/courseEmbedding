Persimmon Leaves are high in fiber and contain tannins which have anti-hypertensive, anti-carcinogenic, and anti-mutagenic properties.

Marsh Mallow is rich in calcium, zinc, iron, sodium, iodine, vitamin B complex, and pantothenic acid.  Marsh Mallow has been used to treat sore throats and to alleviate heart burn because it becomes slick when exposed to fluids which results in a slippery material that coats the lining of the mouth, throat, and stomach.  Marsh Mallow is also used to soothe and soften irritated skin, and as a remedy for cuts, wounds, abscesses, boils, burns, and varicose veins.  


Blessed Thistle has been used as an appetite stimulant, astringent, blood purifier, bile flow stimulant, sweat stimulant, digestion enhancement, fever reducer, memory improver, menstrual flow stimulant and salivation stimulant. It has also been shown to be useful for indigestion and heartburn.  In herbal medicine, Blessed Thistle is used for cancer, infections, inflammation, gallbladder disease, jaundice, liver disorders, cervical dysplasia, heart ailments, skin ulcers, yeast infections, and diarrhea.

Ginger has been used to treat abdominal bloating, coughing, vomiting, diarrhea, and rheumatism.


Chamomile acts medicinally as a tonic, anodyne, antispasmodic, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, anti-allergenic, and sedative.  Chamomile’s mildly sedating and muscle relaxing effects can help people who suffer from insomnia fall asleep more easily.  Chamomile also helps relieve nausea, heartburn, and stress related flatulence.  It may also be used in the treatment of inflammatory bowel conditions such as Crohn’s disease.

TENS Units from LGMedSupply
LGMedSupply has a large selection of portable TENS units for pain relief. Whether youre looking for pain relief from back pain or in other areas of your body, you will find that we offer the best TENS machines and warranties. TENS units are often used as a non-invasive way of electric stimulation for pain relief. A substantial amount of pain relief can be achieved by using a TENS unit properly as the electrode pads cause electric stimulation that travels along nerve fibers, thus creating a pain relieving sensation.
EMS Units from LGMedSupply
We also carry many EMS units. An EMS unit, also known as an electrical muscle stimulator, electronic muscle stimulator, electric muscle stimulator or electro muscle stimulator, can be used as a therapy tool for patients, a strength training tool for athletes and healthy individuals, and even as a testing tool for the evaluation of neural and muscular function.
Electrical muscle stimulation is the use of electric impulses to cause muscle contraction. EMS units provide electrical current that passes through the muscle and causes the muscle to contract. Electrical impulses generated by the EMS machine are delivered through electrodes placed on the skin next to the muscles that need electronic muscle stimulation.  Electrical muscle stimulation can also accelerate the muscle learning process by providing its users with repeated contractions.
A Large Selection of TENS EMS Combo Units
TENS units and EMS units work the same way. An EMS unit will stimulate muscles, whereas a TENS unit will stimulate nerve endings. Many pain sufferers use a combination of both TENS and EMS to provide a maximum amount of relief and muscle stimulation. We carry a large selection of portable Combo TENS / EMS units to combine the benefits of nerve ending stimulation and electronic muscle stimulation.
Portable Ultrasound Machines for the Home from LGMedSupply
We also carry a large selection of portable ultrasonic machines for use at home. These home ultrasound machines stimulate tissue beneath the skin surface by using very high frequency sound waves. Home ultrasound machines can make the healing process much faster by increasing blood flow. They can also diminish the amount of pain due to a decrease in swelling and edema. Portable ultrasound machines provides the user a gentle massage of tendons and/or ligaments without adding any stress, all while softening scar tissue.
Having a portable ultrasound machine at home offers long-term pain relief, cost savings, portable therapy, and can reduce healing time and chronic inflammation.

I looked all over the net for over a year to see who was the main Co. that had not only what I needed but who was the Co. that seemed to be the main Manufacturer of the Tens Unit. Then I started checking who had all of the Conductive Designed Pads That my Dr. wanted me to have and here again LG Med Supply had all of the items and were offering the best prices on all of the items that I needed. LG Med Supply was hands down the best in all of the categories as far as who had all of the items that I needed from the Back Belt Strap/Neck electrode/Shoulder and Knee Conductive Designed Pads that my Dr. wanted me to start therapy with. LG Med Supply is the only web site that had a vast selection of different shaped Electrodes which deliver a totally different stimulation that really gives you a completely different feeling then a straight square pad electrode. Thank You LG Med Supply for being there in my time of need.

Colt Technology Services are a European Telecoms and IT Services Business, with about 1.6 billion Euro's in revenue. Their aim is to provide a unified communications IT Services and telephony to both SMB and Enterprise customers. Scott Holmes, Sales Director at Colt talks about their success and why IASO is important for Colt to ensure recovery. So, Colt Technology Services are a European Telecoms and IT Services Business, with about 1.6 billion Euro's in revenue. And really our aim is to provide a unified communications IT Services and telephony to both SMB and Enterprise customers with presence in 13 countries and delivering services in 20 languages. Where IASO is really important to us as a technology partner is it's highly automated, it's a product that covers really any market requirement from very small customers with very simple needs, right up to very large customers with much more complex needs. So what it gives us, and our partner network, is really elegant backup solution that addresses a large part of the market, and is very supportable and very scalable. What's critical with backup technologies isn't really backup at all. It's recovery. And what we're addressing here is a customer problem of ... something's gone wrong, my system's not available, my data has gone and I need to get it back as quick as possible. What's so great about IASO and how it differentiates is that focus on recovery. Should the worst happen, they would have restored their data very quickly, very elegantly using a number of different tools that ensures they get their business back up and running with a minimum of fuss and delay. Colt and the Ceano brand within Colt is really all about automation. That's the primary driver. And what we really liked with IASO is the flexibility of the automation code. So we use a certain provisioning and billing system and IASO have worked very closely with us to make sure our operation processes can be maintained and the way that we interact with our partners through those systems can be maintained. But beyond that we have also found is terrific marketing support and sales support, training materials. And also, we sort of sometimes look past it, but the quality of the problems as well. The engineering of the solution has been excellent and has really allowed us to kick on and grow that part of our business substantially. So what's obviously important is the quality of the product and it's ability to meet the needs of the customer. And why IASO is such a key partner for us is that every time a customer has appraised the technology. We have been able to provide a solution that meets the customer needs and that allowed us to grow our business in the way that we intended.





Redstor is a data storage, data protection, data management specialist. Founded in 1998, they have been delivering Backup Storage and Archiving services to a broad range of clients based primarily in the UK, but also around the globe. Today their current customer base spans around ten and a half thousand clients, including both local government and also the private sector. Chris Sigley, Managing Director at Redstor speaks about their relationship with IASO and how IASO plays a vital role to Redstor. Redstor is a data storage, data protection, data management specialist. We're founded in 1998 and have always been delivering Backup Storage and Archiving services to a broad range of clients based primarily in the UK, but also around the globe as well. Today our current customer base spands around ten, ten and a half thousand clients, ranging both local government, but also the private sector. IASO plays a vital role to Redstor. The collaboration between Redstor and IASO is quite special. They're a true partner of ours. They understand our business, they understand the requirements of our business and fundamentally, they understand the requirements that our customers have as well. We have a fantastic working relationship on every level within the organization and as a result of that, we can act quickly, we can act confidently and both companies would mutually benefit from the work that goes on. IASO's technology is extremely powerful, extremely high-performance and we find that it outstrips any other technology in the market. For Redstor, it enables us to target new market segments, organizations with multiple Terabytes worth of data and it does that in a number of unique ways. In addition to this, Redstor is also successful with IASO because of commercial arrangements we have. The technology is priced aggressively. It's done in a very simple way that enables, not only Redstor to predict our future growth, but also with our clients we can predict costs and provide a very simple pricing metric that enables clients to fully understand what they are about to embark into when signing up to a backup service with Redstor. I believe that IASO technology also differentiates itself from how simple the management console is. It's very intuitive, and it provides both Redstor and their end-user clients and channel partners, a very simple, easy to view console, that demonstrates what clients are using, how successful backup were, and when and if they need to upgrade their servers. So I think the future between Redstor and IASO is quite exciting. We have a very good working relationship today and we don't see that changing in the future. If anything, we see it enhancing in becoming much stronger. From a support and development perspective, we want to continue feeding like we have an input in the roadmap and the development of the technology. We feel we have to date and we hope we have in the future. We're very excited about the way that the technology is developing and moving forward with many many additions and new features coming out throughout the year.





As a data center hosting company, you are looking for service pillars. The Largest Canadian vCloud service provider Rackforce tells us what they were able to achieve with offering Cloud Backup.Rackforce is Canada's largest vCloud service provider. We offer a wide range of ICT services everything from the ground up design, management of data centers through co-location, up to unify communications as a service, cloud video as well as cloud backup. I'm Tim Dufour, president and CEO of Rackforce Networks. A few years back we were looking for a product that would complement our in house data backup product. We were looking for a product that would scale, would be accessible from any device anywhere. We found that IASO product had all the features were looking for. Data storage is our largest service pillar and is growing rapidly. We feel that the cloud backup service is going to be a large part of our revenue stream in the future, therefore IASO is going to be a huge part of our future. IASO plays a huge role for Rackforce, IASO is the underline technology Rackforce cloud backup. When we engage with IASO, we looked at the business model and the pricing, when it all came together with the feature set, it was the right product for us. Our customers really like the fact that it's a highly automated cloud backup service, very scaleable up to petabytes data storage. It also is a very easy to use the product, from any device anywhere. IASO is a highly automated product, it's set it and forget it until you need it. That's where it really shines, it's got very fast recovery time and it's an easy to use product.





Everything has gone digital and virtual and dissimilar devices need to connect to one another. At IASO we understand the toughest challenges well enough to tackle them with simplicity and efficiency. So we designed an all in one solution for your backup & recovery.In the beginning managing data was straightforward And securing that data was straightforward. Since then things have become more complex. Everything is gone digital and virtual. And the similar devices need to connect to one another. Data can be created by almost anyone and work can be done nearly anywhere and with that comes a high risk factor. When modern data protection continues to advance you end up drowning in hardware and software. The status quo of patching one solution over another does not solve the problem. At IASO we clearly understand the toughest challenges and tackle them with simplicity and efficiency that's why we have designed an all-in-one solution for you. It's hybrid which means you recover from the fastest location either on-site or from the cloud. It saves time by making your back up in minutes instead of hours it works whatever the business environment and is easy to manage through the cloud. It recovers anything anywhere anytime.

Total Life Changes has been around for over 15 years in Asia and Europe but has recently launched in the the United States. We are extremely excited about the opportunity to get in on the ground floor in such an amazing company!
Total Life Changes is dedicated to seeing their business partners flourish and have committed to providing the training, resources, and network that is necessary to get your business off to a great start!
There are 6 different ways to earn with TLC


Fast Start Bonus|Retail Commission|Binary Commission|Matching Bonus|Lifestyle Bonus|Advancement|Fast Start Bonus


Fast Start Bonus
50% Fast Start Bonus

Total Life Changes (TLC) understands the importance of offering people an opportunity to build a business that is affordable and results in immediate cash flow. As an Independent Business Owner (IBO) with TLC, you can receive a 50% commission from the first order (with commissionable volume) from those you personally refer as IBOs. Each IBO you refer is eligible for this program. Commissions for the Fast Start Bonus are paid weekly.

How It Works
You introduced TLC to Tom. Tom is excited and joined your team by purchasing the 50 Pack, which is $500. You will receive a Fast Start Bonus of $250. As you can see, the Fast Start Bonus is not only critical to your immediate success, but the success of every person in your downline as well. Growing your business means emulating the best practices of TLC and continuously implementing them.



Retail Commission



RETAIL COMMISSION

Total Life Changes (TLC) offers you the opportunity to establish a base of customers whose purchases generate retails profits as well as commissionable volume.
TLC has dedicated themselves to researching and selecting the finest all natural, organic products that truly help others maintain overall wellness. They know that not everyone wishes to make the commitment of building a business, but so many have enjoyed the products, they continue to make purchases month after month. These customers play an important role in developing your business as it represents opportunity in both the short-term and long-term.
All customer orders with volume, pay up to 50% commission, paid weekly. The long-term opportunity is the fact that many previous customers have reconsidered their needs and upgraded to an IBO, offering their personal testimonials.



Binary Commission


Binary Pay

A binary, meaning two, is simply having 2 legs, a left leg and a right leg. These legs grow from you and others who add new IBOs that order products. These products are assigned commissionable volume to grow your left leg and right leg. As your volume grows in each leg, you advance in rank. The total volume of these legs determine which side will earn commission in a given week. You will be paid a percentage, ranging from 10% to 25% based on your lesser leg’s (weak leg) volume. These commissions are paid weekly with a $20,000 binary cap.

How It Works

Your have 1,000 volume in your left leg and your right leg has 2,500 volume. This qualifies you as a Director. In this example, your lesser (weaker) leg is your left leg. You will receive a binary commission of $120 (12% of 1,000 volume in the weaker leg). Your stronger leg (right) will be flushed of 1,000 volume (equal to your weak leg), leaving 1,500 volume to be carried over or banked for the strong leg’s following week.
Additionally, your personally sponsored IBOs earned a $50 binary commission. You will also receive a matching binary commission of $25. That $145 in binary commissions. This example doesn’t include the Fast Start Bonuses and retail commissions you earn.
As you achieve higher rankings and volume due to your business’s growth, you will qualify to higher percentages in the binary as well as the matching bonus on your 1st and 2nd personal levels in your organization.




Matching Bonus



1ST LEVEL MATCHING BONUS
When you reach the rank of Director, you qualify for the 1st level matching bonus. This bonus program rewards the commitment to refer others and help them succeed. You will receive additional commissions up to 50% of what your personally referred IBOs earn from their binary commissions. This commission is paid weekly.

Director – 50%
Executive Director – 50%
Regional Director – 50%
National Director – 50%
Global Director – 50%
Ambassador – 50%

2ND LEVEL MATCHING BONUS
Also, when you reach the rank of Director, you qualify for the matching bonus. You will receive additional commissions up to 50% of what your personally referred IBOs earn from their personally referred IBOs binary commissions. This commission is paid weekly.

Director – 10%
Executive Director – 20%
Regional Director – 30%
National Director – 40%
Global Director – 50%
Ambassador – 50%

We are a developmental stage biotechnology company focusing on researching and developing a drug we believe will be a safer alternative to currently available testosterone replacement therapy by stimulating the body's own production of testosterone rather than using exogenous synthetic steroid hormones. We are also working to develop an out of body test to identify Alzheimer's disease through a process, or method, that we believe will be the basis for creating an early stage blood or fluid test for detecting Alzheimer's disease.
