PDT Partners with Prescient Audio to Develop Device Now on Kickstarter
 
Product Development Technologies (PDT) Partners with Prescient Audio MFG, LLC to Develop Device to Revolutionize How Audio is Heard through Smartphones Product development firm and award winning technology creator set to deliver on-board smartphone audio through the Prescient™ AudioCase™
 
LAKE ZURICH, Ill., March 5, 2014 -- Product Development Technologies (PDT), a global, full service product development firm has partnered with Prescient™ Audio, developer of the CES Innovations Award Winning ThinDriver™ TD-12, the world's thinnest, lightest, coolest-running 12" subwoofer, to develop the Prescient AudioCase™, a sleek new audio-enhanced smartphone case - and a Kickstarter campaign to fund commercial development and tooling. The Prescient AudioCase will be made available for iPhone 5/5s and Samsung Galaxy S4.
 
The Prescient AudioCase is one of the most promising, innovative pieces of audio technology for smartphones. It will be the only integrated smartphone case for iPhone 5/5s or Samsung Galaxy s4 that delivers audio quality and volume akin to a premier portable speaker and has a battery on board to extend the life of the phone.
 
“We are thrilled to be working with Prescient on the development of the Prescient AudioCase because it truly is a unique product that will fill a need untouched by existing technologies,” says Mark Schwartz, PDT CEO. “The Mini ThinDriver speaker that will be developed for the case following the Kickstarter campaign has promise to revolutionize audio on smartphones to make hearing content on smartphones as enjoyable as viewing content has become.”
 
"The Prescient AudioCase will bring the highest quality audio possible to people who care about smartphone sound - without awkward external speakers. Literally, the Prescient AudioCase puts high performance audio in the hands of the people. So, we are giving the people an opportunity to lend their hands to its final manufacture," says Paul Niedermann, Inventor of ThinDriver technology.
 
A crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter is live now.
 
A $89 Kickstarter Campaign pledge allows individuals to be among the first to own the Prescient AudioCase, a smartphone case featuring both TrueVoice and ThinDriver™ technology to enable high quality, high-volume, two-way audio. Kickstarter backing affords a significant discount to the planned retail price of $149.
 
For more details about the new audio case product and the Kickstarter campaign, visit PrescientAudio.com.

PDT Partners

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

PDT Partners (Process Driven Trading Partners) is a hedge fund company led by quantitative trader Peter Muller that was founded in 1993 as part of Morgan Stanley's trading division and spun out as an independent business in 2012.[1][2] It has offices in New York City and London.[3]

History[edit]
PDT Partners started out as a proprietary trading division (called the Process Driven Trading Group) of multinational financial services corporation Morgan Stanley in 1993.[4][1] According to Bloomberg, PDT's investments have returned an estimated annual average of more than 20 percent through 2010.[4]
In January 2011, Morgan Stanley announced that it would spin off PDT into a separate hedge fund in order to comply with the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.[4][5]
The spin-off began in 2012. In October 2012, it was announced that the Blackstone Group had put $500 million into PDT, but without seeking any equity in the hedge fund. Bloomberg.com considered this unusual and a testament to Muller's market power and ability.[2] In 2013, the spin-off was complete. In February 2013, it was announced that the fund had raised $2.3 billion in total and was beginning operations in London and Hong Kong in addition to New York City.[5]
Peter Muller, the CEO of PDT, who started PDT as Morgan Stanley's proprietary trading group, was described by Bloomberg.com as an "unlikely executive", a 47-year-old math wizard, and a person with diverse intellectual interests and hobbies.[4][6][4][6][4]

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

It's amazing what three letters can do.
Adding "Inc." or "LLC" to your business' name is more than a good look. It protects your personal assets, creates tax advantages, and much more.

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
