Specially Formulated Lubricants for the Appliance Industry
Dishwashers, washers and dryers, refrigerators, mixers, blenders, and many other appliances have rubber or soft plastic components such as hoses, O-rings, seals, grommets, plugs and more. The slip resistance of these parts makes assembly difficult.  P-80® temporary rubber assembly lubricants significantly reduce friction, helping these parts slide easily into place. 

More Information | All Industries | Resources






Specially Formulated Cleaners for the Food & Beverage Industry
Precision cleaners that provide consistent results with every use and leave surfaces completely clean. These cleaners have been proven in cleaning applications ranging from mixing tanks, processing equipment and fluid lines to labware, general maintenance, and filter membrane cleaning.

Specially Formulated Lubricants for the Automotive Industry
Rubber’s non-slip quality can make an automotive assembly process very difficult.  Without an assembly aid, tight-fitting rubber components can cause production to slow down, and quality and safety standards to slip. P-80® Lubricants provide a safe and easy way to improve automotive assembly operations.

Specially Formulated Cleaners for the Water & Wastewater Industry
Formulated products that meet your membrane cleaning needs. Compatible with UF, RO, Ceramic and NF Systems.

Flextronics International Ltd. said it will open a 17,000-square-foot innovation center in this former military storehouse in the Seaport, now called the Innovation and Design Building.

State and city officials are providing more than $3 million in public aid to entice high-tech manufacturer Flextronics International Ltd. to open an innovation center on the South Boston waterfront.The company has agreed to bring as many as 25 new jobs to staff the roughly 17,000-square-foot facility on Drydock Avenue, to be called the Flex Boston Innovation Center, according to documents obtained from the Baker administration through a public records request.

In exchange, Flextronics will benefit from a $3 million state grant that will help pay for renovations to its new space, according to the documents. The building is owned by the Boston Redevelopment Authority but managed by the real estate firm Jamestown.Boston officials said they have also offered Flextronics a reduction in payments in lieu of taxes valued at about $300,000 over five years.

Flextronics is a massive player in the tech industry, with $24 billion in revenue in its last fiscal year. The Singapore company’s US operations are based in San Jose, Calif. But spokeswoman Renee Brotherton said Flex, as it’s known in the United States, wants a presence in major innovation hubs such as Boston.
The innovation center on Drydock Avenue, Brotherton said, will feature state-of-the-art manufacturing equipment that will be accessible to local universities, startups, and more established companies in industries such as robotics, consumer electronics, medical technology, and energy.State and city officials said they have aggressively pursued Flex for two years, and that the company was also considering other cities such as Atlanta and Toronto for an innovation hub to serve the East Coast.

“If you want to engage Flex in creating a commercialized product from your initial designs, you would have to go to . . . Silicon Valley,” said John Barros, Boston’s economic development chief. “Now Boston becomes the East Coast hub for this kind of advanced manufacturing.”Jay Ash, Massachusetts’ economic development secretary, said the benefits of the Flex investment go well beyond the number of full-time hires the company will bring. He said the Flex center will provide equipment and know-how for startups to build small batches of electronic products to sell to customers, without needing to commit to a large-scale manufacturing run.As a result, executives with startups from outside the area will likely stay at local hotels when developing product prototypes at the Flex center, Ash said, and he also hopes startups may relocate or expand in the state to be close to the center.

Flex also plans to host mentorship events for startups, as well as business-plan competitions. Contest winners will get help developing prototypes by being given free access to the new South Boston facility and its staff. The company also plans to work with local universities and venture capital firms, hosting “tech-talk series,” for example, to discuss advancements in technologies such as digital health and robotics, according to the documents.“To us, it doesn’t matter whether Flextronics added one job or 100 jobs,” Ash said. “It’s about the ecosystem that Flextronics is going to support.”The $3 million grant will come from the MassWorks infrastructure program, which state officials are also tapping to provide as much as $120 million to help General Electric build its future headquarters in nearby Fort Point.Construction on the Flex space is expected to begin later this summer, with a goal of completing it sometime in the fall. Flex is expected to move in by the end of the year.The Drydock Avenue building is quickly becoming a hub of advanced manufacturing and design, Barros said, with Autodesk and Continuum opening offices there. MassChallenge’s startup accelerator space is also in the complex, which Jamestown has refashioned as “The Innovation and Design Building.”Emily Reichert, head of Greentown Labs, said she hopes to strike a deal with Flex for the clean-energy startups at her Somerville incubator to use Flex’s machinery and to consult with its manufacturing experts.“They have, as I understand it, in their Silicon Valley center, quite a bit of equipment and machinery [that] would be very hard for startups to access on their own,” Reichert said. “I also think that the expertise could be very valuable as well. . . . It just continues to highlight the strengths of the hardware and mechanical-based innovation here in the Boston area.”

Since 1986, APC has been recognized for providing value to its customers by manufacturing high-quality custom piezo products and delivering a superior level of customer service.APC’s piezo products include: piezoelectric ceramics in standard and custom shapes, piezoelectric materials (PZT materials), stack actuators, ultrasonic air transducers, piezo nebulizers, piezo buzzers, piezo disc benders, bending actuators, piezo ignitors, ultrasonic cleaning transducers, piezo sensors, and custom transducers.

APC offers five proprietary piezo materials: APC 840, APC 841, APC 850, APC 855, and APC 880. APC’s materials are manufactured in the United Sates and are recognized by our customers for their quality and consistency. APC's recently opened lead zirconate titanate powder manufacturing facility enables APC's team of materials scientists to develop additional piezo powders for specific customer applications.APC’s experienced team of application engineers works with our customers to develop innovative solutions and provide application support for their piezo systems. APC’s piezo design and application support services include: materials development, transducer design, piezo sensor development, and piezo systems optimization.
Those in the industry who are familiar with piezoelectric materials will know the theory, but piezo materials aren't particularly well-known in general. These practical and important materials feature a fascinating and unique physical property: they react to mechanical stress by generating a voltage. It was back in the 1880s that scientists first detected this phenomenon in certain types of crystals.
At this point in time, electricity was in its early stages, and the potential of these piezo materials was obvious. Today, piezo materials are used in many different industries and are an integral part of many sensors, accelerometers, transducers and non-destructive testing equipment. We’re proud to be a leader in the industry and to supply our piezoelectric ceramics to be integrated into a variety of systems that control and monitor our transportation, defenses, manufacturing and medical industries.
At APC International, we help you harness this fascinating physical property with a range of piezoelectric ceramic products custom-made according to your requirements. Our experience has led us to create ultra-sensitive PZT materials that are suitable for use in your high-precision applications. Thanks to our fast concept to production phase, we can often get your custom piezoelectric products to you within one week.
Taking advantage of the natural piezoelectric effect isn’t easy. It requires advanced manufacturing and tight tolerances to give you the response, repeatability and precision you need. All of our piezoelectric materials for sale are a result of years of testing and development. We manufacture using a variety of PZT materials, including lead zirconate titanate, the most common in the industry thanks to its excellent sensitivity and temperature capacities.
It’s impossible to know if the scientists who first came to understand the piezoelectric effect know how important it would come to be. Today, we know that many types of modern equipment, such as transducers and sensors, wouldn’t be possible without they work they pioneered. We’re proud here at APC International to further refine and improve our custom piezoelectric products to find new and exciting uses for all of your applications.
APC International excels at meeting its customer’s precise custom requirements for piezoelectric ceramics. APC’s manufacturing capabilities include an in-house machine shop, design and application of custom electrode patterns, and advanced electrical testing. APC’s manufacturing staff enjoys the challenge of manufacturing unique piezo shapes and piezo shapes with tight electrical or dimensional tolerances.
APC’s in-house assembly & contract manufacturing services, including soldering, bonding, and transducer assembly, provide APCs customers with ready to use piezo devices. Customers who have used APC’s in-house assembly & contract manufacturing services have saved countless hours and reduced their assembly costs.
APC’s shear mode piezoelectric elements are used by many of our customers who require a piezoelectric ceramic with greater sensitivity. APC’s composite materials provide improved resolution for many sonar and medical ultrasound applications.
APC supplies piezoelectric ceramics and piezo devices for a wide range of applications including: flow sensors, level sensors, accelerometers, proximity sensors, ultrasonic medical transducers, and non-destructive testing.APC supplies many Fortune 500 companies with cutting edge piezoelectric products. Our customers are found in a wide range of industries, including: aerospace, automotive, consumer products, engineering & design, industrial, manufacturing, medical products, and defense.
