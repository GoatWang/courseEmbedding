About Us  


NephroGenex is an innovator in the development of drugs to treat kidney disease, with a first indication in diabetic nephropathy. We have been pioneering the development of PYRIDORIN® (pyridoxamine dihydrochloride), a late stage compound to treat diabetic patients with this slow-developing but potentially deadly disease. Pyridorin has the potential to slow or stabilize the progression to end-stage renal disease by inhibiting the formation of advanced glycation end products that have been implicated in the development of diabetic nephropathy.
Our clinical and regulatory teams have positioned the Phase 3 PIONEER program for success by securing from the FDA a Fast Track designation and Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) with a new endpoint of a 50% change in serum creatinine or ESRD that will reduce the time, cost and risk of the trials. A SPA is a binding agreement that the protocol design, clinical endpoints, planned conduct and statistical analyses are acceptable to support regulatory approval. A Fast Track Designation by the FDA is designed to facilitate the development, and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious conditions and fill an unmet medical need.
We believe Pyridorin represents real hope for the millions of type 2 diabetic patients around the world who have diabetic nephropathy.

Oral Pyridorin  


Pyridorin: A Novel Acting Compound to Improve Treatment of Diabetic Nephropathy
Addressing an unmet medical need to slow disease progression
At NephroGenex, we are committed to developing a more effective treatment for diabetic kidney disease—a critical global health issue. We are now in a Phase 3 study with PYRIDORIN® (pyridoxamine dihydrochloride), a novel acting compound to reduce the rate of disease progression in patients with diabetic nephropathy (DN) due to type 2 diabetes.
Currently available treatments for diabetic nephropathy are effective but a significant residual risk remains
Despite the availability of two classes of approved treatments for diabetic nephropathy (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), diabetic nephropathy remains the most common cause of end stage renal disease. There is a significant unmet medical need for new treatments that can slow or stabilize the progression of diabetic nephropathy.
Therapy targets an underlying cause of the disease to improve outcomes
Unlike any currently approved therapies, Pyridorin slows down the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) that have been implicated in the development of diabetic nephropathy.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A variety of completed preclinical studies in animal models of diabetes demonstrate that treatment with Pyridorin improves kidney histology and slows the progression of diabetic nephropathy.

Phase 2 data from over 650 subjects has enabled us to identify the type of patients that may demonstrate benefit from Pyridorin in a Phase 3 trial—type 2 diabetic patients with advanced kidney disease (serum creatinine >1.3mg/dL and <3.0mg/dL) who have a significant amount of protein in their urine (PCR >1200mg/g). Based on safety, efficacy and tolerability profile from the completed Phase 2 studies, we believe Pyridorin has the potential to address an important unmet need in type 2 diabetic patients with advanced kidney disease.
Our Phase 3 trial PYR-311, the first of two identical trials in our PIONEER program, is evaluating the safety and efficacy of Pyridorin to reduce disease progression in this patient population (see Clinical Trials). The design of the trial has been agreed with the FDA under a Special Protocol Assessment and Pyridorin has been granted a Fast Track designation by the FDA. For more information about our pivotal Phase 3 Pyridorin trial, see clinicaltrials.gov.

PIONEER Phase 3 Program  


PYR-311: Pyridorin in Patients with Diabetic Nephropathy 
Pivotal program uses new FDA-approvable endpoint
The Phase 3 PIONEER program includes two identical double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trials. Each is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of PYRIDORIN® (pyridoxamine dihydrochloride) at 300 mg twice a day compared to placebo in reducing the rate of renal disease progression in Type 2 diabetic patients.
PYR-311 is in the process of enrolling approximately 600 patients randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either Pyridorin or placebo. Patients are being enrolled who have baseline serum creatinine (SCr) levels of 1.3 to 3.0 mg/dL and protein/creatinine ratio (PCR) levels greater than 1200 mg/g. Patients must also be on an established and stable regimen of ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) or Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers  (ARBs)—the standard of care treatments for diabetic nephropathy—for 6 months prior to randomization. About 150 centers are expected to participate worldwide, with the majority located in the U.S.
Importantly, this pivotal trial utilizes a new endpoint, as established under a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) with the FDA. Primary efficacy endpoints are time to a 50% increase in SCr levels, or end stage renal disease (ESRD). Pyridorin has also received Fast Track designation from the FDA for this indication.
Details about study enrollment and patient eligibility, can be found at clinicaltrials.gov.

Mechanism of Action






Mechanism of Action  


Pyridorin: Unique Mode of Action Inhibits Key Cause of Disease
PYRIDORIN® (pyridoxamine dihydrochloride) is a novel small molecule drug candidate with a chemical structure similar to, but distinct from, vitamin B6 (pyridoxine). Unlike vitamin B6, pyridoxamine is regulated as an investigational drug candidate by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
The compound has a distinct structure and is comprised of a pyridine ring containing hydroxyl, methyl, aminomethyl, hydroxymethyl and phenol substituent groups.

This structure enables Pyridorin to preferentially bind to a variety of molecules which include:
• Scavenging activity toward free radical and carbonyl compounds that form during the breakdown of sugars and lipids that can lead to AGE formation;
• Trapping hydroxyl radicals (a highly reactive and short-lived neutral form of the hydroxide ion (HO−);
• Redox metal binding activity (e.g. copper (Cu2+), manganese (Mn2+), and iron (Fe2+)), which inhibits the oxidation of Amadori intermediates to AGEs.
• Inhibiting the break-down of glycated proteins to AGEs; and
• Blocking lipoxidation (lipid oxidation) by trapping lipoxidation intermediates

      working capital and general corporate purposes.
    

      A registration statement relating to these securities has been filed 
      with the Securities and Exchange Commission and became effective on July
