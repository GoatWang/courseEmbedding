How to Create a Culture of Success at Your Firm
As wealth advisors, we spend our days elbow deep in portfolio management, tax and estate planning, market analysis, and other endeavors important to the financial success — and ultimate satisfaction — of our clients.
Yet, more goes into building a positive client experience than an advisor’s individual expertise or background. In his article, Michael Nathanson describes how successful firms intentionally cultivate a culture that provides support and opportunities for their employees to thrive and their businesses to grow.
Building this “culture of success” (and reaping its benefits) relies upon advisors’ commitment to four key elements:

Attracting, developing, retaining, and engaging top talent
Embracing a fiduciary-based, client-first philosophy
Building a robust infrastructure
Creating a growth-oriented organization poised for financial strength
