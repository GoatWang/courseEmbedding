                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

BP explores for oil and natural gas in approximately 30 countries and posses proved  reserves of 18.1 billion barrels of oil equivalent. Through its 16 refineries, BP processes 4 million barrels of crude oil per day. It markets these products in 80 countries and through its network of 22,400 gas stations.[1]
In 2010, one of BP's deepwater rigs in the Gulf of Mexico exploded, killing 11 workers and spilling millions of gallons into the Gulf of Mexico. The explosion and spill not only resulted in severe financial fines, but also hurt the company's reputation. Under CEO Robert Dudley, BP is undergoing a strategic change to pay for economic losses attributable to the explosion and improve its reputation.

 Company Overview
In the aftermath of the Horizon disaster in the US Gulf of Mexico, BP's 2010 earnings reflect both the extent of the disaster on BP's financial strength as well as the implementation of a new global strategy. In 2010, BP reported a loss before interest and taxation of $3.7 billion, compared to a profit of $26.4 billion in 2009. While the earnings in every segment rose compared to 2009 performance, BP recorded a loss of $40.8 billion before interest and taxation in response to the US Gulf oil spill. Profit from exploration and production rose to $30.89 billion from $24.80 billion in 2009 partially due to higher crude oil prices. Due to improved margins over the year, refining and marketing reported earnings of $5.55 billion, compared to $743 in 2009.

For 2011, the spill in the Gulf and potential regulations has the potential of impacting BP's financial performance. In addition, BP inked a multibillion deal with Rosneft in early 2011.[2]

 Business Segments
meow
Exploration and production (2010 sales of $66.26 Billion): Through its Exploration and Production segment, BP engages in the search for undeveloped oil and gas reservoirs, the development of reservoirs, and the production and transportation of oil and natural gas from developed wells. BP’s upstream activities include the exploration and extraction of crude oil and natural gas from wells in eight different countries.
In 2010, BP reported sales from operations of $66.26 billion, compared to $57.6 billion  in 2009. Realizations on crude oil increased substantially year-over-year, rising from $59.86 per barrel in 2009 to $77.54 per barrel in 2010. Realizations on NGLs also increased. Average realization for NGL was $42.78 per barrel in 2010, compared to $29.60 per barrel in 2009. Overall production dropped slightly in 2010. BP reported production of 3.82 million barrels per day in 2010 compared to production of 3.99 million barrels per day in 2009. 
Refining and Marketing (2010 sales of $266 million): BP’s Refining and Marketing operations include the processing of crude oil into refined petroleum products and the sale of those products to wholesalers and retailers located in over 100 countries around the world.
In 2010, global oil demand increased by 2.8 million barrels per day. In response to higher demand, petro-product prices rose internationally.[3] BP's annual global indicator refining margins were $4.44 per barrel, compared to $4.00 per barrel in 2009.In addition, total refinery throughputs 2.43 million barrels per day in 2010, compared to 2.29 million barrels per day in 2009. Replacement cost profit before interest and tax for 2010 was $5.55 billion, compared with $743 million for 2009.

  Key Trends and Forces 
 Rosneft deal means short-term costs, but potential long term gain
BP's $16 billion share swap and joint-venture deal with Rosneft has the potential of producing substantial long term gains for the company and its Russian partner. However, BP has to bear much of the short-term costs. Since BP is exchanging 5% of its shares with 9.5% of Rosneft's better rated stock, the stock swap is likely to prove dilutive for BP's earnings per share. In addition, BP has to pay for the early costs of developing oil and gas reserves in Russia Kara Sea; costs which are estimated at $2 billion. However, the blocks BP-Rosneft plan on exploring have the potential of containing as much oil and gas as three times Rosneft and BP's 2010 combined reserve base. As a result, BP has inked a deal with substantial growth opportunities in a sector made up by state-owned companies.  Because the deal is long-term, both political and financial risk remain largely unknown. BP has a 37% stake in the venture, which gives it less control over the ventures direction. In addition, the price and demand of oil have the potential of changing substantially in the long-term. These factors are likely to play an important role in how profitable the venture becomes for BP. 
As of February 2011, the deal with Rosneft is on hold due to a British court order won AAR, the Russian shareholders who own half of the TNK-BP project. AAR has charged that the deal with Rosneft violates its exclusive agreement with them. While there are several proposed resolutions, including the sale of AAR's stake to BP or Rosneft, the legal troubles BP has faced with the TNK-BP project illustrate the potential dangers surrounding large-international oil ventures. Because the TNK-BP project involves a high degree of complexity in regards to ownernship control and international regulations, legal problems have plagued the project for a long time and have the potential of impacting the project's operations as well as the operations of the Rosneft deal.[4] Russian energy czar Igor Sechin urged both BP and AAR to come to an agreement and not let their legal battles hinder BP's deal with Rosneft. To support his warnings, Sechin has threatened legal action against BP and its partners if they sabotaged the $16 billion deal.

 Damages from 2010 Offshore Gulf Explosion
In April 2010, a major fire on an oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico owned by BP and operated by Transocean has the potential of hampering the development of offshore oil production and costing both companies millions in order to fix the situation. Although the exact cause has not been determined, people at Transocean believe the blaze is from an uncontrolled burst of oil and gas from the well.  The Gulf of Mexico produces 30% of the U.S. oil output and is an important source of revenue for oil majors like BP.[5]

In July 2010, BP  temporarily capped the oil spill using a pipe "cork."  To control pressure, oil is released through pipes up to ships, which collect it. As of July 18, 2010, BP plans to use this method until mud and cement are used to plug the well for good. With spill capped successfully, the BP outlined its $20 billion fund set aside for to pay for damages to companies, organizations, and individuals significantly impacted by the spill. raise money for this fund, BP plans to sell up to $12 billion of assets to Apache (APA) in order to cover some of its liabilities.[6]
In late July 2010, Tony Hayward, who has held the position of CEO since 2007, announced that he plans to step down as CEO effective October 2010. Hayward was succeeded by Bob Dudley, who previously ran the unit responsible for clean-up operations and compensation programs in the Gulf of Mexico. While Dudley has noted that cleaning up the Gulf Spill has the potential of being his first priority as CEO, the company has also suggested that its near-future strategy incorporates several divestitures deemed non-core or risky. The divestitures have the potential of raising cash to pay for BP's $20 billion Gulf-relief fund and reducing the company's risk exposure to another drilling accident.  As suggested in interviews and press releases, BP's strategy includes selling assets in places such as Egypt and Vietnam that BP bought in recent years to diversify its reserve base. Assets that have the highest potential for  up for sale are those that BP deemed risky or non-core.[7] While it is still uncertain how much BP plans to sell, it appears clear a focus on core assets and operations has the potential of becoming a principle strategy of a Dudley-run BP.


 Through joint ventures, BP enters the oilsands production market
In 2009 and 2010, BP inked several deals with oilsand production companies that have the potential of increasing BP's exposure to that type of production. Since March 2010, the deals struck by BP have typically followed a "combination" approach, which basically slice the management of particular asset between the two companies while allowing both to receive revenue from them. The result of these deals make it possible for both companies to retain a portfolio of assets without requiring that they have to run all of the assets. BP announced in March 2010 a $7 billion dollar deal with Devon Canada Corporation. The two companies agreed to work together  on the Kirby oilsands lease south of Fort McMurray, Alta. However, Devon is designated as the project´s operator. From the deal, Devon's share of the oilsands production market as well as the size of BP's offshore production operations have the potential of expanding.  BP has made similar deals involving oilsands production. In 2007,  BP and Husky Energy Inc. struck a deal evenly splitting the ownership of BP´s refineries in the United States and Husky´s oilsands leases. However, each company would operate their own side of the venture. In March 2010, BP agreed to make capital contributions to Value Creation Inc., a privately held production company, in exchange for an operating stake in Value Creation's oilsand's leases.[8]

 To increase production BP's  moves operations abroad, exposing the company to political risks 
As do other oil majors, BP controls oil resources in countries around the world. 72% of BP's oil comes from North America and Europe, but the company's exploration and production segment has a strong incentive to push forward and explore in countries that are less politically stable. By expanding around the globe, BP has the potential of increasing its production capacity and reserve life.[9] At the end of 2008, BP had invested 67% of its capital in Organizations for Economic Cooperation and Development(OECD) countries, and its U.S. and Europe operations are the company’s largest. .  While its refining operations are located almost completely in the U.S. and Europe, BP’s has  exploration and production operations are located in 29 countries.  Major development projects are located in the Gulf of Mexico, Azerbaijan, Algeria, Angola, and parts of Pacific Asia.  Although BP’s expanding global reach is capable of increasing its production capabilities, political instability in many of these countries has the potential of  damaging or destroying BP’s operations. The company believes its operations most exposed to political risk are located in Iran, Cuba, Syria, and Russia.[10]

 BP is Vulnerable to Natural Disasters, like the Hurricane Season
The Gulf of Mexico, where 21% of BP's 2008 production occured[11], is prone to violent hurricanes during the last few months of summer. These storms can damage drilling rigs and refineries, and injure workers. Like most oil companies in the region, BP reduces production during hurricane months. Still, some storms can do real harm. In 2008, Hurricane Ike and Gustav resulted in a significant amount of rig shut downs. The  impact of both hurricanes was a reduction equivalent to approximately 24mboe per day for 2008.[12]  BP's Thunder Horse operations, completed in 2009, are also susceptible to hurricane destruction.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.

Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
