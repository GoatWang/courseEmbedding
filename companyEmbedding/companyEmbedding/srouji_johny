The Most Important Apple Executive You’ve Never Heard Of

A little over a year ago, Apple had a problem: The iPad Pro was behind schedule. Elements of the hardware, software, and accompanying stylus weren’t going to be ready for a release in the spring. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook and his top lieutenants had to delay the unveiling until the fall. That gave most of Apple’s engineers more time. It gave a little-known executive named Johny Srouji much less.
Srouji is the senior vice president for hardware technologies at Apple. He runs the division that makes processor chips, the silicon brains inside the iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and Apple TV. The original plan was to introduce the iPad Pro with Apple’s tablet chip, the A8X, the same processor that powered the iPad Air 2, introduced in 2014. But delaying until fall meant that the Pro would make its debut alongside the iPhone 6s, which was going to use a newer, faster phone chip called the A9.

This is the stuff that keeps technology executives up at night. The iPad Pro was important: It was Apple’s attempt to sell tablets to business customers. And it would look feeble next to the iPhone 6s. So Srouji put his engineers on a crash program to move up the rollout of a new tablet processor, the A9X, by half a year. The engineers finished in time, and the Pro hit the market with the faster chip and a 12.9-inch display packed with 5.6 million pixels.
Srouji was nicely rewarded for his efforts. In December he became the newest member of Cook’s management team and received about 90,000 additional shares of Apple stock, which vest over a four-year period.
He also stepped into the kind of spotlight he’s avoided since joining Apple in 2008. Srouji runs what is probably the most important and least understood division inside the world’s most profitable company. Since 2010, when his team produced the A4 chip for the original iPad, Apple has immersed itself in the costly and complex science of silicon. It develops specialized microprocessors as a way to distinguish its products from the competition. The Apple-designed circuits allow the company to customize products to perfectly match the features of its software, while tightly controlling the critical trade-off between speed and battery consumption. Among the components on its chip (technically called a “system on a chip,” or SOC) are an image signal processor and a storage controller, which let Apple tailor useful functions for taking and storing photos, such as the rapid-fire “burst mode” introduced with the iPhone 5s. Engineers and designers can work on features like that years in advance without prematurely notifying vendors—especially Samsung, which manufactures many of Apple’s chips.
At the center of all this is Srouji, 51, an Israeli who joined Apple after jobs at Intel and IBM. He’s compact, he’s intense, and he speaks Arabic, Hebrew, and French. His English is lightly accented and, when the subject has anything to do with Apple, nonspecific bordering on koanlike. “Hard is good. Easy is a waste of time,” he says when asked about increasingly thin iPhone designs. “The chip architects at Apple are artists, the engineers are wizards,” he answers another question. He’ll elaborate a bit when the topic is general. “When designers say, ‘This is hard,’ ” he says, “my rule of thumb is if it’s not gated by physics, that means it’s hard but doable.”
Srouji recently spent several hours with Bloomberg Businessweek over several days and guided a tour of Apple chip facilities in Cupertino, Calif., and Herzliya, Israel. This was, no doubt, strategic. Investors have battered Apple stock over the past year, sending it down more than 25 percent. Most people are already pretty satisfied with their phones, the criticism goes, and aren’t compelled to spend an additional few hundred bucks on an upgrade. (In March, Apple intends to announce an updated iPad and smaller-screen iPhone featuring the latest A9x and A9 chips, according to a person familiar with the plans, who wasn’t authorized to comment publicly.)
Apple’s usual response is to point to Jony Ive and his team of fastidiously cool, Wallabee-shod industrial designers, or to highlight elegantly tooled aluminum or an app or some new feature or gadget. There’s always something new to show off. But none of that has ever explained anything about a crucial part of Apple’s profit machine: its chips.
“I think it’s too good of a story not to be told at this stage,” Srouji says. “Hopefully, we won’t reveal too much.”

When the original iPhone came out in 2007, Steve Jobs was well aware of its flaws. It had no front camera, measly battery life, and a slow 2G connection from AT&T. It was also underpowered. A former Apple engineer who worked on the device said that while the handset was a breakthrough technology, it was limited because it pieced together components from different vendors, including elements from a Samsung chip used in DVD players. “Steve came to the conclusion that the only way for Apple to really differentiate and deliver something truly unique and truly great, you have to own your own silicon,” Srouji says. “You have to control and own it.”
One of Jobs’s trusted advisers, Bob Mansfield, Apple’s top hardware executive at the time, recruited Srouji to lead that effort. Srouji, then at IBM, was a rising star in the arcane world of semiconductor engineering. Mansfield promised him an opportunity to build something from scratch.
The decision to design semiconductors was risky. About the size of a small postage stamp, the microprocessor is the most important component of any computing device. It does the work that makes playing games, posting to Facebook, sending texts, and taking pictures seem easy. Small currents of energy move from the battery through hundreds of millions of tiny transistors, triggering commands and responses in nanoseconds. It’s like an intricate city design that fits on the tip of your finger. When the chip isn’t doing its job efficiently, the device feels sluggish, crashes, or makes users want to throw it against a wall.
If there’s a bug in software, you simply release a corrected version. It’s different with hardware. “You get one transistor wrong, it’s done, game over,” Srouji says. “Each one of those transistors has to work. Silicon is very unforgiving.” Among computer and smartphone makers, industry practice is to leave the processors to specialists such as Intel, Qualcomm, or Samsung, which sink billions into getting the chips right and making them inexpensively. (Apple used to co-design processors for the Macintosh, but Jobs abandoned the work in 2005 in favor of more powerful models from Intel, whose chips still power all Macs.)
When Srouji joined Apple, the company had a group of about 40 engineers working on integrating chips from various vendors into the iPhone. That grew by about 150 people in April 2008, after Apple acquired a Silicon Valley chip startup called P.A. Semi, which had a power-efficient semiconductor design. Srouji’s team found itself interacting regularly with other departments, from software programmers, who wanted chip support for new features, to Ive’s industrial designers, who wanted help making the phones flatter and sleeker. An engineer who sat in on Srouji’s meetings remembers senior managers preparing extensively for presentations, because his support was critical for getting new features approved. He was known for peppering engineers with technically sophisticated questions, particularly about contingency options if something didn’t work out as planned. He’d ask, for example, if a different form of plastic could be used that wouldn’t interfere with another component.


                “The only way for Apple to really differentiate and deliver something truly unique and truly great, you have to own your own silicon”
            

The first public signs of Srouji’s work came in 2010 with the debut of the iPad and iPhone 4. The processor, the A4, was a modified version of a design from ARM Holdings, a British company that licenses mobile technology. The A4 was designed to power the handset’s new high-definition “retina display.” Srouji says it was a race to get that first system-on-a-chip produced. “The airplane was taking off, and I was building the runway just in time,” he says.
Over the next few years, Apple kept making improvements to its designs, introducing chips to accommodate fingerprint identification, video calling, and Siri, the iPhone’s voice-activated assistant, among other enhancements. When the companies using Google’s Android operating system started making tablets, they mostly used conventional mobile phone processors. Starting with the third-generation iPad in 2012, Srouji’s team designed specific chips (the A5x and A6x) to give the tablet the same pixel-packing high-definition screens as the iPhone.
These mysterious semiconductors coming from Apple were the curiosity of the tech industry, but it wasn’t until the release of the iPhone 5s in 2013 that rivals really started to pay attention. The phone featured the A7 processor, the first smartphone chip with 64 bits—double the 32-bit standard at the time. The new technology allowed for entirely new features, such as Apple Pay and the Touch ID fingerprint scanner. Developers had to rewrite applications to account for the new standard, but it gave way to smoother maps, cooler video games, and generally more responsive apps that don’t hog as much memory. (Apple’s control over hardware and software is also useful for encrypting everything on the device, a capability that has landed the company in a controversy: On Feb. 16, a judge ruled that Apple must help the FBI unlock an iPhone owned by one of the San Bernardino shooters. Apple is fighting the order, saying it would set a precedent that would undermine the privacy of all its customers.)
Qualcomm, then as now the biggest designer of phone chips, made the expensive decision to scrap development of its 32-bit chips and put all its resources into catching up. Handset companies all “wanted the shiny new thing,” says Ryan Smith, the editor-in-chief of AnandTech, a website that publishes exhaustive reviews of semiconductor designs. “The A7 really turned the world upside down.”
Srouji can’t restrain a smile when recalling competitors’ reactions to Apple’s 64-bit surprise. “When we pick something,” he says, “it’s because we think there’s a problem that nobody can do, or there is some idea that’s so unique and differentiating that the best way to do it is you have to do it yourself.”

Srouji was born in Haifa, a port city in northern Israel. He was the third child of four. His family was Christian Arab, a minority within a minority in the Jewish state. “Haifa is one of the most integrated cities in Israel,” he says. “You have Christians, you have Muslims, Jews, Bahá’ís, you have any religion you want, and everyone lives together in peaceful harmony. Integration worked for me.”
Srouji’s father owned a metal pattern-making business outside the city, and from age 10, Srouji spent weekends and summers helping him pattern wooden moldings that were used to make engine parts, medical equipment, and other machinery. His father had an unusual philosophy: He would undercharge customers for complicated work while overcharging for easier jobs. “If there was a very complex thing that he’d never done, he wanted to do it,” Srouji says.
His father, who died in 2000, constantly reminded him not to get comfortable in the family business. Education was more important. In high school, Srouji got perfect grades in math, physics, chemistry, and science. He was introduced to computers by an instructor who also taught at the nearby Technion Israel Institute of Technology, one of the world’s top engineering schools. “I fell in love,” Srouji says.
He enrolled at the Technion, spent late nights in the computer lab drafting out code in pencil, and earned undergraduate and master’s degrees in computer science. His master’s thesis was on new techniques for testing software and hardware systems. “At the time it was very progressive,” says Orna Berry, general manager of the EMC Center of Excellence in Israel and corporate vice president of innovation, who met Srouji at the Technion. “I’m not surprised he is where he is.”
After graduating, Srouji got a job with IBM, which had placed its largest non-U.S. research facility in Haifa, the better to attract the big brains coming out of the Technion and other Israeli universities. He researched distributed systems, an emerging field in which computers in different locations are networked together to complete computationally intensive assignments. Ensuring the machines communicated correctly required skill building hardware and writing software algorithms.
“Sometimes I wondered—when he got an assignment and within a day it was complete and perfect—if he was brilliant or just didn’t sleep at night,” says Srouji’s first boss, Oded Cohn, vice president and lab director for IBM Haifa Research. “In some cases, the conclusion was both.”
Although Israel grapples with Jewish-Arab tensions all the time, none of it mattered in Srouji’s world. Cohn, who remains friends with him, says their different backgrounds never came up. “Technical people treat technical people based on personality and technical ability,” he says. “You don’t think about it. You just work together. The rest goes away.”
In 1993, Srouji left IBM for Intel, where he created techniques for running simulations that test the strength of semiconductor designs. During a visit to the U.S. in 1999, he used a 20-minute car ride with a manager, fellow Israeli Uri Weiser, to lobby for a three-year stint at Intel’s research hub in Austin. Assuming Srouji was also Jewish, Weiser invited him to an Israeli Memorial Day celebration at a synagogue in Texas.
“He looked at me and said, ‘I’m a Christian Arab,’ ” recalls Weiser, who gave Srouji the Texas assignment. “I said, ‘Well, come and join and learn about your environment,’ and he said OK. He was there sitting with a kippah in the synagogue and following everything.”


                Standing in an aisle, surrounded by exposed circuit boards and digital innards, is like being inside the Matrix. “No one has seen this before,” Srouji says
            

Srouji lives a few miles from Apple’s headquarters at One Infinite Loop, Cupertino. He drives a black Mercedes-Benz and relaxes by lifting weights and riding his bike on weekends. He smiles easily, warmly touches a reporter’s shoulder when sharing a laugh, blushes at compliments, and absolutely clams up when he’s asked about anything that could remotely be considered a corporate secret. “I don’t want to go into too much detail on that” is a common refrain.
Friends have noticed the heightened discretion. Srouji once invited his former Intel colleague, Weiser, to give a speech about chip development at Apple headquarters in Cupertino. After the presentation, an assistant escorted Weiser to Srouji’s empty office, where he noticed that the papers on the desk were all turned upside down. Then Srouji entered the room and told Weiser he had to move. “He said, ‘We are at Apple, you can’t sit here,’ ” Weiser recalls. “He offered me to sit with his secretary and said, ‘If you want to go to the bathroom, she will escort you.’ ”
One morning in February, Srouji conducts a brief tour of his domain, which is scattered in unmarked locations around Silicon Valley. A shuttle bus leaves One Infinite Loop and drives 10 minutes through a series of residential neighborhoods to a low-rise office building near the Santa Clara city limits.
One of his deputies greets Srouji at the bus and badges through several locked doors into a room where future chip designs are being tested. The building is eerily quiet and still, save for the hum of air conditioners and the blinking red and green lights of large dark boxes that are stacked together and resemble Zambonis. The room is Apple-white and clean, but not tidy; thick wires and large plugs lie around. Old, unused Macs are lined up on a shelf like books that have already been read. All the equipment is operated remotely. The boxes are running software that scans for possible flaws in the chip architecture. Testing proceeds for several days on one element of the chip, then moves on to the next, and then the next, until the process is done, which can take months. “We beat the silicon as much as we can,” Srouji says. “If you’re lucky and rigorous, you find the mistakes before you ship.”
In an adjacent room, circuit boards are wired together in milk carton-size stacks to simulate the capabilities of a future iPhone or iPad. Apple’s software programmers, sitting anywhere in the world, can remotely test how their code holds up against a future chip design.
Then the shuttle takes Srouji a few more miles away, to another unmarked building, where rows of customized Mac Minis are testing prototype chips under various temperature and pressure conditions. Standing in an aisle, surrounded by exposed circuit boards and digital innards, is like being inside the Matrix. “No one has seen this before,” Srouji says.
Everything looks exceedingly complicated. Srouji won’t discuss costs, but Apple’s research and development expenses hit $8.1 billion last year, up from $6 billion in 2014 and $4.5 billion in 2013. Many analysts attribute the rise in large part to chip development. All Srouji will say about his budget is that Cook doesn’t scrutinize it. “I run it very tight,” he says. “I truly believe that engineers will do their best when they are constrained by either money, tools, or resources. If you become sloppy because you have too much money, that’s the wrong mindset.”
Apple isn’t completely in charge of its own destiny. It remains in many ways a prisoner of its supply chain. Displays come from Samsung, and cellular modems from Qualcomm. Samsung and TSMC, based in Taiwan, still manufacture the processors. Apple’s ability to keep up with demand is in part dependent on the production capacity of those companies. It also lags behind Samsung in some areas of chip development, such as adding a modem to the central processor to conserve space and power and transitioning from a 20-nanometer chip design to a more compact 16-nanometer format, which means even more transistors can be crammed into a smaller space. “If I was just arguing hardware and not Apple’s marketing, I would say Samsung has the best processor,” says Mike Demler, a senior mobile chips analyst at the Linley Group, a technology consulting firm in Silicon Valley.
Or Apple could just be getting started. It relies on suppliers for Wi-Fi modems now, but will it forever? “I don’t want to go into Wi-Fi specifically,” Srouji says.
Apple could also take a page from Tesla’s playbook and start developing its own batteries. “I don’t want to get into batteries too deeply,” he says.
And since Apple is doing a fine job with mobile processors, it could conceivably decide to get into conventional chips and bump Intel out of its Mac laptops and desktops. Srouji, of course, won’t go there, though he does allow that his team’s mission is finite. “If we attempt to do everything on the planet,” he says, “I don’t think that would be very smart.”

Apple's chip boss is so secretive that all the papers on his desk are turned upside down

AP


  Apple's chip program is the center of intense speculation in the
  technology industry because so little is known about it.

  Part of the reason Apple has been able to keep the details of its
  chipmaking under wraps is that the man who runs it, Johny Srouji,
  is great at keeping secrets, according to 
  a profile of Srouji in Bloomberg.

  The secrecy applies even to Srouji's office:

  Srouji once invited his former Intel colleague, [Uri] Weiser, to
  give a speech about chip development at Apple headquarters in
  Cupertino. After the presentation, an assistant escorted Weiser
  to Srouji's empty office, where he noticed that the
  papers on the desk were all turned upside down. Then
  Srouji entered the room and told Weiser he had to move. "He said,
  'We are at Apple, you can't sit here,'" Weiser recalls. "He
  offered me to sit with his secretary and said, 'If you want to go
  to the bathroom, she will escort you.'"

  Apple designs the chips that power the iPhone and the iPad, a
  technical feat that gives Apple a significant advantage. For
  example, the fact that Apple designs its own chips allowed the
  company to ship a modern fingerprint reader on a phone a year
  before its competitors.





  Srouji is critical to those efforts, which is why Apple gave him
  a major promotion in the past year that came with 90,000 shares
  of Apple stock.

  Here's one example of how critical Srouji is: Last year,
  Apple's business-focused iPad Pro was behind schedule and missed
  its expected spring release date. Srouji's team was able to
  develop an entirely new iPad Pro chip so it wouldn't look
  underpowered next to that year's iPhones when it finally launched
  in the fall.


  According to the Bloomberg report, Apple's chipmaking
  research happens both in unmarked labs in Silicon Valley as well
  as in labs in Srouji's native Israel.

The chip labs allow Apple engineers to remotely test
  their code from "anywhere in the world" on the latest chip
  designs so they know whether future features will work well on
  whatever silicon will power the next iPhone or
  iPad.

One of Srouji's unmarked labs featured "rows of
  customized Mac Minis ... testing prototype chips under various
  temperature and pressure conditions," according to Bloomberg's
  report.

There are three main possibilities that might answer the
  question of what Apple might do with its chipmaking
  prowess:

Apple could start developing its own modems
  
Apple could start developing its own batteries
  
Apple could release a Mac computer running on an
  Apple-designed ARM chip
  

But Srouji is great at keeping
  corporate secrets, and he declined to talk to Bloomberg about any
  of the three possibilities.

  Read Bloomberg's full interview with Srouji here.

Apple's New Hardware Chief Johny Srouji Awarded Nearly $10 Million in Stock
Tuesday December 29, 2015 5:07 AM PST by Joe Rossignol



Apple's newly promoted Senior Vice President of Hardware Technologies Johny Srouji was awarded 90,270 restricted stock units on October 5, 2015, according to a recent filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The RSUs awarded vest 12.5% in semi-annual installments over a four year period ending October 2019.

Srouji now has a total of 217,305 RSUs and 101,881 common stock units, which together amount to just over $34 million at AAPL's current trading price of around $107 per share. The latest batch of 90,270 RSUs are currently valued at approximately $9.6 million.

Apple often rewards high-level executives with RSUs based on their performance. In August, for example, Apple CEO Tim Cook and Senior Vice President of Internet Software and Services Eddy Cue received 560,000 and 350,000 RSUs respectively worth over $97 million combined. Apple retail chief Angela Ahrendts also received 113,334 RSUs as a signing bonus upon joining Apple in May 2014.

Srouji was promoted to Senior Vice President of Hardware Technologies on December 17, as part of a larger executive team makeover that saw Jeff Williams promoted to COO and marketing chief Phil Schiller take over App Store leadership across all Apple platforms. Tor Myhren, chief creative officer at ad agency Grey, will also join Apple in early 2016 as Vice President of Marketing Communications.

Srouji joined Apple in 2008 to lead development of the A4 chip for iPhone 4, and he now oversees silicon and hardware technologies, including batteries, application processors, storage controllers, sensors silicon, display silicon and other chipsets across Apple's entire product line. Prior to Apple, he held senior positions at Intel and IBM in the areas of processor development and design.Tags: AAPL, Johny Srouji, SEC, RSUs

I know how I would spend it if I had $5M or so (I'd own a nice house... Maybe get a vacation house... Get two Teslas... And retire to do whatever projects I want for the rest of my life) but I have no idea what you'd even do with money after that.

At some point you could get a yacht or a plane or something... But I don't really see the point. Seems that premium seats would get you most of the same niceties at a far lower price.
Psssh.  Where's your imagination.  I'd get hookers and blow... and a statue of a hooker made out of blow.  I'd buy a Capuchin monkey and hire a guy to do nothing but let the monkey hit him with pies... pies made of blow.  I'd hire a big ass group of civil war reenactors and force them to reenact the Peloponnesian war in full Civil War dress.  I'd buy the monkey an Apple Watch.  I would not buy the monkey an iPhone though.  Cuz, I mean seriously, monkeys don't need a phone.  Besides, he'd only accrue excessive data charges with Wifi Assist.

You'd be broke before you know it maintaining that large house and two 100k cars.

Plus... nobody would give someone $5 million, if they were the kind of person that would then immediately retire.
I think that kind of money is reserved for people passionate about their careers, who would work hard, achieve much, and leave a legacy.

If I were the majority shareholder at Apple:

1.Tim Cook would be unemployed. 

Why?

Apple Watch = Fail
Apple Maps = Fail
Siri = Fail
Apple Pay = Way too slow of an adoption rate, and the greed before widespread adoption comes first, so fail.

16 GB base for iPhone with $199 on contract = fail.
Shrinking stock price = Fail.
Apple Music = Fail.

The company's last keynote presentation would also have me worried that the company is starting to decline a bit.

2. There would be more Apple Stores

There's a grand total of one Apple Store in upstate NY, ONE.

I'm sure other areas have the same problem, where customers have to drive 2 hours just to go to the nearest Apple Store.


I know stockholders don't have the power to make every decision for the company, but they do have the power to overthrow the CEO.

Maintanace cost on a Telsa non existent ? Your kidding right? Maintenance of car = servicing , not repairs.

He's right. Servicing an electric car is almost nothing. In fact it is nothing for long periods. I have an electric car (not a Tesla) and the maintenance is identically zero so far (2 years 20,000 miles). It doesn't take oil ever. The only thing it will need is tires eventually. Oh and washer fluid.

On the other hand I have a Mercedes and after 18 months and 4500 miles it has already had two services scheduled and paid for.

"If I were king of the forrrrrest...."

One thing I would not do is base my decisions solely on my personal likes and dislikes, personal convenience or inconvenience (having a nearby Apple Retail Store???). Arguably, in business, the only "win" or "fail" is financial results. It's not whether the Apple Watch is a perfect product, or that it hasn't sold as many units as I imagine it should, or whether I  personally would own one - success is predicated on whether the product is profitable, whether it met or exceeded sales targets (did they make too many, or not enough?), whether customers are satisfied with their purchase (and so will buy more of the company's products), etc.

In an imperfect world, success or failure cannot be judged on the basis of imagined perfection. It doesn't exist, so what one imagines as perfection is besides the point. All one can do is strive. One could pick and choose all the great features of all the competing products, wrap them up in a package and imagine the greatest product in the world... but it doesn't exist. Each feature comes at a cost, and cost-is-no-object is not reasonable. In the end, utility, not perfection, is what matters. Is it good enough to do the job in a satisfying manner, or do users seek better elsewhere? Do benefits outweigh shortcomings?

One also has to question whether "winner takes all" ("best" product based on reviews, etc.) is ever reasonable. First Place doesn't necessarily make Second Place a failure, other than that it failed to take First Place.

Are Maps, Siri, and Apple Pay a success? How do you measure that? It's deeply integrated into the iOS and OS X environment (if a built-in app needs a map, it's going to be Maps). Users don't have a choice in that, which means that Maps has to be so bad/good as to alienate/enamor Apple customers (drive/pull them to/from the competition) in significant numbers, before it can be judged a success or failure in and of itself. While we have statistics on Maps' utilization (high rates of usage on iOS devices), since it's a "captive" product, that number tells us little about consumer preference. I don't think there's publicly-available hard data there that suggests the quality of Maps is either hurting or helping Apple (internet gripes are not exactly hard data). Apple's overall customer satisfaction numbers have not changed much one way or the other since Maps, Siri, or Apple Pay were introduced, but considering how high satisfaction numbers are to begin with, it's pretty hard to make a dent on the upside ("improved satisfaction by 10%" means less than a single percentage point move in the satisfaction ratings).

Maps, Siri, Apple Pay... these aren't even monetizable products. They're features intended to improve the overall appeal of other products. Apple undoubtedly has plenty of internal metrics on feature-by-feature utilization and customer satisfaction, but external numbers are harder to come by. If, as a major shareholder, I could get information to which the rest of the shareholding public is not privy... I and the company would be in violation of insider trading laws. In the absence of information... the phrase, "arbitrary and capricious" comes to mind.

So let's bring it back to financial results. Tim Cook has presided over historically great financial results. On numbers alone, there are few in history who match that performance. Hundreds of billions in profits? Hundreds of billions in excess cash? Increased dividends, huge share buy-backs "returning value to shareholders?"

Would you fire that person because you can imagine even better than historic results? Not likely. You might fire a person for malfeasance, or insubordination.

There may be tens of millions of people on this planet with the intelligence and skills to lead Apple, given the opportunities necessary to reach that particular place. I certainly won't say that Tim Cook is the one person who ought to be leading Apple. He has the job, and the company has been doing very, very well during his tenure. If I was that hypothetical, large shareholder, I'd be asking him, "What do you need in order to do an even better job?"

And this is exactly why you will never be Apple's CEO, or any company's CEO for that matter.

I would rather not work for directly a bunch of shareholders, but thank you.

Personally, I prefer family businesses instead, such as Wegmans. Wegmans treats their employees well, stays up to date on technology, and also treats their customers well. 

When you shop for the shareholder's profits, they don't care about you, the customer--but just screwing you out of your money with nothing in return. When you shop for a family's business, you get great customer service and appreciation. 

This is why people prefer to use a credit union over a bank-- a bank works for shareholders, and does everything possible to maximize profits. They'll rip you apart with ridiculous fees and the customer service will be mediocre at best (unless you're lucky). The credit union works for you, and not shareholders (who are actually the members of the credit union, so they work for the members).

I wish more companies would be non-for-profit or family owned.

When I was in high school, every other student had an iPod. I haven't met one person with an Apple Watch.

 I haven't seen one person that's heard of Apple Pay or even used it in over a year.



Success and failure judged on whether you know someone with an Apple Watch or have seen someone use Apple Pay?!

I've seen people use Apple Pay on an Apple Watch.  Does that mean Apple isn't failing anymore?! 

;)

I also have two Apple Stores within 10 mile of where I live...

This company is on a roll!

Apple Executive Johny Srouji Profiled About iPhone and iPad Chip Development
Thursday February 18, 2016 5:42 am PST by Joe Rossignol
Bloomberg Businessweek has published an in-depth profile of Apple senior vice president Johny Srouji that reveals how the iPad Pro was originally planned for a spring 2015 launch with the same A8X chip powering the iPad Air 2. The 12.9-inch tablet was running behind schedule, however, and Apple ultimately decided to delay announcing the device until late 2015 at its annual iPhone event.Apple realized the 12.9-inch tablet would seem lacking alongside the A9-based iPhone 6s, so Srouji and his team were challenged to fast-track development of the A9X chip by half a year. The chip was ultimately finished on time, and Srouji was rewarded with a promotion to Apple's executive team as Senior Vice President of Hardware Technologies and 90,000 RSUs in December.Apple-designed chipsets allow the company to deeply integrate hardware and software on iPhones and iPads, but Srouji admitted that silicon development is not easy.If there’s a bug in software, you simply release a corrected version. It’s different with hardware. “You get one transistor wrong, it’s done, game over,” Srouji says. “Each one of those transistors has to work. Silicon is very unforgiving.” Among computer and smartphone makers, industry practice is to leave the processors to specialists such as Intel, Qualcomm, or Samsung, which sink billions into getting the chips right and making them inexpensively.Apple did not always develop its own chips, as the profile explains. The original iPhone, for example, used components from different vendors, including a Samsung chip used in DVD players.“Steve came to the

Jeff Williams Named Apple COO, Phil Schiller Takes Over App Store Leadership
Thursday December 17, 2015 6:07 am PST by Joe Rossignol
Apple has announced an executive shakeup today that sees Jeff Williams promoted to Chief Operating Officer and marketing chief Phil Schiller taking over App Store leadership across all Apple platforms.Williams, who joined Apple in 1998 as head of worldwide procurement, becomes Apple's fourth C-level executive alongside CEO Tim Cook, Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri and Chief Design Officer Jony Ive.As vice president of operations since 2004, his responsibilities included overseeing Apple's supply chain, service and support, and the company's social responsibility initiatives protecting its employees worldwide. He also continues to supervise development of the Apple Watch and ResearchKit.Cook called Williams "hands-down the best operations executive I’ve ever worked with."“We are fortunate to have incredible depth and breadth of talent across Apple’s executive team. As we come to the end of the year, we’re recognizing the contributions already being made by two key executives,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “Jeff is hands-down the best operations executive I’ve ever worked with, and Johny’s team delivers world-class silicon designs which enable new innovations in our products year after year.”Apple's COO position had been vacant since Cook was named CEO in August 2011.Schiller's expanded role will be focused on strategies to extend Apple's ecosystem across iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV, alongside his traditional marketing responsibilities. App Store leadership previously belonged to Apple services chief Eddy Cue, who continues to oversee the

Apple Adds Five Vice Presidents, Including Two Women, to 'Apple Leadership' Press Page
Friday August 15, 2014 10:11 am PDT by Juli Clover
Apple today updated its Apple Leadership press page to add the bios of five vice presidents, including Paul Deneve, Lisa Jackson, Joel Podolny, Johny Srouji, and Denise Young Smith.The inclusion of several vice presidents on the executive team is a new move for the company, as the page previously only listed the company's lineup of senior vice presidents.Since taking over as CEO, Tim Cook has aimed to share the spotlight with his employees, letting company leaders like Eddy Cue, Craig Federighi, and Jony Ive take part in press interviews and lead Apple events. The addition of five new VPs to the press roster suggests Cook and the team at Apple are more open than ever, recognizing the efforts of an even larger number of key employees.Of the new executives joining the page, Paul Deneve and Lisa Jackson are relatively new hires, joining Apple in 2013. Deneve oversees special projects, while Jackson has a public-facing job overseeing Apple's environmental efforts. Joel Podolny, dean of Apple University and Denise Young Smith, who oversees Apple's human resources, were promoted to their roles early in 2014. The remaining VP, Johny Srouji, oversees hardware technologies, a role he has held for just over a year.The new additions to the executive press page also spotlight two additional women who hold important leadership roles at Apple, bringing the total number of females on the page to three, with Angela Ahrendts. Apple has faced criticism for its lack of female leadership in the past, which Cook has been aiming to remedy. According to diversity numbers

										Making sense of it all: Smartphone specs and terms explained									











What do the latest iPad, Apple TV, and iPhone all share in common? They sport systems on a chip (SoCs) whose designs were supervised by Johny Srouji, Apple’s senior vice president for hardware technologies. He’s the executive charged with overseeing the creation of the proprietary processors that power Apple’s many mobile products: the A4 with the release of the iPad, the A8X alongside the iPad Air 2 in 2014, and most recently the A9X with the iPad Pro, to name a few.
Apple’s hardware division has lately taken a backseat in terms of publicity to, say, Johnny Ive’s design labs and Angela Ahrendts’ retail operation, but Srouji led Bloomberg on a tour of the iPhone maker’s chip design process at Apple’s Cupertino, California and Herzliya, Israel chip facilities this week. The tidbits are tantalizing.
Srouji, a graduate of Israel’s Technion, is certain an accomplished fellow. His December promotion to his current position of vice president makes him the highest-ranking Israeli in Silicon Valley, according to the Haaretz newspaper. He’s fluent in Arabic, Hebrew, and French.

But perhaps more fascinating than the man is the division he built from the ground up. The first iPhone, Srouji explains, was essentially cobbled together from off-the-shelf parts — parts that included a Samsung chip used in DVD players. “Steve [Jobs] came to the conclusion that the only way for Apple to really differentiate and deliver something truly unique and truly great, you have to own your own silicon,” he told Bloomberg. “You have to control and own it.”
Apple’s then-hardware executive Bob Mansfield recruited Srouji to lead an in-house overhaul of Apple’s semiconductor efforts, and in the short span of a year Srouji spearheaded the acquisition of Silicon Valley chip startup P.A. Semi and grew the the company’s hardware division from 40 engineers to 150.
From that point on, silicon development accelerated. Srouji’s team designed the A4, the heart of the iPad and iPhone 4, specifically to accommodate the latter’s Retina display. The subsequent, iPad-powering A5X and A6X chips were similarly tailored to help Apple’s newer iPads keep up with the processing demands of their high-resolution displays.
Srouji’s headliner, though, was arguably the A7, the first smartphone chip with 64 bits. It took the industry by surprise; chipmaker Qualcomm, which at the time lacked an answer to Apple’s new architecture, started investing significantly in the development of a competitive product. “The chip architects at Apple are artists, the engineers are wizards,” said Srouji. “When we pick something, it’s because we think there’s a problem that nobody can do, or there is some idea that’s so unique and differentiating that the best way to do it is you have to do it yourself.”
The team achieved another silicon miracle last year with the debut of the iPad Pro’s A9. The tablet’s stylus, software, and other hardware issues forced Apple to push back the launch of the Pro from spring 2015 to the fall of that year. Initial plans called for the Pro to pack the A8X, the processor found in the iPad Air 2, but Srouji’s team took the delay as an opportunity to shift the A9X’s release forward. It debuted alongside the iPhone 6s’s A9.
Srouji describes the chipmaking process as a difficult balance between the features Apple’s software programmers request and space constraints imposed by the company’s industrial designers. His team’s custom designs have enabled such functionality as the rapid-fire photo burst mode, video calling, an always-on voice assistant, and an optimized battery and storage. But ultimately, the fundamentals are essential. “You get one transistor wrong, it’s done, game over,” he said. “Each one of those transistors has to work.”
To prevent any unpleasant surprises when Apple’s new silicon ships in its latest iPhones and iPads, the company’s hardware team subjects candidate chip designs to rigorous tests. Large, remotely operated boxes described as resembling “Zambonis” scan for potential errors in candidate chip architectures for up to months at a time. They’re then tested under extreme conditions and temperatures.
Srouji’s philosophy is one of optimism, though. “When designers say, ‘This is hard,’ my rule of thumb is if it’s not gated by physics, that means it’s hard but doable.”

Here's Johny Srouji: Apple's newest executive pioneered company's custom A-series chips

			By Neil Hughes 
Thursday, December 17, 2015, 12:21 pm PT (03:21 pm ET)

After playing integral roles in two of Apple's most important product innovations— its custom A-series processors and the Touch ID fingerprint sensor— Johny Srouji has been rewarded with a new title that sees him reporting directly to CEO Tim Cook.
As part of a series of changes among Apple's top brass, Srouji has been named senior vice president of Hardware Technologies. The title makes him the newest member of Apple's executive team.
An Arab-Israeli from the city of Haifa, Srouji earned bachelor's and master's degrees in Computer Science at Technion— Israel Institute of Technology. Prior to joining Apple, he worked in silicon design at both Intel, where he was senior manager of its Israel Design Center, and IBM, as director of development of its Power 7 processor unit.
When he started at Apple, Srouji's title was senior director of handheld chips and VLSI (very-large-scale integration). It was in that role that he spearheaded development of the A4 processor, a landmark achievement for Apple that paved the way for advancements in future iPhones and iPads.Apple's Johny Srouji, left, with Israel President Reuven Rivlin.

Apple's silicon development originally led to the A4, its first custom-designed System on a Chip, debuting in the iPad in 2010. Since then, Apple's electricity sipping CPUs have become even more powerful, most notably with the desktop-class A9X processor found in the 12.9-inch iPad Pro.
Srouji was also involved in creating the first Touch ID fingerprint sensor Apple first introduced in the iPhone 5s in 2013, according to Israeli publication Haaretz.
His expertise doesn't stop there, however: Apple also noted that he has also overseen in-house developments of new battery, storage and display technology.
Srouji's appointment to senior vice president Hardware Technologies puts his title essentially on par with Dan Riccio, Apple's senior vice president of Hardware Engineering. Riccio has been with Apple since 1998, and currently leads the Mac, iPhone, iPad and iPod engineering teams.
In years past, Apple's semiconductor teams were overseen by Bob Mansfield, also a hardware engineer. But in 2013, he relinquished his role on Apple's executive team, taking on a smaller position working on special projects under Cook, the CEO.
Srouji's new, more visible role at Apple only serves to emphasize the importance of the company's in-house silicon development, a key hardware facet that helps to differentiate its products from competitors. Beyond the A-series chips in the iPhone and iPad, Apple also has custom M-series motion coprocessors for advanced low-power sensors, and the S1 silicon that powers the Apple Watch.
There have also been recent rumors that Apple could begin offering its own proprietary graphics processors as part of its A-series chips. Apple currently uses slightly modified PowerVR designs from Imagination Technologies, but an in-house GPU could allow for more powerful devices— and could even potentially allow Apple to abandon Intel for an ARM-powered Mac.
