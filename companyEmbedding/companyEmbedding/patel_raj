                              simply the result of too much of the wrong kind of economics but rather the larger failure of a democratically bankrupt political
                              system. The solution he offers: discover democratic ways in which people, and not simply governments, can play a crucial role
                              in deciding how we might share our world and its resources in common."--Provided by publisher

                           Today there are over a billion hungry people on the planet, more than ever before in history. While the global food crisis
                              dropped out of the news in 2008, it returned in 2011 (and is threatening us again in 2012) and remains a painful reality for
                              the world's poor and underserved. Why, in a time of record harvests, are a record number of people going hungry? And why are
                              a handful of corporations making record profits? In Food Rebellions! Crisis and the Hunger for Justice, authors Eric Holt-Giménez

                           "Heute kennt man von allem den Preis und von nichts den Wert", sagte Oscar Wilde. Dieser Satz ist gegenwärtig aktueller denn
                              je. Ob Klima- oder Wirtschaftskrise, dahinter steht nicht zuletzt eine Krise der Werte. Fast jeder und alles wird in die Kategorien
                              von Märkten und Preisen gepresst. "Gibt es keinen besseren Weg, die Welt wertzuschätzen?", fragt Raj Patel. In unserem System
                              ist eine Fabrikanlage mit rauchenden Schloten Milliarden Dollar wert, ein intakter Wald dagegen nichts. Ein Tomaten-Erntehelfer
                              in den USA verdient in einem Jahr weniger als ein Wallstreet-Banker in einer Stunde. Wie konnte es so weit kommen? Seit den
                              70er-Jahren wurde unser Wirtschaftssystem von den Fundamentalisten des freien Marktes bestimmt, die jede Art der Regulierung
                              ablehnten. Viele glaubten ihnen, legten Geld an und konsumierten - oft auf Pump. Wir nannten es "Freiheit", sind aber dabei,
                              unsere Lebensgrundlagen zu zerstören und unsere Zukunft zu verspielen. Was können wir jetzt tun, um das Ruder herumzureißen?
                              "Das Gegenteil von Konsum ist nicht Sparsamkeit, sondern Großzügigkeit", sagt Raj Patel. Was Not tut, ist nachhaltiges Wirtschaften
                              und die Beachtung des Werts von sozialer Kooperation, Fairness, ökologischer und physischer Gesundheit. Dieses mitreissend
                              geschriebene Buch zeigt mit zwingender Klarheit die Denkfehler des Systems und wie sie zu korrigieren sind

                              Few things on Earth are as miraculous and vital as seeds, worshiped and treasured since the dawn of humankind. SEED: The Untold
                                 Story follows passionate seed keepers protecting our 12,000 year-old food legacy. In the last century, 94% of our seed varieties
                                 have disappeared. As biotech chemical companies control the majority of our seeds, farmers, scientists, lawyers, and indigenous
                                 seed keepers fight a David and Goliath battle to defend the future of our food. In a harrowing and heartening story, these
                                 heroes rekindle a lost connection to our most treasured resource and revive a culture connected to seeds.SEED features Vandana

                              A revision of Stuffed and Starved first issued in 2007. The author takes us into the supermarket aisles and reveals the stories
                                 behind the products in our trolleys, some of them very dark indeed. His definitive account of the global food system ranges
                                 across GM crops, history and export issues, rising levels of obesity and other health crises. It's a mad world where we encounter
                                 Coca Cola "cosmeceuticals" that promise to improve complexion and breast size, where Nestlé owns Jenny Craig - and Unilever,
                                 home of Ben and Jerry's icecream, owns Slimfast. It is also a positive story of resistance in the paddy fields of India, the
                                 maize ejidos of Mexico and the Italian Slow Food kitchens, to name but a few. This is a groundbreaking look and the people

                              "Voices of the Poor" provides a unique and detailed picture of the life of the poor and explains the constraints poor people
                                 face to escape from poverty in a way that more traditional survey techniques do not capture well. Each of the three volumes
                                 demonstrates the importance of voice and power in poor people's definition of poverty. 'Voices of the Poor' concludes that
                                 we need to expand our conventional views of poverty which focus on income expenditure, education, and health to include measures
                                 of voice and empowerment

                           "Patel shows how our faith in prices as a way of valuing the world is misplaced and reveals that our current crisis is not
                              simply the result of too much of the wrong kind of economics but rather the larger failure of a democratically bankrupt political
                              system. The solution he offers: discover democratic ways in which people, and not simply governments, can play a crucial role
                              in deciding how we might share our world and its resources in common."--Provided by publisher

                           Today there are over a billion hungry people on the planet, more than ever before in history. While the global food crisis
                              dropped out of the news in 2008, it returned in 2011 (and is threatening us again in 2012) and remains a painful reality for

                           "Heute kennt man von allem den Preis und von nichts den Wert", sagte Oscar Wilde. Dieser Satz ist gegenwärtig aktueller denn
                              je. Ob Klima- oder Wirtschaftskrise, dahinter steht nicht zuletzt eine Krise der Werte. Fast jeder und alles wird in die Kategorien
                              von Märkten und Preisen gepresst. "Gibt es keinen besseren Weg, die Welt wertzuschätzen?", fragt Raj Patel. In unserem System
                              ist eine Fabrikanlage mit rauchenden Schloten Milliarden Dollar wert, ein intakter Wald dagegen nichts. Ein Tomaten-Erntehelfer
                              in den USA verdient in einem Jahr weniger als ein Wallstreet-Banker in einer Stunde. Wie konnte es so weit kommen? Seit den
                              70er-Jahren wurde unser Wirtschaftssystem von den Fundamentalisten des freien Marktes bestimmt, die jede Art der Regulierung
                              ablehnten. Viele glaubten ihnen, legten Geld an und konsumierten - oft auf Pump. Wir nannten es "Freiheit", sind aber dabei,
                              unsere Lebensgrundlagen zu zerstören und unsere Zukunft zu verspielen. Was können wir jetzt tun, um das Ruder herumzureißen?
                              "Das Gegenteil von Konsum ist nicht Sparsamkeit, sondern Großzügigkeit", sagt Raj Patel. Was Not tut, ist nachhaltiges Wirtschaften
                              und die Beachtung des Werts von sozialer Kooperation, Fairness, ökologischer und physischer Gesundheit. Dieses mitreissend
                              geschriebene Buch zeigt mit zwingender Klarheit die Denkfehler des Systems und wie sie zu korrigieren sind

                           Patel shows how our faith in prices as a way of valuing the world is misplaced and reveals that our current crisis is not
                              simply the result of too much of the wrong kind of economics but rather the larger failure of a democratically bankrupt political
                              system. The solution he offers: discover democratic ways in which people, and not simply governments, can play a crucial role
                              in deciding how we might share our world and its resources in common

                                 Story follows passionate seed keepers protecting our 12,000 year-old food legacy. In the last century, 94% of our seed varieties
                                 have disappeared. As biotech chemical companies control the majority of our seeds, farmers, scientists, lawyers, and indigenous
                                 seed keepers fight a David and Goliath battle to defend the future of our food. In a harrowing and heartening story, these

                              A revision of Stuffed and Starved first issued in 2007. The author takes us into the supermarket aisles and reveals the stories
                                 behind the products in our trolleys, some of them very dark indeed. His definitive account of the global food system ranges
                                 across GM crops, history and export issues, rising levels of obesity and other health crises. It's a mad world where we encounter
                                 Coca Cola "cosmeceuticals" that promise to improve complexion and breast size, where Nestlé owns Jenny Craig - and Unilever,
                                 home of Ben and Jerry's icecream, owns Slimfast. It is also a positive story of resistance in the paddy fields of India, the
                                 maize ejidos of Mexico and the Italian Slow Food kitchens, to name but a few. This is a groundbreaking look and the people

                              "Voices of the Poor" provides a unique and detailed picture of the life of the poor and explains the constraints poor people
                                 face to escape from poverty in a way that more traditional survey techniques do not capture well. Each of the three volumes
                                 demonstrates the importance of voice and power in poor people's definition of poverty. 'Voices of the Poor' concludes that
                                 we need to expand our conventional views of poverty which focus on income expenditure, education, and health to include measures
