                The Honda lease program  changes depending of the current lease company who actually designed the Honda program to their customers
            

                Look at LeaseTrader.com listing and see the actual leasing company, and find how the Honda lease program works.
            

                Each Honda leasing company offers a Honda lease program that meets the users needs for a wide range of models and Honda car types. Most companies accept the posibility of doing a lease swap, so the Honda lease program options are transfered from the current Honda lease program owner to a new qualified customer who is taking over the Honda lease in short term.  This new customer also assumes the responsabilities implied into the original Honda lease program as the amount of miles allowed and monthly payments.

Car lease Specials, The Simple Way

    Buyers who are in the market to acquire a new car lose sleep over the dilemma of buying or leasing.
    Both options have plusses and minuses to them. You may pay less in the long run by purchasing a new vehicle; so if you are planning on keeping the car for over 4 years purchasing might be the right choice for you, however if you do not plan to keep the car for over 4 years leasing might be the correct choice to make, and your monthly car lease payments should be much lower. Compare car lease specials and save.
    
Affordability and flexibility the leasing gives you are generally the biggest consideration when leasing a new vehicle. Before choosing look at your job stability and the state of your personal finances; this will help you understand what you can afford.
Car leasing short term can yield payments that are less than the monthly payments of purchasing a car.
        Leasing a Car Lease on Specials are the best option to saving on monthly payments.
    
When getting a car on lease specials you are only paying a portion of the total cost of the vehicle when you lease instead of the entire amount.
With a decent down payment you may be better off purchasing the car and getting a good interest rate; this is ideal if you plan on keeping your car for a longer amount of time. The ownership is yours when purchasing and therefore you have more freedoms with the car than you do when you lease a car.
For those who do not have a down payment and may not qualify for the credit terms yet want to drive a luxury car such as a Lexus lease or Mercedes lease special may be exactly what you are looking for.
Car leasing will almost always have monthly payments that are less than if you are buying the vehicle.
You will want to make sure you can adhere to the conditions of the lease including those of the terms of the lease special. 
Having good timing and knowledge you should be able to get luxury brands like Mercedes-Benz lease on specials, BMW lease specials, Lexus leases, Infiniti leases, Ford leases in lease Special.
In the market for an SUV or minivan; many models are leased and having lease rebates and lease specials by month end.
With the financial considerations set aside, your lease or purchase decision is influenced by your lifestyle and personal preference.  Do you get attached to your vehicle? Do you keep your car for more than 4 years? If so you may want to purchase;
however, if you get bored with a car after about two years, you are part of the growing number of Americans than are part of the leasing lifestyle, then you may be the ideal candidate for leasing.

Car lease contracts allow for 12,000 to 15,000 miles a year and will charge extra for mileage beyond that.
Additionally you will need to make sure the car is kept up in very good condition to avoid high end-of-lease costs.
When looking for car lease specials you will find a host of locations and dealerships as well as a host of car lease specials to take advantage of including car leasing short term deals

Water Management Module

	The Water Management module in SMS Advanced allows you to map out and plan tile lines to be installed. Designing these plans in SMS allows you to visualize the field from different perspectives, as well as overlay with other layers such as yield or soil type maps.

 Features

Design Tiling Plans




	Utilize the software's ability to import multiple different file types and design your tiling plans based on any reference layer to strategically place tile runs. Utilize soil surveys, yield maps, elevation maps or even high resolution LIDAR data. View these maps in 3D to gain a better perspective on the field's topography. Make use of the powerful Terrain Analysis tool for a greater outlook of the field's terrain



Create Tiling Plans




	Place tile mains, sub mains or laterals based on your tiling parameters to create accurate tile plans. Added tile lines will display a soil profile view, making it easy to see changes in elevation and these changes affect your tile runs. Utilize tools incorporated into the software to make sure your tile plans will drain the right amount of water in the right amount of time. 



Reference Layers




	When creating new tile plans, any reference layer can be displayed to help strategically place tile lines, such as Soil Survey, Yield, Elevation, Flow Arrows, Existing Tile or LIDAR data. Display the field in 3D terrain view to gain perspective on the field. Use the Terrain Analysis tools in SMS Advanced to show water flow related attributes such as Wetness Potential and Drainage area. Easily visualize these attributes with directional flow arrows that can overlay these maps.



Track Installed Tile




	Import and store installed tile lines to help you locate and easily add on to a drainage system. If the tile was installed using the Ag Leader display or Gradient Intellislope display, SMS will display a soil profile view detailing how the tile was installed. 

	This can be used to ensure that all your tile lines indeed have a positive flow. Data collected from the Ag Leader display will also show GPS statistics when you were running in the field. For installations with the Ag leader display using AutoTile®, you can see the depth of the tile as well.



Share your tile designs




	Designing a tile plan in SMS allows you to easily create multiple variations to a tile system so you can compare the amount of tile used, as well as the most effective placement to ensure your install time and effort are maximized. These plans can easily be printed in custom formats to provide a quote to land owners or for documentation purposes. 



Print Tiling Plans




	Designing Tile Plans in SMS allows you to create multiple approaches to a tile system, so you can compare the amount of tile used as well as the most effective placement to ensure your time and effort are not wasted. Tile plans can be easily printed for quotes to land owners or used to provide documentation for future reference.



Drainage Calculation Tools




	The Tile Design Editor encompasses many features that ensure tile plan designing goes smoothly. Settings for the Drainage Coefficent, Min/Max depth, Connection Offset and more make sure your tile plan will drain correctly.

Efficiently Manage Client's Data




	Organize client's information in seperate and secure projects. Projects can be organized by groups and can also be password protected. Multiple users can access projects from a storage location and may check out projects for client review while in the field. Projects can be stored at multiple data locations offering flexibility for large client databases. Each location can be formatted for custom migration and backup settings. 

	Wirelessly transfer prescriptions and other management files to the field by utilizing AgFiniti's file transfer feature. Use AgFiniti's file sharing tools for instant access to client's data. With a grower's permission, custom sharing relationships can be established for easy data access between AgFiniti accounts. 



Create tailor-made Report and Print Layouts




	Give grower clients the specific information they need by developing customized reports, maps, charts and summaries, including multi-layer views of planting, harvesting and application maps.

	The SMS software has an abundance of print layouts and the ability to create user-defined layouts that you can use to feature your data on the right layout.



Discover Yield Influencers




	Utilize the Correlation and Comparison Analysis tools to begin understanding how in-field variables influence yield.

	The Correlation tool indicates a position or negative relationship between two variables. 1 indicates a positive/strong correlation and 0 indicates no correlation. For example, if a correlation result revealed a .464 relationship between yield and soil CEC one may determine areas of the field with higher CEC levels have a greater chance of producing a higher yield. 

	Once you've identified a relationship between variables the Comparison Analysis tool can be used to further understand it. The Comparison tool helps you better identify how one or more variables (such as hybrid selection, soil type, fertilizer rates, planting dates) combine to affect results, such as yield. For example, a comparison could be run to determine optimum planting speed. 



Reveal Management Zones




	See field trends based on layers of annual field data such as soil types, soil fertility results, yield data, NDVI results and more all in one map, giving you the valuable date needed for creating management zones. Data normalization tools allow you to accurately view yield trends even when multiple crops types have been planted in the same field over the years. 



Create Formula Based Prescriptions




	Build an equation to generate a new dataset based on mapped layers, such as soil test results, soil type, grain harvest, zone maps or previous fertilizing application.

	Create, edit and save fertilizer recommendation equations from universities, consultants and others, then apply those recommendations to specific projects, or across the entire client base. Users can also output multiple product recommendations from a single equation, helping make prescription writing more efficient.



Interpret NIR Imagery




	Convert NIR imagery captured from satellite, airplane or UAV into a manageable spatial layer for data analysis, creating prescriptions or generating management zones. Simply identify the near infared and visible red color bands and the NDVI analysis will do the work by calculating NDVI and NIR vigor values into mapped attributes.



Breakdown Field Profitability




	Create a new layer based on expense and income entries from all operations that contain financial tracking information. The resulting map will visually display profit/loss values and trends across fields and totals in profit/loss reports.



Reduce Processing Time




	Process SMS Advanced’s powerful analysis tools in batch mode across projects and datasets to reduce time and develop consistent reporting for clients.

	Also, utilize SMS’ Batch Command Utility to complete many common data management tasks such as Import and Exporting files (including shape and text), generating boundaries, reprocessing data and more, saving you valuable processing time. Note: Limited Batch Functionality also available in SMS Basic.



Better Visualize Field Topography 




	Use Terrain Analysis and 3D View layers to begin understanding your field's relationship between topography and yield and to determine drainage needs. View multiple terrain characteristics such as drainage area, watershed id, slope, wetness potential and flow direction. 



Better Manage Operational Activities




	View an animation of operations pass-by-pass. Watch an instant replay of how an operation was logged in the field. Slow down, speed up, pause and skip during replay of the event. Also, actual time attribute values for the operation will be displayed during replay (e.g., speed, rate, elevation, etc.).

	An easy-to-read calendar format gives a unique chronological view of all field activities. This allows for better understanding of how timing of field work impacts yield. View field activities by day, week or month. Enter events not recorded with a display for thorough records. Calendars can be printed, filtered and custom grouped for different viewing preferences.



View your data anywhere




	View your data anywhere, from any device* when using SMS in conjunction with the AgFiniti cloud-based platform! Export your data from your SMS desktop software and view your row by row planting, application, harvest data and more in the cloud!
