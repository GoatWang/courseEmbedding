	Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.



	On June 15, 2017, Extended Stay America, Inc. (the Company) entered into a preferred share repurchase agreement (the Share Repurchase
	Agreement) with certain entities affiliated with Centerbridge Partners, L.P. and The Blackstone Group L.P. (the Selling Stockholders) pursuant to which the Company repurchased, directly from the Selling Stockholders, 14,069 shares
	of Series A Preferred Stock of the Company (the Preferred Shares) on June 15, 2017. The preferred share repurchase was effected in a private, non-underwritten transaction at a price per share equal to $1,000 plus all accrued and
	unpaid dividends thereon through and including the date of the repurchase. The Company funded the preferred share repurchase from cash on hand. The preferred share repurchase was approved by the Companys audit committee. After this preferred
	share repurchase, the Company has 7,133 Preferred Shares outstanding and the Selling Stockholders no longer beneficially own any Preferred Shares. The foregoing description of the Share Repurchase Agreement does not purport to be complete and is
	qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Share Repurchase Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

	Extended Stay America Announces Repurchase of Preferred Shares



	CHARLOTTE, N.C.June 15, 2017 (BUSINESS WIRE) Extended Stay America, Inc. (the Company) (NYSE: STAY) today announced that it entered
	into a preferred share repurchase agreement with certain selling stockholders affiliated with Centerbridge Partners, L.P. and The Blackstone Group L.P. (the Selling Stockholders) pursuant to which the Company repurchased directly from
	the Selling Stockholders 14,069 shares of Series A Preferred Stock of the Company (the Preferred Shares). The preferred share repurchase was effected in a private, non-underwritten transaction at a price per share equal to $1,000 plus
	all accrued and unpaid dividends thereon through and including the date of the repurchase. The Company funded the preferred share repurchase from cash on hand. The preferred share repurchase was approved by the Companys audit committee. After
	this preferred share repurchase, the Company has 7,133 Preferred Shares outstanding and the Selling Stockholders no longer beneficially own any Preferred Shares. Following the closing of the preferred share repurchase, the repurchased Preferred
	Shares will be retired. The timing and method of any future Preferred Share repurchases (other than in connection with the exercise of any put rights), will depend on a variety of factors, including market conditions and the Companys financial
	condition and are subject to the discretion of management.


	The Companys Chief Financial Officer, Jonathan Halkyard, commented, We are pleased
	to continue to improve our balance sheet and lower our cost of capital. Since returning to the public markets in 2013 and including this repurchase agreement, the Company has retired over $950 million in debt and has refinanced the entire balance
	sheet into long dated, low cost and flexible debt.

	Item 1.01.




	Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.





	On March 1, 2017, Extended Stay America, Inc. and ESH
	Hospitality, Inc. (together, the Company) entered into a share repurchase agreement (the Share Repurchase Agreement) with the Selling Stockholders (as defined below) pursuant to which they intend to repurchase, directly from
	the Selling Stockholders, 625,000 Paired Shares, each Paired Share consisting of a share of common stock of Extended Stay America, Inc. and a share of Class B common stock of ESH Hospitality, Inc., which are attached and trade together as Paired
	Shares. The share repurchase will be effected in a private, non-underwritten transaction at a price per share equal to the price paid by the underwriters in the offering (as defined below). Extended Stay America, Inc. and ESH Hospitality, Inc.
	expect to fund the share repurchase from cash on hand. The share repurchase is expected to be consummated concurrently with the offering. Although the completion of the share repurchase will be conditioned upon the closing of the offering, the
	closing of the offering will not be conditioned upon the closing of the share repurchase. The share repurchase has been approved by the audit committees of Extended Stay America, Inc. and ESH Hospitality, Inc. and is pursuant to, and will count
	toward, the Companys existing combined Paired Share repurchase program. The foregoing description of the Share Repurchase Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Share
	Repurchase Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.




	 









	Item 8.01.




	Other Events.





	On March 6, 2017, the Company issued a press release which announced the pricing of the
	underwritten secondary offering (the offering) of 25,000,000 Paired Shares. The Paired Shares were offered by certain entities affiliated with Centerbridge Partners, L.P., Paulson & Co. Inc. and The Blackstone Group L.P. (the
	Selling Stockholders), which is expected to result in gross proceeds of approximately $421 million. The Paired Shares may be offered by the underwriters from time to time to purchasers directly or through agents, or through brokers in
	brokerage transactions on the NYSE, or to dealers in negotiated transactions or in a combination of such methods of sale, at a fixed price or prices, which may be changed, or at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to such
	prevailing market prices or at negotiated prices. The offering is expected to close on March 10, 2017, subject to customary closing conditions.


	The
	Company will not sell any Paired Shares in the offering and will not receive any proceeds from the offering. In addition, none of the Companys officers or directors are selling any Paired Shares beneficially owned by them in the offering.


	A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.

	ESH Hospitality, Inc., which are attached and trade together as Paired Shares. The Paired Shares were offered by certain selling stockholders affiliated with Centerbridge Partners, L.P., Paulson & Co. Inc. and The Blackstone Group L.P. (the
	Selling Stockholders), which is expected to result in gross proceeds of approximately $421 million. The offering is expected to close on March 10, 2017, subject to customary closing conditions.


	The Company will not sell any Paired Shares in the offering and will not receive any proceeds from the offering. In addition, none of the Companys
	officers or directors are selling any Paired Shares beneficially owned by them in the offering.


	Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC and Barclays Capital
	Inc. are acting as the underwriters for the offering.


	The offering is being made only by means of a prospectus and related prospectus supplement, copies
	of which may be obtained, when available, from: Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Attention: Prospectus Department, One Madison Avenue, New York, New York, 10010, or by telephone at +1 (800) 221-1037, or by email at

	Stockholders pursuant to which they intend to repurchase 625,000 Paired Shares directly from the Selling Stockholders. The share repurchase will be effected in a private, non-underwritten transaction at a price per share equal to the price paid by
	the underwriters in the offering. Extended Stay America, Inc. and ESH Hospitality, Inc. expect to fund the share repurchase from cash on hand. The share repurchase is expected to be consummated concurrently with the offering. Although the share
	repurchase will be conditioned upon, among other things, the closing of the offering, the closing of the offering will not be conditioned upon the closing of the share repurchase. The share repurchase has been approved by the audit committees of
	Extended Stay America, Inc. and ESH Hospitality, Inc. and is pursuant to, and will count toward, the Companys existing combined Paired Share repurchase program. Following the closing of the share repurchase, the repurchased Paired Shares will
	be retired. The timing and method of any future repurchases, which will depend on a variety of factors, including market conditions and the Companys financial condition, are subject to the discretion of management.
