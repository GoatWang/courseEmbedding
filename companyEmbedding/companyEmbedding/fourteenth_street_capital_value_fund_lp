Vanguard balanced funds


100% of our low-cost balanced funds performed better than their peer-group averages over the past 10 years.*




Get a mix of stocks and bonds in one fund
Combine the potential for income and growth



Balanced mutual funds invest in both bonds, which focus primarily on income, and stocks, which aim for investment growth.

Add stability to your portfolio



The bond portion of the fund helps offset the risks associated with the stock portion—providing you with a "balanced" investment.

Automatically maintain your asset mix



You never have to rebalance a balanced fund—it's done for you automatically. Some funds maintain a set asset mix, while others grow more conservative over time.

Spread out your exposure to risk



By potentially holding hundreds—sometimes thousands—of bonds and stocks in a single balanced fund, you get more diversification than you would buying individual bonds and stocks.

How to choose a balanced fund



Picking a Vanguard balanced fund generally depends on whether you're investing for a specific goal, like retirement, or you have another goal in mind.

Target Retirement Funds



If you're investing for retirement, you can get a complete portfolio in a single fund with a Vanguard Target Retirement Fund. Simply choose a fund based on the date you plan to retire or your current age, and the fund will gradually grow more conservative the closer you get to retirement.
See which Target Retirement Fund fits your timeline


LifeStrategy Funds



If you'd prefer a fund that maintains a set asset mix, a LifeStrategy® Fund can help you reach other financial goals.
Match your risk tolerance to a LifeStrategy Fund


Managed Payout Fund



If you're looking to generate income in retirement, Vanguard Managed Payout Fund** might be appropriate for you.
Get income from the Managed Payout Fund


Traditional balanced funds



If you'd like a set asset allocation based on the level of risk you're comfortable with, choose from a variety of traditional index or actively managed balanced funds.

Rebalancing involves periodically buying and selling the stocks, bonds, cash, or other investments in your portfolio to maintain your original or desired mix of those assets.

footnote*For the 10-year period ended March 31, 2017, 23 of 23 Vanguard balanced funds outperformed their Lipper peer-group averages. Results will vary for other time periods.

footnote**Vanguard Managed Payout Fund is protected by U.S. Patent Nos. 8,180,695 and 8,185,464.
	Investments in Target Retirement Funds are subject to the risks of their underlying funds. The year in the fund name refers to the approximate year (the target date) when an investor in the fund would retire and leave the workforce. The fund will gradually shift its emphasis from more aggressive investments to more conservative ones based on its target date. An investment in a Target Retirement Fund is not guaranteed at any time, including on or after the target date.
	Each LifeStrategy Fund invests in 4 broadly diversified Vanguard funds and is subject to the risks associated with those underlying funds.
	The Managed Payout Fund is not guaranteed to achieve its investment objectives, is subject to loss, and some of its distributions may be treated in part as a return of capital. The dollar amount of the fund's monthly cash distributions could go up or down substantially from one year to the next and over time. It is also possible for the fund to suffer substantial investment losses and simultaneously experience additional asset reductions as a result of its distributions to shareholders under its managed-distribution policy. An investment in the fund could lose money over short, intermediate, or even long periods of time because the fund allocates its assets worldwide across different asset classes and investments with specific risk and return characteristics. Diversification does not necessarily ensure a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market. The fund is proportionately subject to the risks associated with its underlying funds, which may invest in stocks (including stocks issued by REITs), bonds, cash, inflation-linked investments, commodity-linked investments, long/short market-neutral investments, and leveraged absolute return investments.
	The Managed Payout Fund may not be appropriate for all investors. For example, depending on the time horizon, retirement income needs, and tax bracket, an investment in the Managed Payout Fund might not be appropriate for younger investors not currently in retirement, in IRAs or other tax-advantaged accounts for those investors under 59½, or for participants in employer-sponsored plans. Investors who hold the Managed Payout Fund within a tax-advantaged retirement account should consult their tax advisors to discuss tax consequences that could result if payments are distributed from their core account prior to age 59½ or if they plan to use the Managed Payout Fund, in whole or in part, to meet their required minimum distribution (RMD) obligations. Distributions from the Managed Payout Fund are unlikely to precisely match an investor's IRA RMD obligations. In addition, use of the Managed Payout Fund may be restricted in employer-sponsored plans by the terms of the governing plan documents and/or at the discretion of the plan administrator. Review the information carefully with your financial advisor before deciding whether the Managed Payout Fund is right for you.
	All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss.
	Vanguard provides services to the Vanguard funds and ETFs at cost.

Index funds could help lower long-term costs
Get the high quality and low costs you'd expect from the company that introduced indexing to individual investors.
What are index mutual funds?



Instead of hiring fund managers to actively select which stocks or bonds the fund will hold, an index fund buys all (or a representative sample) of the securities in a specific index, like the S&P 500 Index.The goal of an index fund is to track the performance of a specific market benchmark as closely as possible. That's why you may hear it referred to as a "passively managed" fund.

Index funds offer built-in benefits








Low costs
Because index funds hold investments until the index itself changes, they generally have lower management and transaction costs.
 




Lower risk through broader diversification
Some index funds give you exposure to potentially thousands of securities in a single fund.
 




Tax efficiency
Broad index funds generally don't trade as much as actively managed funds might, so they're typically generating less taxable income, which reduces the drag on your investments.
 
Compare index funds vs. actively managed funds 

Could actively managed funds help you beat the market?

Read more about what you should consider when choosing an index fund


You can get an index fund anywhere—why Vanguard?








We started the indexing revolution
Vanguard launched the first index fund for individual investors in 1976, and we've been fine-tuning both our benchmark selections and tracking skills ever since.Today, we have more than 60 unique funds that track indexes across the bond and stock markets, both U.S. and international, as well as sector-specific areas of the markets.

We've made it our business to keep your costs low
The average Vanguard index fund expense ratio is 71% less than the industry average.*

Low-cost investing for everyone



Our passion for low costs will always be our driving force. When others take notice, expense ratios fall more broadly. Everyone wins!

How would index funds fit into your portfolio?



Because of their low costs, broader diversification, and tax efficiency, index funds could be appropriate for any portion of your portfolio. In fact, the right balance of four of our broadest index funds could give you a complete portfolio, with full exposure to U.S. and international stock and bond markets.Get details on:

	All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market. Bond funds are subject to the risk that an issuer will fail to make payments on time and that bond prices will decline because of rising interest rates or negative perceptions of an issuer's ability to make payments. Investments in stocks issued by non-U.S. companies are subject to risks including country/regional risk, which is the chance that political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions; and currency risk, which is the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates. Funds that concentrate on a relatively narrow market sector face the risk of higher share-price volatility. Past performance is no guarantee of future returns. The performance of an index is not an exact representation of any particular investment, as you cannot invest directly in an index.

5:05 PM  Shifting Fund Strategy, Extending Commitment Periods, Fund Workouts and Other Advisory Board Issues 


Due to opportunity or the lack of many funds have extended fund life or gone outside their fund parameters to reach their investment objectives. There are the slight shifts like writing debt in your equity fund org going into secondary markets. Other funds have gone through much bigger transformations. And still other funds just weren’t successful investments. This session will discuss the advisory board make up, role of the advisory board in approving such transformations, the role of the non-voting LP and the strategy/extension success/failure.

5:05 PM  Europe, the Next Shoe to Drop and Worldwide Risk-Adjusted Returns 


We’ve all gotten used to finding value-added returns without going further west than San Francisco or east of the Hamptons in the summer. As gateway city values are getting frothy should we consider getting on a plane to London, checking out Rio’s carnival, brushing up on our Chinese or getting out the black book of Indian joint venture partners? Meanwhile Europe continues to be Europe with Cypress, Greece and Whatever is next. Has Europe reached its low point and is now on the slow way back or is there another black swan waiting?

Commerce Street Capital Advised Oakwood Bancshares in Capital Raise of More Than $38 Million




Pharr PR











May 15 @ 09:07








Commerce Street Capital, LLC (“CSC”), a Dallas-based investment banking firm, served as financial advisor to Oakwood Bancshares, Inc. (“Oakwood”) on its recent capital raise of more than $38 million as well as buy side advisor on the transaction. This new capital allows Plano-based Oakwood to become a bank holding company by acquiring the historic Oakwood State Bank. This acquisition will also allow Oakwood State Bank, which is located 120 miles southeast of Dallas, to expand into the North Texas market.
 
“We are proud to help Oakwood take the next steps to better serve their growing community,” said Dory Wiley, President and CEO of CSC. “This new capital will allow the holding company to move forward with its strategic growth plan, including strong internal growth and offering a wider range of services to its banking customers.”
 
CSC’s Bank Capital Group Managing Director, Steve Parks was the lead financial advisor to Oakwood on the capital raise. He was assisted by Senior Vice President, Jay Orr. CSC’s team worked closely with the leadership of Oakwood in the transaction.
 
“Oakwood State Bank has been a successful financial institution for more than 100 years, and this transaction will allow the bank to broaden its customer base, while maintaining its historic roots in Oakwood, Texas,” said Parks. “The expansion plans for Oakwood State Bank include two additional branches in the Dallas area.”
 
Founded in 1900, the historic Oakwood State Bank has resided at 300 Main Street in Oakwood, Texas since 1910, but recently underwent renovations to restore and expand the structure.  With just 600 checking accounts and two employees, Oakwood State Bank has previously been recognized as the smallest bank in America.
 
CSC’s Bank Capital Group practice has more than 20 years of experience raising capital for community banks regardless of market direction or circumstances, in major metropolitan areas and rural communities across the country. CSC brings management teams, acquisition and organizer groups access to market assessment; charter application development; development and execution of a capital strategy; project consulting; full-time, on-site project management; and secure, real-time, dedicated on-line process management systems.

Commerce Street Peak Advisors Expands 401k Plan Offerings to Help Employers Meet ERISA Requirements




Pharr PR











Mar 15 @ 10:04








The Employee Retirement Security Act (ERISA) emphasizes that responsible retirement plan sponsors must act prudently and solely in the interest of plan participants and beneficiaries when selecting and monitoring service providers and plan investments. These ERISA requirements have created a surge in new business for Commerce Street Peak Advisors (“CSPA”).  
CSPA’s retirement plan solutions include 401(k), 403(b) and 457 programs which address the need for employers to utilize fiduciary investment managers to assist them in meeting new ERISA fiduciary requirements by providing reasonable fees, more transparency and mitigating potential conflicts of interest within the programs. CSPA began offering ERISA compliant retirement solutions to many of its banking clients in 2015. More recently, employers beyond the banking industry also began embracing CSPA’s retirement plan solutions.
“CSPA’s retirement plan advisory business has expanded dramatically over the last year. Our clients currently include law firms and service providers in addition to banks,” said Dory Wiley. “This demand reflects how organizations are taking the ERISA regulations seriously.”
It has been widely reported that multiple lawsuits are being filed on behalf of retirement plan participants against corporations such as Allergan, JC Penny and Starwood. Financial advisory firms such as Aeon Hewitt, Fidelity and New York Life have also been named in suits.
“In addition to reassuring employers that they are compliant with ERISA fiduciary requirements, Peak Advisors’ retirement plan platforms offer comprehensive and cost-effective solutions for 401(k), 403(b) and 457 plans that are professionally managed, risk-based portfolios,” Wiley said. “We are providing unbundled services and thereby offering lower management fees, transparent investment policy programs and better participant education.”
Commerce Street Peak Advisors is acting in the capacity of a 3(21) Investment Consultant and/or a 3(38) Discretionary Investment Manager in offering these retirement solutions. 
About Commerce Street Investment Advisors 
Commerce Street Investment Advisor (“CSIA”), dba Commerce Street Peak Advisors (“CSPA”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Commerce Street Holdings LLC, a Texas limited liability company and SEC-registered.

Valesco Industries Announces $59 Million First Closing of Valesco Fund II, LP




Pharr PR











Jun 1 2016








Valesco Industries (“Valesco”) is pleased to announce the successful first close of its second fund, Valesco Fund II, LP (“Fund II” or “VFII”), completed on May 25, 2016 at $59 million.  VFII is managed by Dallas-based Valesco, and is the successor fund to Valesco Commerce Street Capital, LP, a private equity fund created by Valesco and Commerce Street Capital, LLC (“CSC”). Fund II is seeking total equity commitments of $150 million.  By utilizing the Small Business Investment Company debenture program of U.S. Small Business Administration (“SBA”), Fund II is targeting $250 million in aggregate investment capital.
VFII was formed for the purpose of raising capital for a private investment fund licensed under the Small Business Investment Company (“SBIC”) program of the SBA. VFII was created to provide long-term equity and subordinated debt capital to growth-oriented small and lower middle market businesses located primarily in the southern U.S.
“In keeping with our first fund, Valesco partnered with Commerce Street Capital as our placement agent to raise the private equity capital.  The collaboration has been excellent, with our first close exceeding plan and happening in just four months,” said Bud Moore, a Valesco founder.
Jack Sadden, also a Valesco founder, added, “Valesco's track record of providing capital and management support to growing businesses, and Commerce Street’s significant investment banking and advisory resources in the community banking arena, were instrumental in attracting both bank and non-bank investors to Fund II.”
SBIC funds are a critical source of growth capital in the U.S.  Created by the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, the SBIC mission is “to improve and stimulate the national economy in general and the small-business segment in particular by establishing a program to stimulate and supplement the flow of private equity capital and long-term loan funds which small-business concerns need for the sound financing of their business operations and for their growth, expansion, and modernization.”
About Valesco Industries
Valesco is a Dallas, Texas based private equity firm that focuses on making control and non-control investments in select growth-oriented small- and lower- middle-market businesses engaged in manufacturing, distribution and business-to-business services. Valesco specializes in partnering with a company’s management team to support its growth objectives.

Bankers attending Commerce Street Capital’s Conference Heard it’s  a Great Time to Buy Banks




Pharr PR











May 9 2016
















John Steinmetz, Scott MacDonald, Craig Scheef and
        John Steinmetz, Scott MacDonald, Craig Scheef and Ken Cook at Commerce Street Capital's 14th Annual Bank Conference
    















Improving profitability, minimizing risk and maintaining growth in a challenging banking environment – these were some of the strategies discussed in detail during Commerce Street Capital’s (“CSC”) 14th Annual Banking Conference. More than 200 regional and community bankers in attendance heard insights about ways to positively influence bank performance amid elevated market volatility, increased regulatory challenges and an uncertain economy.
 
A key theme of this year’s conference was the impact global and national issues have on local community banks. In opening the conference, CSC’s Chairman Tex Gross welcomed attendees and said, “Whether you are in Bowie, Bellville or Beaumont, today, you must have a world view.”
 
Reva Bhalla, Vice President of Global Analysis for Stratfor Global Intelligence, opened the conference with her presentation entitled “The Global Crunch – How We Got Here. Where We’re Going.” Ms. Bhalla outlined global economic trends over 20-year cycles. Bhalla further explained that the U.S. is in a much stronger position for growth than the rest of the world, given that the projected demographics of the U.S. population isn’t as heavily weighted by senior citizens as other countries.
 
“As community bankers we have a lot of insight into our local economy, but banking is very much influenced by world issues,” remarked Dory Wiley, CSC’s CEO and President, as he began his overview of the banking industry. “Indications are the 2016 market will continue to be volatile based upon weakness in the U.S and world economy and political instability across the globe. This volatility presents a buying opportunity for banks.” Speaking on the stock market, Dory explained that, “The stock market should produce 3 to 5 percent returns with bank stock returns potentially outperforming, at closer to 10 percent return.”
 
C.K. Lee, Managing Director of the Financial Institutions Group at CSC discussed bank M&A noting that consolidation will continue to lag due to the energy market downturn and decreases in acquirer currencies. In 2015, bank M&A deal value reached $26.6 billion compared to $18.8 billion in 2014. So far this year, only $6.6 billion in bank deal announcements have been made. “There will be buying opportunities of banks in rural areas due to succession and demographics,” Lee stated.
 
John D. Steinmetz, President and CEO of Vista Bank in Lubbock, Texas, emphasized the importance of keeping up with technology, creating a culture of customer service and developing partnerships with industry leaders as keys to ongoing growth for his $330 million bank that recently expanded into the DFW market. Craig Scheef, Chairman and CEO of Dallas-based Texas Security Bank, discussed how championing entrepreneurs and relationship management led his bank to being one of the healthiest banks in North Texas. Delivering customizable offerings and knowing what your bank does best are the keys to Laurel, Maryland-based, Revere Bank’s success competing against larger banks according to the bank’s co-President and CEO, Kenneth Cook. Revere Bank is a $1.1 billion bank located in suburban Washington, D.C.
 
John Mauldin, Chairman of Mauldin Economics, shared insights into the economic environment over the next five years. Mauldin noted that the U.S. economy is growing by less than 2 percent annually and that the country is currently in the third-longest recovery period in history without a recession. He expects a recession is on the horizon, but Mauldin is optimistic that there is a path to stimulating growth, creating new jobs and spurring economic recovery. Sydney Menefee, Deputy Chief Accountant for the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in Washington, D.C. gave an overview on the new Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) model. Along with being scalable like today’s financial modeling methodologies, CECL will allow institutions to revert to a historical loss experience for periods beyond which the organization is unable to reasonably forecast, according to Menefee.
 
Dory Wiley, Mark Whidby and Greg Mykytyn of Commerce Street Peak Advisors discussed organizations reducing risk and improving performance within their 401(k) plans.
 
Brian Johnson, Managing Director in CSC’s Financial Institutions Group, moderated a panel that discussed recruiting top talent for banks and boards. The panel, which included Tommy Ellison, Chairman of the Board of Commercial Bank of Texas in Nacogdoches, Texas; Robert Strong, Executive Vice President of Commercial Banking for Mutual of Omaha Bank in Dallas; and Doyle Lee of Lee Training & Consulting provided key strategies to improve employee communication and attract millennials. The panel agreed one key element to successful multi-generational companies is implementing “reverse mentoring,” where younger colleagues assist older colleagues in understanding them, current technology and optimal communication.
 
Guillermo Borda of CSC discussed the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) credit. Borda explained that banks should develop a portfolio of public welfare investments by investing in assets such as SBICs, Low Income Tax Credit Funds, CRA Mutual Funds and MBS.
 
Danielle DiMartino Booth, President of Money Strong, LLC wrapped up the conference by discussing the state of debt in the U.S. and the duty of the Federal Reserve to restore the financial markets to their proper function as price discovery mechanisms. DiMartino Booth noted that while income has stagnated, debt from student loans, mortgages and credit cards continues to rise.
