			Mr. Hooks has been a director of the LLC since 2006 and he became a member of our Board of Directors in 2014 in connection with the IPO. He was a co-founder and has been a managing director of Black Canyon Capital LLC since 2004. Previously, Mr. Hooks was a co-head of the Los Angeles office of Credit Suisse First Boston and a managing director in the Los Angeles office of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. Mr. Hooks also serves on the board of directors of JDC Healthcare Management, which is a private company. He previously served on the boards of directors of Saunders & Associates, TASI Holdings, Virgin America, Logan's Roadhouse and Switchcraft, as well as the Supervisory Board of Pfeiffer Vacuum Technology, at the time a public company listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Mr. Hooks received a degree in Economics from Princeton University and an M.B.A. with distinction from the Wharton School of Business. Based on his extensive experience as an investment banker advising companies on their financing and strategic alternatives, his experience as a private equity manager working with companies and their management teams to grow and improve their businesses, and his deep knowledge of Malibu Boats given his ten-year tenure as a board member of the LLC, we believe Mr. Hooks is qualified to serve on our Board of Directors.

 From author of Waiting for the Barbarians and Nobel Prize winner J.M. Coetzee. J.M. Coetzee's latest novel, The Schooldays of Jesus, is now available from Viking. Late Essays: 2006-2016 will be available January 2018. In a South Africa turned by war, Michael K. sets out to take his ailing mother back to her rural home. On the way there she dies, leaving him alone in an anarchic world of brutal roving armies. Imprisoned, Michael is unable to bear confinement and escapes, determined to live with dignity. This life affirming novel goes to the center of human experience—the need for an interior, spiritual life; for some connections to the world in which we live; and for purity of vision.

I just finished this new book.  It's small but powerful and I've just started to read it again.  It's compelling and soul searching and makes me wonder about our world, my life, how our nature causes so much destruction but also how sensitive and enduring we are.  It's worth a read or two.Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse4.0 out of 5 starsStep inside MIchael K's world in this harrowing novel of warBySuzanne Dobbinson March 9, 2013Format: Paperback|Verified Purchase“The first thing the midwife noticed about Michael K when she helped him out of his mother into the world was that he had a hare lip.  The lip curled like a snail’s foot, the left nostril gaped.  Obscuring the child for a moment from it’s mother, she prodded open the tiny bud of a mouth and was thankful to find the palate whole.”In this novel by Nobel Prize winner J.M. Coetzee, Michael K is a simple-minded young man, living in the middle of a civil war in South Africa.  His mother, a maid in the home of a white family, is ailing.  The family she works for has left the city, making no provisions to take care of their servants.  She not only asks Michael to care for her, but she requests that he take her back to her home in the country.One of the things that struck me most about this novel, was the “science fiction” feeling of the book.  We have Michael, who is like a stranger in a strange land.  He cannot communicate because of his deformity, and with the war going on, he is in danger from both the army and the insurgents.  The countryside is devastated.  It is dry and hot.  There is no food anywhere.  And of course, Michael is black.  He does not have value here.Yet, through it all, Michael cherishes his freedom – which is taken away on several occasions.  He strives to maintain his dignity and eventually we see the light of compassion in others.So many times in novels relating to the horrors of war in Africa, it feels like the reader is outside looking in.  Coetzee is (for me at least) able to extend the feeling of what it is like to be Michael K.  I really enjoyed Life & Times of Michael K and hope to read more by this author.Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsAn ode to the free and simple lifeByTChrisTOP 100 REVIEWERon October 5, 2010Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseOppression is a recurring theme in Coetzee novels, and it is the theme that drives Life and Times of Michael K.  While the novel is set in South Africa, it is not explicitly (perhaps not even impliedly) a novel about racial oppression.  Rather, Michael is treated as an outsider, as subservient, because he is disfigured and mentally dull.  Having been raised in an institution where he was taught to peel potatoes before being given a job as a municipal gardener, Michael wants nothing more than to be left alone, nose to the ground, to work the fertile land of his ancestry.  He is a simple man with simple needs and the simplest of those--freedom--is bedeviled by travel permits and curfews and work camps, by a civil war he does not understand, by societal demands that do not concern him.  Throughout the novel, Coetzee illustrates the oppression of war, of institutions and bureaucracies, of demanding parents, of uncaring employers and landowners.  Even the doctor who envisions himself as Michael's savior wants to bend Michael to his own will.Using prose that is plain yet elegant, Coetzee creates empathy for Michael's plight--we feel for him when his crops are trampled, when he is removed from the land he loves, when he is forced to do physical labor for the benefit of those who have political pull with the authorities, when he is badgered to talk about his past, when he is not permitted to indulge the simple pleasures of sleeping and eating as he chooses.  Michael thinks of himself as an earthworm, but he lacks an earthworm's freedom to be true to itself.  The last few pages of the novel are almost an ode to simplicity, to the freedom of living off the land, unencumbered by the dictates of those who would imprison nonconformists.Life and Times of Michael K is an important contribution to world literature.  It is also a moving, beautifully written novel.  Five stars.Read more0Comment|

Lerneron October 29, 2013Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseMichael K is a puzzling combination of total passivity and active, ingenious coping with his very difficult situation. A sort of fantasy on the chaos of South African culture toward the end of the apartheid era, the tale is an allegory of a seriously troubled society. The main shortcoming of the book is the difficulty it presents to the reader in ferreting out just what it is allegorizing. But the author is a master of language and the book would be worth reading on that head alone.Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starspage turnerByBrianSon August 28, 2012Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseI was pleasantly surprised by this book.  I so seldom find anything that makes me want to keep reading.  I push myself to finish most books.  However, Michael K. is a wonderful exploration into the mind of a mentally limited man.  It's a great spiritual insight into the space we often try to achieve when camping or sitting in the sand at the ocean -- to separate ourselves from the everyday things that we seem to need for survival and sociability.  This is a compelling and easy read.  I recommend it to anyone.Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse3.0 out of 5 starsThree StarsByPrometheuson June 1, 2016Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseI was kind of disappointed with this book.
