Welcome. We recognize that tax preparation can be complicated. That’s why we have developed this singular, easy-to-use, online resource to help you prepare your state and federal tax returns. Although it includes much of the general and Deutsche-fund specific tax information you may need, it is not exhaustive. It is merely a summary of our understanding and interpretation of some of the current tax laws and regulations.

Summary of Deutsche AM's 2016 Tax Communications 
By the end of each December, mutual funds must distribute to shareholders substantially all of their ordinary income and net capital gains in order to obtain favorable tax treatment. All distributions from your Deutsche fund investment, including ordinary (income) dividends and capital gain rate distributions, are reported to you in your Deutsche fund year-end account statement dated December 31, 2016 and on one or more of the following IRS tax forms which will begin mailing at the end of January 2017. Beginning this year, steps have been taken to reduce the amount of forms you receive. As applicable, information for all your Deutsche fund accounts will be consolidated on fewer forms. See the sample forms in the 2016 Tax Guide for details.

Risk Considerations
Investments in mutual funds involve risk. Stocks may decline in value. Bond investments are subject to interest-rate, credit, liquidity and market risks to varying degrees. Credit risk refers to the ability of an issuer to make timely payments of principal and interest. Investing in derivatives entails special risks relating to liquidity, leverage and credit that may reduce returns and/or increase volatility. Investing in foreign securities, particularly those of emerging markets, presents certain risks, such as currency fluctuations, political and economic changes, and market risks. There are additional risks associated with investing in commodities, high-yield bonds, aggressive growth stocks, non-diversified/concentrated funds and small- and mid-cap stocks which are more fully explained in the prospectuses. Please read the prospectus for more information.

Read the ProspectusTo obtain a summary prospectus, if available, or prospectus, download for mutual funds or download for money funds, talk to your financial representative or contact us, We advise you to carefully consider the product's objectives, risks, charges and expenses before investing.

Risk Considerations
Investments in mutual funds involve risk. Stocks may decline in value. Bond investments are subject to interest-rate, credit, liquidity and market risks to varying degrees. Credit risk refers to the ability of an issuer to make timely payments of principal and interest. Investing in derivatives entails special risks relating to liquidity, leverage and credit that may reduce returns and/or increase volatility. Investing in foreign securities, particularly those of emerging markets, presents certain risks, such as currency fluctuations, political and economic changes, and market risks. There are additional risks associated with investing in commodities, high-yield bonds, aggressive growth stocks, non-diversified/concentrated funds and small- and mid-cap stocks which are more fully explained in the prospectuses. Please read the prospectus for more information.

 SUPPLEMENT TO THE CURRENTLY EFFECTIVE PROSPECTUSES OF
 EACH OF THE LISTED FUNDS:

----------------------

DWS Commodity Securities Fund                DWS High Yield Tax Free Fund       
DWS Equity Partners Fund                     DWS Intermediate Tax/AMT Free Fund 
DWS Health Care Fund                         DWS Managed Municipal Bond Fund    

Effective for all purchases until October 16, 2007, the sections under the      
subheading entitled "Policies about transactions -- Market timing policies and
procedures" are replaced in their entirety by the following:                    

Market timing policies and procedures. Short-term and excessive trading of fund 
shares may present risks to the fund's long-term shareholders, including        
potential dilution in the value of fund shares, interference with the efficient 
management of the fund's portfolio (including losses on the sale of             
investments), taxable gains to remaining shareholders and increased brokerage   
and administrative costs. These risks may be more pronounced if the fund invests
in certain securities, such as those that trade in foreign markets, are illiquid
or do not otherwise have "readily available market quotations." Certain         
investors may seek to employ short-term trading strategies aimed at exploiting  
variations in portfolio valuation that arise from the nature of the securities  
held by the fund (e.g., "time zone arbitrage").                                 

The fund discourages short-term and excessive trading. The fund will take steps 
to detect and deter short-term and excessive trading pursuant to the fund's     
policies as described in this prospectus and approved by the fund's Board. The  
fund generally defines short-term trading as purchase and redemption activity,  
including exchanges, that occurs within the time period for imposition of       
redemption fees. The fund may also take trading activity that occurs over longer
periods into account if the fund believes such activity is of an amount or      
frequency that may be harmful to long-term shareholders or disruptive to        
portfolio management. The fund's policies include:                              

o    a 2% redemption fee on fund shares held for less than a specified holding  
 period (subject to certain exceptions discussed below under "Redemption
fees");                                                               

o    the fund reserves the right to reject or cancel a purchase or exchange     
    order for any reason when, in the opinion of the Advisor, there appears to
   be a pattern of short-term or excessive trading activity by a shareholder
     or any other trading activity deemed harmful or disruptive to the fund; and

o    the fund has adopted certain fair valuation practices intended to protect  
    the fund from "time zone arbitrage" with respect to its foreign securities
 holdings and other trading practices that seek to exploit variations in
  portfolio valuation that arise from the nature of the securities held by
the fund. (See "How the fund calculates share price.")                

When a pattern of short-term or excessive trading activity or other trading     
activity deemed harmful or disruptive to the fund by an investor is detected,   
the Advisor may determine to prohibit that investor from future purchases in the
fund or to limit or terminate the investor's exchange privilege. The detection  
of these patterns and the banning of further trading are inherently subjective  
and therefore involve some selectivity in their application. The Advisor seeks  
to make such determinations in a manner consistent with the interests of the    
fund's long-term shareholders.                                                  

There is no assurance that these policies and procedures will be effective in   
limiting short-term and excessive trading in all cases. For example, the Advisor
may not be able to effectively monitor, detect or limit short-term or excessive 
trading by underlying shareholders that occurs through omnibus accounts         
maintained by broker-dealers or other financial intermediaries. Depending on the
amount of fund shares held in such omnibus accounts (which may represent most of
the fund's shares) short-term and/or excessive trading of fund shares could     
adversely affect long-term shareholders in the fund. It is important to note    
that shareholders that invest through omnibus accounts also may be subject to   
the policies and procedures of their financial intermediaries with respect to   
short-term and excessive trading in the fund.                                   

The fund's market timing policies and procedures may be modified or terminated  
at any time.                                                                    

                                                              [DWS SCUDDER LOGO]

Effective for all purchases until October 16, 2007, the sections under the      
subheading entitled "Policies about transactions -- Redemption fees" are        
replaced in their entirety by the following:                                    

Redemption fees. The fund imposes a redemption fee of 2% of the total redemption
amount (calculated at net asset value, without regard to the effect of any      
contingent deferred sales charge; any contingent deferred sales charge is also  
assessed on the total redemption amount without regard to the assessment of the 
2% redemption fee) on all fund shares redeemed or exchanged within 15 days of   
buying them (either by purchase or exchange). The redemption fee is paid        
directly to the fund and is designed to encourage long-term investment and to   
offset transaction and other costs associated with short-term or excessive      
trading. For purposes of determining whether the redemption fee applies, shares 
held the longest time will be treated as being redeemed first and shares held   
the shortest time will be treated as being redeemed last.                       

The redemption fee is applicable to fund shares purchased either directly or    
through a financial intermediary, such as a broker-dealer. Transactions through 
financial intermediaries typically are placed with the fund on an omnibus basis 
and include both purchase and sale transactions placed on behalf of multiple    
investors. These purchase and sale transactions are generally netted against one
another and placed on an aggregate basis; consequently the identities of the    
individuals on whose behalf the transactions are placed generally are not known 
to the fund. For this reason, the fund has undertaken to notify financial       
intermediaries of their obligation to assess the redemption fee on customer     
accounts and to collect and remit the proceeds to the fund. However, due to     
operational requirements, the intermediaries' methods for tracking and          
calculating the fee may be inadequate or differ in some respects from the       
fund's. Subject to approval by the Advisor or the fund's Board, intermediaries  
who transact business on an omnibus basis may implement the redemption fees     
according to their own operational guidelines (which may be different than the  
fund's policies) and remit the fees to the fund. In addition, certain           
intermediaries that do not currently have the capacity to collect redemption    
fees at an account level may be granted a temporary waiver from the fund's      
policies until such time as they can develop and implement a system to collect  
the redemption fees.                                                            

The redemption fee will not be charged in connection with the following exchange
or redemption transactions: (i) transactions on behalf of participants in       
certain research wrap programs; (ii) transactions on behalf of participants in  
certain group retirement plans and financial intermediaries whose processing    
systems are incapable of properly applying the redemption fee to underlying     
shareholders; (iii) transactions on behalf of a shareholder to return any excess
IRA contributions to the shareholder; (iv) transactions on behalf of a          
shareholder to effect a required minimum distribution on an IRA; (v)            
transactions on behalf of any mutual fund advised by the Advisor and its        
affiliates (e.g., "funds of funds") or, in the case of a master/feeder          
relationship, redemptions by the feeder fund from the master portfolio; (vi)    
transactions on behalf of certain unaffiliated mutual funds operating as funds  
of funds; (vii) transactions following death or disability of any registered    
shareholder, beneficial owner or grantor of a living trust with respect to      
shares purchased before death or disability; (viii) transactions involving      
hardship of any registered shareholder; (ix) systematic transactions with       
pre-defined trade dates for purchases, exchanges or redemptions, such as        
automatic account rebalancing, or loan origination and repayments; (x)          
transactions involving shares purchased through the reinvestment of dividends or
other distributions; (xi) transactions involving shares transferred from another
account in the same fund or converted from another class of the same fund (e.g.,
shares converting from Class B to Class A) (the redemption fee period will carry
over to the acquired shares); (xii) transactions initiated by the fund or       
administrator (e.g., redemptions for not meeting account minimums, to pay       
account fees funded by share redemptions, or in the event of the liquidation or 
merger of the fund); (xiii) transactions in cases when there are legal or       
contractual limitations or restrictions on the imposition of the redemption fee 
(as determined by the fund or its agents in their sole discretion); or (xiv) for
DWS Massachusetts Tax-Free Fund and DWS Intermediate Tax/AMT Free Fund only:    
checkwriting transactions in these funds. The policy of the DWS funds is to     
permit transactions on behalf of fund platform providers without the imposition 
of a redemption fee if such fund platform providers are able to implement trade 
block policies in which the period of time covered by the trade block is equal  
to or greater than the relevant redemption fee holding period for the DWS fund. 
The fund expects that the waiver for certain group retirement plans and         
financial intermediaries will be eliminated over time as their respective       
operating systems are improved. Until such time that these operating systems are
improved, the Advisor will attempt to monitor the trading activity in these     
accounts and will take appropriate corrective action if it appears that a       
pattern of short-term or excessive trading or other harmful or disruptive       
trading by underlying shareholders exists. The fund reserves the right to       
withdraw waivers and to modify or terminate these waivers or the redemption fee 
at any time.

THE FUND'S MAIN INVESTMENT STRATEGY 

    The fund seeks to provide a high level of income exempt from
regular federal income tax.                             

        Under normal circumstances, the fund invests at least 80% of net
       assets in securities issued by municipalities across the United
        States and in other securities whose income is free from regular
          federal income tax. The fund may invest up to 20% of net assets in
     securities whose income is subject to the federal alternative
minimum tax (AMT).                                      

  The fund can buy many types of municipal securities of all
        maturities. These may include revenue bonds (which are backed by
       revenues from a particular source) and general obligation bonds
           (which are typically backed by the issuer's ability to levy taxes).
         They may also include municipal lease obligations and investments
representing an interest therein.                       

           CREDIT QUALITY POLICIES. This fund normally invests at least 50% of
      total assets in municipal securities of the top four grades of
       credit quality. The fund could put up to 50% of total assets in
      high yield bonds (commonly referred to as "junk" bonds) of the
         fifth and sixth credit grades (i.e., as low as grade B). Compared
          to investment-grade bonds, junk bonds generally pay higher yields,
        have higher volatility and higher risk of default on payments of
interest or principal.                                  

           The portfolio managers look for securities that appear to offer the
 best total return potential. In making their buy and sell
           decisions, the managers typically weigh a number of factors against
     each other, from economic outlooks and possible interest rate
    movements to characteristics of specific securities, such as
      coupon, maturity date and call date, and changes in supply and
demand within the municipal bond market.

          Although the managers may adjust the fund's duration (a measure of
         sensitivity to interest rates) over a wider range, they generally
          intend to keep it similar to that of the Lehman Brothers Municipal
Bond Index, generally between five and nine years.      

         In addition, they may use various types of derivative instruments
   (instruments whose value is based on, for example, indices,
      commodities or securities), for hedging purposes or to enhance
      return. Such instruments may include inverse floaters, futures
 contracts, interest rate swaps and other over-the-counter
derivatives.                                            

THE MAIN RISKS OF INVESTING IN THE FUND                 

 There are several risk factors that could hurt the fund's
performance, cause you to lose money or cause the fund's
performance to trail that of other investments.         

   INTEREST RATE RISK. Generally, fixed income securities will
  decrease in value when interest rates rise. The longer the
       effective maturity of the fund's securities, the more sensitive
     it will be to interest rate changes. (As a general rule, a 1%
         rise in interest rates means a 1% fall in value for every year of
       duration.) As interest rates decline, the issuers of securities
     held by the fund may prepay principal earlier than scheduled,
         forcing the fund to reinvest in lower-yielding securities and may
         reduce the fund's income. As interest rates increase, slower than
        expected principal payments may extend the average life of fixed
    income securities. This will have the effect of locking in a
      below-market interest rate, increasing the fund's duration and
reducing the value of such a security.                  

    CREDIT RISK. A fund purchasing bonds faces the risk that the
       creditworthiness of an issuer may decline, causing the value of
       its bonds to decline. In addition, an issuer may not be able to
       make timely payments on the interest and principal on the bonds
      it has issued. Because the issuers of high-yield bonds or junk
 bonds (rated below the fourth highest category) may be in
         uncertain financial health, the prices of their bonds can be more
      vulnerable to bad economic news or even the expectation of bad
news, than investment-grade bonds. In some cases, bonds,
particularly high-yield bonds, may                      

THE FOLLOWING SIDEBAR TEXT APPEARS NEXT TO THE PRECEDING PARAGRAPHS             

This fund is designed for investors who are looking for a tax-advantaged        
investment and are willing to accept risk to their principal and who are        
interested in the potential for high current income.

          decline in credit quality or go into default. Because the fund may
         invest in securities not paying current interest or in securities
already in default, these risks may be more pronounced. 

   FOCUSED INVESTING RISK. The fact that the fund may focus on
  investments from a single state or sector of the municipal
       securities market increases risk, because factors affecting the
          state or region, such as economic or fiscal problems, could affect
         a large portion of the fund's securities in a similar manner. For
 example, a state's technology or biotech industries could
         experience a downturn or fail to develop as expected, hurting the
         local economy. States that face severe fiscal difficulties due to
        an economic downturn, could experience increased expenditures on
       domestic security and reduced monetary support from the federal
          government. Over time, these issues may have the ability to impair
a state's ability to repay its obligations.             

          MARKET RISK. Deteriorating market conditions might cause a general
           weakness in the market that reduces the overall level of securities
          prices in that market. Developments in a particular class of bonds
   or the stock market could also adversely affect the fund by
       reducing the relative attractiveness of bonds as an investment.
         Also, to the extent that the fund emphasizes bonds from any given
     industry, it could be hurt if that industry does not do well.

       DERIVATIVES RISK. Risks associated with derivatives include the
          risk that the derivative is not well correlated with the security,
        index or currency to which it relates; the risk that derivatives
     may not have the intended effects and may result in losses or
           missed opportunities; the risk that the fund will be unable to sell
        the derivative because of an illiquid secondary market; the risk
          that a counterparty is unwilling or unable to meet its obligation;
          and the risk that the derivative transaction could expose the fund
   to the effects of leverage, which could increase the fund's
        exposure to the market and magnify potential losses. There is no
         guarantee that derivatives, to the extent employed, will have the
        intended effect, and their use could cause lower returns or even
       losses to the fund. The use of derivatives by the fund to hedge
           risk may reduce the opportunity for gain by offsetting the positive
effect of favorable price movements.

Other factors that could affect performance include:    

 -  portfolio management could be wrong in the analysis of
  industries, companies, economic trends, the relative
     attractiveness of different securities or other matters

     -  political or legal actions could change the way the fund's
dividends are treated for tax purposes            

       -  at times, market conditions might make it hard to value some
 investments or to get an attractive price for them.

THE FUND'S PERFORMANCE HISTORY                                                  

While a fund's past performance (before and after taxes) isn't necessarily a    
sign of how it will do in the future, it can be valuable for an investor to     
know.                                                                           

The bar chart shows how the performance of the fund's Class A shares has varied 
from year to year, which may give some idea of risk. The bar chart does not     
reflect sales loads; if it did, total returns would be lower than those shown.  
The table on the following page shows how fund performance compares to relevant 
index information (which, unlike the fund performance, does not reflect fees or 
expenses). The table includes the effects of maximum sales loads. The           
performance of both the fund and the index information varies over time. All    
figures assume reinvestment of dividends and distributions (in the case of      
after-tax returns, reinvested net of assumed tax rates).                        

The table shows returns for Class A shares on a before-tax and after-tax basis. 
After-tax returns are shown for Class A only and will vary for Classes B and C. 
After-tax returns are estimates calculated using the historical highest         
individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of   
state and local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on an investor's tax     
situation and may differ from those shown in the table. After-tax returns shown 
are not relevant for investors who hold their shares through tax-deferred       
arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts.           

The inception date for Class A, B and C shares is May 1, 2001. In the bar       
chart, the performance figures for Class A shares before that date are based on 
the historical performance of the fund's original share class (Class S),        
adjusted to reflect the higher gross total annual operating expenses of Class   
A.                                                                              

In the table, the performance figures for each share class prior to its         
inception are based on the historical performance of Class S, adjusted to       
reflect both the higher gross total annual operating expenses of Classes A, B   
or C and the current applicable sales charges of Classes A, B or C. Class S     
shares are offered in a different prospectus.

1    Because of rounding in the calculation of the offering price, the actual   
   maximum front-end sales charge paid by an investor may be higher than the
percentage noted (see "Choosing a Share Class - Class A shares").     

2    The redemption of shares purchased at net asset value under the Large Order
NAV Purchase Privilege (see "Policies You Should Know About - Policies
about transactions") may be subject to a contingent deferred sales charge
 of 0.85% if redeemed within 12 months of purchase and 0.50% if redeemed
within the following six months.

5    Interest expense relates to the fund's liability with respect to floating  
rate notes held by third parties in conjunction with certain inverse  
     floater securities transactions. However, the accounting treatment for such
   transactions includes an offsetting interest income item, and accordingly
  has no impact to net investment income, total return or net asset value.

Based on the costs above (including one year of capped expenses in each

THE FUND'S MAIN INVESTMENT STRATEGY 

    The fund seeks to provide income exempt from regular federal
income tax.                                             

        Under normal circumstances, the fund invests at least 80% of net
          assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes,
           in securities issued by municipalities across the United States and
     in other securities whose income is free from regular federal
  income tax. The fund may invest up to 20% of net assets in
     securities whose income is subject to the federal alternative
minimum tax (AMT).                                      

  The fund can buy many types of municipal securities of all
        maturities. These may include revenue bonds (which are backed by
       revenues from a particular source) and general obligation bonds
           (which are typically backed by the issuer's ability to levy taxes).
         They may also include municipal lease obligations and investments
representing an interest therein.                       

           CREDIT QUALITY POLICIES. This fund normally invests at least 65% of
       total assets in municipal securities of the top three grades of
       credit quality. The fund could put up to 10% of total assets in
      high yield bonds (commonly referred to as "junk" bonds) of the
         fifth and sixth credit grades (i.e., as low as grade B). Compared
          to investment-grade bonds, junk bonds generally pay higher yields,
        have higher volatility and higher risk of default on payments of
interest or principal.                                  

           The portfolio managers look for securities that appear to offer the
 best total return potential. In making their buy and sell
           decisions, the managers typically weigh a number of factors against
     each other, from economic outlooks and possible interest rate
    movements to characteristics of specific securities, such as
      coupon, maturity date and call date, and changes in supply and
demand within the municipal bond market.

P-->49715th Page of 358TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 15th
          Although the managers may adjust the fund's duration (a measure of
         sensitivity to interest rates) over a wider range, they generally
          intend to keep it similar to that of the Lehman Brothers Municipal
Bond Index, generally between five and nine years.      

         In addition, they may use various types of derivative instruments
   (instruments whose value is based on, for example, indices,
      commodities or securities), for hedging purposes or to enhance
      return. Such instruments may include inverse floaters, futures
 contracts, interest rate swaps and other over-the-counter
derivatives.                                            

THE MAIN RISKS OF INVESTING IN THE FUND                 

 There are several risk factors that could hurt the fund's
performance, cause you to lose money or cause the fund's
performance to trail that of other investments.         

   INTEREST RATE RISK. Generally, fixed income securities will
  decrease in value when interest rates rise. The longer the
          effective maturity of the fund's securities, the more sensitive it
          will be to interest rate changes. (As a general rule, a 1% rise in
 interest rates means a 1% fall in value for every year of
       duration.) As interest rates decline, the issuers of securities
     held by the fund may prepay principal earlier than scheduled,
         forcing the fund to reinvest in lower-yielding securities and may
         reduce the fund's income. As interest rates increase, slower than
        expected principal payments may extend the average life of fixed
    income securities. This will have the effect of locking in a
      below-market interest rate, increasing the fund's duration and
reducing the value of such a security.                  

    CREDIT RISK. A fund purchasing bonds faces the risk that the
       creditworthiness of an issuer may decline, causing the value of
       its bonds to decline. In addition, an issuer may not be able to
       make timely payments on the interest and principal on the bonds
      it has issued. Because the issuers of high-yield bonds or junk
 bonds (rated below the fourth highest category) may be in
         uncertain financial health, the prices of their bonds can be more
      vulnerable to bad economic news or even the expectation of bad
news, than investment-grade bonds. In some cases, bonds,
       particularly high-yield bonds, may decline in credit quality or
      go into default. Because the fund may invest in securities not
    paying current interest or in securities already in default,
these risks may be more pronounced.                     

THE FOLLOWING SIDEBAR TEXT APPEARS NEXT TO THE PRECEDING PARAGRAPHS             

This fund is designed for investors who are looking for a tax-advantaged        
investment and are interested in current income.

   FOCUSED INVESTING RISK. The fact that the fund may focus on
  investments from a single state or sector of the municipal
       securities market increases risk, because factors affecting the
          state or region, such as economic or fiscal problems, could affect
         a large portion of the fund's securities in a similar manner. For
 example, a state's technology or biotech industries could
         experience a downturn or fail to develop as expected, hurting the
         local economy. States that face severe fiscal difficulties due to
        an economic downturn, could experience increased expenditures on
       domestic security and reduced monetary support from the federal
          government. Over time, these issues may have the ability to impair
a state's ability to repay its obligations.             

          MARKET RISK. Deteriorating market conditions might cause a general
           weakness in the market that reduces the overall level of securities
          prices in that market. Developments in a particular class of bonds
   or the stock market could also adversely affect the fund by
       reducing the relative attractiveness of bonds as an investment.
         Also, to the extent that the fund emphasizes bonds from any given
     industry, it could be hurt if that industry does not do well.

       DERIVATIVES RISK. Risks associated with derivatives include the
          risk that the derivative is not well correlated with the security,
        index or currency to which it relates; the risk that derivatives
     may not have the intended effects and may result in losses or
           missed opportunities; the risk that the fund will be unable to sell
        the derivative because of an illiquid secondary market; the risk
          that a counterparty is unwilling or unable to meet its obligation;
          and the risk that the derivative transaction could expose the fund
   to the effects of leverage, which could increase the fund's
        exposure to the market and magnify potential losses. There is no
         guarantee that derivatives, to the extent employed, will have the
        intended effect, and their use could cause lower returns or even
       losses to the fund. The use of derivatives by the fund to hedge
           risk may reduce the opportunity for gain by offsetting the positive
effect of favorable price movements.

Other factors that could affect performance include:    

 -  portfolio management could be wrong in the analysis of
  industries, companies, economic trends, the relative
     attractiveness of different securities or other matters

     -  political or legal actions could change the way the fund's
dividends are treated for tax purposes            

       -  at times, market conditions might make it hard to value some
 investments or to get an attractive price for them.

THE FUND'S PERFORMANCE HISTORY                                                  

While a fund's past performance (before and after taxes) isn't necessarily a    
sign of how it will do in the future, it can be valuable for an investor to     
know.                                                                           

The bar chart shows how the performance of the fund's Class A shares has varied 
from year to year, which may give some idea of risk. The bar chart does not     
reflect sales loads; if it did, total returns would be lower than those shown.  
The table on the following page shows how fund performance compares to relevant 
index information (which, unlike the fund performance, does not reflect fees or 
expenses). The table includes the effects of maximum sales loads. The           
performance of both the fund and the index information varies over time. All    
figures assume reinvestment of dividends and distributions (in the case of      
after-tax returns, reinvested net of assumed tax rates).                        

The table shows returns for Class A shares on a before-tax and after-tax basis. 
After-tax returns are shown for Class A only and will vary for Classes B and C. 
After-tax returns are estimates calculated using the historical highest         
individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of   
state and local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on an investor's tax     
situation and may differ from those shown in the table. After-tax returns shown 
are not relevant for investors who hold their shares through tax-deferred       
arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts.           

The inception date for Class A, B and C shares is June 11, 2001. In the bar     
chart, the performance figures for Class A shares before that date are based on 
the historical performance of the fund's original share class (Class S),        
adjusted to reflect the higher gross total annual operating expenses of Class   
A.                                                                              

In the table, the performance figures for each share class prior to its         
inception are based on the historical performance of Class S, adjusted to       
reflect both the higher gross total annual operating expenses of Classes A, B   
or C and the current applicable sales charges of Classes A, B or C. Class S     
shares are offered in a different prospectus.

*    Return after Taxes on Distributions and Sale of Fund Shares is higher than 
  other return figures for the same period due to a capital loss occurring
    upon redemption resulting in an assumed tax deduction for the shareholder.

Total returns would have been lower if certain expenses hadn't been reduced.    

The LEHMAN BROTHERS MUNICIPAL BOND INDEX is an unmanaged market-value-weighted  
measure of municipal bonds issued across the United States. Index issues have a 
credit rating of at least Baa and a maturity of at least two years.

The RETURN AFTER TAXES ON DISTRIBUTIONS assumes that an investor holds fund     
shares at the end of the period. The number represents only the fund's taxable  
distributions and not a shareholder's gain or loss from selling fund shares.    

The RETURN AFTER TAXES ON DISTRIBUTIONS AND SALE OF FUND SHARES assumes that an

1    Because of rounding in the calculation of the offering price, the actual   
   maximum front-end sales charge paid by an investor may be higher than the
percentage noted (see "Choosing a Share Class - Class A shares").     

2    The redemption of shares purchased at net asset value under the Large Order
NAV Purchase Privilege (see "Policies You Should Know About - Policies
about transactions") may be subject to a contingent deferred sales charge
 of 0.85% if redeemed within 12 months of purchase and 0.50% if redeemed
within the following six months.                                      

3    This fee is charged on applicable redemptions or exchanges. Please see     
"Policies about transactions" for further information.

5    Interest expense relates to the fund's liability with respect to floating  
rate notes held by third parties in conjunction with inverse floater  
securities transactions. However, the accounting treatment for such   
   transactions includes an offsetting interest income item, and accordingly
  has no impact to net investment income, total return or net asset value.

6    Through September 30, 2008, the Advisor has contractually agreed to waive  
all or a portion of its management fee and reimburse or pay operating 
   expenses of the fund to the extent necessary to maintain the fund's total
annual operating expenses at ratios no higher than 0.73%, for Class A 
shares, and 1.48% for Class B shares and 1.49% for Class C shares,    
excluding certain expenses such as extraordinary expenses, taxes,     
brokerage, interest and organizational and offering expenses.

Based on the costs above (including one year of capped expenses in each         
period), this example helps you compare the expenses of each share class to     
those of other mutual funds. This example assumes the expenses above remain the 
same. It also assumes that you invested $10,000, earned 5% annual returns and   
reinvested all dividends and distributions. This is only an example; actual     
expenses will be different.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


THE FUND'S MAIN INVESTMENT STRATEGY 

    The fund seeks to provide a high level of income exempt from
 regular federal income taxes and seeks to limit principal
fluctuation.                                            

        Under normal circumstances, the fund invests at least 80% of net
          assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes,
           in securities issued by municipalities across the United States and
     in other securities whose income is free from regular federal
       income tax and alternative minimum tax (AMT). The fund does not
      intend to invest in securities whose income is subject to AMT.

  The fund can buy many types of municipal securities of all
        maturities. These may include revenue bonds (which are backed by
       revenues from a particular source) and general obligation bonds
           (which are typically backed by the issuer's ability to levy taxes).
         They may also include municipal lease obligations and investments
representing an interest therein.                       

           CREDIT QUALITY POLICIES. This fund normally invests at least 65% of
       total assets in municipal securities of the top three grades of
           credit quality. The fund could put up to 35% of net assets in bonds
   rated in the fourth credit grade, which is still considered
investment-grade.                                       

           The portfolio managers look for securities that appear to offer the
 best total return potential. In making their buy and sell
           decisions, the managers typically weigh a number of factors against
     each other, from economic outlooks and possible interest rate
    movements to characteristics of specific securities, such as
      coupon, maturity date and call date, and changes in supply and
demand within the municipal bond market.                

   Although the managers may adjust the maturity of the fund's
       portfolio between three and ten years, they generally intend to
keep it between five and ten years.

         In addition, they may use various types of derivative instruments
   (instruments whose value is based on, for example, indices,
      commodities or securities), for hedging purposes or to enhance
      return. Such instruments may include inverse floaters, futures
 contracts, interest rate swaps and other over-the-counter
derivatives.                                            

THE MAIN RISKS OF INVESTING IN THE FUND                 

 There are several risk factors that could hurt the fund's
performance, cause you to lose money or cause the fund's
performance to trail that of other investments.         

   INTEREST RATE RISK. Generally, fixed income securities will
  decrease in value when interest rates rise. The longer the
          effective maturity of the fund's securities, the more sensitive it
          will be to interest rate changes. (As a general rule, a 1% rise in
 interest rates means a 1% fall in value for every year of
       duration.) As interest rates decline, the issuers of securities
     held by the fund may prepay principal earlier than scheduled,
         forcing the fund to reinvest in lower-yielding securities and may
         reduce the fund's income. As interest rates increase, slower than
        expected principal payments may extend the average life of fixed
    income securities. This will have the effect of locking in a
      below-market interest rate, increasing the fund's duration and
reducing the value of such a security.                  

    CREDIT RISK. A fund purchasing bonds faces the risk that the
       creditworthiness of an issuer may decline, causing the value of
       its bonds to decline. In addition, an issuer may not be able to
       make timely payments on the interest and principal on the bonds
      it has issued. Because the issuers of high-yield bonds or junk
 bonds (rated below the fourth highest category) may be in
         uncertain financial health, the prices of their bonds can be more
      vulnerable to bad economic news or even the expectation of bad
news, than investment-grade bonds. In some cases, bonds,
       particularly high-yield bonds, may decline in credit quality or
      go into default. Because the fund may invest in securities not
    paying current interest or in securities already in default,
these risks may be more pronounced.                     

THE FOLLOWING SIDEBAR TEXT APPEARS NEXT TO THE PRECEDING PARAGRAPHS             

This fund is designed for investors who are looking for a tax-advantaged        
investment, are interested in higher yield and can accept moderate risk to their
principal.

   FOCUSED INVESTING RISK. The fact that the fund may focus on
  investments from a single state or sector of the municipal
       securities market increases risk, because factors affecting the
          state or region, such as economic or fiscal problems, could affect
         a large portion of the fund's securities in a similar manner. For
 example, a state's technology or biotech industries could
         experience a downturn or fail to develop as expected, hurting the
         local economy. States that face severe fiscal difficulties due to
        an economic downturn, could experience increased expenditures on
       domestic security and reduced monetary support from the federal
          government. Over time, these issues may have the ability to impair
a state's ability to repay its obligations.             

          MARKET RISK. Deteriorating market conditions might cause a general
           weakness in the market that reduces the overall level of securities
          prices in that market. Developments in a particular class of bonds
   or the stock market could also adversely affect the fund by
       reducing the relative attractiveness of bonds as an investment.
         Also, to the extent that the fund emphasizes bonds from any given
     industry, it could be hurt if that industry does not do well.

       DERIVATIVES RISK. Risks associated with derivatives include the
          risk that the derivative is not well correlated with the security,
        index or currency to which it relates; the risk that derivatives
     may not have the intended effects and may result in losses or
           missed opportunities; the risk that the fund will be unable to sell
        the derivative because of an illiquid secondary market; the risk
          that a counterparty is unwilling or unable to meet its obligation;
          and the risk that the derivative transaction could expose the fund
   to the effects of leverage, which could increase the fund's
        exposure to the market and magnify potential losses. There is no
         guarantee that derivatives, to the extent employed, will have the
        intended effect, and their use could cause lower returns or even
       losses to the fund. The use of derivatives by the fund to hedge
           risk may reduce the opportunity for gain by offsetting the positive
effect of favorable price movements.

Other factors that could affect performance include:    

 -  portfolio management could be wrong in the analysis of
  industries, companies, economic trends, the relative
     attractiveness of different securities or other matters

     -  political or legal actions could change the way the fund's
dividends are treated for tax purposes            

       -  at times, market conditions might make it hard to value some
 investments or to get an attractive price for them.

THE FUND'S PERFORMANCE HISTORY                                                  

While a fund's past performance (before and after taxes) isn't necessarily a    
sign of how it will do in the future, it can be valuable for an investor to     
know.                                                                           

The bar chart shows how the performance of the fund's Class A shares has varied 
from year to year, which may give some idea of risk. The bar chart does not     
reflect sales loads; if it did, total returns would be lower than those shown.  
The table on the following page shows how fund performance compares to relevant 
index information (which, unlike the fund performance, does not reflect fees or 
expenses). The table includes the effects of maximum sales loads. The           
performance of both the fund and the index information varies over time. All    
figures assume reinvestment of dividends and distributions (in the case of      
after-tax returns, reinvested net of assumed tax rates).                        

The table shows returns for Class A shares on a before-tax and after-tax basis. 
After-tax returns are shown for Class A only and will vary for Classes B and C. 
After-tax returns are estimates calculated using the historical highest         
individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of   
state and local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on an investor's tax     
situation and may differ from those shown in the table. After-tax returns shown 
are not relevant for investors who hold their shares through tax-deferred       
arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts.           

The inception date for Class A, B and C shares is June 11, 2001. In the bar     
chart, the performance figures for Class A shares before that date are based on 
the historical performance of the fund's original share class (Class S),        
adjusted to reflect the higher gross total annual operating expenses of Class   
A. In the table, the performance figures for each share class prior to its      
inception are based on the historical performance of Class S, adjusted to       
reflect both the higher gross total annual operating expenses of Classes A, B   
or C and the current applicable sales charges of Classes A, B or C. Class S     
shares are offered in a different prospectus.

*    Return after Taxes on Distributions and Sale of Fund Shares is higher than 
  other return figures for the same period due to a capital loss occurring
    upon redemption resulting in an assumed tax deduction for the shareholder.

Total returns would have been lower if certain expenses hadn't been reduced.    

The LEHMAN SEVEN YEAR MUNICIPAL BOND INDEX is an unmanaged, total return      
subset of the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index. It includes maturities of 
six to eight years.

The RETURN AFTER TAXES ON DISTRIBUTIONS assumes that an investor holds fund     
shares at the end of the period. The number represents only the fund's taxable  
distributions and not a shareholder's gain or loss from selling fund shares.    

The RETURN AFTER TAXES ON DISTRIBUTIONS AND SALE OF FUND SHARES assumes that an 
investor sold his or her fund shares at the end of the period. The number       
reflects both the fund's taxable distributions and a shareholder's gain or loss 
from selling fund shares.

1  Because of rounding in the calculation of the offering price, the actual     
maximum front-end sales charge paid by an investor may be higher than the 
percentage noted (see "Choosing a Share Class - Class A shares").         

2  The redemption of shares purchased at net asset value under the Large Order  
NAV Purchase Privilege (see "Policies You Should Know About - Policies
about transactions") may be subject to a contingent deferred sales charge 
of 0.85% if redeemed within 12 months of purchase and 0.50% if redeemed   
within the following six months.                                          

3  This fee is charged on applicable redemptions or exchanges. Please see       
"Policies about transactions" for further information.

Based on the costs above, this example helps you compare the expenses of each   
share class to those of other mutual funds. This example assumes the expenses   
above remain the same. It also assumes that you invested $10,000, earned 5%     
annual returns and reinvested all dividends and distributions. This is only an  
example; actual expenses will be different.

OTHER POLICIES AND RISKS                                                        

      While the previous pages describe the main points of each fund's
     strategy and risks, there are a few other issues to know about:

        -  Although major changes tend to be infrequent, each fund's Board
      could change a fund's investment objective without seeking
           shareholder approval. However, the policy of investing at least
    80% of net assets (plus the amount of any borrowings for
         investment purposes in the case of DWS Managed Municipal Bond
     Fund and DWS Intermediate Tax/AMT Free Fund) in municipal
         securities exempt from regular federal income tax (and in the
case of DWS Intermediate Tax/                       
            AMT Free Fund, the alternative minimum tax) for each fund cannot
be changed without shareholder approval.            

          -  As a temporary defensive measure, each fund could shift up to 20%
             and DWS High Yield Tax Free Fund could shift up to 100% of assets
             into investments such as taxable money market securities or other
            short-term securities that offer comparable levels of risk. This
             could prevent losses, but, while engaged in a temporary defensive
      position, a fund will not be pursuing its investment goal.
     However, portfolio management may choose not to use these
   strategies for various reasons, even in volatile market
conditions. Temporary investments may be taxable.   

         -  Portfolio management measures credit quality at the time it buys
         securities, using independent rating agencies or, for unrated
          securities, a judgment by portfolio management. All securities
       must meet the credit quality standards applied by portfolio
         management. If a security's credit quality changes, portfolio
             management will decide what to do with the security, based on its
assessment of what would benefit shareholders most. 

For more information                                      

    This prospectus doesn't tell you about every policy or risk of
investing in each fund.                                   

          If you want more information on each fund's allowable securities and
         investment practices and the characteristics and risks of each one,
   you may want to request a copy of the Statement of Additional
Information (the back cover tells you how to do this).

          Keep in mind that there is no assurance that a fund will achieve its
goal.                                                     

       A complete list of each fund's portfolio holdings is posted as of
        the month-end on www.dws-scudder.com (the Web site does not form a
        part of this prospectus) on or after the last day of the following
          month. This posted information generally remains accessible at least
         until the date on which a fund files its Form N-CSR or N-Q with the
         Securities and Exchange Commission for the period that includes the
     date as of which the posted information is current. Each fund's
     Statement of Additional Information includes a description of a
        fund's policies and procedures with respect to the disclosure of a
fund's portfolio holdings.

        daily and paid monthly, at the annual rate of 0.565% of the fund's
          average daily net assets up to $300 million, 0.515% of the next $200
     million, 0.490% of the next $500 million and 0.470% thereafter.

       A discussion regarding the basis for the Board's approval of each
fund's investment management agreement is contained in the
       shareholder reports for the semi-annual period ended November 30,
2006 (see "Shareholder reports" on the back cover).       

          Under a separate administrative services agreement between each fund
       and the Advisor, each fund pays the Advisor for providing most of
each fund's administrative services.

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS                                                            

The financial highlights are designed to help you understand recent financial   
performance. The figures in the first part of each table are for a single       
share. The total return figures represent the percentage that an investor in a  
fund would have earned (or lost), assuming all dividends and distributions were 
reinvested. This information has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP,    
independent registered public accounting firm, whose report, along with each    
fund's financial statements, is included in each fund's annual report (see      
"Shareholder reports" on the back cover).

have its own policies or instructions and you should follow those.              

You can find out more about the topics covered here by speaking with your       
FINANCIAL ADVISOR OR A REPRESENTATIVE OF YOUR WORKPLACE RETIREMENT PLAN OR      
OTHER INVESTMENT PROVIDER.

CHOOSING A SHARE CLASS 

Offered in this prospectus are the share classes noted on the front cover. Each 
class has its own fees and expenses, offering you a choice of cost structures.  
Each fund may offer other classes of shares in a separate prospectus. These     
shares are intended for investors seeking the advice and assistance of a        
financial advisor, who will typically receive compensation for those services.  

Before you invest, take a moment to look over the characteristics of each share 
class, so that you can be sure to choose the class that's right for you. You    
may want to ask your financial advisor to help you with this decision.          

We describe each share class in detail on the following pages. But first, you   
may want to look at the table below, which gives you a brief comparison of the  
main features of each class.

      Your financial advisor will typically be paid a fee when you buy
       shares and may receive different levels of compensation depending
     upon which class of shares you buy. Each fund may pay financial
         advisors or other intermediaries compensation for the services they
       provide to their clients. This compensation may vary depending on
          the fund you buy or the class of shares of a fund that you buy. Your
      financial advisor may also receive compensation from the Advisor
       and/or its affiliates, please see "Financial intermediary support
payments."

Class A shares                                            

       Class A shares may make sense for long-term investors, especially
      those who are eligible for a reduced or eliminated sales charge.

 Class A shares have a 12b-1 plan, under which a shareholder
     servicing fee of up to 0.25% is deducted from class assets each
          year. Because the shareholder servicing fee is continuous in nature,
          it may, over time, increase the cost of your investment and may cost
you more than paying other types of sales charges.        

    Class A shares of DWS High Yield Tax Free Fund and DWS Managed
        Municipal Bond Fund have an up-front sales charge that varies with
the amount you invest:

1   The offering price includes the sales charge.         

       2   Because of rounding in the calculation of the offering price,
          the actual front-end sales charge paid by an investor may be
higher or lower than the percentages noted.       

YOU MAY BE ABLE TO LOWER YOUR CLASS A SALES CHARGE IF:    

          -  you plan to invest at least $100,000 in Class A shares (including
             Class A shares in other retail DWS funds) over the next 24 months
("Letter of Intent")                                

        -  the amount of Class A shares you already own (including Class A
    shares in other retail DWS funds) plus the amount you're
             investing now in Class A shares is at least $100,000 ("Cumulative
Discount")                                          

        -  you are investing a total of $100,000 or more in Class A shares
  of several retail DWS funds on the same day ("Combined
Purchases")                                         

       The point of these three features is to let you count investments
   made at other times or in certain other funds for purposes of
     calculating your present sales charge. Any time you can use the
    privileges to "move" your investment into a lower sales charge
category, it's generally beneficial for you to do so.     

        For purposes of determining whether you are eligible for a reduced
         Class A sales charge, you and your immediate family (your spouse or
       life partner and your children or stepchildren age 21 or younger)
     may aggregate your investments in the DWS family of funds. This
         includes, for example, investments held in a retirement account, an
        employee benefit plan or at a financial advisor other than the one
        handling your current purchase. These combined investments will be
      valued at their current offering price to determine whether your
current investment qualifies for a reduced sales charge.

      To receive a reduction in your Class A initial sales charge, you
         must let your financial advisor or Shareholder Services know at the
         time you purchase shares that you qualify for such a reduction. You
       may be asked by your financial advisor or Shareholder Services to
       provide account statements or other information regarding related
      accounts of you or your immediate family in order to verify your
eligibility for a reduced sales charge.                   

         For more information about sales charge discounts, please visit the
         "Individual Investors" section of www.dws-scudder.com (click on the
         link entitled "Fund Sales Charge and Breakpoint Schedule"), consult
  with your financial advisor or refer to the section entitled
    "Purchase or Redemption of Shares" in each fund's Statement of
Additional Information.                                   

     IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, YOU MAY BE ABLE TO BUY CLASS A SHARES
          WITHOUT A SALES CHARGE. For example, the sales charge will be waived
     if you are reinvesting dividends or distributions or if you are
       exchanging an investment in Class A shares of another fund in the
        DWS family of funds for an investment in Class A shares of a fund.
     In addition, a sales charge waiver may apply to transactions by
    certain retirement plans and certain other entities or persons
          (e.g., affiliated persons of DeAM or the DWS funds) and with respect
      to certain types of investments (e.g., an investment advisory or
          agency commission program under which you pay a fee to an investment
 advisor or other firm for portfolio management or brokerage
services).                                                

          Details regarding the types of investment programs and categories of
       investors eligible for a sales charge waiver are provided in each
fund's Statement of Additional Information.               

        There are a number of additional provisions that apply in order to
          be eligible for a sales charge waiver. Each fund may waive the sales
      charge for investors in other situations as well. Your financial
        advisor or Shareholder Services can answer your questions and help
you determine if you are eligible.                        

     IF YOU'RE INVESTING $1 MILLION OR MORE, either as a lump sum or
         through one of the sales charge reduction features described above,
      you may be eligible to buy Class A shares without a sales charge
         ("Large Order NAV Purchase Privilege"). However, you may be charged
          a contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) of 0.85% on any shares you
        sell within 12 months of owning them and a similar charge of 0.50%
on shares you sell within

 the following six months. This CDSC is waived under certain
          circumstances (see "Policies You Should Know About"). Your financial
        advisor or Shareholder Services can answer your questions and help
you determine if you're eligible.                         

Class B shares                                            

         Class B shares may make sense for long-term investors who prefer to
      see all of their investment go to work right away and can accept
       somewhat higher annual expenses. Please note, however, that since
     not all DWS funds offer Class B shares, exchange options may be
limited.                                                  

      With Class B shares, you pay no up-front sales charge to a fund.
         Class B shares have a 12b-1 plan, under which a distribution fee of
       0.75% and a shareholder servicing fee of up to 0.25% are deducted
     from class assets each year. This means the annual expenses for
Class B shares are somewhat higher (and their performance 
        correspondingly lower) compared to Class A shares. However, unlike
      Class A shares, your entire investment goes to work immediately.
         After six years, Class B shares automatically convert on a tax-free
       basis to Class A shares, which has the net effect of lowering the
annual expenses from the seventh year on.                 

         Class B shares have a CDSC. This charge declines over the years you
        own shares and disappears completely after six years of ownership.
    But for any shares you sell within those six years, you may be
charged as follows:                                       

                                                                [Download Table]

        This CDSC is waived under certain circumstances (see "Policies You
Should Know About"). Your financial advisor or Shareholder Services
          can answer your questions and help you determine if you're eligible.

       While Class B shares don't have any front-end sales charge, their
      higher annual expenses mean that over the years you could end up
        paying more than the equivalent of the maximum allowable front-end
sales charge.

         If you are thinking of making a large purchase in Class B shares or
      if you already own a large amount of Class A shares of a fund or
        other DWS funds, it may be more cost efficient to purchase Class A
      shares instead. Orders to purchase Class B shares of $100,000 or
      more will be declined with the exception of orders received from
        financial representatives acting for clients whose shares are held
   in an omnibus account and certain employer-sponsored employee
      benefit plans. You should consult with your financial advisor to
determine which class of shares is appropriate for you.   

Class C shares                                            

         Class C shares may appeal to investors who plan to sell some or all
   of their shares within six years of buying them or who aren't
certain of their investment time horizon.                 

      With Class C shares, you pay no up-front sales charge to a fund.
         Class C shares have a 12b-1 plan, under which a distribution fee of
       0.75% and a shareholder servicing fee of up to 0.25% are deducted
    from class assets each year. Because of these fees, the annual
         expenses for Class C shares are similar to those of Class B shares,
      but higher than those for Class A shares (and the performance of
  Class C shares is correspondingly lower than that of Class A
shares).                                                  

        Unlike Class B shares, Class C shares do NOT automatically convert
        to Class A shares after six years, so they continue to have higher
annual expenses.                                          

        Class C shares have a CDSC, but only on shares you sell within one

        This CDSC is waived under certain circumstances (see "Policies You
Should Know About"). Your financial advisor or Shareholder Services
          can answer your questions and help you determine if you're eligible.

      While Class C shares do not have an up-front sales charge, their
        higher annual expenses mean that, over the years, you could end up
       paying more than the equivalent of the maximum allowable up-front
sales charge.

Financial intermediary support payments                   

     The Advisor, DWS Scudder Distributors, Inc. (the "Distributor")
     and/or their affiliates may pay additional compensation, out of
       their own assets and not as an additional charge to each fund, to
          selected affiliated and unaffiliated brokers, dealers, participating
       insurance companies or other financial intermediaries ("financial
        advisors") in connection with the sale and/or distribution of fund
         shares or the retention and/or servicing of fund investors and fund
      shares ("revenue sharing"). Such revenue sharing payments are in
         addition to any distribution or service fees payable under any Rule
         12b-1 or service plan of each fund, any record keeping/sub-transfer
        agency/networking fees payable by each fund (generally through the
    Distributor or an affiliate) and/or the Distributor to certain
   financial advisors for performing such services and any sales
        charges, commissions, non-cash compensation arrangements expressly
       permitted under applicable rules of the NASD or other concessions
       described in the fee table or elsewhere in this prospectus or the
     Statement of Additional Information as payable to all financial
      advisors. For example, the Advisor, the Distributor and/or their
       affiliates may compensate financial advisors for providing a fund
    with "shelf space" or access to a third party platform or fund
  offering list or other marketing programs including, without
         limitation, inclusion of the fund on preferred or recommended sales
       lists, mutual fund "supermarket" platforms and other formal sales
          programs; granting the Distributor access to the financial advisor's
   sales force; granting the Distributor access to the financial
    advisor's conferences and meetings; assistance in training and
      educating the financial advisor's personnel; and obtaining other
forms of marketing support.                               

          The level of revenue sharing payments made to financial advisors may
        be a fixed fee or based upon one or more of the following factors:
        gross sales, current assets and/or number of accounts of each fund
        attributable to the financial advisor, the particular fund or fund
         type or other measures as agreed to by the Advisor, the Distributor
and/or their affiliates and the financial advisors or any 
          combination thereof. The amount of these revenue sharing payments is
         determined at the discretion of the Advisor, the Distributor and/or
        their affiliates from time to time, may be substantial, and may be
       different for different financial advisors based on, for example,
   the nature of the services provided by the financial advisor.

     combination thereof. These amounts are subject to change at the
         discretion of the Advisor, the Distributor and/or their affiliates.
Receipt of, or the prospect of receiving, this additional

on how to request a copy of the Statement of Additional   
Information).                                             

        The Advisor, the Distributor and/or their affiliates may also make
         such revenue sharing payments to financial advisors under the terms
     discussed above in connection with the distribution of both DWS
       funds and non-DWS funds by financial advisors to retirement plans
   that obtain record keeping services from ADP, Inc. on the DWS
        Scudder branded retirement plan platform (the "Platform") with the
          level of revenue sharing payments being based upon sales of both the
     DWS funds and the non-DWS funds by the financial advisor on the
      Platform or current assets of both the DWS funds and the non-DWS
   funds serviced and maintained by the financial advisor on the
Platform.                                                 

          It is likely that broker-dealers that execute portfolio transactions
       for each fund will include firms that also sell shares of the DWS
      funds to their customers. However, the Advisor will not consider
sales of DWS fund shares as a factor in the selection of  
         broker-dealers to execute portfolio transactions for the DWS funds.
      Accordingly, the Advisor has implemented policies and procedures
          reasonably designed to prevent its traders from considering sales of
DWS fund shares as a factor in the selection of

        broker-dealers to execute portfolio transactions for each fund. In
         addition, the Advisor, the Distributor and/or their affiliates will
   not use fund brokerage to pay for their obligation to provide
       additional compensation to financial advisors as described above.

POLICIES YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT 

     Along with the instructions on the previous pages, the policies
      below may affect you as a shareholder. Some of this information,
    such as the section on distributions and taxes, applies to all
       investors, including those investing through a financial advisor.

   If you are investing through a financial advisor or through a
       retirement plan, check the materials you received from them about
         how to buy and sell shares because particular financial advisors or
        other intermediaries may adopt policies, procedures or limitations
          that are separate from those described by a fund. Please note that a
        financial advisor may charge fees separate from those charged by a
fund and may be compensated by a fund.                    

          Keep in mind that the information in this prospectus applies only to
     the shares offered herein. Other share classes are described in
     separate prospectuses and have different fees, requirements and
services.                                                 

          In order to reduce the amount of mail you receive and to help reduce
         expenses, we generally send a single copy of any shareholder report
         and prospectus to each household. If you do not want the mailing of
         these documents to be combined with those for other members of your
    household, please contact your financial advisor or call (800)
621-1048.                                                 

Policies about transactions                               

         EACH FUND IS OPEN FOR BUSINESS each day the New York Stock Exchange
        is open. Each fund calculates its share price for each class every
      business day, as of the close of regular trading on the New York
     Stock Exchange (typically 4:00 p.m. Eastern time, but sometimes
          earlier, as in the case of scheduled half-day trading or unscheduled
    suspensions of trading). You can place an order to buy or sell
shares at any time.

     To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money
laundering activities, federal law requires all financial 
institutions to obtain, verify and record information that
          identifies each person who opens an account. What this means to you:
        When you open an account, we will ask for your name, address, date
        of birth and other information that will allow us to identify you.
         Some or all of this information will be used to verify the identity
of all persons opening an account.                        

          We might request additional information about you (which may include
         certain documents, such as articles of incorporation for companies)
         to help us verify your identity and, in some cases, the information
       and/or documents may be required to conduct the verification. The
  information and documents will be used solely to verify your
identity.                                                 

   We will attempt to collect any missing required and requested
        information by contacting you or your financial advisor. If we are
          unable to obtain this information within the time frames established
  by each fund, then we may reject your application and order.

    Each fund will not invest your purchase until all required and
     requested identification information has been provided and your
          application has been submitted in "good order." After we receive all
         the information, your application is deemed to be in good order and
       we accept your purchase, you will receive the net asset value per
share next calculated, less any applicable sales charge.  

 If we are unable to verify your identity within time frames
       established by each fund, after a reasonable effort to do so, you
will receive written notification.                        

      With certain limited exceptions, only US residents may invest in
each fund.                                                

         Because orders placed through a financial advisor must be forwarded
        to the transfer agent before they can be processed, you'll need to
         allow extra time. Your financial advisor should be able to tell you
approximately when your order will be processed. It is the
       responsibility of your financial advisor to forward your order to
the transfer agent in a timely manner.                    

         INITIAL PURCHASE. The minimum initial investment for Class A, B and
          C shares is $1,000, except for investments on behalf of participants
    in certain fee-based and wrap programs offered through certain
financial intermediaries approved by the Advisor,

     for which there is no minimum initial investment; and IRAs, for
   which the minimum initial investment is $500 per account. The
        minimum initial investment is $500 per account if you establish an
         automatic investment plan. Group retirement plans and certain other
        accounts have similar or lower minimum share balance requirements.

         SUB-MINIMUM BALANCES. Each fund may close your account and send you
          the proceeds if your balance falls below $1,000 ($250 for retirement
      accounts and $500 for accounts with an Automatic Investment Plan
      funded with $50 or more per month in subsequent investments); we
        will give you 60 days' notice (90 days for retirement accounts) so
       you can either increase your balance or close your account (these
         policies don't apply to investors with $100,000 or more in DWS fund
      shares, investors in certain fee-based and wrap programs offered
          through certain financial intermediaries approved by the Advisor, or
    group retirement plans and certain other accounts having lower
minimum share balance requirements)                       

       SUBSEQUENT INVESTMENTS. The minimum subsequent investment is $50.
        However, there is no minimum investment requirement for subsequent
        investments in Class A shares on behalf of participants in certain
   fee-based and wrap programs offered through certain financial
intermediaries approved by the Advisor.                   

MARKET TIMING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. Short-term and excessive
    trading of fund shares may present risks to a fund's long-term
     shareholders, including potential dilution in the value of fund
    shares, interference with the efficient management of a fund's
      portfolio (including losses on the sale of investments), taxable
 gains to remaining shareholders and increased brokerage and
        administrative costs. These risks may be more pronounced if a fund
        invests in certain securities, such as those that trade in foreign
       markets, are illiquid or do not otherwise have "readily available
         market quotations." Certain investors may seek to employ short-term
    trading strategies aimed at exploiting variations in portfolio
      valuation that arise from the nature of the securities held by a
          fund (e.g., "time zone arbitrage"). Each fund discourages short-term
        and excessive trading and has adopted policies and procedures that
        are intended to detect and deter short-term and excessive trading.

         Pursuant to its policies, each fund will impose a 2% redemption fee
  on fund shares held for less than a specified holding period
      (subject to certain exceptions discussed below under "Redemption
fees"). Each fund also reserves the right to reject or cancel a
         purchase or exchange order for any reason without prior notice. For
          example, a fund may in its discretion reject or cancel a purchase or
     an exchange order even if the transaction is not subject to the
      specific roundtrip transaction limitation described below if the
          Advisor believes that there appears to be a pattern of short-term or
    excessive trading activity by a shareholder or deems any other
          trading activity harmful or disruptive to a fund. Each fund, through
 its Advisor and Transfer Agent, will measure short-term and
        excessive trading by the number of roundtrip transactions within a
shareholder's account during a rolling 12-month period. A 
       "roundtrip" transaction is defined as any combination of purchase
      and redemption activity (including exchanges) of the same fund's
         shares. Each fund may take other trading activity into account if a
          fund believes such activity is of an amount or frequency that may be
  harmful to long-term shareholders or disruptive to portfolio
management.                                               

         Shareholders are limited to four roundtrip transactions in the same
     DWS Fund (excluding money market funds) over a rolling 12-month
          period. Shareholders with four or more roundtrip transactions in the
      same DWS Fund within a rolling 12-month period generally will be
          blocked from making additional purchases of, or exchanges into, that
       DWS Fund. Each fund has sole discretion whether to remove a block
         from a shareholder's account. The rights of a shareholder to redeem
 shares of a DWS Fund are not affected by the four roundtrip
        transaction limitation, but all redemptions remain subject to each
   fund's redemption fee policy (see "Redemption fees" described
below).                                                   

         The Advisor may make exceptions to the roundtrip transaction policy
          for certain types of transactions if in its opinion the transactions
         do not represent short-term or excessive trading or are not abusive
   or harmful to a fund, such as, but not limited to, systematic
transactions, required minimum retirement distributions,  
        transactions initiated by a fund or administrator and transactions
by certain qualified fund-of-fund(s).

       In certain circumstances where shareholders hold shares of a fund
  through a financial intermediary, the fund may rely upon the
      financial intermediary's policy to deter short-term or excessive
       trading if the Advisor believes that the financial intermediary's
         policy is reasonably designed to detect and deter transactions that
        are not in the best interest of a fund. A financial intermediary's
       policy relating to short-term or excessive trading may be more or
     less restrictive than the DWS Funds' policy, may permit certain
        transactions not permitted by the DWS Funds' policies, or prohibit
transactions not subject to the DWS Funds' policies.      

The Advisor may also accept undertakings from a financial 
         intermediary to enforce short-term or excessive trading policies on
    behalf of a fund that provide a substantially similar level of
      protection for each fund against such transactions. For example,
    certain financial intermediaries may have contractual or legal
      restrictions that prevent them from blocking an account. In such
        instances, the financial intermediary may use alternate techniques
         that the Advisor considers to be a reasonable substitute for such a
block.                                                    

          In addition, if a fund invests some portion of its assets in foreign
          securities, it has adopted certain fair valuation practices intended
        to protect the fund from "time zone arbitrage" with respect to its
          foreign securities holdings and other trading practices that seek to
          exploit variations in portfolio valuation that arise from the nature
      of the securities held by a fund. (See "How each fund calculates
share price.")                                            

      There is no assurance that these policies and procedures will be
          effective in limiting short-term and excessive trading in all cases.
      For example, the Advisor may not be able to effectively monitor,
   detect or limit short-term or excessive trading by underlying
     shareholders that occurs through omnibus accounts maintained by
   broker-dealers or other financial intermediaries. The Advisor
        reviews trading activity at the omnibus level to detect short-term
     or excessive trading. If the Advisor has reason to suspect that
        short-term or excessive trading is occurring at the omnibus level,
    the Advisor will contact the financial intermediary to request
       underlying shareholder level activity. Depending on the amount of
         fund shares held in such omnibus accounts (which may represent most
     of a fund's shares) short-term and/or excessive trading of fund
        shares could adversely affect long-term shareholders in a fund. If
          short-term or excessive trading is identified, the Advisor will take
appropriate action.

          Each fund's market timing policies and procedures may be modified or
terminated at any time.                                   

REDEMPTION FEES. Each fund imposes a redemption fee of 2% of the
     total redemption amount (calculated at net asset value, without
       regard to the effect of any contingent deferred sales charge; any
    contingent deferred sales charge is also assessed on the total
  redemption amount without regard to the assessment of the 2%
        redemption fee) on all fund shares redeemed or exchanged within 15
          days of buying them (either by purchase or exchange). The redemption
    fee is paid directly to each fund and is designed to encourage
    long-term investment and to offset transaction and other costs
      associated with short-term or excessive trading. For purposes of
     determining whether the redemption fee applies, shares held the
          longest time will be treated as being redeemed first and shares held
the shortest time will be treated as being redeemed last. 

      The redemption fee is applicable to fund shares purchased either
directly or through a financial intermediary, such as a   
  broker-dealer. Transactions through financial intermediaries
      typically are placed with a fund on an omnibus basis and include
      both purchase and sale transactions placed on behalf of multiple
          investors. These purchase and sale transactions are generally netted
        against one another and placed on an aggregate basis; consequently
        the identities of the individuals on whose behalf the transactions
         are placed generally are not known to a fund. For this reason, each
     fund has undertaken to notify financial intermediaries of their
         obligation to assess the redemption fee on customer accounts and to
  collect and remit the proceeds to each fund. However, due to
        operational requirements, the intermediaries' methods for tracking
          and calculating the fee may be inadequate or differ in some respects
         from each fund's. Subject to approval by the Advisor or each fund's
         Board, intermediaries who transact business on an omnibus basis may
      implement the redemption fees according to their own operational
      guidelines (which may be different than the funds' policies) and
remit the fees to the funds.                              

   The redemption fee will not be charged in connection with the
        following exchange or redemption transactions: (i) transactions on
    behalf of participants in certain research wrap programs; (ii)
        transactions on behalf of participants in certain group retirement
     plans and financial intermediaries whose processing systems are
     incapable of properly applying the redemption fee to underlying
    shareholders; (iii) transactions on behalf of a shareholder to

          transactions on behalf of a shareholder to effect a required minimum
      distribution on an IRA; (v) transactions on behalf of any mutual
     fund advised by the Advisor and its affiliates (e.g., "funds of
          funds") or, in the case of a master/feeder relationship, redemptions
        by the feeder fund from the master portfolio; (vi) transactions on
       behalf of certain unaffiliated mutual funds operating as funds of
    funds; (vii) transactions following death or disability of any
     registered shareholder, beneficial owner or grantor of a living
        trust with respect to shares purchased before death or disability;
(viii) transactions involving hardship of any registered  
      shareholder; (ix) systematic transactions with pre-defined trade
      dates for purchases, exchanges or redemptions, such as automatic
  account rebalancing, or loan origination and repayments; (x)
         transactions involving shares purchased through the reinvestment of
          dividends or other distributions; (xi) transactions involving shares
         transferred from another account in the same fund or converted from
          another class of the same fund (e.g., shares converting from Class B
   to Class A) (the redemption fee period will carry over to the
 acquired shares); (xii) transactions initiated by a fund or
        administrator (e.g., redemptions for not meeting account minimums,
         to pay account fees funded by share redemptions, or in the event of
       the liquidation or merger of the fund); or (xiii) transactions in
cases when there are legal or contractual limitations or  
         restrictions on the imposition of the redemption fee (as determined
         by a fund or its agents in their sole discretion). In addition, the
        redemption fee will not be charged in connection with checkwriting
    transactions for DWS Intermediate Tax/AMT Free Fund. It is the
        policy of the DWS funds to permit approved fund platform providers
          to execute transactions within the funds without the imposition of a
   redemption fee if such providers have implemented alternative
        measures that are determined by the Advisor to provide controls on
     short-term and excessive trading that are comparable to the DWS
funds' policies.

     QUICKBUY AND QUICKSELL let you set up a link between a DWS fund
          account and a bank account. Once this link is in place, you can move
       money between the two with a phone call. You'll need to make sure
         your bank has Automated Clearing House (ACH) services. Transactions
       take two to three days to be completed and there is a $50 minimum
      and a $250,000 maximum. To set up QuickBuy or QuickSell on a new
    account, see the account application; to add it to an existing

TELEPHONE AND ELECTRONIC TRANSACTIONS. Generally, you are 
    automatically entitled to telephone and electronic transaction
       privileges, but you may elect not to have them when you open your
          account or by contacting Shareholder Services at (800) 621-1048 at a
later date.                                               

Since many transactions may be initiated by telephone or  
          electronically, it's important to understand that as long as we take
    reasonable steps to ensure that an order to purchase or redeem
shares is genuine, such as recording calls or requesting  
  personalized security codes or other information, we are not
responsible for any losses that may occur as a result. For
         transactions conducted over the Internet, we recommend the use of a
          secure Internet browser. In addition, you should verify the accuracy
         of your confirmation statements immediately after you receive them.

  EACH FUND DOES NOT ISSUE SHARE CERTIFICATES. However, if you
      currently have shares in certificated form, you must include the
   share certificates properly endorsed or accompanied by a duly
       executed stock power when exchanging or redeeming shares. You may
       not exchange or redeem shares in certificate form by telephone or
via the Internet.                                         

          WHEN YOU ASK US TO SEND OR RECEIVE A WIRE, please note that while we
          don't charge a fee to send or receive wires, it's possible that your
         bank may do so. Wire transactions are generally completed within 24
       hours. Each fund can only send wires of $1,000 or more and accept
wires of $50 or more.                                     

       EACH FUND ACCEPTS PAYMENT FOR SHARES ONLY IN US DOLLARS by check,
         bank or Federal Funds wire transfer or by electronic bank transfer.
 Please note that a fund does not accept cash, money orders,
          traveler's checks, starter checks, third party checks (except checks
      for retirement plan asset transfers and rollovers or for Uniform
          Gift to Minors Act/Uniform Transfers to Minors Act accounts), checks

         by credit card companies or Internet-based companies. Thus, subject
        to the foregoing exceptions for certain third party checks, checks
        that are otherwise permissible must be drawn by the account holder
on a domestic bank and must be payable to a fund.         

SIGNATURE GUARANTEE. When you want to sell more than $100,000 worth
      of shares or send proceeds to a third party or to a new address,
      you'll usually need to place your order in writing and include a
     signature guarantee. However, if you want money wired to a bank
         account that is already on file with us, you don't need a signature
         guarantee. Also, generally you don't need a signature guarantee for
an exchange, although we may require one in certain other 
circumstances.                                            

         A signature guarantee is simply a certification of your signature -
 a valuable safeguard against fraud. You can get a signature
 guarantee from an eligible guarantor institution, including
          commercial banks, savings and loans, trust companies, credit unions,
member firms of a national stock exchange or any member or
       participant of an approved signature guarantor program. Note that
          you can't get a signature guarantee from a notary public and we must
be provided the original guarantee.                       

   SELLING SHARES OF TRUST ACCOUNTS AND BUSINESS OR ORGANIZATION
      ACCOUNTS may require additional documentation. Please call (800)
      621-1048 or contact your financial advisor for more information.

       WHEN YOU SELL SHARES THAT HAVE A CDSC, we calculate the CDSC as a
        percentage of what you paid for the shares or what you are selling
 them for - whichever results in the lower charge to you. In
       processing orders to sell shares, the shares with the lowest CDSC
       are sold first. Exchanges from one fund into another don't affect
    CDSCs; for each investment you make, the date you first bought
      shares is the date we use to calculate a CDSC on that particular
investment.                                               

     There are certain cases in which you may be exempt from a CDSC.
These include:                                            

       -  the death or disability of an account owner (including a joint
             owner). This waiver applies only under certain conditions. Please
     contact your financial advisor or Shareholder Services to
determine if the conditions exist

    -  withdrawals made through an automatic withdrawal plan. Such
           withdrawals may be made at a maximum of 12% per year of the net
asset value of the account                          

   -  withdrawals related to certain retirement or benefit plans

      -  redemptions for certain loan advances, hardship provisions or
 returns of excess contributions from retirement plans

          -  for Class A shares purchased through the Large Order NAV Purchase
         Privilege, redemption of shares whose dealer of record at the
           time of the investment notifies the Distributor that the dealer
waives the applicable commission                    

     -  for Class C shares, redemption of shares purchased through a
      dealer-sponsored asset allocation program maintained on an
            omnibus record-keeping system, provided the dealer of record has
         waived the advance of the first year distribution and service
         fees applicable to such shares and has agreed to receive such
fees quarterly                                      

         In each of these cases, there are a number of additional provisions
          that apply in order to be eligible for a CDSC waiver. Your financial
        advisor or Shareholder Services can answer your questions and help
you determine if you are eligible.                        

         IF YOU SELL SHARES IN A DWS FUND AND THEN DECIDE TO INVEST WITH DWS
        SCUDDER AGAIN WITHIN SIX MONTHS, you may be able to take advantage
         of the "reinstatement feature." With this feature, you can put your
          money back into the same class of a DWS fund at its current NAV and,
     for purposes of a sales charge, it will be treated as if it had
never left DWS Scudder.                                   

        You'll be reimbursed (in the form of fund shares) for any CDSC you
        paid when you sold. Future CDSC calculations will be based on your
          original investment date, rather than your reinstatement date. There
       is also an option that lets investors who sold Class B shares buy
       Class A shares (if available) with no sales charge, although they
      won't be reimbursed for any CDSC they paid. You can only use the
       reinstatement feature once for any given group of shares. To take
     advantage of this feature, contact Shareholder Services or your
financial advisor.                                        

         MONEY FROM SHARES YOU SELL is normally sent out within one business
    day of when your order is processed (not when it is received),
        although it could be delayed for up to seven days. There are other
        circumstances when it could be longer: When you are selling shares
you bought recently by check (redemption

   proceeds from such a sale are unavailable until the check has
        cleared), when you make purchases by ACH (the funds will be placed
        under a 10 calendar day hold to ensure good funds) or when unusual
   circumstances prompt the SEC to allow further delays. Certain
     expedited redemption processes may also be delayed when you are
         selling recently purchased shares or in the event of closing of the
        Federal Reserve Bank's wire payment system. In addition, each fund
        reserves the right to suspend or postpone redemptions as permitted
      pursuant to Section 22(e) of the Investment Company Act of 1940.
   Generally, those circumstances are when 1) the New York Stock
          Exchange is closed other than customary weekend or holiday closings;
    2) trading on the New York Stock Exchange is restricted; 3) an
        emergency exists which makes the disposal of securities owned by a
        fund or the fair determination of the value of a fund's net assets
      not reasonably practicable; or 4) the SEC, by order, permits the
        suspension of the right of redemption. Redemption payments by wire
      may also be delayed in the event of a non-routine closure of the
         Federal Reserve wire payment system. For additional rights reserved
by each fund, please see "Other rights we reserve."       

         You may obtain additional information about other ways to sell your
shares by contacting your financial advisor.              

How each fund calculates share price                      

     To calculate net asset value, or NAV, each share class uses the
following equation:                                       

                                                                [Download Table]

 TOTAL ASSETS - TOTAL LIABILITIES                    
-----------------------------------------    =    NAV
    TOTAL NUMBER OF SHARES OUTSTANDING               

        The price at which you buy shares is the NAV, although for Class A
         shares it will be adjusted to allow for any applicable sales charge
        (see "Choosing a Share Class"). The price at which you sell shares
       is also the NAV, although a CDSC may be taken out of the proceeds
(see "Choosing a Share Class").                           

       EACH FUND CHARGES A REDEMPTION FEE EQUAL TO 2.00% of the value of
       shares redeemed or exchanged within 15 days. Please see "Policies
about transactions - Redemption fees" for further information.

     WE TYPICALLY VALUE SECURITIES USING INFORMATION FURNISHED BY AN
          INDEPENDENT PRICING SERVICE OR MARKET QUOTATIONS, WHERE APPROPRIATE.
       However, we may use methods approved by a fund's Board, such as a
         fair valuation model, which are intended to reflect fair value when
      pricing service information or market quotations are not readily
         available or when a security's value or a meaningful portion of the
     value of a fund's portfolio is believed to have been materially
     affected by a significant event, such as a natural disaster, an
economic event like a bankruptcy filing, or a substantial 
          fluctuation in domestic or foreign markets that has occurred between
  the close of the exchange or market on which the security is
        principally traded (for example, a foreign exchange or market) and
        the close of the New York Stock Exchange. In such a case, a fund's
         value for a security is likely to be different from the last quoted
          market price or pricing service information. In addition, due to the
          subjective and variable nature of fair value pricing, it is possible
        that the value determined for a particular asset may be materially
different from the value realized upon such asset's sale. 

Other rights we reserve                                   

You should be aware that we may do any of the following:  

-  withdraw or suspend the offering of shares at any time 

         -  withhold a portion of your distributions and redemption proceeds
          as federal income tax if we have been notified by the IRS that
           you are subject to backup withholding or if you fail to provide
           us with a correct taxpayer ID number and certain certifications
        or certification that you are exempt from backup withholding

  -  reject a new account application if you don't provide any
           required or requested identifying information, or for any other
reason                                              

         -  refuse, cancel, limit or rescind any purchase or exchange order,
             without prior notice; freeze any account (meaning you will not be
          able to purchase fund shares in your account); suspend account
          services; and/or involuntarily redeem your account if we think
    that the account is being used for fraudulent or illegal
             purposes; one or more of these actions will be taken when, at our
            sole discretion, they are deemed to be in a fund's best interest
             or when a fund is requested or compelled to do so by governmental
authority or by applicable law

         -  close and liquidate your account if we are unable to verify your
      identity, or for other reasons; if we decide to close your
             account, your fund shares will be redeemed at the net asset value
      per share next calculated after we determine to close your
           account (less any applicable sales charges or redemption fees);
           you may recognize a gain or loss on the redemption of your fund
shares and incur a tax liability                    

        -  pay you for shares you sell by "redeeming in kind," that is, by
          giving you marketable securities (which typically will involve
             brokerage costs for you to liquidate) rather than cash, but which
          will be taxable to the same extent as a redemption for cash; a
      fund generally won't make a redemption in kind unless your
           requests over a 90-day period total more than $250,000 or 1% of
the value of a fund's net assets, whichever is less

UNDERSTANDING DISTRIBUTIONS AND TAXES                                           

          Each fund intends to distribute to its shareholders virtually all of
          its net earnings. Each fund can earn money in two ways: by receiving
         interest, dividends or other income from securities it holds and by
     selling securities for more than it paid for them. (Each fund's
       earnings are separate from any gains or losses stemming from your
      own purchase and sale of shares.) Each fund may not always pay a
dividend or distribution for a given period.              

  Income dividends are declared daily and paid monthly. Short-
        term and long-term capital gains are paid in November or December,
or otherwise as needed.                                   

          Dividends or distributions declared to shareholders of record in the
          last quarter of a given calendar year are treated for federal income
        tax purposes as if they were received on December 31 of that year,
         provided such dividends or distributions are paid by the end of the
following January.                                        

For federal income tax purposes, income and capital gains 
 distributions are generally taxable. However, dividends and
   distributions received by retirement plans qualifying for tax
   exemption under federal income tax laws generally will not be
taxable.                                                  

THE FOLLOWING SIDEBAR TEXT APPEARS NEXT TO THE PRECEDING PARAGRAPHS             

Because each shareholder's tax situation is unique, ask your tax professional   
about the tax consequences of your investments, including any state and local   
tax consequences.

         YOU CAN CHOOSE HOW TO RECEIVE YOUR DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS. You
         can have them all automatically reinvested in fund shares (at NAV),
       all deposited directly to your bank account or all sent to you by
        check, have one type reinvested and the other sent to you by check
        or have them invested in a different fund. Tell us your preference
   on your application. If you don't indicate a preference, your
         dividends and distributions will all be reinvested in shares of the
    fund without a sales charge (if applicable). Distributions are
          treated the same for federal income tax purposes whether you receive
them in cash or reinvest them in additional shares. For   
employer-sponsored qualified plans, and retirement plans, 
reinvestment (at NAV) is the only option.                 

         BUYING, SELLING OR EXCHANGING FUND SHARES WILL USUALLY HAVE FEDERAL
   INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES FOR YOU (except in employer-sponsored
        qualified plans, IRAs or other tax-advantaged accounts). Your sale
      of shares may result in a capital gain or loss. The gain or loss
         will be long-term or short-term depending on how long you owned the
         shares that were sold. For federal income tax purposes, an exchange
is treated the same as a sale.                            

Each fund intends to distribute tax-exempt interest as    
         exempt-interest dividends, which are excluded from gross income for
regular federal income tax purposes, but may be subject to
     alternative minimum tax and state and local income taxes. Their
   distributions from other sources, if any, would be taxable as
described above.                                          

Dividends from each fund are generally tax-free for most  
          shareholders, meaning that investors who are individuals can receive
       them without incurring federal and (for some investors) state and
      local income tax liability. However, there are a few exceptions:

       -  a portion of a fund's dividends may be taxable if it came from
investments in taxable securities                   

       -  because a fund (except DWS Intermediate Tax/AMT Free Fund) can
        invest up to 20% of net assets in securities whose income is
             subject to the federal alternative minimum tax (AMT), you may owe
       taxes on a portion of your dividends if you are among those
investors who must pay AMT                          

-  capital gains distributions may be taxable

   ANY DIRECT INVESTMENTS IN FOREIGN SECURITIES BY A FUND MAY BE
        SUBJECT TO FOREIGN WITHHOLDING TAXES. In that case, a fund's yield
    on those securities would generally be decreased. Shareholders
        generally will not be entitled to claim a credit or deduction with
 respect to foreign taxes paid by the fund. In addition, any
          investments in foreign securities or foreign currencies may increase
          or accelerate a fund's recognition of ordinary income and may affect
          the timing or amount of the fund's distributions. If you invest in a
    fund through a taxable account, your after-tax return could be
negatively impacted.                                      

      To the extent that a fund invests in certain debt obligations or
   certain other securities, investments in these obligations or
          securities may cause a fund to recognize taxable income in excess of
   the cash generated by such obligations. Thus, a fund could be
          required at times to liquidate other investments in order to satisfy
its distribution requirements.                            

          For taxable years beginning before January 1, 2011, distributions to
          individuals and other noncorporate shareholders of investment income
        designated by a fund as derived from qualified dividend income are
       eligible for taxation for federal income tax purposes at the more
       favorable long-term capital gain rates. Qualified dividend income
 generally includes dividends from domestic and some foreign
       corporations. It does not include income from investments in debt
         securities or, generally, from REITs. In addition, a fund must meet
       certain holding period and other requirements with respect to the
      dividend-paying stocks in its portfolio and the shareholder must

          meet certain holding period and other requirements with respect to a
      fund's shares for the lower tax rates to apply. The funds do not
       expect a significant portion of their distributions to be derived
from qualified dividend income.                           

     For taxable years beginning before January 1, 2011, the maximum
federal income tax rate imposed on long-term capital gains
       recognized by individuals and other noncorporate shareholders has
     been reduced to 15%. For more information, see the Statement of
Additional Information, under "Taxes."
     YOUR FUND WILL SEND YOU DETAILED FEDERAL INCOME TAX INFORMATION
         EVERY JANUARY. These statements tell you the amount and the federal
     income tax classification of any dividends or distributions you
          received. They also have certain details on your purchases and sales
of shares.                                                

          IF YOU INVEST RIGHT BEFORE A FUND PAYS A DIVIDEND, you'll be getting
       some of your investment back as a taxable dividend. You can avoid
this by investing after a fund declares a dividend. In    
       tax-advantaged retirement accounts you do not need to worry about
this.                                                     

     CORPORATIONS are taxed at the same rates on ordinary income and
 capital gains, but may be eligible for a dividends-received
         deduction for a portion of the income dividends they receive from a
      fund, provided certain holding period and other requirements are
met.                                                      

   The above discussion is applicable to shareholders who are US
      persons. If you are a non-US person, please consult your own tax
  advisor with respect to the US tax consequences to you of an
investment in a fund.

APPENDIX

Hypothetical Expense Summary                              

         Using the annual fund operating expense ratios presented in the fee
     tables in the fund prospectus, the Hypothetical Expense Summary
          shows the estimated fees and expenses, in actual dollars, that would
         be charged on a hypothetical investment of $10,000 in the fund held
       for the next 10 years and the impact of such fees and expenses on
       fund returns for each year and cumulatively, assuming a 5% return
  for each year. The tables also assume that all dividends and
     distributions are reinvested and that Class B shares convert to
          Class A shares after six years. The annual fund expense ratios shown
          are net of any contractual fee waivers or expense reimbursements, if
   any, for the period of the contractual commitment. The tables
          reflect the maximum initial sales charge, if any, but do not reflect
      any contingent deferred sales charge or redemption fees, if any,
        which may be payable upon redemption. If contingent deferred sales
       charges or redemption fees were shown, the "Hypothetical Year-End
       Balance After Fees and Expenses" amounts shown would be lower and
         the "Annual Fees and Expenses" amounts shown would be higher. Also,
 please note that if you are investing through a third party
      provider, that provider may have fees and expenses separate from
         those of the fund that are not reflected here. Mutual fund fees and
       expenses fluctuate over time and actual expenses may be higher or
lower than those shown.                                   

         The Hypothetical Expense Summary should not be used or construed as
an offer to sell, a solicitation of an offer to buy or a  
    recommendation or endorsement of any specific mutual fund. You
   should carefully review the fund's prospectus to consider the
          investment objectives, risks, expenses and charges of the fund prior
to investing.

THE FUND'S MAIN INVESTMENT STRATEGY 

    The fund seeks to provide a high level of income exempt from
regular federal income tax.                             

        Under normal circumstances, the fund invests at least 80% of net
       assets in securities issued by municipalities across the United
        States and in other securities whose income is free from regular
          federal income tax. The fund may invest up to 20% of net assets in
     securities whose income is subject to the federal alternative
minimum tax (AMT).                                      

  The fund can buy many types of municipal securities of all
        maturities. These may include revenue bonds (which are backed by
       revenues from a particular source) and general obligation bonds
           (which are typically backed by the issuer's ability to levy taxes).
         They may also include municipal lease obligations and investments
representing an interest therein.                       

           CREDIT QUALITY POLICIES. This fund normally invests at least 50% of
      total assets in municipal securities of the top four grades of
       credit quality. The fund could put up to 50% of total assets in
      high yield bonds (commonly referred to as "junk" bonds) of the
         fifth and sixth credit grades (i.e., as low as grade B). Compared
          to investment-grade bonds, junk bonds generally pay higher yields,
        have higher volatility and higher risk of default on payments of
interest or principal.                                  

           The portfolio managers look for securities that appear to offer the
 best total return potential. In making their buy and sell
           decisions, the managers typically weigh a number of factors against
     each other, from economic outlooks and possible interest rate
    movements to characteristics of specific securities, such as
      coupon, maturity date and call date, and changes in supply and
demand within the municipal bond market.

P-->49783rd Page of 358TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 83rd
          Although the managers may adjust the fund's duration (a measure of
         sensitivity to interest rates) over a wider range, they generally
          intend to keep it similar to that of the Lehman Brothers Municipal
Bond Index, generally between five and nine years.      

         In addition, they may use various types of derivative instruments
   (instruments whose value is based on, for example, indices,
      commodities or securities), for hedging purposes or to enhance
      return. Such instruments may include inverse floaters, futures
 contracts, interest rate swaps and other over-the-counter
derivatives.                                            

THE MAIN RISKS OF INVESTING IN THE FUND                 

 There are several risk factors that could hurt the fund's
performance, cause you to lose money or cause the fund's
performance to trail that of other investments.         

            INTEREST RATE RISK. Generally, fixed income securities will decrease
            in value when interest rates rise. The longer the effective maturity
           of the fund's securities, the more sensitive it will be to interest
           rate changes. (As a general rule, a 1% rise in interest rates means
         a 1% fall in value for every year of duration.) As interest rates
      decline, the issuers of securities held by the fund may prepay
         principal earlier than scheduled, forcing the fund to reinvest in
      lower-yielding securities and may reduce the fund's income. As
            interest rates increase, slower than expected principal payments may
          extend the average life of fixed income securities. This will have
         the effect of locking in a below-market interest rate, increasing
      the fund's duration and reducing the value of such a security.

    CREDIT RISK. A fund purchasing bonds faces the risk that the
           creditworthiness of an issuer may decline, causing the value of its
        bonds to decline. In addition, an issuer may not be able to make
         timely payments on the interest and principal on the bonds it has
            issued. Because the issuers of high-yield bonds or junk bonds (rated
        below the fourth highest category) may be in uncertain financial
       health, the prices of their bonds can be more vulnerable to bad
economic news or even the expectation of bad news, than 
  investment-grade bonds. In some cases, bonds, particularly
high-yield bonds, may                                   

THE FOLLOWING SIDEBAR TEXT APPEARS NEXT TO THE PRECEDING PARAGRAPHS             

This fund is designed for investors who are looking for a tax-advantaged        
investment and are willing to accept risk to their principal and who are        
interested in the potential for high current income.

          decline in credit quality or go into default. Because the fund may
         invest in securities not paying current interest or in securities
already in default, these risks may be more pronounced. 

   FOCUSED INVESTING RISK. The fact that the fund may focus on
  investments from a single state or sector of the municipal
       securities market increases risk, because factors affecting the
          state or region, such as economic or fiscal problems, could affect
         a large portion of the fund's securities in a similar manner. For
 example, a state's technology or biotech industries could
         experience a downturn or fail to develop as expected, hurting the
         local economy. States that face severe fiscal difficulties due to
        an economic downturn, could experience increased expenditures on
       domestic security and reduced monetary support from the federal
          government. Over time, these issues may have the ability to impair
a state's ability to repay its obligations.             

          MARKET RISK. Deteriorating market conditions might cause a general
           weakness in the market that reduces the overall level of securities
          prices in that market. Developments in a particular class of bonds
   or the stock market could also adversely affect the fund by
       reducing the relative attractiveness of bonds as an investment.
         Also, to the extent that the fund emphasizes bonds from any given
     industry, it could be hurt if that industry does not do well.

       DERIVATIVES RISK. Risks associated with derivatives include the
          risk that the derivative is not well correlated with the security,
        index or currency to which it relates; the risk that derivatives
     may not have the intended effects and may result in losses or
           missed opportunities; the risk that the fund will be unable to sell
        the derivative because of an illiquid secondary market; the risk
          that a counterparty is unwilling or unable to meet its obligation;
          and the risk that the derivative transaction could expose the fund
   to the effects of leverage, which could increase the fund's
        exposure to the market and magnify potential losses. There is no
         guarantee that derivatives, to the extent employed, will have the
        intended effect, and their use could cause lower returns or even
       losses to the fund. The use of derivatives by the fund to hedge
           risk may reduce the opportunity for gain by offsetting the positive
effect of favorable price movements.

Other factors that could affect performance include:    

 -  portfolio management could be wrong in the analysis of
  industries, companies, economic trends, the relative
     attractiveness of different securities or other matters

     -  political or legal actions could change the way the fund's
dividends are treated for tax purposes            

       -  at times, market conditions might make it hard to value some
 investments or to get an attractive price for them.

THE FUND'S PERFORMANCE HISTORY                                                  

While a fund's past performance (before and after taxes) isn't necessarily a    
sign of how it will do in the future, it can be valuable for an investor to     
know.                                                                           

The bar chart shows how the performance of the fund's Institutional Class       
shares has varied from year to year, which may give some idea of risk. The      
table on the following page shows how fund performance compares to relevant     
index information (which, unlike the fund performance, does not reflect fees or 
expenses). The performance of both the fund and the index information varies    
over time. All figures assume reinvestment of dividends and distributions (in   
the case of after-tax returns, reinvested net of assumed tax rates).            

The table shows returns for Institutional Class shares on a before-tax and      
after-tax basis. After-tax returns are estimates calculated using the           
historical highest individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not      
reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on 
an investor's tax situation and may differ from those shown in the table.       
After-tax returns shown are not relevant for investors who hold their shares    
through tax-deferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or individual           
retirement accounts.

THE FUND'S MAIN INVESTMENT STRATEGY 

    The fund seeks to provide income exempt from regular federal
income tax.                                             

        Under normal circumstances, the fund invests at least 80% of net
          assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes,
           in securities issued by municipalities across the United States and
     in other securities whose income is free from regular federal
  income tax. The fund may invest up to 20% of net assets in
     securities whose income is subject to the federal alternative
minimum tax (AMT).                                      

  The fund can buy many types of municipal securities of all
        maturities. These may include revenue bonds (which are backed by
       revenues from a particular source) and general obligation bonds
           (which are typically backed by the issuer's ability to levy taxes).
         They may also include municipal lease obligations and investments
representing an interest therein.                       

           CREDIT QUALITY POLICIES. This fund normally invests at least 65% of
       total assets in municipal securities of the top three grades of
       credit quality. The fund could put up to 10% of total assets in
      high yield bonds (commonly referred to as "junk" bonds) of the
         fifth and sixth credit grades (i.e., as low as grade B). Compared
          to investment-grade bonds, junk bonds generally pay higher yields,
        have higher volatility and higher risk of default on payments of
interest or principal.                                  

           The portfolio managers look for securities that appear to offer the
 best total return potential. In making their buy and sell
           decisions, the managers typically weigh a number of factors against
     each other, from economic outlooks and possible interest rate
    movements to characteristics of specific securities, such as
      coupon, maturity date and call date, and changes in supply and
demand within the municipal bond market.

P-->49791st Page of 358TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 91st
          Although the managers may adjust the fund's duration (a measure of
         sensitivity to interest rates) over a wider range, they generally
          intend to keep it similar to that of the Lehman Brothers Municipal
Bond Index, generally between five and nine years.      

         In addition, they may use various types of derivative instruments
   (instruments whose value is based on, for example, indices,
      commodities or securities), for hedging purposes or to enhance
      return. Such instruments may include inverse floaters, futures
 contracts, interest rate swaps and other over-the-counter
derivatives.                                            

THE MAIN RISKS OF INVESTING IN THE FUND                 

 There are several risk factors that could hurt the fund's
performance, cause you to lose money or cause the fund's
performance to trail that of other investments.         

   INTEREST RATE RISK. Generally, fixed income securities will
  decrease in value when interest rates rise. The longer the
          effective maturity of the fund's securities, the more sensitive it
          will be to interest rate changes. (As a general rule, a 1% rise in
 interest rates means a 1% fall in value for every year of
       duration.) As interest rates decline, the issuers of securities
     held by the fund may prepay principal earlier than scheduled,
         forcing the fund to reinvest in lower-yielding securities and may
         reduce the fund's income. As interest rates increase, slower than
        expected principal payments may extend the average life of fixed
    income securities. This will have the effect of locking in a
      below-market interest rate, increasing the fund's duration and
reducing the value of such a security.                  

    CREDIT RISK. A fund purchasing bonds faces the risk that the
           creditworthiness of an issuer may decline, causing the value of its
        bonds to decline. In addition, an issuer may not be able to make
         timely payments on the interest and principal on the bonds it has
            issued. Because the issuers of high-yield bonds or junk bonds (rated
        below the fourth highest category) may be in uncertain financial
       health, the prices of their bonds can be more vulnerable to bad
economic news or even the expectation of bad news, than 
  investment-grade bonds. In some cases, bonds, particularly
high-yield bonds, may

This fund is designed for investors who are looking for a tax-advantaged        
investment and are interested in current income.

          decline in credit quality or go into default. Because the fund may
         invest in securities not paying current interest or in securities
already in default, these risks may be more pronounced. 

   FOCUSED INVESTING RISK. The fact that the fund may focus on
  investments from a single state or sector of the municipal
       securities market increases risk, because factors affecting the
          state or region, such as economic or fiscal problems, could affect
         a large portion of the fund's securities in a similar manner. For
 example, a state's technology or biotech industries could
         experience a downturn or fail to develop as expected, hurting the
         local economy. States that face severe fiscal difficulties due to
        an economic downturn, could experience increased expenditures on
       domestic security and reduced monetary support from the federal
          government. Over time, these issues may have the ability to impair
a state's ability to repay its obligations.             

          MARKET RISK. Deteriorating market conditions might cause a general
           weakness in the market that reduces the overall level of securities
          prices in that market. Developments in a particular class of bonds
   or the stock market could also adversely affect the fund by
       reducing the relative attractiveness of bonds as an investment.
         Also, to the extent that the fund emphasizes bonds from any given
     industry, it could be hurt if that industry does not do well.

       DERIVATIVES RISK. Risks associated with derivatives include the
          risk that the derivative is not well correlated with the security,
        index or currency to which it relates; the risk that derivatives
     may not have the intended effects and may result in losses or
           missed opportunities; the risk that the fund will be unable to sell
        the derivative because of an illiquid secondary market; the risk
          that a counterparty is unwilling or unable to meet its obligation;
          and the risk that the derivative transaction could expose the fund
   to the effects of leverage, which could increase the fund's
        exposure to the market and magnify potential losses. There is no
         guarantee that derivatives, to the extent employed, will have the
        intended effect, and their use could cause lower returns or even
       losses to the fund. The use of derivatives by the fund to hedge
           risk may reduce the opportunity for gain by offsetting the positive
effect of favorable price movements.

Other factors that could affect performance include:    

 -  portfolio management could be wrong in the analysis of
  industries, companies, economic trends, the relative
     attractiveness of different securities or other matters

     -  political or legal actions could change the way the fund's
dividends are treated for tax purposes            

       -  at times, market conditions might make it hard to value some
 investments or to get an attractive price for them.

THE FUND'S PERFORMANCE HISTORY                                                  

While a fund's past performance (before and after taxes) isn't necessarily a    
sign of how it will do in the future, it can be valuable for an investor to     
know.                                                                           

The bar chart shows how the performance of the fund's Institutional Class       
shares has varied from year to year, which may give some idea of risk. The      
table on the following page shows how fund performance compares to relevant     
index information (which, unlike the fund performance, does not reflect fees or 
expenses). The performance of both the fund and the index information varies    
over time. All figures assume reinvestment of dividends and distributions (in   
the case of after-tax returns, reinvested net of assumed tax rates).            

The table shows returns for Institutional Class shares on a before-tax and      
after-tax basis. After-tax returns are estimates calculated using the           
historical highest individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not      
reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on 
an investor's tax situation and may differ from those shown in the table.       
After-tax returns shown are not relevant for investors who hold their shares    
through tax-deferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or individual           
retirement accounts.

3  Interest expense relates to the fund's liability with respect to floating    
rate notes held by third parties in conjunction with inverse floater      
securities transactions. However, the accounting treatment for such       
transactions includes an offsetting interest income item, and accordingly 
has no impact to net investment income, total return or net asset value.  

4  Through September 30, 2008, the Advisor has contractually agreed to waive    
all or a portion of its management fee and reimburse or pay operating     
expenses of the fund to the extent necessary to maintain the fund's total 
operating expenses at 0.50% for Institutional Class shares, excluding     
certain expenses such as extraordinary expenses, taxes, brokerage,        
interest, and organizational and offering expenses.                       

Based on the costs above, this example helps you compare this fund's            
Institutional Class shares expenses to those of other mutual funds. This        
example assumes the expenses above remain the same. It also assumes that you    
invested $10,000, earned 5% annual returns and reinvested all dividends and     
distributions. This is only an example; actual expenses will be different.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THE FUND'S MAIN INVESTMENT STRATEGY 

    The fund seeks to provide a high level of income exempt from
 regular federal income taxes and seeks to limit principal
fluctuation.                                            

        Under normal circumstances, the fund invests at least 80% of net
          assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes,
           in securities issued by municipalities across the United States and
     in other securities whose income is free from regular federal
       income tax and alternative minimum tax (AMT). The fund does not
      intend to invest in securities whose income is subject to AMT.

  The fund can buy many types of municipal securities of all
        maturities. These may include revenue bonds (which are backed by
       revenues from a particular source) and general obligation bonds
           (which are typically backed by the issuer's ability to levy taxes).
         They may also include municipal lease obligations and investments
representing an interest therein.                       

           CREDIT QUALITY POLICIES. This fund normally invests at least 65% of
       total assets in municipal securities of the top three grades of
           credit quality. The fund could put up to 35% of net assets in bonds
   rated in the fourth credit grade, which is still considered
investment-grade.                                       

           The portfolio managers look for securities that appear to offer the
 best total return potential. In making their buy and sell
           decisions, the managers typically weigh a number of factors against
     each other, from economic outlooks and possible interest rate
    movements to characteristics of specific securities, such as
      coupon, maturity date and call date, and changes in supply and
demand within the municipal bond market.                

   Although the managers may adjust the maturity of the fund's
       portfolio between three and ten years, they generally intend to
keep it between five and ten years.

         In addition, they may use various types of derivative instruments
   (instruments whose value is based on, for example, indices,
      commodities or securities), for hedging purposes or to enhance
      return. Such instruments may include inverse floaters, futures
 contracts, interest rate swaps and other over-the-counter
derivatives.                                            

THE MAIN RISKS OF INVESTING IN THE FUND                 

 There are several risk factors that could hurt the fund's
performance, cause you to lose money or cause the fund's
performance to trail that of other investments.         

   INTEREST RATE RISK. Generally, fixed income securities will
  decrease in value when interest rates rise. The longer the
          effective maturity of the fund's securities, the more sensitive it
          will be to interest rate changes. (As a general rule, a 1% rise in
 interest rates means a 1% fall in value for every year of
       duration.) As interest rates decline, the issuers of securities
     held by the fund may prepay principal earlier than scheduled,
         forcing the fund to reinvest in lower-yielding securities and may
         reduce the fund's income. As interest rates increase, slower than
        expected principal payments may extend the average life of fixed
    income securities. This will have the effect of locking in a
      below-market interest rate, increasing the fund's duration and
reducing the value of such a security.                  

    CREDIT RISK. A fund purchasing bonds faces the risk that the
           creditworthiness of an issuer may decline, causing the value of its
        bonds to decline. In addition, an issuer may not be able to make
         timely payments on the interest and principal on the bonds it has
            issued. Because the issuers of high-yield bonds or junk bonds (rated
        below the fourth highest category) may be in uncertain financial
       health, the prices of their bonds can be more vulnerable to bad
economic news or even the expectation of bad news, than 
  investment-grade bonds. In some cases, bonds, particularly
           high-yield bonds, may decline in credit quality or go into default.
    Because the fund may invest in securities not paying current
        interest or in securities already in default, these risks may be
more pronounced.

   FOCUSED INVESTING RISK. The fact that the fund may focus on
  investments from a single state or sector of the municipal
       securities market increases risk, because factors affecting the
          state or region, such as economic or fiscal problems, could affect
         a large portion of the fund's securities in a similar manner. For
 example, a state's technology or biotech industries could
         experience a downturn or fail to develop as expected, hurting the
         local economy. States that face severe fiscal difficulties due to
        an economic downturn, could experience increased expenditures on
       domestic security and reduced monetary support from the federal
          government. Over time, these issues may have the ability to impair
a state's ability to repay its obligations.             

          MARKET RISK. Deteriorating market conditions might cause a general
           weakness in the market that reduces the overall level of securities
          prices in that market. Developments in a particular class of bonds
   or the stock market could also adversely affect the fund by
       reducing the relative attractiveness of bonds as an investment.
         Also, to the extent that the fund emphasizes bonds from any given
     industry, it could be hurt if that industry does not do well.

       DERIVATIVES RISK. Risks associated with derivatives include the
          risk that the derivative is not well correlated with the security,
        index or currency to which it relates; the risk that derivatives
     may not have the intended effects and may result in losses or
           missed opportunities; the risk that the fund will be unable to sell
        the derivative because of an illiquid secondary market; the risk
          that a counterparty is unwilling or unable to meet its obligation;
          and the risk that the derivative transaction could expose the fund
   to the effects of leverage, which could increase the fund's
        exposure to the market and magnify potential losses. There is no
         guarantee that derivatives, to the extent employed, will have the
        intended effect, and their use could cause lower returns or even
       losses to the fund. The use of derivatives by the fund to hedge
           risk may reduce the opportunity for gain by offsetting the positive
effect of favorable price movements.

Other factors that could affect performance include:    

 -  portfolio management could be wrong in the analysis of
  industries, companies, economic trends, the relative
     attractiveness of different securities or other matters

     -  political or legal actions could change the way the fund's
dividends are treated for tax purposes            

       -  at times, market conditions might make it hard to value some
 investments or to get an attractive price for them.

THE FUND'S PERFORMANCE HISTORY                                                  

While a fund's past performance (before and after taxes) isn't necessarily a    
sign of how it will do in the future, it can be valuable for an investor to     
know.                                                                           

The bar chart shows how the performance of the fund's Institutional Class       
shares has varied from year to year, which may give some idea of risk. The      
table on the following page shows how fund performance compares to relevant     
index information (which, unlike the fund performance, does not reflect fees or 
expenses). The performance of both the fund and the index information varies    
over time. All figures assume reinvestment of dividends and distributions (in   
the case of after-tax returns, reinvested net of assumed tax rates).            

The table shows returns for Institutional Class shares on a before-tax and      
after-tax basis. After-tax returns are estimates calculated using the           
historical highest individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not      
reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on 
an investor's tax situation and may differ from those shown in the table.       
After-tax returns shown are not relevant for investors who hold their shares    
through tax-deferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or individual           
retirement accounts.

*  Institutional Class shares commenced operations on December 17, 2004. Index

** Return after Taxes on Distributions and Sale of Fund Shares is higher than   
other return figures for the same period due to a capital loss occurring  
upon redemption resulting in an assumed tax deduction for the shareholder.

  Total returns would have been lower if certain expenses hadn't been reduced.

The LEHMAN SEVEN YEAR MUNICIPAL BOND INDEX is an unmanaged, total return      
subset of the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index. It includes maturities of 
six to eight years.

The RETURN AFTER TAXES ON DISTRIBUTIONS assumes that an investor holds fund     
shares at the end of the period. The number represents only the fund's taxable  
distributions and not a shareholder's gain or loss from selling fund shares.    

The RETURN AFTER TAXES ON DISTRIBUTIONS AND SALE OF FUND SHARES assumes that an 
investor sold his or her fund shares at the end of the period. The number       
reflects both the fund's taxable distributions and a shareholder's gain or loss 
from selling fund shares.

OTHER POLICIES AND RISKS                                                        

      While the previous pages describe the main points of each fund's
     strategy and risks, there are a few other issues to know about:

        -  Although major changes tend to be infrequent, each fund's Board
      could change a fund's investment objective without seeking
           shareholder approval. However, the policy of investing at least
    80% of net assets (plus the amount of any borrowings for
         investment purposes in the case of DWS Managed Municipal Bond
     Fund and DWS Intermediate Tax/AMT Free Fund) in municipal
         securities exempt from regular federal income tax (and in the
        case of DWS Intermediate Tax/ AMT Free Fund, the alternative
            minimum tax) for each fund cannot be changed without shareholder
approval.                                           

          -  As a temporary defensive measure, each fund could shift up to 20%
             and DWS High Yield Tax Free Fund could shift up to 100% of assets
             into investments such as taxable money market securities or other
            short-term securities that offer comparable levels of risk. This
             could prevent losses, but, while engaged in a temporary defensive
      position, a fund will not be pursuing its investment goal.
     However, portfolio management may choose not to use these
   strategies for various reasons, even in volatile market
conditions. Temporary investments may be taxable.   

         -  Portfolio management measures credit quality at the time it buys
         securities, using independent rating agencies or, for unrated
          securities, a judgment by portfolio management. All securities
       must meet the credit quality standards applied by portfolio
         management. If a security's credit quality changes, portfolio
             management will decide what to do with the security, based on its
assessment of what would benefit shareholders most. 

For more information                                      

    This prospectus doesn't tell you about every policy or risk of
investing in each fund.                                   

          If you want more information on each fund's allowable securities and
         investment practices and the characteristics and risks of each one,
   you may want to request a copy of the Statement of Additional
Information (the back cover tells you how to do this).

          Keep in mind that there is no assurance that a fund will achieve its
goal.                                                     

       A complete list of each fund's portfolio holdings is posted as of
        the month-end on www.dws-scudder.com (the Web site does not form a
        part of this prospectus) on or after the last day of the following
          month. This posted information generally remains accessible at least
         until the date on which a fund files its Form N-CSR or N-Q with the
         Securities and Exchange Commission for the period that includes the
     date as of which the posted information is current. Each fund's
     Statement of Additional Information includes a description of a
        fund's policies and procedures with respect to the disclosure of a
fund's portfolio holdings.

      Effective October 1, 2007, DWS High Yield Tax Free Fund pays the
         Advisor under the investment management agreement a fee, calculated
        daily and paid monthly, at the annual rate of 0.565% of the fund's
          average daily net assets up to $300 million, 0.515% of the next $200
     million, 0.490% of the next $500 million and 0.470% thereafter.

       A discussion regarding the basis for the Board's approval of each
fund's investment management agreement is contained in the
       shareholder reports for the semi-annual period ended November 30,
2006 (see "Shareholder reports" on the back cover).       

          Under a separate administrative services agreement between each fund
       and the Advisor, each fund pays the Advisor for providing most of

The financial highlights are designed to help you understand recent financial   
performance. The figures in the first part of each table are for a single       
share. The total return figures represent the percentage that an investor in a  
fund would have earned (or lost), assuming all dividends and distributions were 
reinvested. This information has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP,    
independent registered public accounting firm, whose report, along with each    
fund's financial statements, is included in each fund's annual report (see      
"Shareholder reports" on the back cover).

The following pages tell you how to invest in a fund and what to expect as a    
shareholder. If you're investing directly with DWS Scudder, all of this         
information applies to you.                                                     

The following pages also tell you about many of the services, choices and       
benefits of being a shareholder. You'll also find information on how to check

retirement plan, financial supermarket or financial advisor - your provider may 
have its own policies or instructions and you should follow those.              

You can find out more about the topics covered here by speaking with your       
FINANCIAL ADVISOR OR A REPRESENTATIVE OF YOUR WORKPLACE RETIREMENT PLAN OR      
OTHER INVESTMENT PROVIDER.

Financial intermediary support payments                   

     The Advisor, DWS Scudder Distributors, Inc. (the "Distributor")
     and/or their affiliates may pay additional compensation, out of
       their own assets and not as an additional charge to each fund, to
          selected affiliated and unaffiliated brokers, dealers, participating
       insurance companies or other financial intermediaries ("financial
        advisors") in connection with the sale and/or distribution of fund
         shares or the retention and/or servicing of fund investors and fund
      shares ("revenue sharing"). Such revenue sharing payments are in
         addition to any distribution or service fees payable under any Rule
         12b-1 or service plan of each fund, any record keeping/sub-transfer
        agency/networking fees payable by each fund (generally through the
    Distributor or an affiliate) and/or the Distributor to certain
   financial advisors for performing such services and any sales
        charges, commissions, non-cash compensation arrangements expressly
       permitted under applicable rules of the NASD or other concessions
       described in the fee table or elsewhere in this prospectus or the
     Statement of Additional Information as payable to all financial
      advisors. For example, the Advisor, the Distributor and/or their
       affiliates may compensate financial advisors for providing a fund
    with "shelf space" or access to a third party platform or fund
  offering list or other marketing programs including, without
         limitation, inclusion of the fund on preferred or recommended sales
       lists, mutual fund "supermarket" platforms and other formal sales
          programs; granting the Distributor access to the financial advisor's
sales

       force; granting the Distributor access to the financial advisor's
        conferences and meetings; assistance in training and educating the
 financial advisor's personnel; and obtaining other forms of
marketing support.                                        

          The level of revenue sharing payments made to financial advisors may
        be a fixed fee or based upon one or more of the following factors:
        gross sales, current assets and/or number of accounts of each fund
        attributable to the financial advisor, the particular fund or fund
         type or other measures as agreed to by the Advisor, the Distributor
and/or their affiliates and the financial advisors or any 
          combination thereof. The amount of these revenue sharing payments is
         determined at the discretion of the Advisor, the Distributor and/or
        their affiliates from time to time, may be substantial, and may be
       different for different financial advisors based on, for example,
   the nature of the services provided by the financial advisor.

         The Advisor, the Distributor and/or their affiliates currently make
       revenue sharing payments from their own assets in connection with
      the sale and/or distribution of DWS Fund shares or the retention
    and/or servicing of investors and DWS Fund shares to financial
      advisors in amounts that generally range from .01% up to .50% of
  assets of each fund serviced and maintained by the financial
     advisor, .10% to .25% of sales of each fund attributable to the
     financial advisor, a flat fee of $12,500 up to $500,000, or any
     combination thereof. These amounts are subject to change at the
         discretion of the Advisor, the Distributor and/or their affiliates.
Receipt of, or the prospect of receiving, this additional 
        compensation may influence your financial advisor's recommendation
     of each fund or of any particular share class of each fund. You
    should review your financial advisor's compensation disclosure
         and/or talk to your financial advisor to obtain more information on
        how this compensation may have influenced your financial advisor's
         recommendation of each fund. Additional information regarding these
      revenue sharing payments is included in each fund's Statement of
        Additional Information, which is available to you on request at no
        charge (see the back cover of this prospectus for more information
on how to request a copy of the Statement of Additional   
Information).                                             

        The Advisor, the Distributor and/or their affiliates may also make
         such revenue sharing payments to financial advisors under the terms
     discussed above in connection with the distribution of both DWS
funds and non-DWS funds by financial advisors to

         retirement plans that obtain record keeping services from ADP, Inc.
          on the DWS Scudder branded retirement plan platform (the "Platform")
          with the level of revenue sharing payments being based upon sales of
          both the DWS funds and the non-DWS funds by the financial advisor on
          the Platform or current assets of both the DWS funds and the non-DWS
   funds serviced and maintained by the financial advisor on the
Platform.                                                 

          It is likely that broker-dealers that execute portfolio transactions
       for each fund will include firms that also sell shares of the DWS
      funds to their customers. However, the Advisor will not consider
sales of DWS fund shares as a factor in the selection of  
         broker-dealers to execute portfolio transactions for the DWS funds.
      Accordingly, the Advisor has implemented policies and procedures
          reasonably designed to prevent its traders from considering sales of
       DWS fund shares as a factor in the selection of broker-dealers to
    execute portfolio transactions for each fund. In addition, the
        Advisor, the Distributor and/or their affiliates will not use fund
 brokerage to pay for their obligation to provide additional
compensation to financial advisors as described above.    

POLICIES YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT 

     Along with the instructions on the previous pages, the policies
      below may affect you as a shareholder. Some of this information,
    such as the section on distributions and taxes, applies to all
       investors, including those investing through a financial advisor.

   If you are investing through a financial advisor or through a
       retirement plan, check the materials you received from them about
         how to buy and sell shares because particular financial advisors or
        other intermediaries may adopt policies, procedures or limitations
          that are separate from those described by a fund. Please note that a
        financial advisor may charge fees separate from those charged by a
fund and may be compensated by a fund.                    

          Keep in mind that the information in this prospectus applies only to
     the shares offered herein. Other share classes are described in
     separate prospectuses and have different fees, requirements and
services.

          In order to reduce the amount of mail you receive and to help reduce
         expenses, we generally send a single copy of any shareholder report
         and prospectus to each household. If you do not want the mailing of
         these documents to be combined with those for other members of your
    household, please contact your financial advisor or call (800)

Policies about transactions                               

         EACH FUND IS OPEN FOR BUSINESS each day the New York Stock Exchange
        is open. Each fund calculates its share price for each class every
      business day, as of the close of regular trading on the New York
     Stock Exchange (typically 4:00 p.m. Eastern time, but sometimes
          earlier, as in the case of scheduled half-day trading or unscheduled
    suspensions of trading). You can place an order to buy or sell
shares at any time.                                       

     To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money
laundering activities, federal law requires all financial 
institutions to obtain, verify and record information that
          identifies each person who opens an account. What this means to you:
        When you open an account, we will ask for your name, address, date
        of birth and other information that will allow us to identify you.
         Some or all of this information will be used to verify the identity
of all persons opening an account.                        

          We might request additional information about you (which may include
         certain documents, such as articles of incorporation for companies)
         to help us verify your identity and, in some cases, the information
       and/or documents may be required to conduct the verification. The
  information and documents will be used solely to verify your
identity.                                                 

   We will attempt to collect any missing required and requested
        information by contacting you or your financial advisor. If we are
          unable to obtain this information within the time frames established
  by each fund, then we may reject your application and order.

    Each fund will not invest your purchase until all required and
     requested identification information has been provided and your
          application has been submitted in "good order." After we receive all
         the information, your application is deemed to be in good order and
       we accept your purchase, you will receive the net asset value per
share next calculated.

P-->497124th Page of 358TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 124th
 If we are unable to verify your identity within time frames
       established by each fund, after a reasonable effort to do so, you
will receive written notification.                        

      With certain limited exceptions, only US residents may invest in
each fund.                                                

         Because orders placed through a financial advisor must be forwarded
        to the transfer agent before they can be processed, you'll need to
         allow extra time. Your financial advisor should be able to tell you
approximately when your order will be processed. It is the
       responsibility of your financial advisor to forward your order to
the transfer agent in a timely manner.                    

      SUB-MINIMUM BALANCES. Each fund may redeem your shares and close
     your account on 60 days' notice if it fails to meet the minimum
          account balance requirement of $1,000,000 ($250,000 for shareholders
     with existing accounts prior to August 13, 2004) for any reason
other than a change in market value                       

MARKET TIMING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. Short-term and excessive
    trading of fund shares may present risks to a fund's long-term
     shareholders, including potential dilution in the value of fund
    shares, interference with the efficient management of a fund's
      portfolio (including losses on the sale of investments), taxable
 gains to remaining shareholders and increased brokerage and
        administrative costs. These risks may be more pronounced if a fund
        invests in certain securities, such as those that trade in foreign
       markets, are illiquid or do not otherwise have "readily available
         market quotations." Certain investors may seek to employ short-term
    trading strategies aimed at exploiting variations in portfolio
      valuation that arise from the nature of the securities held by a
          fund (e.g., "time zone arbitrage"). Each fund discourages short-term
        and excessive trading and has adopted policies and procedures that
        are intended to detect and deter short-term and excessive trading.

         Pursuant to its policies, each fund will impose a 2% redemption fee
  on fund shares held for less than a specified holding period
      (subject to certain exceptions discussed below under "Redemption
fees"). Each fund also reserves the right to reject or cancel a
         purchase or exchange order for any reason without prior notice. For
          example, a fund may in its discretion reject or cancel a purchase or
     an exchange order even if the transaction is not subject to the
      specific roundtrip transaction limitation described below if the
Advisor believes that there appears to be                 

46 | Policies You Should Know About                                             

P-->497125th Page of 358TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 125th
a pattern of short-term or excessive trading activity by a
shareholder or deems any other trading activity harmful or
       disruptive to a fund. Each fund, through its Advisor and Transfer
        Agent, will measure short-term and excessive trading by the number
       of roundtrip transactions within a shareholder's account during a
          rolling 12-month period. A "roundtrip" transaction is defined as any
combination of purchase and redemption activity (including
    exchanges) of the same fund's shares. Each fund may take other
          trading activity into account if a fund believes such activity is of
          an amount or frequency that may be harmful to long-term shareholders
or disruptive to portfolio management.                    

         Shareholders are limited to four roundtrip transactions in the same
     DWS Fund (excluding money market funds) over a rolling 12-month
          period. Shareholders with four or more roundtrip transactions in the
      same DWS Fund within a rolling 12-month period generally will be
          blocked from making additional purchases of, or exchanges into, that
       DWS Fund. Each fund has sole discretion whether to remove a block
         from a shareholder's account. The rights of a shareholder to redeem
 shares of a DWS Fund are not affected by the four roundtrip
        transaction limitation, but all redemptions remain subject to each
   fund's redemption fee policy (see "Redemption fees" described
below).                                                   

         The Advisor may make exceptions to the roundtrip transaction policy
          for certain types of transactions if in its opinion the transactions
         do not represent short-term or excessive trading or are not abusive
   or harmful to a fund, such as, but not limited to, systematic
transactions, required minimum retirement distributions,  
        transactions initiated by a fund or administrator and transactions
by certain qualified fund-of-fund(s).                     

       In certain circumstances where shareholders hold shares of a fund
  through a financial intermediary, the fund may rely upon the
      financial intermediary's policy to deter short-term or excessive
       trading if the Advisor believes that the financial intermediary's
         policy is reasonably designed to detect and deter transactions that
        are not in the best interest of a fund. A financial intermediary's
       policy relating to short-term or excessive trading may be more or
     less restrictive than the DWS Funds' policy, may permit certain
        transactions not permitted by the DWS Funds' policies, or prohibit
transactions not subject to the DWS Funds' policies.      

                                            Policies You Should Know About  | 47

P-->497126th Page of 358TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 126th
The Advisor may also accept undertakings from a financial 
         intermediary to enforce short-term or excessive trading policies on
    behalf of a fund that provide a substantially similar level of
      protection for each fund against such transactions. For example,
    certain financial intermediaries may have contractual or legal
      restrictions that prevent them from blocking an account. In such
        instances, the financial intermediary may use alternate techniques
         that the Advisor considers to be a reasonable substitute for such a
block.                                                    

          In addition, if a fund invests some portion of its assets in foreign
          securities, it has adopted certain fair valuation practices intended
        to protect the fund from "time zone arbitrage" with respect to its
          foreign securities holdings and other trading practices that seek to
          exploit variations in portfolio valuation that arise from the nature
      of the securities held by a fund. (See "How each fund calculates
share price.")                                            

      There is no assurance that these policies and procedures will be
          effective in limiting short-term and excessive trading in all cases.
      For example, the Advisor may not be able to effectively monitor,
   detect or limit short-term or excessive trading by underlying
     shareholders that occurs through omnibus accounts maintained by
   broker-dealers or other financial intermediaries. The Advisor
        reviews trading activity at the omnibus level to detect short-term
     or excessive trading. If the Advisor has reason to suspect that
        short-term or excessive trading is occurring at the omnibus level,
    the Advisor will contact the financial intermediary to request
       underlying shareholder level activity. Depending on the amount of
         fund shares held in such omnibus accounts (which may represent most
     of a fund's shares) short-term and/or excessive trading of fund
        shares could adversely affect long-term shareholders in a fund. If
          short-term or excessive trading is identified, the Advisor will take
appropriate action.                                       

          Each fund's market timing policies and procedures may be modified or
terminated at any time.                                   

REDEMPTION FEES. Each fund imposes a redemption fee of 2% of the
         total redemption amount (calculated at net asset value) on all fund
        shares redeemed or exchanged within 15 days of buying them (either
      by purchase or exchange). The redemption fee is paid directly to
        each fund and is designed to encourage long-term investment and to
offset transaction and other costs

      associated with short-term or excessive trading. For purposes of
     determining whether the redemption fee applies, shares held the
          longest time will be treated as being redeemed first and shares held
the shortest time will be treated as being redeemed last. 

      The redemption fee is applicable to fund shares purchased either
directly or through a financial intermediary, such as a   
  broker-dealer. Transactions through financial intermediaries
      typically are placed with a fund on an omnibus basis and include
      both purchase and sale transactions placed on behalf of multiple
          investors. These purchase and sale transactions are generally netted
        against one another and placed on an aggregate basis; consequently
        the identities of the individuals on whose behalf the transactions
         are placed generally are not known to a fund. For this reason, each
     fund has undertaken to notify financial intermediaries of their
         obligation to assess the redemption fee on customer accounts and to
  collect and remit the proceeds to each fund. However, due to
        operational requirements, the intermediaries' methods for tracking
          and calculating the fee may be inadequate or differ in some respects
from each fund's.                                         

   The redemption fee will not be charged in connection with the
        following exchange or redemption transactions: (i) transactions on
    behalf of participants in certain research wrap programs; (ii)
        transactions on behalf of participants in certain group retirement
       plans whose processing systems are incapable of properly applying
          the redemption fee to underlying shareholders; (iii) transactions on
       behalf of a shareholder to return any excess IRA contributions to
      the shareholder; (iv) transactions on behalf of a shareholder to
        effect a required minimum distribution on an IRA; (v) transactions
 on behalf of any mutual fund advised by the Advisor and its
affiliates (e.g., "funds of funds") or, in the case of a  
         master/feeder relationship, redemptions by the feeder fund from the
master portfolio; (vi) transactions on behalf of certain  
  unaffiliated mutual funds operating as funds of funds; (vii)
  transactions following death or disability of any registered
     shareholder, beneficial owner or grantor of a living trust with
    respect to shares purchased before death or disability; (viii)
         transactions involving hardship of any registered shareholder; (ix)
         systematic transactions with pre-defined trade dates for purchases,
         exchanges or redemptions, such as automatic account rebalancing, or
        loan origination and repayments; (x) transactions involving shares
purchased through the reinvestment of dividends or other  
distributions; (xi)

       transactions involving shares transferred from another account in
    the same fund or converted from another class of the same fund
       (e.g., shares converting from Class B to Class A) (the redemption
fee period will carry over to the acquired shares); (xii) 
          transactions initiated by a fund or administrator (e.g., redemptions
     for not meeting account minimums, to pay account fees funded by
        share redemptions, or in the event of the liquidation or merger of
        the fund); or (xiii) transactions in cases when there are legal or
      contractual limitations or restrictions on the imposition of the
         redemption fee (as determined by a fund or its agents in their sole
         discretion). In addition, the redemption fee will not be charged in
    connection with checkwriting transactions for DWS Intermediate
    Tax/AMT Free Fund. It is the policy of the DWS funds to permit
         approved fund platform providers to execute transactions within the
        funds without the imposition of a redemption fee if such providers
      have implemented alternative measures that are determined by the
          Advisor to provide controls on short-term and excessive trading that
are comparable to the DWS funds' policies.                

   THE AUTOMATED INFORMATION LINE IS AVAILABLE 24 HOURS A DAY BY
         CALLING (800) 621-1048. You can use our automated phone services to
          get information on DWS funds generally and on accounts held directly
         at DWS Scudder. You can also use this service to make exchanges and
sell shares.                                              

QUICKBUY AND QUICKSELL let you set up a link between a DWS
          fund account and a bank account. Once this link is in place, you can
       move money between the two with a phone call. You'll need to make
 sure your bank has Automated Clearing House (ACH) services.
        Transactions take two to three days to be completed and there is a
         $50 minimum and a $250,000 maximum. To set up QuickBuy or QuickSell
    on a new account, see the account application; to add it to an
existing account, call (800) 730-1313.                    

TELEPHONE AND ELECTRONIC TRANSACTIONS. Generally, you are 
    automatically entitled to telephone and electronic transaction
       privileges, but you may elect not to have them when you open your
          account or by contacting Shareholder Services at (800) 730-1313 at a

         of your confirmation statements immediately after you receive them.

  EACH FUND DOES NOT ISSUE SHARE CERTIFICATES. However, if you
      currently have shares in certificated form, you must include the
   share certificates properly endorsed or accompanied by a duly
       executed stock power when exchanging or redeeming shares. You may
       not exchange or redeem shares in certificate form by telephone or
via the Internet.                                         

          WHEN YOU ASK US TO SEND OR RECEIVE A WIRE, please note that while we
          don't charge a fee to send or receive wires, it's possible that your
         bank may do so. Wire transactions are generally completed within 24
       hours. Each fund can only send wires of $1,000 or more and accept
wires of $50 or more.                                     

       EACH FUND ACCEPTS PAYMENT FOR SHARES ONLY IN US DOLLARS by check,
         bank or Federal Funds wire transfer or by electronic bank transfer.
 Please note that a fund does not accept cash, money orders,
          traveler's checks, starter checks, third party checks (except checks
      for retirement plan asset transfers and rollovers or for Uniform
          Gift to Minors Act/Uniform Transfers to Minors Act accounts), checks
         drawn on foreign banks or checks issued by credit card companies or
         Internet-based companies. Thus, subject to the foregoing exceptions
for certain third party checks, checks that are otherwise 
        permissible must be drawn by the account holder on a domestic bank
and must be payable to a fund.                            

SIGNATURE GUARANTEE. When you want to sell more than $100,000 worth
      of shares or send proceeds to a third party or to a new address,
      you'll usually need to place your order in writing and include a
     signature guarantee. However, if you want money wired to a bank
         account that is already on file with us, you don't need a signature
         guarantee. Also, generally you don't need a signature guarantee for
an exchange, although we may require one in certain other 
circumstances.                                            

         A signature guarantee is simply a certification of your signature -
 a valuable safeguard against fraud. You can get a signature
 guarantee from an eligible guarantor institution, including
          commercial banks, savings and loans, trust companies, credit unions,
member firms of a national stock

   SELLING SHARES OF TRUST ACCOUNTS AND BUSINESS OR ORGANIZATION
      ACCOUNTS may require additional documentation. Please call (800)
      730-1313 or contact your financial advisor for more information.

         MONEY FROM SHARES YOU SELL is normally sent out within one business
    day of when your order is processed (not when it is received),
        although it could be delayed for up to seven days. There are other
        circumstances when it could be longer: When you are selling shares
        you bought recently by check (redemption proceeds from such a sale
 are unavailable until the check has cleared), when you make
        purchases by ACH (the funds will be placed under a 10 calendar day
         hold to ensure good funds) or when unusual circumstances prompt the
         SEC to allow further delays. Certain expedited redemption processes
        may also be delayed when you are selling recently purchased shares
   or in the event of closing of the Federal Reserve Bank's wire
          payment system. In addition, each fund reserves the right to suspend
       or postpone redemptions as permitted pursuant to Section 22(e) of
        the Investment Company Act of 1940. Generally, those circumstances
  are when 1) the New York Stock Exchange is closed other than
       customary weekend or holiday closings; 2) trading on the New York
          Stock Exchange is restricted; 3) an emergency exists which makes the
         disposal of securities owned by a fund or the fair determination of
        the value of a fund's net assets not reasonably practicable; or 4)
the SEC, by order, permits the suspension of the right of 
        redemption. Redemption payments by wire may also be delayed in the
        event of a non-routine closure of the Federal Reserve wire payment
     system. For additional rights reserved by each fund, please see
"Other rights we reserve."                                

         You may obtain additional information about other ways to sell your
shares by contacting your financial advisor.              

     ACCOUNT STATEMENTS. We or your financial advisor will generally
       furnish you with a written confirmation of every transaction that
  affects your account balance. You will also receive periodic
statements reflecting the balances in your account.

How each fund calculates share price                      

     To calculate net asset value, or NAV, each share class uses the
following equation:                                       

                                                                [Download Table]

 TOTAL ASSETS - TOTAL LIABILITIES                    
-----------------------------------------    =    NAV
    TOTAL NUMBER OF SHARES OUTSTANDING               

The price at which you buy and sell shares is the NAV.    

       EACH FUND CHARGES A REDEMPTION FEE EQUAL TO 2.00% of the value of
       shares redeemed or exchanged within 15 days. Please see "Policies
about transactions - Redemption fees" for further information.

     WE TYPICALLY VALUE SECURITIES USING INFORMATION FURNISHED BY AN
          INDEPENDENT PRICING SERVICE OR MARKET QUOTATIONS, WHERE APPROPRIATE.
       However, we may use methods approved by a fund's Board, such as a
         fair valuation model, which are intended to reflect fair value when
      pricing service information or market quotations are not readily
         available or when a security's value or a meaningful portion of the
     value of a fund's portfolio is believed to have been materially
     affected by a significant event, such as a natural disaster, an
economic event like a bankruptcy filing, or a substantial 
          fluctuation in domestic or foreign markets that has occurred between
  the close of the exchange or market on which the security is
        principally traded (for example, a foreign exchange or market) and
        the close of the New York Stock Exchange. In such a case, a fund's
         value for a security is likely to be different from the last quoted
          market price or pricing service information. In addition, due to the
          subjective and variable nature of fair value pricing, it is possible
        that the value determined for a particular asset may be materially
different from the value realized upon such asset's sale.

Other rights we reserve                                   

You should be aware that we may do any of the following:  

-  withdraw or suspend the offering of shares at any time 

         -  withhold a portion of your distributions and redemption proceeds
          as federal income tax if we have been notified by the IRS that
           you are subject to backup withholding or if you fail to provide
           us with a correct taxpayer ID number and certain certifications
        or certification that you are exempt from backup withholding

  -  reject a new account application if you don't provide any
           required or requested identifying information, or for any other
reason                                              

         -  refuse, cancel, limit or rescind any purchase or exchange order,
             without prior notice; freeze any account (meaning you will not be
          able to purchase fund shares in your account); suspend account
          services; and/or involuntarily redeem your account if we think
    that the account is being used for fraudulent or illegal
             purposes; one or more of these actions will be taken when, at our
            sole discretion, they are deemed to be in a fund's best interest
             or when a fund is requested or compelled to do so by governmental
authority or by applicable law                      

         -  close and liquidate your account if we are unable to verify your
      identity, or for other reasons; if we decide to close your
             account, your fund shares will be redeemed at the net asset value
      per share next calculated after we determine to close your
            account (less any applicable redemption fees); you may recognize
            a gain or loss on the redemption of your fund shares and incur a
tax liability                                       

        -  pay you for shares you sell by "redeeming in kind," that is, by
          giving you marketable securities (which typically will involve
             brokerage costs for you to liquidate) rather than cash, but which
          will be taxable to the same extent as a redemption for cash; a
      fund generally won't make a redemption in kind unless your
           requests over a 90-day period total more than $250,000 or 1% of
the value of a fund's net assets, whichever is less 

   -  change, add or withdraw various services, fees and account
             policies (for example, we may adjust a fund's investment minimums
at any time)

UNDERSTANDING DISTRIBUTIONS AND TAXES                                           

          Each fund intends to distribute to its shareholders virtually all of
          its net earnings. Each fund can earn money in two ways: by receiving
         interest, dividends or other income from securities it holds and by
     selling securities for more than it paid for them. (Each fund's
       earnings are separate from any gains or losses stemming from your
      own purchase and sale of shares.) Each fund may not always pay a
dividend or distribution for a given period.              

          Income dividends are declared daily and paid monthly. Short-term and
  long-term capital gains are paid in November or December, or
otherwise as needed.                                      

          Dividends or distributions declared to shareholders of record in the
          last quarter of a given calendar year are treated for federal income
        tax purposes as if they were received on December 31 of that year,
         provided such dividends or distributions are paid by the end of the
following January.                                        

For federal income tax purposes, income and capital gains 
 distributions are generally taxable. However, dividends and
   distributions received by retirement plans qualifying for tax
   exemption under federal income tax laws generally will not be
taxable.                                                  

         YOU CAN CHOOSE HOW TO RECEIVE YOUR DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS. You
         can have them all automatically reinvested in fund shares (at NAV),
       all deposited directly to your bank account or all sent to you by
        check, have one type reinvested and the other sent to you by check
        or have them invested in a different fund. Tell us your preference
   on your application. If you don't indicate a preference, your
         dividends and distributions will all be reinvested in shares of the
    fund without a sales charge (if applicable). Distributions are
          treated the same for federal income tax purposes whether you receive
them in cash or reinvest them in additional shares. For   
employer-sponsored qualified plans, and retirement plans, 
reinvestment (at NAV) is the only option.                 

         BUYING, SELLING OR EXCHANGING FUND SHARES WILL USUALLY HAVE FEDERAL
   INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES FOR YOU (except in employer-sponsored
        qualified plans, IRAs or other tax-advantaged accounts). Your sale
of shares may result in a capital                         

THE FOLLOWING SIDEBAR TEXT APPEARS NEXT TO THE PRECEDING PARAGRAPHS             

Because each shareholder's tax situation is unique, ask your tax professional   
about the tax consequences of your investments, including any state and local   
tax consequences.

    gain or loss. The gain or loss will be long-term or short-term
    depending on how long you owned the shares that were sold. For
       federal income tax purposes, an exchange is treated the same as a
sale.                                                     

Each fund intends to distribute tax-exempt interest as    
         exempt-interest dividends, which are excluded from gross income for
regular federal income tax purposes, but may be subject to
     alternative minimum tax and state and local income taxes. Their
   distributions from other sources, if any, would be taxable as
described above.                                          

Dividends from each fund are generally tax-free for most  
          shareholders, meaning that investors who are individuals can receive
       them without incurring federal and (for some investors) state and
      local income tax liability. However, there are a few exceptions:

       -  a portion of a fund's dividends may be taxable if it came from
investments in taxable securities                   

       -  because a fund (except DWS Intermediate Tax/AMT Free Fund) can
        invest up to 20% of net assets in securities whose income is
             subject to the federal alternative minimum tax (AMT), you may owe
       taxes on a portion of your dividends if you are among those
investors who must pay AMT                          

-  capital gains distributions may be taxable             

        THE FEDERAL INCOME TAX STATUS of a fund's earnings you receive and
your own fund transactions generally depend on their type:

   ANY DIRECT INVESTMENTS IN FOREIGN SECURITIES BY A FUND MAY BE
        SUBJECT TO FOREIGN WITHHOLDING TAXES. In that case, a fund's yield
    on those securities would generally be decreased. Shareholders
        generally will not be entitled to claim a credit or deduction with
 respect to foreign taxes paid by the fund. In addition, any
          investments in foreign securities or foreign currencies may increase
          or accelerate a fund's recognition of ordinary income and may affect
          the timing or amount of the fund's distributions. If you invest in a
    fund through a taxable account, your after-tax return could be
negatively impacted.                                      

      To the extent that a fund invests in certain debt obligations or
   certain other securities, investments in these obligations or
          securities may cause a fund to recognize taxable income in excess of
   the cash generated by such obligations. Thus, a fund could be
          required at times to liquidate other investments in order to satisfy
its distribution requirements.                            

          For taxable years beginning before January 1, 2011, distributions to
          individuals and other noncorporate shareholders of investment income
        designated by a fund as derived from qualified dividend income are
       eligible for taxation for federal income tax purposes at the more
       favorable long-term capital gain rates. Qualified dividend income
 generally includes dividends from domestic and some foreign
       corporations. It does not include income from investments in debt
         securities or, generally, from REITs. In addition, a fund must meet
       certain holding period and other requirements with respect to the
      dividend-paying stocks in its portfolio and the shareholder must
          meet certain holding period and other requirements with respect to a
      fund's shares for the lower tax rates to apply. The funds do not
       expect a significant portion of their distributions to be derived
from qualified dividend income.                           

     For taxable years beginning before January 1, 2011, the maximum
federal income tax rate imposed on long-term capital gains
       recognized by individuals and other noncorporate shareholders has
     been reduced to 15%. For more information, see the Statement of
Additional Information, under "Taxes."
     YOUR FUND WILL SEND YOU DETAILED FEDERAL INCOME TAX INFORMATION
         EVERY JANUARY. These statements tell you the amount and the federal
     income tax classification of any dividends or distributions you
          received. They also have certain details on your purchases and sales
of shares.

          IF YOU INVEST RIGHT BEFORE A FUND PAYS A DIVIDEND, you'll be getting
       some of your investment back as a taxable dividend. You can avoid
this by investing after a fund declares a dividend. In    
       tax-advantaged retirement accounts you do not need to worry about
this.                                                     

     CORPORATIONS are taxed at the same rates on ordinary income and
 capital gains, but may be eligible for a dividends-received
         deduction for a portion of the income dividends they receive from a
      fund, provided certain holding period and other requirements are
met.                                                      

   The above discussion is applicable to shareholders who are US
      persons. If you are a non-US person, please consult your own tax
  advisor with respect to the US tax consequences to you of an
investment in a fund.

Hypothetical Expense Summary                              

         Using the annual fund operating expense ratios presented in the fee
     tables in the fund prospectus, the Hypothetical Expense Summary
          shows the estimated fees and expenses, in actual dollars, that would
         be charged on a hypothetical investment of $10,000 in the fund held
       for the next 10 years and the impact of such fees and expenses on
       fund returns for each year and cumulatively, assuming a 5% return
  for each year. The tables also assume that all dividends and
        distributions are reinvested. The annual fund expense ratios shown
          are net of any contractual fee waivers or expense reimbursements, if
          any, for the period of the contractual commitment. The tables do not
reflect redemption fees, if any, which may be payable upon
  redemption. If redemption fees were shown, the "Hypothetical
      Year-End Balance After Fees and Expenses" amounts shown would be
     lower and the "Annual Fees and Expenses" amounts shown would be
         higher. Also, please note that if you are investing through a third
       party provider, that provider may have fees and expenses separate
          from those of the fund that are not reflected here. Mutual fund fees
        and expenses fluctuate over time and actual expenses may be higher
or lower than those shown.                                

         The Hypothetical Expense Summary should not be used or construed as
an offer to sell, a solicitation of an offer to buy or a  
    recommendation or endorsement of any specific mutual fund. You
   should carefully review the fund's prospectus to consider the
          investment objectives, risks, expenses and charges of the fund prior
to investing.                                             

                                                                  Appendix  | 59

THE FUND'S MAIN INVESTMENT STRATEGY 

    The fund seeks to provide a high level of income exempt from
regular federal income tax.                             

        Under normal circumstances, the fund invests at least 80% of net
       assets in securities issued by municipalities across the United
        States and in other securities whose income is free from regular
          federal income tax. The fund may invest up to 20% of net assets in
     securities whose income is subject to the federal alternative
minimum tax (AMT).                                      

  The fund can buy many types of municipal securities of all
        maturities. These may include revenue bonds (which are backed by
       revenues from a particular source) and general obligation bonds
           (which are typically backed by the issuer's ability to levy taxes).
         They may also include municipal lease obligations and investments
representing an interest therein.                       

           CREDIT QUALITY POLICIES. This fund normally invests at least 50% of
      total assets in municipal securities of the top four grades of
       credit quality. The fund could put up to 50% of total assets in
      high yield bonds (commonly referred to as "junk" bonds) of the
         fifth and sixth credit grades (i.e., as low as grade B). Compared
          to investment-grade bonds, junk bonds generally pay higher yields,
        have higher volatility and higher risk of default on payments of
interest or principal.                                  

           The portfolio managers look for securities that appear to offer the
 best total return potential. In making their buy and sell
           decisions, the managers typically weigh a number of factors against
     each other, from economic outlooks and possible interest rate
    movements to characteristics of specific securities, such as
      coupon, maturity date and call date, and changes in supply and
demand within the municipal bond market.

P-->497145th Page of 358TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 145th
          Although the managers may adjust the fund's duration (a measure of
         sensitivity to interest rates) over a wider range, they generally
          intend to keep it similar to that of the Lehman Brothers Municipal
Bond Index, generally between five and nine years.      

         In addition, they may use various types of derivative instruments
   (instruments whose value is based on, for example, indices,
      commodities or securities), for hedging purposes or to enhance
      return. Such instruments may include inverse floaters, futures
 contracts, interest rate swaps and other over-the-counter
derivatives.                                            

THE MAIN RISKS OF INVESTING IN THE FUND                 

 There are several risk factors that could hurt the fund's
performance, cause you to lose money or cause the fund's
performance to trail that of other investments.         

            INTEREST RATE RISK. Generally, fixed income securities will decrease
            in value when interest rates rise. The longer the effective maturity
           of the fund's securities, the more sensitive it will be to interest
           rate changes. (As a general rule, a 1% rise in interest rates means
         a 1% fall in value for every year of duration.) As interest rates
      decline, the issuers of securities held by the fund may prepay
         principal earlier than scheduled, forcing the fund to reinvest in
      lower-yielding securities and may reduce the fund's income. As
            interest rates increase, slower than expected principal payments may
          extend the average life of fixed income securities. This will have
         the effect of locking in a below-market interest rate, increasing
      the fund's duration and reducing the value of such a security.

    CREDIT RISK. A fund purchasing bonds faces the risk that the
           creditworthiness of an issuer may decline, causing the value of its
        bonds to decline. In addition, an issuer may not be able to make
         timely payments on the interest and principal on the bonds it has
            issued. Because the issuers of high-yield bonds or junk bonds (rated
        below the fourth highest category) may be in uncertain financial
       health, the prices of their bonds can be more vulnerable to bad
economic news or even the expectation of bad news, than 
  investment-grade bonds. In some cases, bonds, particularly
high-yield bonds, may                                   

THE FOLLOWING SIDEBAR TEXT APPEARS NEXT TO THE PRECEDING PARAGRAPHS             

This  fund is  designed  for  investors  who are  looking  for a  tax-advantaged
investment  and are  willing  to  accept  risk to  their  principal  and who are
interested in the potential for high current income.

          decline in credit quality or go into default. Because the fund may
         invest in securities not paying current interest or in securities
already in default, these risks may be more pronounced. 

   FOCUSED INVESTING RISK. The fact that the fund may focus on
  investments from a single state or sector of the municipal
       securities market increases risk, because factors affecting the
          state or region, such as economic or fiscal problems, could affect
         a large portion of the fund's securities in a similar manner. For
 example, a state's technology or biotech industries could
         experience a downturn or fail to develop as expected, hurting the
         local economy. States that face severe fiscal difficulties due to
        an economic downturn, could experience increased expenditures on
       domestic security and reduced monetary support from the federal
          government. Over time, these issues may have the ability to impair
a state's ability to repay its obligations.             

          MARKET RISK. Deteriorating market conditions might cause a general
           weakness in the market that reduces the overall level of securities
          prices in that market. Developments in a particular class of bonds
   or the stock market could also adversely affect the fund by
       reducing the relative attractiveness of bonds as an investment.
         Also, to the extent that the fund emphasizes bonds from any given
     industry, it could be hurt if that industry does not do well.

       DERIVATIVES RISK. Risks associated with derivatives include the
          risk that the derivative is not well correlated with the security,
        index or currency to which it relates; the risk that derivatives
     may not have the intended effects and may result in losses or
           missed opportunities; the risk that the fund will be unable to sell
        the derivative because of an illiquid secondary market; the risk
          that a counterparty is unwilling or unable to meet its obligation;
          and the risk that the derivative transaction could expose the fund
   to the effects of leverage, which could increase the fund's
        exposure to the market and magnify potential losses. There is no
         guarantee that derivatives, to the extent employed, will have the
        intended effect, and their use could cause lower returns or even
       losses to the fund. The use of derivatives by the fund to hedge
           risk may reduce the opportunity for gain by offsetting the positive
effect of favorable price movements.

Other factors that could affect performance include:    

 -  portfolio management could be wrong in the analysis of
  industries, companies, economic trends, the relative
     attractiveness of different securities or other matters

     -  political or legal actions could change the way the fund's
dividends are treated for tax purposes            

       -  at times, market conditions might make it hard to value some
 investments or to get an attractive price for them.

THE FUND'S PERFORMANCE HISTORY                                                  

While a fund's past performance (before and after taxes) isn't necessarily a    
sign of how it will do in the future, it can be valuable for an investor to     
know.                                                                           

The bar chart shows how the performance of the fund's Class S shares has varied 
from year to year, which may give some idea of risk. The table on the following 
page shows how fund performance compares to relevant index information (which,  
unlike the fund performance, does not reflect fees or expenses). The            
performance of both the fund and the index information varies over time. All    
figures assume reinvestment of dividends and distributions (in the case of      
after-tax returns, reinvested net of assumed tax rates).                        

The table shows returns for Class S shares on a before-tax and after-tax basis. 
After-tax returns are estimates calculated using the historical highest         
individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of   
state and local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on an investor's tax     
situation and may differ from those shown in the table. After-tax returns shown 
are not relevant for investors who hold their shares through tax-deferred       
arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts.

This fund's Class S shares have no sales charge or other shareholder fees other 
than a short-term redemption/exchange fee. This information doesn't include any 
fees that may be charged by your financial advisor. The fund does have annual   
operating expenses and as a shareholder of Class S shares, you pay them         
indirectly.

    "Policies You Should Know About - Policies about transactions" for further
information.                                                          

2    Includes 0.10% administration fee.                                         

3    Interest expense relates to the fund's liability with respect to floating  
rate notes held by third parties in conjunction with inverse floater  
securities transactions. However, the accounting treatment for such   
   transactions includes an offsetting interest income item, and accordingly
  has no impact to net investment income, total return or net asset value.

4    Through September 30, 2008, the Advisor has contractually agreed to waive  
all or a portion of its management fee and reimburse or pay operating 
   expenses of the fund to the extent necessary to maintain the fund's total
  operating annual expenses at 0.68% for Class S shares, excluding certain
 expenses such as extraordinary expenses, taxes, brokerage, interest and
organizational and offering expenses.                                 

Based on the costs above (including one year of capped expenses in each         
period), this example helps you compare this fund's expenses to those of other  
mutual funds. This example assumes the expenses above remain the same. It also  
assumes that you invested $10,000, earned 5% annual returns, reinvested all     
dividends and distributions and sold your shares at the end of each period.     
This is only an example; actual expenses will be different.

THE FUND'S MAIN INVESTMENT STRATEGY 

    The fund seeks to provide income exempt from regular federal
income tax.                                             

        Under normal circumstances, the fund invests at least 80% of net
          assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes,
           in securities issued by municipalities across the United States and
     in other securities whose income is free from regular federal
  income tax. The fund may invest up to 20% of net assets in
     securities whose income is subject to the federal alternative
minimum tax (AMT).                                      

  The fund can buy many types of municipal securities of all
        maturities. These may include revenue bonds (which are backed by
       revenues from a particular source) and general obligation bonds
           (which are typically backed by the issuer's ability to levy taxes).
         They may also include municipal lease obligations and investments
representing an interest therein.                       

           CREDIT QUALITY POLICIES. This fund normally invests at least 65% of
       total assets in municipal securities of the top three grades of
       credit quality. The fund could put up to 10% of total assets in
      high yield bonds (commonly referred to as "junk" bonds) of the
         fifth and sixth credit grades (i.e., as low as grade B). Compared
          to investment-grade bonds, junk bonds generally pay higher yields,
        have higher volatility and higher risk of default on payments of
interest or principal.                                  

           The portfolio managers look for securities that appear to offer the
 best total return potential. In making their buy and sell
           decisions, the managers typically weigh a number of factors against
     each other, from economic outlooks and possible interest rate
    movements to characteristics of specific securities, such as
      coupon, maturity date and call date, and changes in supply and
demand within the municipal bond market.

P-->497153rd Page of 358TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 153rd
          Although the managers may adjust the fund's duration (a measure of
         sensitivity to interest rates) over a wider range, they generally
          intend to keep it similar to that of the Lehman Brothers Municipal
Bond Index, generally between five and nine years.      

         In addition, they may use various types of derivative instruments
   (instruments whose value is based on, for example, indices,
      commodities or securities), for hedging purposes or to enhance
      return. Such instruments may include inverse floaters, futures
 contracts, interest rate swaps and other over-the-counter
derivatives.                                            

THE MAIN RISKS OF INVESTING IN THE FUND                 

 There are several risk factors that could hurt the fund's
performance, cause you to lose money or cause the fund's
performance to trail that of other investments.         

   INTEREST RATE RISK. Generally, fixed income securities will
  decrease in value when interest rates rise. The longer the
          effective maturity of the fund's securities, the more sensitive it
          will be to interest rate changes. (As a general rule, a 1% rise in
 interest rates means a 1% fall in value for every year of
       duration.) As interest rates decline, the issuers of securities
     held by the fund may prepay principal earlier than scheduled,
         forcing the fund to reinvest in lower-yielding securities and may
         reduce the fund's income. As interest rates increase, slower than
        expected principal payments may extend the average life of fixed
    income securities. This will have the effect of locking in a
      below-market interest rate, increasing the fund's duration and
reducing the value of such a security.                  

    CREDIT RISK. A fund purchasing bonds faces the risk that the
           creditworthiness of an issuer may decline, causing the value of its
        bonds to decline. In addition, an issuer may not be able to make
         timely payments on the interest and principal on the bonds it has
            issued. Because the issuers of high-yield bonds or junk bonds (rated
        below the fourth highest category) may be in uncertain financial
       health, the prices of their bonds can be more vulnerable to bad
economic news or even the expectation of bad news, than 
  investment-grade bonds. In some cases, bonds, particularly
high-yield bonds, may                                   

THE FOLLOWING SIDEBAR TEXT APPEARS NEXT TO THE PRECEDING PARAGRAPHS             

This fund is designed for investors who are looking for a tax-advantaged        
investment and are interested in current income.

          decline in credit quality or go into default. Because the fund may
         invest in securities not paying current interest or in securities
already in default, these risks may be more pronounced. 

   FOCUSED INVESTING RISK. The fact that the fund may focus on
  investments from a single state or sector of the municipal
       securities market increases risk, because factors affecting the
          state or region, such as economic or fiscal problems, could affect
         a large portion of the fund's securities in a similar manner. For
 example, a state's technology or biotech industries could
         experience a downturn or fail to develop as expected, hurting the
         local economy. States that face severe fiscal difficulties due to
        an economic downturn, could experience increased expenditures on
       domestic security and reduced monetary support from the federal
          government. Over time, these issues may have the ability to impair
a state's ability to repay its obligations.             

          MARKET RISK. Deteriorating market conditions might cause a general
           weakness in the market that reduces the overall level of securities
          prices in that market. Developments in a particular class of bonds
   or the stock market could also adversely affect the fund by
       reducing the relative attractiveness of bonds as an investment.
         Also, to the extent that the fund emphasizes bonds from any given
     industry, it could be hurt if that industry does not do well.

       DERIVATIVES RISK. Risks associated with derivatives include the
          risk that the derivative is not well correlated with the security,
        index or currency to which it relates; the risk that derivatives
     may not have the intended effects and may result in losses or
           missed opportunities; the risk that the fund will be unable to sell
        the derivative because of an illiquid secondary market; the risk
          that a counterparty is unwilling or unable to meet its obligation;
          and the risk that the derivative transaction could expose the fund
   to the effects of leverage, which could increase the fund's
        exposure to the market and magnify potential losses. There is no
         guarantee that derivatives, to the extent employed, will have the
        intended effect, and their use could cause lower returns or even
       losses to the fund. The use of derivatives by the fund to hedge
           risk may reduce the opportunity for gain by offsetting the positive
effect of favorable price movements.

Other factors that could affect performance include:    

 -  portfolio management could be wrong in the analysis of
  industries, companies, economic trends, the relative
     attractiveness of different securities or other matters

     -  political or legal actions could change the way the fund's
dividends are treated for tax purposes            

       -  at times, market conditions might make it hard to value some
 investments or to get an attractive price for them.

THE FUND'S PERFORMANCE HISTORY                                                  

While a fund's past performance (before and after taxes) isn't necessarily a    
sign of how it will do in the future, it can be valuable for an investor to     
know.                                                                           

The bar chart shows how the performance of the fund's Class S shares has varied 
from year to year, which may give some idea of risk. The table on the following 
page shows how fund performance compares to relevant index information (which,  
unlike the fund performance, does not reflect fees or expenses). The            
performance of both the fund and the index information varies over time. All    
figures assume reinvestment of dividends and distributions (in the case of      
after-tax returns, reinvested net of assumed tax rates).                        

The table shows returns for Class S shares on a before-tax and after-tax basis. 
After-tax returns are estimates calculated using the historical highest         
individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of   
state and local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on an investor's tax     
situation and may differ from those shown in the table. After-tax returns shown 
are not relevant for investors who hold their shares through tax-deferred       
arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts.

The RETURN AFTER TAXES ON DISTRIBUTIONS assumes that an investor holds fund     
shares at the end of the period. The number represents only the fund's taxable  
distributions and not a shareholder's gain or loss from selling fund shares.    

The RETURN AFTER TAXES ON DISTRIBUTIONS AND SALE OF FUND SHARES assumes that an 
investor sold his or her fund shares at the end of the period. The number       
reflects both the fund's taxable distributions and a shareholder's gain or loss 
from selling fund shares.

This fund's Class S shares have no sales charge or other shareholder fees other 
than a short-term redemption/exchange fee. This information doesn't include any 
fees that may be charged by your financial advisor. The fund does have annual   
operating expenses and as a shareholder of Class S shares, you pay them         
indirectly.

1     This fee is charged on applicable redemptions or exchanges. Please see    
      "Policies You Should Know About - Policies about transactions" for further
information.                                                        

2     Includes 0.10% administration fee.                                        

3     Interest expense relates to the fund's liability with respect to floating 
rate notes held by third parties in conjunction with inverse floater
securities transactions. However, the accounting treatment for such 
     transactions includes an offsetting interest income item, and accordingly
    has no impact to net investment income, total return or net asset value.

4     Through September 30, 2008, the Advisor has contractually agreed to waive 
 all or a portion of its management fee and reimburse or pay operating
     expenses of the fund to the extent necessary to maintain the fund's total
    annual operating expenses at 0.52% for Class S shares, excluding certain
   expenses such as extraordinary expenses, taxes, brokerage, interest and
organizational and offering expenses.                               

Based on the costs above (including one year of capped expenses in each         
period), this example helps you compare this fund's expenses to those of other  
mutual funds. This example assumes the expenses above remain the same. It also  
assumes that you invested $10,000, earned 5% annual returns, reinvested all     
dividends and distributions and sold your shares at the end of each period.     
This is only an example; actual expenses will be different.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


THE FUND'S MAIN INVESTMENT STRATEGY 

    The fund seeks to provide a high level of income exempt from
 regular federal income taxes and seeks to limit principal
fluctuation.                                            

        Under normal circumstances, the fund invests at least 80% of net
          assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes,
           in securities issued by municipalities across the United States and
     in other securities whose income is free from regular federal
       income tax and alternative minimum tax (AMT). The fund does not
      intend to invest in securities whose income is subject to AMT.

  The fund can buy many types of municipal securities of all
        maturities. These may include revenue bonds (which are backed by
       revenues from a particular source) and general obligation bonds
           (which are typically backed by the issuer's ability to levy taxes).
         They may also include municipal lease obligations and investments
representing an interest therein.                       

           CREDIT QUALITY POLICIES. This fund normally invests at least 65% of
       total assets in municipal securities of the top three grades of
           credit quality. The fund could put up to 35% of net assets in bonds
   rated in the fourth credit grade, which is still considered
investment-grade.                                       

           The portfolio managers look for securities that appear to offer the
 best total return potential. In making their buy and sell
           decisions, the managers typically weigh a number of factors against
     each other, from economic outlooks and possible interest rate
    movements to characteristics of specific securities, such as
      coupon, maturity date and call date, and changes in supply and
demand within the municipal bond market.                

   Although the managers may adjust the maturity of the fund's
       portfolio between three and ten years, they generally intend to
keep it between five and ten years.

         In addition, they may use various types of derivative instruments
   (instruments whose value is based on, for example, indices,
      commodities or securities), for hedging purposes or to enhance
      return. Such instruments may include inverse floaters, futures
 contracts, interest rate swaps and other over-the-counter
derivatives.                                            

THE MAIN RISKS OF INVESTING IN THE FUND                 

 There are several risk factors that could hurt the fund's
performance, cause you to lose money or cause the fund's
performance to trail that of other investments.         

   INTEREST RATE RISK. Generally, fixed income securities will
  decrease in value when interest rates rise. The longer the
          effective maturity of the fund's securities, the more sensitive it
          will be to interest rate changes. (As a general rule, a 1% rise in
 interest rates means a 1% fall in value for every year of
       duration.) As interest rates decline, the issuers of securities
     held by the fund may prepay principal earlier than scheduled,
         forcing the fund to reinvest in lower-yielding securities and may
         reduce the fund's income. As interest rates increase, slower than
        expected principal payments may extend the average life of fixed
    income securities. This will have the effect of locking in a
      below-market interest rate, increasing the fund's duration and
reducing the value of such a security.                  

    CREDIT RISK. A fund purchasing bonds faces the risk that the
           creditworthiness of an issuer may decline, causing the value of its
        bonds to decline. In addition, an issuer may not be able to make
         timely payments on the interest and principal on the bonds it has
            issued. Because the issuers of high-yield bonds or junk bonds (rated
        below the fourth highest category) may be in uncertain financial
       health, the prices of their bonds can be more vulnerable to bad
economic news or even the expectation of bad news, than 
  investment-grade bonds. In some cases, bonds, particularly
           high-yield bonds, may decline in credit quality or go into default.
    Because the fund may invest in securities not paying current
        interest or in securities already in default, these risks may be
more pronounced.                                        

THE FOLLOWING SIDEBAR TEXT APPEARS NEXT TO THE PRECEDING PARAGRAPHS             

This fund is designed for investors who are looking for a tax-advantaged        
investment, are interested in higher yield and can accept moderate risk to their
principal.

P-->497162nd Page of 358TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 162nd
   FOCUSED INVESTING RISK. The fact that the fund may focus on
  investments from a single state or sector of the municipal
       securities market increases risk, because factors affecting the
          state or region, such as economic or fiscal problems, could affect
         a large portion of the fund's securities in a similar manner. For
 example, a state's technology or biotech industries could
         experience a downturn or fail to develop as expected, hurting the
         local economy. States that face severe fiscal difficulties due to
        an economic downturn, could experience increased expenditures on
       domestic security and reduced monetary support from the federal
          government. Over time, these issues may have the ability to impair
a state's ability to repay its obligations.             

          MARKET RISK. Deteriorating market conditions might cause a general
           weakness in the market that reduces the overall level of securities
          prices in that market. Developments in a particular class of bonds
   or the stock market could also adversely affect the fund by
       reducing the relative attractiveness of bonds as an investment.
         Also, to the extent that the fund emphasizes bonds from any given
     industry, it could be hurt if that industry does not do well.

       DERIVATIVES RISK. Risks associated with derivatives include the
          risk that the derivative is not well correlated with the security,
        index or currency to which it relates; the risk that derivatives
     may not have the intended effects and may result in losses or
           missed opportunities; the risk that the fund will be unable to sell
        the derivative because of an illiquid secondary market; the risk
          that a counterparty is unwilling or unable to meet its obligation;
          and the risk that the derivative transaction could expose the fund
   to the effects of leverage, which could increase the fund's
        exposure to the market and magnify potential losses. There is no
         guarantee that derivatives, to the extent employed, will have the
        intended effect, and their use could cause lower returns or even
       losses to the fund. The use of derivatives by the fund to hedge
           risk may reduce the opportunity for gain by offsetting the positive
effect of favorable price movements.

Other factors that could affect performance include:    

 -  portfolio management could be wrong in the analysis of
  industries, companies, economic trends, the relative
     attractiveness of different securities or other matters

     -  political or legal actions could change the way the fund's
dividends are treated for tax purposes            

       -  at times, market conditions might make it hard to value some
 investments or to get an attractive price for them.

THE FUND'S PERFORMANCE HISTORY                                                  

While a fund's past performance (before and after taxes) isn't necessarily a    
sign of how it will do in the future, it can be valuable for an investor to     
know.                                                                           

The bar chart shows how the performance of the fund's Class S shares has varied 
from year to year, which may give some idea of risk. The table on the following 
page shows how fund performance compares to relevant index information (which,  
unlike the fund performance, does not reflect fees or expenses). The            
performance of both the fund and the index information varies over time. All    
figures assume reinvestment of dividends and distributions (in the case of      
after-tax returns, reinvested net of assumed tax rates).                        

The table shows returns for Class S shares on a before-tax and after-tax basis. 
After-tax returns are estimates calculated using the historical highest         
individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of   
state and local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on an investor's tax     
situation and may differ from those shown in the table. After-tax returns shown 
are not relevant for investors who hold their shares through tax-deferred       
arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts.

The RETURN AFTER TAXES ON DISTRIBUTIONS assumes that an investor holds fund     
shares at the end of the period. The number represents only the fund's taxable  
distributions and not a shareholder's gain or loss from selling fund shares.    

The RETURN AFTER TAXES ON DISTRIBUTIONS AND SALE OF FUND SHARES assumes that an 
investor sold his or her fund shares at the end of the period. The number       
reflects both the fund's taxable distributions and a shareholder's gain or loss 
from selling fund shares.

the same. It also assumes that you invested $10,000, earned 5% annual returns,  
reinvested all dividends and distributions and sold your shares at the end of   
each period. This is only an example; actual expenses will be different.

OTHER POLICIES AND RISKS                                                        

      While the previous pages describe the main points of each fund's
     strategy and risks, there are a few other issues to know about:

        -  Although major changes tend to be infrequent, each fund's Board
      could change a fund's investment objective without seeking
           shareholder approval. However, the policy of investing at least
    80% of net assets (plus the amount of any borrowings for
         investment purposes in the case of DWS Managed Municipal Bond
     Fund and DWS Intermediate Tax/AMT Free Fund) in municipal
         securities exempt from regular federal income tax (and in the
       case of DWS Intermediate Tax/AMT Free Fund, the alternative
            minimum tax) for each fund cannot be changed without shareholder
approval.                                           

          -  As a temporary defensive measure, each fund could shift up to 20%
             and DWS High Yield Tax Free Fund could shift up to 100% of assets
             into investments such as taxable money market securities or other
            short-term securities that offer comparable levels of risk. This
             could prevent losses, but, while engaged in a temporary defensive
      position, a fund will not be pursuing its investment goal.
     However, portfolio management may choose not to use these
   strategies for various reasons, even in volatile market
conditions. Temporary investments may be taxable.   

         -  Portfolio management measures credit quality at the time it buys
         securities, using independent rating agencies or, for unrated
          securities, a judgment by portfolio management. All securities
       must meet the credit quality standards applied by portfolio
         management. If a security's credit quality changes, portfolio
             management will decide what to do with the security, based on its
assessment of what would benefit shareholders most. 

For more information                                      

    This prospectus doesn't tell you about every policy or risk of
investing in each fund.                                   

          If you want more information on each fund's allowable securities and
         investment practices and the characteristics and risks of each one,
   you may want to request a copy of the Statement of Additional
Information (the back cover tells you how to do this).

          Keep in mind that there is no assurance that a fund will achieve its
goal.                                                     

       A complete list of each fund's portfolio holdings is posted as of
        the month-end on www.dws-scudder.com (the Web site does not form a
        part of this prospectus) on or after the last day of the following
          month. This posted information generally remains accessible at least
         until the date on which a fund files its Form N-CSR or N-Q with the
         Securities and Exchange Commission for the period that includes the
     date as of which the posted information is current. Each fund's
     Statement of Additional Information includes a description of a
        fund's policies and procedures with respect to the disclosure of a
fund's portfolio holdings.

      Effective October 1, 2007, DWS High Yield Tax Free Fund pays the
         Advisor under the investment management agreement a fee, calculated
        daily and paid monthly, at the annual rate of 0.565% of the fund's

     million, 0.490% of the next $500 million and 0.470% thereafter.

       A discussion regarding the basis for the Board's approval of each
fund's investment management agreement is contained in the
       shareholder reports for the semi-annual period ended November 30,
2006 (see "Shareholder reports" on the back cover).       

          Under a separate administrative services agreement between each fund
       and the Advisor, each fund pays the Advisor for providing most of
each fund's administrative services.

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS                                                            

The financial highlights are designed to help you understand recent financial   
performance. The figures in the first part of each table are for a single       
share. The total return figures represent the percentage that an investor in a  
fund would have earned (or lost), assuming all dividends and distributions were 
reinvested. This information has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP,    
independent registered public accounting firm, whose report, along with each    
fund's financial statements, is included in each fund's annual report (see      
"Shareholder reports" on the back cover).

HOW TO INVEST IN THE FUNDS                                                      

The following pages tell you how to invest in a fund and what to expect as a    
shareholder. If you're investing directly with DWS Scudder, all of this         
information applies to you.                                                     

The following pages also tell you about many of the services, choices and       
benefits of being a shareholder. You'll also find information on how to check   
the status of your account using the method that's most convenient for you.     

If you're investing through a "third party provider" - for example, a workplace 
retirement plan, financial supermarket or financial advisor - your provider may 
have its own policies or instructions and you should follow those.              

Please remember, CLASS S shares are generally only available to new investors   
through fee-based programs of investment dealers that have special agreements   
with the fund's distributor, through certain group retirement plans and through 
certain registered investment advisors. These dealers and advisors typically    
charge ongoing fees for services they provide.                                  

You can find out more about the topics covered here by speaking with your       
FINANCIAL ADVISOR OR A REPRESENTATIVE OF YOUR WORKPLACE RETIREMENT PLAN OR      
OTHER INVESTMENT PROVIDER.

Financial intermediary support payments                   

     The Advisor, DWS Scudder Distributors, Inc. (the "Distributor")
     and/or their affiliates may pay additional compensation, out of
       their own assets and not as an additional charge to each fund, to
          selected affiliated and unaffiliated brokers, dealers, participating
       insurance companies or other financial intermediaries ("financial
        advisors") in connection with the sale and/or distribution of fund
         shares or the retention and/or servicing of fund investors and fund
      shares ("revenue sharing"). Such revenue sharing payments are in
         addition to any distribution or service fees payable under any Rule
         12b-1 or service plan of each fund, any record keeping/sub-transfer
        agency/networking fees payable by each fund (generally through the
    Distributor or an affiliate) and/or the Distributor to certain
   financial advisors for performing such services and any sales
        charges, commissions, non-cash compensation arrangements expressly
       permitted under applicable rules of the NASD or other concessions
       described in the fee table or elsewhere in this prospectus or the
     Statement of Additional Information as payable to all financial
      advisors. For example, the Advisor, the Distributor and/or their
       affiliates may compensate financial advisors for providing a fund
    with "shelf space" or access to a third party platform or fund
  offering list or other marketing programs including, without
         limitation, inclusion of the fund on preferred or recommended sales
       lists, mutual fund "supermarket" platforms and other formal sales
          programs; granting the Distributor access to the financial advisor's
   sales force; granting the Distributor access to the financial
    advisor's conferences and meetings; assistance in training and
      educating the financial advisor's personnel; and obtaining other
forms of marketing support.                               

          The level of revenue sharing payments made to financial advisors may
        be a fixed fee or based upon one or more of the following factors:
        gross sales, current assets and/or number of accounts of each fund
        attributable to the financial advisor, the particular fund or fund
         type or other measures as agreed to by the Advisor, the Distributor
and/or their affiliates and the financial advisors or any 
          combination thereof. The amount of these revenue sharing payments is
         determined at the discretion of the Advisor, the Distributor and/or
        their affiliates from time to time, may be substantial, and may be
       different for different financial advisors based on, for example,
   the nature of the services provided by the financial advisor.

         The Advisor, the Distributor and/or their affiliates currently make
       revenue sharing payments from their own assets in connection with
      the sale and/or distribution of DWS Fund shares or the retention
    and/or servicing of investors and DWS Fund shares to financial
      advisors in amounts that generally range from .01% up to .50% of
  assets of each fund serviced and maintained by the financial
     advisor, .10% to .25% of sales of each fund attributable to the
     financial advisor, a flat fee of $12,500 up to $500,000, or any
     combination thereof. These amounts are subject to change at the
         discretion of the Advisor, the Distributor and/or their affiliates.
Receipt of, or the prospect of receiving, this additional 
        compensation may influence your financial advisor's recommendation
     of each fund or of any particular share class of each fund. You
    should review your financial advisor's compensation disclosure
         and/or talk to your financial advisor to obtain more information on
        how this compensation may have influenced your financial advisor's
         recommendation of each fund. Additional information regarding these
      revenue sharing payments is included in each fund's Statement of
        Additional Information, which is available to you on request at no
        charge (see the back cover of this prospectus for more information
on how to request a copy of the Statement of Additional   
Information).                                             

        The Advisor, the Distributor and/or their affiliates may also make
         such revenue sharing payments to financial advisors under the terms
     discussed above in connection with the distribution of both DWS
       funds and non-DWS funds by financial advisors to retirement plans
   that obtain record keeping services from ADP, Inc. on the DWS
        Scudder branded retirement plan platform (the "Platform") with the
          level of revenue sharing payments being based upon sales of both the
     DWS funds and the non-DWS funds by the financial advisor on the
      Platform or current assets of both the DWS funds and the non-DWS
   funds serviced and maintained by the financial advisor on the
Platform.                                                 

          It is likely that broker-dealers that execute portfolio transactions
       for each fund will include firms that also sell shares of the DWS
      funds to their customers. However, the Advisor will not consider
sales of DWS fund shares as a factor in the selection of  
         broker-dealers to execute portfolio transactions for the DWS funds.
      Accordingly, the Advisor has implemented policies and procedures
          reasonably designed to prevent its traders from considering sales of
DWS fund shares as a factor in the selection of

        broker-dealers to execute portfolio transactions for each fund. In
         addition, the Advisor, the Distributor and/or their affiliates will
   not use fund brokerage to pay for their obligation to provide
       additional compensation to financial advisors as described above.

POLICIES YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT 

     Along with the instructions on the previous pages, the policies
      below may affect you as a shareholder. Some of this information,
    such as the section on distributions and taxes, applies to all
       investors, including those investing through a financial advisor.

   If you are investing through a financial advisor or through a
       retirement plan, check the materials you received from them about
         how to buy and sell shares because particular financial advisors or
        other intermediaries may adopt policies, procedures or limitations
          that are separate from those described by a fund. Please note that a
        financial advisor may charge fees separate from those charged by a
fund and may be compensated by a fund.                    

          Keep in mind that the information in this prospectus applies only to
     the shares offered herein. Other share classes are described in
     separate prospectuses and have different fees, requirements and
services.                                                 

          In order to reduce the amount of mail you receive and to help reduce
         expenses, we generally send a single copy of any shareholder report
         and prospectus to each household. If you do not want the mailing of
         these documents to be combined with those for other members of your
    household, please contact your financial advisor or call (800)
728-3337.                                                 

Policies about transactions                               

         EACH FUND IS OPEN FOR BUSINESS each day the New York Stock Exchange
        is open. Each fund calculates its share price for each class every
      business day, as of the close of regular trading on the New York
     Stock Exchange (typically 4:00 p.m. Eastern time, but sometimes
          earlier, as in the case of scheduled half-day trading or unscheduled
    suspensions of trading). You can place an order to buy or sell
shares at any time.

     To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money
laundering activities, federal law requires all financial 
institutions to obtain, verify and record information that
          identifies each person who opens an account. What this means to you:
        When you open an account, we will ask for your name, address, date
        of birth and other information that will allow us to identify you.
         Some or all of this information will be used to verify the identity
of all persons opening an account.                        

          We might request additional information about you (which may include
         certain documents, such as articles of incorporation for companies)
         to help us verify your identity and, in some cases, the information
       and/or documents may be required to conduct the verification. The
  information and documents will be used solely to verify your
identity.                                                 

   We will attempt to collect any missing required and requested
        information by contacting you or your financial advisor. If we are
          unable to obtain this information within the time frames established
  by each fund, then we may reject your application and order.

    Each fund will not invest your purchase until all required and
     requested identification information has been provided and your
          application has been submitted in "good order." After we receive all
         the information, your application is deemed to be in good order and
       we accept your purchase, you will receive the net asset value per
share next calculated.                                    

 If we are unable to verify your identity within time frames
       established by each fund, after a reasonable effort to do so, you
will receive written notification.                        

      With certain limited exceptions, only US residents may invest in
each fund.                                                

         Because orders placed through a financial advisor must be forwarded
        to the transfer agent before they can be processed, you'll need to
         allow extra time. Your financial advisor should be able to tell you
approximately when your order will be processed. It is the
       responsibility of your financial advisor to forward your order to
the transfer agent in a timely manner.                    

        INITIAL PURCHASE. The minimum initial investment is $2,500, except
        for investments on behalf of participants in certain fee-based and
    wrap programs offered through certain financial intermediaries
    approved by the Advisor, for which there is no minimum initial
investment; and fiduciary accounts such as IRAs and

        custodial accounts such as Uniform Gifts to Minors Act and Uniform
    Transfers to Minors Act accounts for which the minimum initial
        investment is $1,000 per account. In addition, the minimum initial
     investment is $1,000 if an automatic investment plan of $50 per
    month is established. Group retirement plans and certain other
        accounts have similar or lower minimum share balance requirements.

         SUB-MINIMUM BALANCES. Each fund may close your account and send you
     the proceeds if your balance falls below $2,500 ($1,000 with an
    Automatic Investment Plan funded with $50 or more per month in
         subsequent investments); $250 for retirement accounts; we will give
      you 60 days' notice (90 days for retirement accounts) so you can
        either increase your balance or close your account (these policies
        don't apply to investors with $100,000 or more in DWS fund shares,
      investors in certain fee-based and wrap programs offered through
        certain financial intermediaries approved by the Advisor, or group
      retirement plans and certain other accounts having lower minimum
share balance requirements)                               

          Because of the high cost of servicing accounts with low balances, an
         account maintenance fee of $6.25 per quarter (for a $25 annual fee)
          will be assessed on accounts whose balances fail to meet the minimum
         initial investment requirement for a period of 90 days prior to the
          assessment date. The quarterly assessment will occur on or about the
       15th of the last month in each calendar quarter. Please note that
          the fee will be assessed on accounts that fall below the minimum for
         any reason, including due to market value fluctuations, redemptions
 or exchanges. The account maintenance fee will apply to all
          shareholders of the DWS Funds except for: accounts with an automatic
    investment plan, accounts held in an omnibus account through a
financial services firm, accounts maintained on behalf of 
         participants in certain fee based and wrap programs offered through
certain financial intermediaries approved by the Advisor, 
      participant level accounts in group retirement plans held on the
        records of a retirement plan record keeper, or accounts maintained
          on behalf of trustees, directors, officers or employees of a fund or
the Advisor and its affiliates.                           

       SUBSEQUENT INVESTMENTS. The minimum subsequent investment is $50.
        However, there is no minimum investment requirement for subsequent
         investments on behalf of participants in certain fee-based and wrap
        programs offered through certain financial intermediaries approved
by the Advisor.

 MARKET TIMING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. Short-term and excessive
    trading of fund shares may present risks to a fund's long-term
     shareholders, including potential dilution in the value of fund
    shares, interference with the efficient management of a fund's
      portfolio (including losses on the sale of investments), taxable
 gains to remaining shareholders and increased brokerage and
        administrative costs. These risks may be more pronounced if a fund
        invests in certain securities, such as those that trade in foreign
       markets, are illiquid or do not otherwise have "readily available
         market quotations." Certain investors may seek to employ short-term
    trading strategies aimed at exploiting variations in portfolio
      valuation that arise from the nature of the securities held by a
          fund (e.g., "time zone arbitrage"). Each fund discourages short-term
        and excessive trading and has adopted policies and procedures that
        are intended to detect and deter short-term and excessive trading.

         Pursuant to its policies, each fund will impose a 2% redemption fee
  on fund shares held for less than a specified holding period
      (subject to certain exceptions discussed below under "Redemption
fees"). Each fund also reserves the right to reject or cancel a
         purchase or exchange order for any reason without prior notice. For
          example, a fund may in its discretion reject or cancel a purchase or
     an exchange order even if the transaction is not subject to the
      specific roundtrip transaction limitation described below if the
          Advisor believes that there appears to be a pattern of short-term or
    excessive trading activity by a shareholder or deems any other
          trading activity harmful or disruptive to a fund. Each fund, through
 its Advisor and Transfer Agent, will measure short-term and
        excessive trading by the number of roundtrip transactions within a
shareholder's account during a rolling 12-month period. A 
       "roundtrip" transaction is defined as any combination of purchase
      and redemption activity (including exchanges) of the same fund's
         shares. Each fund may take other trading activity into account if a
          fund believes such activity is of an amount or frequency that may be
  harmful to long-term shareholders or disruptive to portfolio
management.                                               

         Shareholders are limited to four roundtrip transactions in the same
     DWS Fund (excluding money market funds) over a rolling 12-month
          period. Shareholders with four or more roundtrip transactions in the
      same DWS Fund within a rolling 12-month period generally will be
          blocked from making additional purchases of, or exchanges into, that
       DWS Fund. Each fund has sole discretion whether to remove a block
from a shareholder's                                      

44 | Policies You Should Know About                                             

P-->497185th Page of 358TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 185th
         account. The rights of a shareholder to redeem shares of a DWS Fund
        are not affected by the four roundtrip transaction limitation, but
         all redemptions remain subject to each fund's redemption fee policy
(see "Redemption fees" described below).                  

         The Advisor may make exceptions to the roundtrip transaction policy
          for certain types of transactions if in its opinion the transactions
         do not represent short-term or excessive trading or are not abusive
   or harmful to a fund, such as, but not limited to, systematic
transactions, required minimum retirement distributions,  
        transactions initiated by a fund or administrator and transactions
by certain qualified fund-of-fund(s).                     

       In certain circumstances where shareholders hold shares of a fund
  through a financial intermediary, the fund may rely upon the
      financial intermediary's policy to deter short-term or excessive
       trading if the Advisor believes that the financial intermediary's
         policy is reasonably designed to detect and deter transactions that
        are not in the best interest of a fund. A financial intermediary's
       policy relating to short-term or excessive trading may be more or
     less restrictive than the DWS Funds' policy, may permit certain
        transactions not permitted by the DWS Funds' policies, or prohibit
transactions not subject to the DWS Funds' policies.      

The Advisor may also accept undertakings from a financial 
         intermediary to enforce short-term or excessive trading policies on
    behalf of a fund that provide a substantially similar level of
      protection for each fund against such transactions. For example,
    certain financial intermediaries may have contractual or legal
      restrictions that prevent them from blocking an account. In such
        instances, the financial intermediary may use alternate techniques
         that the Advisor considers to be a reasonable substitute for such a
block.                                                    

          In addition, if a fund invests some portion of its assets in foreign
          securities, it has adopted certain fair valuation practices intended
        to protect the fund from "time zone arbitrage" with respect to its
          foreign securities holdings and other trading practices that seek to
          exploit variations in portfolio valuation that arise from the nature
      of the securities held by a fund. (See "How each fund calculates
share price.")                                            

      There is no assurance that these policies and procedures will be
          effective in limiting short-term and excessive trading in all cases.
      For example, the Advisor may not be able to effectively monitor,
   detect or limit short-term or excessive trading by underlying

     shareholders that occurs through omnibus accounts maintained by
   broker-dealers or other financial intermediaries. The Advisor
        reviews trading activity at the omnibus level to detect short-term
     or excessive trading. If the Advisor has reason to suspect that
        short-term or excessive trading is occurring at the omnibus level,
    the Advisor will contact the financial intermediary to request
       underlying shareholder level activity. Depending on the amount of
         fund shares held in such omnibus accounts (which may represent most
     of a fund's shares) short-term and/or excessive trading of fund
        shares could adversely affect long-term shareholders in a fund. If
          short-term or excessive trading is identified, the Advisor will take
appropriate action.                                       

          Each fund's market timing policies and procedures may be modified or
terminated at any time.                                   

REDEMPTION FEES. Each fund imposes a redemption fee of 2% of the
         total redemption amount (calculated at net asset value) on all fund
        shares redeemed or exchanged within 15 days of buying them (either
      by purchase or exchange). The redemption fee is paid directly to
        each fund and is designed to encourage long-term investment and to
      offset transaction and other costs associated with short-term or
excessive trading. For purposes of determining whether the
          redemption fee applies, shares held the longest time will be treated
       as being redeemed first and shares held the shortest time will be
treated as being redeemed last.                           

      The redemption fee is applicable to fund shares purchased either
directly or through a financial intermediary, such as a   
  broker-dealer. Transactions through financial intermediaries
      typically are placed with a fund on an omnibus basis and include
      both purchase and sale transactions placed on behalf of multiple
          investors. These purchase and sale transactions are generally netted
        against one another and placed on an aggregate basis; consequently
        the identities of the individuals on whose behalf the transactions
         are placed generally are not known to a fund. For this reason, each
     fund has undertaken to notify financial intermediaries of their
         obligation to assess the redemption fee on customer accounts and to
  collect and remit the proceeds to each fund. However, due to
        operational requirements, the intermediaries' methods for tracking
          and calculating the fee may be inadequate or differ in some respects
from each fund's.

   The redemption fee will not be charged in connection with the
        following exchange or redemption transactions: (i) transactions on
    behalf of participants in certain research wrap programs; (ii)
        transactions on behalf of participants in certain group retirement
       plans whose processing systems are incapable of properly applying
          the redemption fee to underlying shareholders; (iii) transactions on
       behalf of a shareholder to return any excess IRA contributions to
      the shareholder; (iv) transactions on behalf of a shareholder to
        effect a required minimum distribution on an IRA; (v) transactions
 on behalf of any mutual fund advised by the Advisor and its
affiliates (e.g., "funds of funds") or, in the case of a  
         master/feeder relationship, redemptions by the feeder fund from the
master portfolio; (vi) transactions on behalf of certain  
  unaffiliated mutual funds operating as funds of funds; (vii)
  transactions following death or disability of any registered
     shareholder, beneficial owner or grantor of a living trust with
    respect to shares purchased before death or disability; (viii)
         transactions involving hardship of any registered shareholder; (ix)
         systematic transactions with pre-defined trade dates for purchases,
         exchanges or redemptions, such as automatic account rebalancing, or
        loan origination and repayments; (x) transactions involving shares
purchased through the reinvestment of dividends or other  
        distributions; (xi) transactions involving shares transferred from
         another account in the same fund or converted from another class of
          the same fund (e.g., shares converting from Class B to Class A) (the
          redemption fee period will carry over to the acquired shares); (xii)
          transactions initiated by a fund or administrator (e.g., redemptions
     for not meeting account minimums, to pay account fees funded by
        share redemptions, or in the event of the liquidation or merger of
        the fund); or (xiii) transactions in cases when there are legal or
      contractual limitations or restrictions on the imposition of the
         redemption fee (as determined by a fund or its agents in their sole
         discretion). In addition, the redemption fee will not be charged in
    connection with checkwriting transactions for DWS Intermediate
    Tax/AMT Free Fund. It is the policy of the DWS funds to permit
         approved fund platform providers to execute transactions within the
        funds without the imposition of a redemption fee if such providers
      have implemented alternative measures that are determined by the
          Advisor to provide controls on short-term and excessive trading that
are comparable to the DWS funds' policies.

   THE AUTOMATED INFORMATION LINE IS AVAILABLE 24 HOURS A DAY BY
         CALLING (800) 728-3337. You can use our automated phone services to
          get information on DWS funds generally and on accounts held directly
         at DWS Scudder. You can also use this service to make exchanges and
sell shares.                                              

     QUICKBUY AND QUICKSELL let you set up a link between a DWS fund
          account and a bank account. Once this link is in place, you can move
       money between the two with a phone call. You'll need to make sure
         your bank has Automated Clearing House (ACH) services. Transactions
       take two to three days to be completed and there is a $50 minimum
      and a $250,000 maximum. To set up QuickBuy or QuickSell on a new
    account, see the account application; to add it to an existing
account, call (800) 728-3337.                             

TELEPHONE AND ELECTRONIC TRANSACTIONS. Generally, you are 
    automatically entitled to telephone and electronic transaction
       privileges, but you may elect not to have them when you open your
          account or by contacting Shareholder Services at (800) 728-3337 at a
later date.                                               

Since many transactions may be initiated by telephone or  
          electronically, it's important to understand that as long as we take
    reasonable steps to ensure that an order to purchase or redeem
shares is genuine, such as recording calls or requesting  
  personalized security codes or other information, we are not
responsible for any losses that may occur as a result. For
         transactions conducted over the Internet, we recommend the use of a
          secure Internet browser. In addition, you should verify the accuracy
         of your confirmation statements immediately after you receive them.

  EACH FUND DOES NOT ISSUE SHARE CERTIFICATES. However, if you
      currently have shares in certificated form, you must include the
   share certificates properly endorsed or accompanied by a duly
       executed stock power when exchanging or redeeming shares. You may
       not exchange or redeem shares in certificate form by telephone or
via the Internet.                                         

          WHEN YOU ASK US TO SEND OR RECEIVE A WIRE, please note that while we
          don't charge a fee to send or receive wires, it's possible that your
         bank may do so. Wire transactions are generally completed within 24
       hours. Each fund can only send wires of $1,000 or more and accept
wires of $50 or more.

       EACH FUND ACCEPTS PAYMENT FOR SHARES ONLY IN US DOLLARS by check,
         bank or Federal Funds wire transfer or by electronic bank transfer.
 Please note that a fund does not accept cash, money orders,
          traveler's checks, starter checks, third party checks (except checks
      for retirement plan asset transfers and rollovers or for Uniform
          Gift to Minors Act/Uniform Transfers to Minors Act accounts), checks
         drawn on foreign banks or checks issued by credit card companies or
         Internet-based companies. Thus, subject to the foregoing exceptions
for certain third party checks, checks that are otherwise 
        permissible must be drawn by the account holder on a domestic bank
and must be payable to a fund.                            

SIGNATURE GUARANTEE. When you want to sell more than $100,000 worth
      of shares or send proceeds to a third party or to a new address,
      you'll usually need to place your order in writing and include a
     signature guarantee. However, if you want money wired to a bank
         account that is already on file with us, you don't need a signature
         guarantee. Also, generally you don't need a signature guarantee for
an exchange, although we may require one in certain other 
circumstances.                                            

         A signature guarantee is simply a certification of your signature -
 a valuable safeguard against fraud. You can get a signature
 guarantee from an eligible guarantor institution, including
          commercial banks, savings and loans, trust companies, credit unions,
member firms of a national stock exchange or any member or
       participant of an approved signature guarantor program. Note that
          you can't get a signature guarantee from a notary public and we must
be provided the original guarantee.                       

   SELLING SHARES OF TRUST ACCOUNTS AND BUSINESS OR ORGANIZATION
      ACCOUNTS may require additional documentation. Please call (800)
      728-3337 or contact your financial advisor for more information.

         MONEY FROM SHARES YOU SELL is normally sent out within one business
    day of when your order is processed (not when it is received),
        although it could be delayed for up to seven days. There are other
        circumstances when it could be longer: When you are selling shares
        you bought recently by check (redemption proceeds from such a sale
 are unavailable until the check has cleared), when you make
        purchases by ACH (the funds will be placed under a 10 calendar day
         hold to ensure good funds) or when unusual circumstances prompt the
         SEC to allow further delays. Certain expedited redemption processes
may also be

      delayed when you are selling recently purchased shares or in the
         event of closing of the Federal Reserve Bank's wire payment system.
      In addition, each fund reserves the right to suspend or postpone
          redemptions as permitted pursuant to Section 22(e) of the Investment
         Company Act of 1940. Generally, those circumstances are when 1) the
       New York Stock Exchange is closed other than customary weekend or
    holiday closings; 2) trading on the New York Stock Exchange is
    restricted; 3) an emergency exists which makes the disposal of
          securities owned by a fund or the fair determination of the value of
       a fund's net assets not reasonably practicable; or 4) the SEC, by
          order, permits the suspension of the right of redemption. Redemption
        payments by wire may also be delayed in the event of a non-routine
        closure of the Federal Reserve wire payment system. For additional
         rights reserved by each fund, please see "Other rights we reserve."

shares by contacting your financial advisor.              

How each fund calculates share price                      

     To calculate net asset value, or NAV, each share class uses the
following equation:                                       

                                                                [Download Table]

     TOTAL ASSETS - TOTAL LIABILITIES                
-----------------------------------------    =    NAV
    TOTAL NUMBER OF SHARES OUTSTANDING               

The price at which you buy and sell shares is the NAV.    

       EACH FUND CHARGES A REDEMPTION FEE EQUAL TO 2.00% of the value of
       shares redeemed or exchanged within 15 days. Please see "Policies
about transactions - Redemption fees" for further information.

     WE TYPICALLY VALUE SECURITIES USING INFORMATION FURNISHED BY AN
          INDEPENDENT PRICING SERVICE OR MARKET QUOTATIONS, WHERE APPROPRIATE.
       However, we may use methods approved by a fund's Board, such as a
         fair valuation model, which are intended to reflect fair value when
      pricing service information or market quotations are not readily
         available or when a security's value or a meaningful portion of the
     value of a fund's portfolio is believed to have been materially
     affected by a significant event, such as a natural disaster, an
economic event like a bankruptcy filing, or a substantial 
          fluctuation in domestic or foreign markets that has occurred between
  the close of the exchange or market on which the security is
        principally traded (for example, a foreign exchange or market) and
        the close of the New York Stock Exchange. In such a case, a fund's
         value for a security is likely to be different from the last quoted
          market price or pricing service information. In addition, due to the
          subjective and variable nature of fair value pricing, it is possible
        that the value determined for a particular asset may be materially
different from the value realized upon such asset's sale. 

Other rights we reserve                                   

You should be aware that we may do any of the following:  

-  withdraw or suspend the offering of shares at any time 

         -  withhold a portion of your distributions and redemption proceeds
          as federal income tax if we have been notified by the IRS that
           you are subject to backup withholding or if you fail to provide
           us with a correct taxpayer ID number and certain certifications
        or certification that you are exempt from backup withholding

  -  reject a new account application if you don't provide any
           required or requested identifying information, or for any other
reason                                              

         -  refuse, cancel, limit or rescind any purchase or exchange order,
             without prior notice; freeze any account (meaning you will not be
          able to purchase fund shares in your account); suspend account
          services; and/or involuntarily redeem your account if we think
    that the account is being used for fraudulent or illegal
             purposes; one or more of these actions will be taken when, at our
            sole discretion, they are deemed to be in a fund's best interest
             or when a fund is requested or compelled to do so by governmental
authority or by applicable law

          will be taxable to the same extent as a redemption for cash; a
      fund generally won't make a redemption in kind unless your

UNDERSTANDING DISTRIBUTIONS AND TAXES                                           

          Each fund intends to distribute to its shareholders virtually all of
          its net earnings. Each fund can earn money in two ways: by receiving
         interest, dividends or other income from securities it holds and by
     selling securities for more than it paid for them. (Each fund's
       earnings are separate from any gains or losses stemming from your
      own purchase and sale of shares.) Each fund may not always pay a
dividend or distribution for a given period.              

  Income dividends are declared daily and paid monthly. Short-
        term and long-term capital gains are paid in November or December,
or otherwise as needed.                                   

          Dividends or distributions declared to shareholders of record in the
          last quarter of a given calendar year are treated for federal income
        tax purposes as if they were received on December 31 of that year,
         provided such dividends or distributions are paid by the end of the
following January.                                        

For federal income tax purposes, income and capital gains 
 distributions are generally taxable. However, dividends and
   distributions received by retirement plans qualifying for tax
   exemption under federal income tax laws generally will not be
taxable.

Because each shareholder's tax situation is unique, ask your tax professional   
about the tax consequences of your investments, including any state and local   
tax consequences.

         YOU CAN CHOOSE HOW TO RECEIVE YOUR DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS. You
         can have them all automatically reinvested in fund shares (at NAV),
       all deposited directly to your bank account or all sent to you by
        check, have one type reinvested and the other sent to you by check
        or have them invested in a different fund. Tell us your preference
   on your application. If you don't indicate a preference, your
         dividends and distributions will all be reinvested in shares of the
    fund without a sales charge (if applicable). Distributions are
          treated the same for federal income tax purposes whether you receive
them in cash or reinvest them in additional shares. For   
employer-sponsored qualified plans, and retirement plans, 
reinvestment (at NAV) is the only option.                 

         BUYING, SELLING OR EXCHANGING FUND SHARES WILL USUALLY HAVE FEDERAL
   INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES FOR YOU (except in employer-sponsored
        qualified plans, IRAs or other tax-advantaged accounts). Your sale
      of shares may result in a capital gain or loss. The gain or loss
         will be long-term or short-term depending on how long you owned the
         shares that were sold. For federal income tax purposes, an exchange
is treated the same as a sale.                            

Each fund intends to distribute tax-exempt interest as    
         exempt-interest dividends, which are excluded from gross income for
regular federal income tax purposes, but may be subject to
     alternative minimum tax and state and local income taxes. Their
   distributions from other sources, if any, would be taxable as
described above.                                          

Dividends from each fund are generally tax-free for most  
          shareholders, meaning that investors who are individuals can receive
       them without incurring federal and (for some investors) state and
      local income tax liability. However, there are a few exceptions:

       -  a portion of a fund's dividends may be taxable if it came from
investments in taxable securities                   

       -  because a fund (except DWS Intermediate Tax/AMT Free Fund) can

   ANY DIRECT INVESTMENTS IN FOREIGN SECURITIES BY A FUND MAY BE
        SUBJECT TO FOREIGN WITHHOLDING TAXES. In that case, a fund's yield
    on those securities would generally be decreased. Shareholders
        generally will not be entitled to claim a credit or deduction with
 respect to foreign taxes paid by the fund. In addition, any
          investments in foreign securities or foreign currencies may increase
          or accelerate a fund's recognition of ordinary income and may affect
          the timing or amount of the fund's distributions. If you invest in a
    fund through a taxable account, your after-tax return could be
negatively impacted.                                      

      To the extent that a fund invests in certain debt obligations or
   certain other securities, investments in these obligations or
          securities may cause a fund to recognize taxable income in excess of
   the cash generated by such obligations. Thus, a fund could be
          required at times to liquidate other investments in order to satisfy
its distribution requirements.                            

          For taxable years beginning before January 1, 2011, distributions to
          individuals and other noncorporate shareholders of investment income
        designated by a fund as derived from qualified dividend income are
       eligible for taxation for federal income tax purposes at the more
       favorable long-term capital gain rates. Qualified dividend income
 generally includes dividends from domestic and some foreign
       corporations. It does not include income from investments in debt
         securities or, generally, from REITs. In addition, a fund must meet
       certain holding period and other requirements with respect to the
      dividend-paying stocks in its portfolio and the shareholder must

          meet certain holding period and other requirements with respect to a
      fund's shares for the lower tax rates to apply. The funds do not
       expect a significant portion of their distributions to be derived
from qualified dividend income.                           

     For taxable years beginning before January 1, 2011, the maximum
federal income tax rate imposed on long-term capital gains
       recognized by individuals and other noncorporate shareholders has
     been reduced to 15%. For more information, see the Statement of
Additional Information, under "Taxes."
     YOUR FUND WILL SEND YOU DETAILED FEDERAL INCOME TAX INFORMATION
         EVERY JANUARY. These statements tell you the amount and the federal
     income tax classification of any dividends or distributions you
          received. They also have certain details on your purchases and sales
of shares.                                                

          IF YOU INVEST RIGHT BEFORE A FUND PAYS A DIVIDEND, you'll be getting
       some of your investment back as a taxable dividend. You can avoid
this by investing after a fund declares a dividend. In    
       tax-advantaged retirement accounts you do not need to worry about
this.                                                     

     CORPORATIONS are taxed at the same rates on ordinary income and
 capital gains, but may be eligible for a dividends-received
         deduction for a portion of the income dividends they receive from a
      fund, provided certain holding period and other requirements are
met.                                                      

   The above discussion is applicable to shareholders who are US
      persons. If you are a non-US person, please consult your own tax
  advisor with respect to the US tax consequences to you of an
investment in a fund.

Hypothetical Expense Summary                              

         Using the annual fund operating expense ratios presented in the fee
     tables in the fund prospectus, the Hypothetical Expense Summary
          shows the estimated fees and expenses, in actual dollars, that would
         be charged on a hypothetical investment of $10,000 in the fund held
       for the next 10 years and the impact of such fees and expenses on
       fund returns for each year and cumulatively, assuming a 5% return
  for each year. The tables also assume that all dividends and
        distributions are reinvested. The annual fund expense ratios shown
          are net of any contractual fee waivers or expense reimbursements, if
          any, for the period of the contractual commitment. The tables do not
reflect redemption fees, if any, which may be payable upon
  redemption. If redemption fees were shown, the "Hypothetical
      Year-End Balance After Fees and Expenses" amounts shown would be
     lower and the "Annual Fees and Expenses" amounts shown would be
         higher. Also, please note that if you are investing through a third
       party provider, that provider may have fees and expenses separate
          from those of the fund that are not reflected here. Mutual fund fees
        and expenses fluctuate over time and actual expenses may be higher
or lower than those shown.                                

         The Hypothetical Expense Summary should not be used or construed as
an offer to sell, a solicitation of an offer to buy or a  
    recommendation or endorsement of any specific mutual fund. You
   should carefully review the fund's prospectus to consider the
          investment objectives, risks, expenses and charges of the fund prior
to investing.

 INVESTMENT RESTRICTIONS

Except as otherwise indicated, each Fund's investment objective and policies are
not fundamental and may be changed without a vote of shareholders.  There can be
no assurance that a Fund's objective will be met.                               

Each Fund has elected to be classified  as a  diversified  series of an open-end
investment  company.  A  diversified  fund may not, with respect to 75% of total
assets, invest more than 5% of total assets in the securities of a single issuer
or invest in more than 10% of the outstanding  voting  securities of such issuer
(with certain exceptions).                                                      

If a percentage  restriction on investment or utilization of assets as set forth
under "Investment Restrictions" and "Other Investment Policies" is adhered to at
the time an  investment  is made, a later change in  percentage  resulting  from
changes in the value or the total cost of a Fund's assets will not be considered
a violation of the restriction.                                                 

Unless specified to the contrary,  the following fundamental policies may not be
changed without the approval of a majority of the outstanding  voting securities
of a Fund which, under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940
Act"),  and the rules  thereunder  and as used in this  Statement of  Additional
Information,  means  the  lesser  of (1) 67% or more  of the  voting  securities
present at a meeting,  if the holders of more than 50% of the outstanding voting
securities of a Fund are present or represented  by proxy,  or (2) more than 50%
of the outstanding voting securities of a Fund.                                 

As a matter of fundamental policy, each Fund may not:                           

(1)      borrow money,  except as permitted under the 1940 Act as interpreted or
         modified by  regulatory  authority  having  jurisdiction,  from time to
time;                                                         

(2)      issue senior  securities,  except as  permitted  under the 1940 Act, as
         interpreted or modified by regulatory  authority  having  jurisdiction,
from time to time;                                            

(3)      concentrate its investments in a particular  industry,  as that term is
         used  in the  1940  Act,  as  interpreted  or  modified  by  regulatory
authority having jurisdiction, from time to time;             

(4)      engage in the  business of  underwriting  securities  issued by others,
         except to the extent  that the Fund may be deemed to be an  underwriter
in connection with the disposition of portfolio securities;   

(5)      purchase or sell real estate, which term does not include securities of
         companies which deal in real estate or mortgages or investments secured
         by real estate or  interests  therein,  except  that the Fund  reserves
         freedom of action to hold and to sell real estate  acquired as a result
of the Fund's ownership of securities;                        

(6)      purchase or sell  commodities,  except as permitted by the 1940 Act, as
         amended,  and as interpreted  or modified by the  regulatory  authority
having jurisdiction, from time to time;                       

(7)      make loans except as permitted  under the 1940 Act, as  interpreted  or
         modified by  regulatory  authority  having  jurisdiction,  from time to
time;                                                         

Additionally, as a matter of fundamental policy, each Fund will:                

(8)      under normal  circumstances,  have at least 80% of its net assets (plus
         the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes in the case of the
         DWS Managed  Municipal Bond Fund and the DWS Intermediate  Tax/AMT Free
         Fund) invested in securities of municipalities across the United States
         and in other  securities  whose  income  is free from  regular  federal
income tax.                                                   

With respect to fundamental  policy (8) above,  DWS Managed  Municipal Bond Fund
considers any investments in municipal  securities that pay interest  subject to
the alternative  minimum tax ("AMT") as part of the 80% of the Fund's net assets
that must be invested in municipal securities.

Other Investment Policies                                                       

The Board of Trustees has voluntarily adopted certain  non-fundamental  policies
and  restrictions  which are observed in the conduct of a Fund's affairs.  These
represent  intentions  of the Trustees  based upon current  circumstances.  They
differ  from  fundamental  investment  policies  in that they may be  changed or
amended by action of the Trustees without  requiring prior notice to or approval
of the shareholders.                                                            

As a matter of non-fundamental policy, each Fund may not:                       

1.       borrow money in an amount  greater than 5% of its total assets,  except
for temporary or emergency purposes;                          

2.       purchase  securities  on margin or make short  sales,  except (i) short
         sales against the box, (ii) in connection with arbitrage  transactions,
         (iii) for margin deposits in connection with futures contracts, options
         or other  permitted  investments,  (iv) that  transactions  in  futures
         contracts  and  options  shall  not be  deemed  to  constitute  selling
         securities  short,  and (v)  that a Fund  may  obtain  such  short-term
         credits  as  may  be  necessary   for  the   clearance  of   securities
transactions;                                                 

3.       purchase  options,  unless  the  aggregate  premiums  paid on all  such
         options  held by a Fund  at any  time do not  exceed  20% of its  total
         assets; or sell put options, if as a result, the aggregate value of the
         obligations  underlying  such put options would exceed 50% of its total
assets;                                                       

4.       enter  into  futures  contracts  or  purchase  options  thereon  unless
         immediately  after the  purchase,  the value of the  aggregate  initial
         margin with respect to such futures contracts entered into on behalf of
         a Fund and the premiums paid for such options on futures contracts does
         not  exceed  5% of the fair  market  value of a  Fund's  total  assets;
         provided that in the case of an option that is in-the-money at the time
         of purchase,  the in-the-money  amount may be excluded in computing the
5% limit;                                                     

5.       purchase warrants if as a result,  such securities,  taken at the lower
         of cost or market value, would represent more than 5% of the value of a
         Fund's total assets (for this  purpose,  warrants  acquired in units or
attached to securities will be deemed to have no value); and  

6.       lend  portfolio  securities  in an amount  greater than 5% of its total
assets.                                                       

The  foregoing  non-fundamental  policies are in addition to policies  otherwise
stated in the Prospectus or this Statement of Additional Information.           

The DWS High Yield Tax Free Fund will invest at least 50% of its total assets in
municipal bonds rated, at the time of purchase,  within the four highest quality
rating categories of Moody's Investors Service,  Inc. ("Moody's") (Aaa, Aa, A or
Baa),  Standard & Poor's Ratings  Services  ("S&P") or Fitch Investors  Service,
Inc.  ("Fitch")  (AAA, AA, A or BBB), or their  equivalents as determined at the
time of purchase by Deutsche Investment  Management Americas Inc. ("DIMA" or the
"Advisor"). The Fund may invest, however, up to 50% of its total assets in bonds
rated below Baa by Moody's or below BBB by S&P or Fitch,  or unrated  securities
considered to be of equivalent  quality.  The Fund may not invest in bonds rated
below B by Moody's,  S&P or Fitch, or their  equivalent.  If a security's credit
quality is  downgraded,  the Advisor  will decide what to do with the  security,
based on its assessment of what would benefit shareholders most.                

Normally,  the DWS Managed  Municipal  Bond Fund invests at least 65% of its net
assets  in  securities  rated,  or issued  by an  issuer  rated,  at the time of
purchase within the three highest quality rating  categories of Moody's (Aaa, Aa
or A), S&P or Fitch (AAA, AA or A) or their equivalents,  or if unrated,  judged
by the Advisor to be of comparable quality at the time of purchase. The Fund may
invest  up to 10% of its  assets  in debt  securities  rated  lower  than Baa by
Moody's,  BBB by S&P or Fitch or of  equivalent  quality  as  determined  by the
Advisor,  but will not purchase bonds rated below B by Moody's, S&P or Fitch, or
their equivalent.

Normally,  DWS  Intermediate  Tax/AMT  Free Fund invests at least 65% of its net
assets in municipal  bonds which are rated,  at the time of purchase  within the
three highest quality rating  categories of Moody's (Aaa, Aa or A), S&P or Fitch
(AAA, AA or A) or their equivalents,  or if unrated, judged by the Advisor to be
of comparable  quality at the time of purchase.  The Fund will not invest in any
debt  security  rated  lower  than  Baa by  Moody's,  BBB by S&P or  Fitch or of
equivalent quality as determined by the Advisor.                                

For temporary  defensive  purposes or if an unusual  disparity between after-tax
income on taxable and municipal securities makes it advisable, up to 100% of the
DWS High Yield Tax Free Fund's  assets (20% of assets in the case of DWS Managed
Municipal Bond Fund and DWS Intermediate  Tax/AMT Free Fund) may be held in cash
or  invested  in  short-term  taxable   investments,   including  US  Government
obligations and money market instruments.                                       

Although there is no current  intention to do so, each Fund may invest more than
25% of its total assets in  industrial  development  or other  private  activity
bonds, subject to a Fund's fundamental investment policies.  Because these bonds
are  frequently  subject to regular  federal  income tax and AMT,  investment in
these types of bonds is also  subject to a Fund's  limitation  on  investing  in
municipal securities whose investment income is subject to these taxes.         

INVESTMENT POLICIES AND TECHNIQUES

General Investment Objectives and Policies                                      

Descriptions  in  this  Statement  of  Additional  Information  of a  particular
investment  practice  or  technique  in which a Fund  may  engage  are  meant to
describe the spectrum of investments  that the Advisor in its discretion  might,
but is not  required  to, use in managing  each  Fund's  portfolio  assets.  The
Advisor may in its  discretion  at any time employ such  practice,  technique or
instrument  for  one or  more  Funds  but  not  for  all  funds  advised  by it.
Furthermore,  it is possible  that  certain  types of financial  instruments  or
investment  techniques  described  herein  may  not be  available,  permissible,
economically  feasible or effective for their intended  purposes in all markets.
Certain practices,  techniques or instruments may not be principal activities of
the Funds, but, to the extent employed,  could from time to time have a material
impact on a Fund's performance. It is possible that certain investment practices
and techniques  described  below may not be permissible  for a Fund based on its
investment  restrictions,  as  described  herein,  and in the Funds'  applicable
prospectus.                                                                     

Advance  Refunded  Bonds.  A Fund may  purchase  Municipal  Securities  that are
subsequently refunded by the issuance and delivery of a new issue of bonds prior
to the date on which the outstanding issue of bonds can be redeemed or paid. The
proceeds  from the new issue of bonds  are  typically  placed in an escrow  fund
consisting  of US  Government  obligations  that are  used to pay the  interest,
principal and call premium on the issue being refunded. A Fund may also purchase
Municipal Securities that have been refunded prior to purchase by a Fund.       

High  Yield/High  Risk  Bonds.  DWS High  Yield  Tax Free  Fund and DWS  Managed
Municipal  Bond Fund may also  purchase  debt  securities  which are rated below
investment-grade  (commonly  referred to as "junk bonds"),  that is, rated below
Baa by  Moody's  or below BBB by S&P,  and  unrated  securities  judged to be of
equivalent quality as determined by the Advisor. These securities usually entail
greater risk  (including the possibility of default or bankruptcy of the issuers
of such securities),  generally involve greater  volatility of price and risk to
principal  and income,  and may be less liquid,  than  securities  in the higher
rating categories. The lower the ratings of such debt securities, the more their
risks render them like equity  securities.  Securities rated D may be in default
with respect to payment of principal or interest.  See "Ratings of  Investments"
for a more complete description of the ratings assigned by ratings organizations
and their respective characteristics.                                           

Issuers of such high yield  securities  often are highly  leveraged  and may not
have available to them more  traditional  methods of financing.  Therefore,  the
risk  associated  with  acquiring the  securities  of such issuers  generally is
greater than is the case with higher rated  securities.  For example,  during an
economic  downturn  or a  sustained  period of  rising  interest  rates,  highly
leveraged  issuers of high yield  securities  may experience  financial  stress.
During such periods, such issuers may not have sufficient revenues to meet their
interest  payment  obligations.   The  issuer's  ability  to  service  its  debt
obligations may also be adversely affected by specific  corporate  developments,
or the issuer's inability to meet specific projected business forecasts,  or the
unavailability  of  additional  financing.  The risk of loss from default by the
issuer is significantly greater for the holders of high yield securities because
such  securities  are generally  unsecured and are often  subordinated  to other
creditors  of the  issuer.  Prices  and  yields of high  yield

securities will fluctuate over time and, during periods of economic uncertainty,
volatility  of high yield  securities  may  adversely  affect a Fund's net asset
value. In addition,  investments in high yield zero coupon or pay-in-kind bonds,
rather than  income-bearing  high yield securities,  may be more speculative and
may be  subject  to greater  fluctuations  in value due to  changes in  interest
rates.                                                                          

A Fund may have difficulty  disposing of certain  high-yield  securities because
they may have a thin trading market. Because not all dealers maintain markets in
all high yield securities, a Fund anticipates that such securities could be sold
only to a limited number of dealers or  institutional  investors.  The lack of a
liquid  secondary  market may have an adverse  effect on the market  price and a
Fund's  ability  to  dispose  of  particular  issues  and may also  make it more
difficult  for a Fund to obtain  accurate  market  quotations  for  purposes  of
valuing a Fund's assets.  Market quotations generally are available on many high
yield  issues  only from a limited  number of  dealers  and may not  necessarily
represent  firm  bids of such  dealers  or  prices  for  actual  sales.  Adverse
publicity and investor perceptions may decrease the values and liquidity of high
yield  securities.  These  securities  may  also  involve  special  registration
responsibilities,   liabilities   and  costs,   and   liquidity   and  valuation
difficulties.                                                                   

Credit  quality in the  high-yield  securities  market can change  suddenly  and
unexpectedly,  and even recently issued credit ratings may not fully reflect the
actual risks posed by a particular high-yield security. For these reasons, it is
generally the policy of the Advisor not to rely exclusively on ratings issued by
established credit rating agencies,  but to supplement such ratings with its own
independent and on-going  review of credit quality.  The achievement of a Fund's
investment  objective by investment in such  securities may be more dependent on
the Advisor's credit analysis than is the case for higher quality bonds.  Should
the rating of a portfolio  security be  downgraded,  the Advisor will  determine
whether  it is in the best  interests  of a Fund to  retain or  dispose  of such
security.                                                                       

Prices for high-yield  securities may be affected by legislative  and regulatory
developments.  Also, Congress has from time to time considered legislation which
would restrict or eliminate the corporate tax deduction for interest payments in
these  securities and regulate  corporate  restructurings.  Such legislation may
significantly depress the prices of outstanding securities of this type.        

A portion of the  high-yield  securities  acquired by the Funds may be purchased
upon  issuance,  which may  involve  special  risks  because the  securities  so
acquired  are new  issues.  In such  instances  that  Fund may be a  substantial
purchaser of the issue and therefore  have the  opportunity  to  participate  in
structuring the terms of the offering. Although this may enable the Fund to seek
to protect itself against certain of such risks,  the  considerations  discussed
herein would nevertheless remain applicable.                                    

Illiquid  Securities and Restricted  Securities.  A Fund may purchase securities
that are subject to legal or  contractual  restrictions  on resale  ("restricted
securities").  Generally  speaking,  restricted  securities  may be sold  (i) to
qualified  institutional buyers; (ii) in a privately negotiated transaction to a
limited number of purchasers;  (iii) in limited  quantities after they have been
held for a specified  period of time and other conditions are met pursuant to an
exemption  from  registration;  or  (iv)  in  a  public  offering  for  which  a
registration statement is in effect under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the "1933 Act").  Issuers of  restricted  securities  may not be subject to the
disclosure and other investor  protection  requirements that would be applicable
if their securities were publicly traded.                                       

Restricted  securities  are often  illiquid,  but they may also be  liquid.  For
example,  restricted securities that are eligible for resale under Rule 144A are
often deemed to be liquid.                                                      

Each Fund's Board has approved  guidelines for use by the Advisor in determining
whether a security  is liquid or  illiquid.  Among the  factors  the Advisor may
consider in reaching  liquidity  decisions relating to Rule 144A securities are:
(1) the  frequency  of trades  and quotes  for the  security;  (2) the number of
dealers  wishing  to  purchase  or sell the  security  and the  number  of other
potential purchasers;  (3) dealer undertakings to make a market in the security;
and (4) the nature of the security and the nature of the market for the security
(i.e.,  the time  needed to dispose of the  security,  the method of  soliciting
offers, and the mechanics of the transfer). Issuers of restricted securities may
not be subject to the disclosure and other investor protection requirements that
would  be  applicable  if  their  securities  were  publicly  traded.   Where  a
registration  statement is required for the resale of restricted  securities,  a
fund may be required to bear all or part of the  registration  expenses.  A fund
may be deemed to be an "underwriter" for purposes of the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended when selling restricted  securities to the public and, in such event,
a fund                                                                          

6 

P-->497206th Page of 358TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 206th
may be liable to purchasers of such  securities  if the  registration  statement
prepared by the issuer is materially inaccurate or misleading.                  

A Fund may also purchase securities that are not subject to legal or contractual
restrictions  on resale,  but that are deemed  illiquid.  Such securities may be
illiquid, for example, because there is a limited trading market for them.      

A Fund may be unable to sell a restricted or illiquid security.  In addition, it
may be more  difficult to determine a market  value for  restricted  or illiquid
securities.  Moreover,  if adverse market  conditions were to develop during the
period between a Fund's  decision to sell a restricted or illiquid  security and
the point at which a Fund is  permitted  or able to sell such  security,  a Fund
might  obtain a price  less  favorable  than the price  that  prevailed  when it
decided to sell.                                                                

Impact of Large  Redemptions  and  Purchases of Fund Shares.  From time to time,
shareholders  of a Fund  (which may  include  affiliated  and/or  non-affiliated
registered investment companies that invest in a Fund) may make relatively large
redemptions or purchases of Fund shares.  These transactions may cause a Fund to
have to sell securities or invest  additional cash, as the case may be. While it
is impossible  to predict the overall  impact of these  transactions  over time,
there could be adverse effects on a Fund's performance to the extent that a Fund
may be  required  to sell  securities  or invest cash at times when it would not
otherwise do so. These  transactions  could also  accelerate the  realization of
taxable income if sales of securities  resulted in gains and could also increase
transaction costs, which may impact a Fund's expense ratio.                     

Industrial  Development and Pollution Control Bonds.  Industrial Development and
Pollution  Control Bonds (which are types of private activity  bonds),  although
nominally  issued by municipal  authorities,  are  generally  not secured by the
taxing  power  of the  municipality  but  are  secured  by the  revenues  of the
authority  derived  from  payments by the  industrial  user.  Under  federal tax
legislation, certain types of Industrial Development Bonds and Pollution Control
Bonds may no longer be issued on a tax-exempt basis,  although previously issued
bonds of these types and certain refundings of such bonds are not affected.  For
the purposes of the Funds'  investment  limitation  regarding  concentration  of
investments  in any  one  industry,  industrial  development  or  other  private
activity bonds ultimately  payable by companies within the same industry will be
considered as if they were issued by issuers in the same industry.              

Interfund  Borrowing  and Lending  Program.  The Funds have  received  exemptive
relief from the Securities and Exchange  Commission  ("SEC"),  which permits the
Funds to participate in an interfund  lending  program among certain  investment
companies  advised by the Advisor.  The  interfund  lending  program  allows the
participating  funds to  borrow  money  from and loan  money to each  other  for
temporary  or  emergency  purposes.  The  program  is  subject  to a  number  of
conditions  designed to ensure fair and equitable treatment of all participating
funds, including the following: (1) no fund may borrow money through the program
unless it receives a more favorable  interest rate than a rate approximating the
lowest  interest  rate at which  bank  loans  would be  available  to any of the
participating  funds  under a loan  agreement;  and (2) no fund may  lend  money
through  the  program  unless it  receives  a more  favorable  return  than that
available  from an  investment  in  repurchase  agreements  and,  to the  extent
applicable,  money  market  cash  swap  arrangements.  In  addition,  a fund may
participate in the program only if and to the extent that such  participation is
consistent with a fund's investment objectives and policies (for instance, money
market  funds would  normally  participate  only as lenders and tax exempt funds
only as borrowers).  Interfund  loans and borrowings may extend  overnight,  but
could have a maximum  duration of seven  days.  Loans may be called on one day's
notice.  A fund may have to borrow from a bank at a higher  interest  rate if an
interfund  loan is called or not  renewed.  Any delay in  repayment to a lending
fund could result in a lost  investment  opportunity  or additional  costs.  The
program is subject to the  oversight  and  periodic  review of the Boards of the
participating  funds. To the extent the Funds are actually  engaged in borrowing
through the interfund lending program, the Funds, as a matter of non-fundamental
policy,  may not borrow for other than temporary or emergency  purposes (and not
for  leveraging),  except  that the  Funds  may  engage  in  reverse  repurchase
agreements and dollar rolls for any purpose.                                    

Investment-Grade Bonds. A fund may purchase  "investment-grade" bonds, which are
those  rated Aaa,  Aa, A or Baa by  Moody's  or AAA,  AA, A or BBB by S&P or, if
unrated,  judged to be of  equivalent  quality  as  determined  by the  Advisor.
Moody's  considers  bonds it rates Baa to have  speculative  elements as well as
investment-grade  characteristics.   To  the  extent  that  a  fund  invests  in
higher-grade   securities,   a  fund  will  not  be  able  to  avail  itself  of
opportunities for higher income which may be available at lower grades.

Inverse Floaters.  A Fund may invest in inverse  floaters.  Inverse floaters are
debt instruments typically with a weekly floating rate of interest that bears an
inverse relationship to changes in short-term market interest rates. Investments
in this type of instrument  involve special risks as compared to investments in,
for example,  a fixed rate municipal  security.  The debt  instrument in which a
Fund  invests  may be a tender  option  bond  trust (the  "trust")  which can be
established  by a Fund,  a  financial  institution  or a broker,  consisting  of
underlying municipal  obligations.  Other investors in the trust usually consist
of money market fund investors  normally receiving weekly floating interest rate
payments who have put options with the financial institutions.  A Fund may enter
into  shortfall and  forbearance  agreements by which a Fund agrees to reimburse
the trust, in certain circumstances,  for the difference between the liquidation
value of the fixed rate municipal security held by the trust and the liquidation
value of the  floating  rate  notes.  A Fund  could lose money and its NAV could
decline as a result of investments in inverse  floaters if movements in interest
rates are incorrectly  anticipated.  Moreover,  the markets for inverse floaters
may be less  developed  and may have less  liquidity  than the  markets for more
traditional municipal securities.  A Fund's investments in inverse floaters will
not be considered  borrowing  within the meaning of the 1940 Act or for purposes
of a Fund's investment restrictions on borrowing.                               

Investment of Uninvested Cash Balances.  A Fund may have cash balances that have
not been invested in portfolio securities  ("Uninvested Cash").  Uninvested Cash
may result from a variety of sources,  including  dividends or interest received
from portfolio securities, unsettled securities transactions,  reserves held for
investment strategy purposes, scheduled maturity of investments,  liquidation of
investment securities to meet anticipated redemptions and dividend payments, and
new cash received from investors.  Uninvested  Cash may be invested  directly in
money market  instruments or other short-term debt  obligations.  Pursuant to an
Exemptive  Order issued by the SEC, a Fund may use  Uninvested  Cash to purchase
shares of affiliated  funds including money market funds,  short-term bond funds
and Cash  Management  QP Trust,  or one or more  future  entities  for which the
Advisor acts as trustee or  investment  advisor that operate as cash  management
investment  vehicles and that are excluded  from the  definition  of  investment
company  pursuant to section  3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act  (collectively,
the "Central  Funds") in excess of the  limitations  of Section  12(d)(1) of the
1940  Act.  Investment  by a Fund in  shares  of the  Central  Funds  will be in
accordance with a Fund's  investment  policies and  restrictions as set forth in
its registration statement.                                                     

Certain of the Central Funds comply with Rule 2a-7 under the 1940 Act. The other
Central Funds are or will be short-term  bond funds that invest in  fixed-income
securities  and maintain a dollar  weighted  average  maturity of three years or
less.  Each of the  Central  Funds will be managed  specifically  to  maintain a
highly liquid  portfolio,  and access to them will enhance the Funds' ability to
manage Uninvested Cash.                                                         

A Fund will invest  Uninvested  Cash in Central  Funds only to the extent that a
Fund's  aggregate  investment  in the  Central  Funds does not exceed 25% of its
total  assets.  Purchase  and sales of shares of  Central  Funds are made at net
asset value.                                                                    

Letters  of   Credit.   Municipal   obligations,   including   certificates   of
participation,  commercial paper and other short-term obligations, may be backed
by an  irrevocable  letter of credit of a bank which assumes the  obligation for
payment of principal  and  interest in the event of default by the issuer.  Only
banks which, in the opinion of the Advisor, are of investment quality comparable
to other permitted investments of a Fund may be used for letter of credit-backed
investments.                                                                    

Municipal  Securities.  Municipal  obligations  are  issued  by or on  behalf of
states,  territories  and  possessions of the United States and their  political
subdivisions,  agencies  and  instrumentalities  and the District of Columbia to
obtain funds for various public purposes.  The interest on these  obligations is
generally exempt from regular federal income tax in the hands of most investors.
The two  principal  classifications  of  municipal  obligations  are "notes" and
"bonds."                                                                        

Municipal  notes are generally used to provide for short-term  capital needs and
generally have  maturities of one year or less.  Municipal  notes  include:  Tax
Anticipation  Notes,  Revenue  Anticipation  Notes, Bond Anticipation Notes, and
Construction  Loan Notes.  Tax  Anticipation  Notes are sold to finance  working
capital needs of  municipalities.  They are generally  payable from specific tax
revenues expected to be received at a future date.  Revenue  Anticipation  Notes
are issued in expectation of receipt of other types of revenue. Tax Anticipation
Notes and  Revenue  Anticipation  Notes are  issued in  anticipation  of various
seasonal  revenue  such  as  income,   sales,  use  and  business  taxes.   Bond
Anticipation  Notes are sold to provide interim  financing and Construction Loan
Notes are sold

to provide  construction  financing.  These notes are issued in  anticipation of
long-term  financing in the market. In most cases,  these monies provide for the
repayment  of the notes.  After the  projects  are  successfully  completed  and
accepted,  many projects receive permanent financing through the Federal Housing
Administration under "Fannie Mae" (the Federal National Mortgage Association) or
"Ginnie  Mae" (the  Government  National  Mortgage  Association).  There are, of
course,  a number of other  types of notes  issued for  different  purposes  and
secured differently than those described above.                                 

Municipal  bonds,  which  meet  longer-term  capital  needs and  generally  have
maturities   of  more   than  one  year   when   issued,   have  two   principal
classifications:  "general  obligation"  bonds and "revenue"  bonds.  Issuers of
general obligation bonds include states,  counties,  cities,  towns and regional
districts.  The proceeds of these  obligations  are used to fund a wide range of
public projects  including the construction or improvement of schools,  highways
and roads,  water and sewer systems and a variety of other public purposes.  The
basic security  behind general  obligation  bonds is the issuer's  pledge of its
full faith,  credit, and taxing power for the payment of principal and interest.
The taxes that can be levied for the  payment of debt  service may be limited or
unlimited as to rate, amount or special assessments.                            

The principal  security for a revenue bond is generally the net revenues derived
from a particular  facility or group of facilities  or, in some cases,  from the
proceeds of a special excise or other  specific  revenue  source.  Revenue bonds
have been issued to fund a wide variety of capital projects including: electric,
gas, water and sewer systems;  highways,  bridges and tunnels;  port and airport
facilities;  colleges and  universities;  and hospitals.  Although the principal
security behind these bonds varies widely,  many provide additional  security in
the form of a debt  service  reserve  fund whose monies may also be used to make
principal and interest  payments on the issuer's  obligations.  Housing  finance
authorities have a wide range of security including  partially or fully-insured,
rent-subsidized  and/or collateralized  mortgages,  and/or the net revenues from
housing or other public  projects.  In addition to a debt service  reserve fund,
some  authorities  provide  further  security  in the form of a state's  ability
(without  obligation) to make up  deficiencies  in the debt reserve fund.  Lease
rental  bonds  issued by a state or local  authority  for capital  projects  are
secured  by annual  lease  rental  payments  from the state or  locality  to the
authority sufficient to cover debt service on the authority's obligations.      

Some issues of municipal bonds are payable from United States Treasury bonds and
notes or agency obligations held in escrow by a trustee, frequently a commercial
bank.  The  interest  and  principal  on  these  US  Government  securities  are
sufficient  to pay all  interest and  principal  requirements  of the  municipal
securities  when  due.  Some  escrowed  Treasury  securities  are used to retire
municipal  bonds at their  earliest  call date,  while others are used to retire
municipal bonds at their maturity.                                              

Securities purchased for a Fund may include  variable/floating rate instruments,
variable  mode  instruments,  put  bonds,  and other  obligations  which  have a
specified maturity date but also are payable before maturity after notice by the
holder ("demand  obligations").  Demand  obligations are considered for a Fund's
purposes to mature at the demand date.                                          

There are,  in  addition,  a variety of hybrid and  special  types of  municipal
obligations  as  well as  numerous  differences  in the  security  of  municipal
obligations  both within and between the two  principal  classifications  (i.e.,
notes and bonds) discussed above.                                               

An entire  issue of  municipal  securities  may be  purchased  by one or a small
number of institutional investors such as a Fund. Thus, such an issue may not be
said to be publicly offered. Unlike the equity securities of operating companies
or mutual funds which must be  registered  under the 1933 Act prior to offer and
sale  unless  an  exemption  from  such  registration  is  available,  municipal
securities,  whether publicly or privately offered,  may nevertheless be readily
marketable.  A secondary market exists for municipal  securities which have been
publicly  offered as well as  securities  which have not been  publicly  offered
initially but which may nevertheless be readily marketable. Municipal securities
purchased  for a Fund are subject to the  limitations  on holdings of securities
which are not readily marketable based on whether it may be sold in a reasonable
time consistent with the customs of the municipal  markets  (usually seven days)
at a price (or interest rate) which  accurately  reflects its recorded  value. A
Fund believes that the quality standards applicable to their investments enhance
marketability.  In addition,  stand-by commitments,  participation interests and
demand obligations also enhance marketability.

Provisions  of the federal  bankruptcy  statutes  relating to the  adjustment of
debts of political  subdivisions  and authorities of states of the United States
provide that, in certain circumstances,  such subdivisions or authorities may be
authorized to initiate bankruptcy proceedings without prior notice to or consent
of  creditors,   which   proceedings   could  result  in  material  and  adverse
modification  or  alteration of the rights of holders of  obligations  issued by
such subdivisions or authorities.                                               

Litigation challenging the validity under state constitutions of present systems
of financing  public  education has been initiated or adjudicated in a number of
states,  and  legislation has been introduced to effect changes in public school
finances  in  some  states.   In  other  instances  there  has  been  litigation
challenging  the issuance of pollution  control revenue bonds or the validity of
their  issuance  under state or federal law which  litigation  could  ultimately
affect the validity of those Municipal  Securities or the tax-free nature of the
interest thereon.                                                               

In  some  cases,  municipalities  may  issue  bonds  relying  on  proceeds  from
litigation  settlements.  These  bonds may be further  secured  by debt  service
reserve  funds  established  at the time the bonds were  issued.  Bonds that are
supported in whole or in part by expected litigation proceeds are subject to the
risk that part or all of the expected proceeds may not be received. For example,
a damage  award  could be  overturned  or reduced by a court,  or the terms of a
settlement  or damages award may allow for reduced or  discontinued  payments if
certain  conditions  are met.  As a result,  bonds  that rely on  proceeds  from
litigation proceeds are subject to an increased risk of nonpayment or default.  

For the purpose of the Funds' investment restrictions, the identification of the
"issuer" of municipal obligations which are not general obligation bonds is made
by the  Advisor  on  the  basis  of the  characteristics  of the  obligation  as
described  above,  the most  significant of which is the source of funds for the
payment of principal and interest on such obligations.                          

Municipal Lease Obligations and Participation Interests. Participation interests
represent  undivided  interests  in  municipal  leases,   installment   purchase
contracts, conditional sales contracts or other instruments. These are typically
issued  by a trust or other  entity  which has  received  an  assignment  of the
payments to be made by the state or political  subdivision  under such leases or
contracts. They may be variable rate or fixed rate.                             

Each Fund may  purchase  from banks  participation  interests  in all or part of
specific holdings of municipal obligations,  provided the participation interest
is fully  insured.  Each  participation  is backed by an  irrevocable  letter of
credit or guarantee of the selling  bank that the Advisor has  determined  meets
the prescribed quality standards of a Fund. Therefore,  either the credit of the
issuer of the municipal  obligation or the selling bank, or both,  will meet the
quality  standards  of the  particular  Fund.  A Fund has the  right to sell the
participation  back to the bank after seven days' notice for the full  principal
amount of a Fund's interest in the municipal  obligation plus accrued  interest,
but only (i) as required to provide liquidity to a Fund, (ii) to maintain a high
quality  investment  portfolio  or (iii)  upon a default  under the terms of the
municipal  obligation.  The  selling  bank  will  receive  a fee  from a Fund in
connection  with  the  arrangement.  A  Fund  will  not  purchase  participation
interests unless in the opinion of bond counsel, counsel for the issuers of such
participations  or counsel  selected  by the  Advisor,  the  interest  from such
participations  is exempt from regular  federal  income tax and state income tax
for a Fund.                                                                     

A municipal lease obligation may take the form of a lease,  installment purchase
contract  or  conditional  sales  contract  which is  issued by a state or local
government and  authorities to acquire land,  equipment and  facilities.  Income
from such  obligations  is  generally  exempt  from state and local taxes in the
state of issuance.  Municipal lease obligations frequently involve special risks
not normally  associated with general  obligations or revenue bonds.  Leases and
installment  purchase or conditional  sale contracts (which normally provide for
title in the leased asset to pass  eventually to the  governmental  issuer) have
evolved as a means for  governmental  issuers to acquire  property and equipment
without meeting the constitutional  and statutory  requirements for the issuance
of debt. The debt issuance  limitations are deemed to be inapplicable because of
the  inclusion in many leases or contracts of  "non-appropriation"  clauses that
relieve the governmental  issuer of any obligation to make future payments under
the lease or  contract  unless  money is  appropriated  for such  purpose by the
appropriate  legislative  body on a yearly or other periodic basis. In addition,
such leases or contracts may be subject to the  temporary  abatement of payments
in the event the issuer is prevented  from  maintaining  occupancy of the leased
premises or utilizing  the leased  equipment.  Although the  obligations  may be
secured by the leased  equipment or facilities,  the disposition of the property
in the event of  nonappropriation  or foreclosure  might prove  difficult,  time
consuming and costly,  and result in a delay in recovery or the failure to fully
recover a Fund's original investment.

Certain municipal lease  obligations and  participation  interests may be deemed
illiquid  for the  purpose of a Fund's  limitation  on  investments  in illiquid
securities.  Other  municipal  lease  obligations  and  participation  interests
acquired by a Fund may be determined by the Advisor to be liquid  securities for
the purpose of such limitation.  In determining the liquidity of municipal lease
obligations and participation  interests, the Advisor will consider a variety of
factors including:  (1) the willingness of dealers to bid for the security;  (2)
the number of dealers  willing to purchase or sell the obligation and the number
of other  potential  buyers;  (3) the  frequency  of trades  or  quotes  for the
obligation;  and (4) the nature of the  marketplace  trades.  In  addition,  the
Advisor  will  consider  factors  unique to  particular  lease  obligations  and
participation  interests affecting the marketability  thereof. These include the
general  creditworthiness  of the issuer,  the  importance  to the issuer of the
property  covered by the lease and the likelihood that the  marketability of the
obligation  will be maintained  throughout  the time the obligation is held by a
Fund.                                                                           

A fund may purchase participation  interests in municipal lease obligations held
by a commercial bank or other financial institution. Such participations provide
a fund  with the  right  to a pro  rata  undivided  interest  in the  underlying
municipal lease obligations.  In addition, such participations generally provide
a fund with the right to demand payment, on not more than seven days' notice, of
all  or any  part  of  such  fund's  participation  interest  in the  underlying
municipal lease obligation, plus accrued interest.                              

Participation  Interests.  A  fund  may  purchase  from  financial  institutions
participation   interests  in  securities   in  which  a  fund  may  invest.   A
participation interest gives a fund an undivided interest in the security in the
proportion that the fund's participation  interest bears to the principal amount
of the security. These instruments may have fixed, floating or variable interest
rates.  If the  participation  interest is  unrated,  or has been given a rating
below  that which is  permissible  for  purchase  by a fund,  the  participation
interest  will be backed by an  irrevocable  letter of credit or  guarantee of a
bank,  or  the  payment  obligation  will  be  collateralized  by US  Government
securities, or, in the case of unrated participation interest, determined by the
Advisor to be of  comparable  quality to those  instruments  in which a fund may
invest.  For  certain  participation  interests,  a fund  will have the right to
demand  payment,  on not more than seven days' notice,  for all or any part of a
fund's  participation  interests in the security,  plus accrued interest.  As to
these  instruments,  a fund  generally  intends to exercise  its right to demand
payment only upon a default under the terms of the security.                    

Repurchase Agreements.  A Fund may invest in repurchase  agreements,  subject to
its investment guidelines.  In a repurchase agreement, a Fund acquires ownership
of a security and simultaneously  commits to resell that security to the seller,
typically a bank or broker/dealer.                                              

A repurchase  agreement  provides a means for a Fund to earn income on funds for
periods as short as overnight.  It is an  arrangement  under which the purchaser
(i.e., a Fund) acquires a security  ("Obligation") and the seller agrees, at the
time of sale,  to  repurchase  the  Obligation  at a  specified  time and price.
Securities  subject to a repurchase  agreement are held in a segregated  account
and,  as  described  in more detail  below,  the value of the account is kept at
least equal to the repurchase  price on a daily basis.  The repurchase price may
be higher than the purchase price, the difference being income to a Fund, or the
purchase and repurchase  prices may be the same,  with interest at a stated rate
due to a Fund  together with the  repurchase  price upon  repurchase.  In either
case,  income to a Fund is  unrelated  to the  interest  rate on the  Obligation
itself. Obligations will be held by the custodian or in the Federal Reserve Book
Entry System.                                                                   

It is not clear  whether a court would  consider the  Obligation  purchased by a
Fund  subject to a  repurchase  agreement  as being  owned by a Fund or as being
collateral for a loan by a Fund to the seller.  In the event of the commencement
of  bankruptcy  or  insolvency  proceedings  with  respect  to the seller of the
Obligation before repurchase of the Obligation under a repurchase  agreement,  a
Fund may encounter delay and incur costs before being able to sell the security.
Delays may involve  loss of interest or decline in price of the  Obligation.  If
the court characterizes the transaction as a loan and a Fund has not perfected a
security  interest  in the  Obligation,  a Fund may be  required  to return  the
Obligation to the seller's estate and be treated as an unsecured creditor of the
seller. As an unsecured creditor,  a Fund would be at risk of losing some or all
of the principal and income involved in the  transaction.  As with any unsecured
debt  obligation  purchased for a Fund,  the Advisor seeks to reduce the risk of
loss through  repurchase  agreements  by analyzing the  creditworthiness  of the
obligor,  in this case the  seller  of the  Obligation.  Apart  from the risk of
bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings, there is also the risk that the seller may
fail to repurchase  the  Obligation,  in which case the Fund may incur a loss if
the proceeds to a Fund of the sale to a third party are less than the repurchase
price.  However,  if the market value  (including  interest)  of the  Obligation
subject                                                                         

11

P-->497211th Page of 358TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 211th
to the repurchase  agreement  becomes less than the repurchase  price (including
interest), a Fund will direct the seller of the Obligation to deliver additional
securities  so that the market  value  (including  interest)  of all  securities
subject to the repurchase agreement will equal or exceed the repurchase price.  

Reverse  Repurchase  Agreements.  A Fund  may  enter  into  "reverse  repurchase
agreements," which are repurchase agreements in which the Fund, as the seller of
the  securities,  agrees to  repurchase  such  securities  at an agreed time and
price.  The Fund maintains a segregated  account in connection with  outstanding
reverse  repurchase  agreements.  The Fund will  enter into  reverse  repurchase
agreements only when the Advisor  believes that the interest income to be earned
from the investment of the proceeds of the transaction  will be greater than the
interest expense of the transaction. Such transactions may increase fluctuations
in the market  value of Fund assets and its yield and may be viewed as a form of
leverage.                                                                       

Securities  Backed by  Guarantees.  The Fund may invest in securities  backed by
guarantees from banks, insurance companies and other financial  institutions.  A
money  market  fund's  ability to maintain a stable  share price may depend upon
such  guarantees,   which  are  not  supported  by  federal  deposit  insurance.
Consequently,  changes in the credit quality of these institutions could have an
adverse impact on securities they have  guaranteed or backed,  which could cause
losses to a Fund and affect its share price.                                    

Stand-by Commitments.  A stand-by commitment is a right acquired by a Fund, when
it purchases a municipal  obligation  from a broker,  dealer or other  financial
institution  ("seller"),  to  sell  up to the  same  principal  amount  of  such
securities  back to the  seller,  at a  Fund's  option,  at a  specified  price.
Stand-by  commitments  are also known as "puts." The investment  policies of DWS
High  Yield  Tax Free  Fund and DWS  Managed  Municipal  Bond  Fund  permit  the
acquisition of stand-by  commitments solely to facilitate  portfolio  liquidity.
The  exercise by a Fund of a stand-by  commitment  is subject to the ability and
willingness of the other party to fulfill its contractual commitment.           

Stand-by  commitments  acquired by a Fund will have the following features:  (1)
they will be in writing and will be physically held by the Fund's custodian; (2)
the Fund's right to exercise them will be  unconditional  and  unqualified;  (3)
they will be  entered  into only with  sellers  which in the  Advisor's  opinion
present a minimal risk of default; (4) although stand-by commitments will not be
transferable, municipal obligations purchased subject to such commitments may be
sold to a third party at any time,  even though the  commitment is  outstanding;
and (5) their exercise price will be (i) a Fund's  acquisition  cost  (excluding
any accrued interest which a Fund paid on their acquisition), less any amortized
market premium or plus any amortized original issue discount during the period a
Fund owned the  securities,  plus (ii) all  interest  accrued on the  securities
since the last interest payment date.                                           

A Fund expects that stand-by commitments generally will be available without the
payment  of any direct or  indirect  consideration.  However,  if  necessary  or
advisable,  a Fund will pay for stand-by commitments,  either separately in cash
or by paying a higher price for portfolio  securities which are acquired subject
to the commitments.                                                             

It is difficult to evaluate the likelihood of use or the potential  benefit of a
stand-by commitment.  Therefore,  it is expected that the Advisor will determine
that stand-by commitments  ordinarily have a "fair value" of zero, regardless of
whether any direct or indirect  consideration was paid.  However,  if the market
price of the  security  subject  to the  stand-by  commitment  is less  than the
exercise  price of the stand-by  commitment,  such security  will  ordinarily be
valued  at such  exercise  price.  Where  each  Fund  has  paid  for a  stand-by
commitment, its cost will be reflected as unrealized depreciation for the period
during which the commitment is held.                                            

The Advisor  understands  that the Internal  Revenue Service (the "Service") has
issued  a  favorable   revenue  ruling  to  the  effect  that,  under  specified
circumstances,  a registered  investment company will be the owner of tax-exempt
municipal  obligations  acquired  subject to a put option.  The Service has also
issued  private  letter  rulings  to  certain  taxpayers  (which do not serve as
precedent for other taxpayers) to the effect that tax-exempt  interest  received
by a regulated  investment  company  with  respect to such  obligations  will be
tax-exempt  in  the  hands  of  the  company  and  may  be  distributed  to  its
shareholders  as  exempt-interest   dividends.   The  Service  has  subsequently
announced  that it will not  ordinarily  issue advance  ruling letters as to the
identity of the true owner of property in cases involving the sale of securities
or participation  interests  therein if the purchaser has the right to cause the
security,  or the participation  interest therein, to be purchased by either the
seller or a third party.  A Fund  intends to take the position  that it owns any
municipal  obligations  acquired  subject  to a  Stand-by  Commitment  and  that
tax-exempt  interest                                                            

12

P-->497212th Page of 358TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 212th
earned with respect to such  municipal  obligations  will be  tax-exempt  in its
hands.  There is no assurance  that the Service will agree with such position in
any particular case.                                                            

Strategic  Transactions  and  Derivatives.  A Fund may,  but is not required to,
utilize various other investment  strategies as described below for a variety of
purposes,  such as hedging various market risks, managing the effective maturity
or  duration  of the  Fund's  portfolio,  or  enhancing  potential  gain.  These
strategies may be executed through the use of derivative contracts.             

In the course of pursuing these  investment  strategies,  the Funds may purchase
and  sell  exchange-listed  and  over  the  counter  put  and  call  options  on
securities,  fixed-income indices and other financial instruments,  purchase and
sell futures contracts and options thereon,  and enter into various transactions
such as swaps, caps, floors or collars  (collectively,  all the above are called
"Strategic Transactions").  In addition, Strategic Transactions may also include
new  techniques,  instruments  or  strategies  that are  permitted as regulatory
changes occur.  Strategic  Transactions may be used without limit (except to the
extent  that 80% of the  Funds'  net  assets  are  required  to be  invested  in
tax-exempt municipal  securities,  and as limited by the Funds' other investment
restrictions  and subject to certain  limits imposed by the 1940 Act) to attempt
to protect against possible changes in the market value of securities held in or
to be  purchased  for a  Fund's  portfolio  resulting  from  securities  markets
fluctuations,  to  protect  the  Fund's  unrealized  gains  in the  value of its
portfolio  securities,  to facilitate the sale of such securities for investment
purposes, to manage the effective maturity or duration of a Fund's portfolio, or
to establish a position in the derivatives markets as a temporary substitute for
purchasing or selling  particular  securities.  Some Strategic  Transactions may
also be used to enhance  potential  gain although no more than 5% of each Fund's
assets will be committed to Strategic  Transactions entered into for non-hedging
purposes.  Any or all of these investment techniques may be used at any time and
in any combination, and there is no particular strategy that dictates the use of
one technique  rather than another,  as use of any  Strategic  Transaction  is a
function of numerous variables  including market conditions.  The ability of the
Funds to utilize these Strategic  Transactions  successfully  will depend on the
Advisor's  ability  to  predict  pertinent  market  movements,  which  cannot be
assured.  The Funds will comply with  applicable  regulatory  requirements  when
implementing   these   strategies,   techniques   and   instruments.   Strategic
Transactions  will  not be used to alter  fundamental  investment  purposes  and
characteristics  of the Funds,  and a Fund will segregate assets (or as provided
by applicable regulations, enter into certain offsetting positions) to cover its
obligations under options, futures and swaps to limit leveraging of a Fund.     

Strategic  Transactions,  including derivative contracts,  have risks associated
with them  including  possible  default by the other  party to the  transaction,
illiquidity and, to the extent the Advisor's view as to certain market movements
is incorrect,  the risk that the use of such Strategic Transactions could result
in losses  greater  than if they had not been used.  Use of put and call options
may  result  in  losses  to a Fund,  force  the sale or  purchase  of  portfolio
securities  at  inopportune  times or for prices higher than (in the case of put
options)  or lower than (in the case of call  options)  current  market  values,
limit the amount of  appreciation a Fund can realize on its investments or cause
a Fund to hold a  security  it might  otherwise  sell.  The use of  options  and
futures  transactions  entails certain other risks. In particular,  the variable
degree of  correlation  between price  movements of futures  contracts and price
movements in the related  portfolio  position of a Fund creates the  possibility
that losses on the hedging  instrument may be greater than gains in the value of
that Fund's position. In addition, futures and options markets may not be liquid
in all circumstances and certain  over-the-counter  options may have no markets.
As a  result,  in  certain  markets,  a Fund  might  not be able to close  out a
transaction without incurring substantial losses, if at all. Although the use of
futures and options transactions for hedging should tend to minimize the risk of
loss due to a decline in the value of the hedged position, at the same time they
tend to limit any potential gain which might result from an increase in value of
such position.  Finally,  the daily variation  margin  requirements  for futures
contracts  would create a greater  ongoing  potential  financial risk than would
purchase  of options,  where the  exposure is limited to the cost of the initial
premium.  Losses resulting from the use of Strategic  Transactions  would reduce
net asset value, and possibly income, and such losses can be greater than if the
Strategic Transactions had not been utilized.                                   

General  Characteristics of Options. Put options and call options typically have
similar structural  characteristics and operational  mechanics regardless of the
underlying  instrument on which they are purchased or sold.  Thus, the following
general  discussion relates to each of the particular types of options discussed
in greater  detail below.  In addition,  many Strategic  Transactions  involving
options  require  segregation of Fund assets in special  accounts,  as described
below under "Use of Segregated and Other Special Accounts."

A put option gives the purchaser of the option,  upon payment of a premium,  the
right to sell, and the writer the  obligation to buy, the  underlying  security,
commodity,  index,  currency or other  instrument  at the  exercise  price.  For
instance,  a Fund's  purchase of a put option on a security might be designed to
protect its holdings in the underlying  instrument (or, in some cases, a similar
instrument)  against a substantial  decline in the market value by giving a Fund
the right to sell such  instrument at the option  exercise price. A call option,
upon payment of a premium,  gives the  purchaser of the option the right to buy,
and the seller the obligation to sell, the underlying instrument at the exercise
price.  A Fund's  purchase  of a call option on a  security,  financial  future,
index,  currency or other instrument might be intended to protect a Fund against
an  increase  in the  price of the  underlying  instrument  that it  intends  to
purchase  in the  future  by  fixing  the  price at which it may  purchase  such
instrument.  An American  style put or call option may be  exercised at any time
during  the  option  period  while a  European  style put or call  option may be
exercised only upon expiration or during a fixed period prior thereto. A Fund is
authorized to purchase and sell  exchange  listed  options and  over-the-counter
options  ("OTC  options").  Exchange  listed  options  are issued by a regulated
intermediary such as the Options Clearing Corporation ("OCC"),  which guarantees
the  performance  of the  obligations  of  the  parties  to  such  options.  The
discussion  below uses the OCC as an example,  but is also  applicable  to other
financial intermediaries.                                                       

With certain exceptions, OCC issued and exchange listed options generally settle
by physical  delivery of the  underlying  security or currency,  although in the
future cash  settlement  may become  available.  Index  options  and  Eurodollar
instruments are cash settled for the net amount,  if any, by which the option is
"in-the-money"  (i.e., where the value of the underlying  instrument exceeds, in
the case of a call  option,  or is less than,  in the case of a put option,  the
exercise  price of the option) at the time the option is exercised.  Frequently,
rather than taking or making delivery of the underlying  instrument  through the
process of  exercising  the option,  listed  options are closed by entering into
offsetting  purchase or sale transactions that do not result in ownership of the
new option.                                                                     

A Fund's ability to close out its position as a purchaser or seller of an OCC or
exchange listed put or call option is dependent,  in part, upon the liquidity of
the option market. Among the possible reasons for the absence of a liquid option
market on an exchange are: (i) insufficient trading interest in certain options;
(ii) restrictions on transactions  imposed by an exchange;  (iii) trading halts,
suspensions or other restrictions  imposed with respect to particular classes or
series of  options or  underlying  securities  including  reaching  daily  price
limits;  (iv)  interruption of the normal  operations of the OCC or an exchange;
(v) inadequacy of the facilities of an exchange or OCC to handle current trading
volume;  or (vi) a decision by one or more exchanges to discontinue  the trading
of options  (or a  particular  class or series of  options),  in which event the
relevant market for that option on that exchange would cease to exist,  although
outstanding  options on that exchange would generally continue to be exercisable
in accordance with their terms.                                                 

The hours of trading for listed  options may not coincide  with the hours during
which the underlying  financial  instruments are traded.  To the extent that the
option   markets  close  before  the  markets  for  the   underlying   financial
instruments,  significant  price  and  rate  movements  can  take  place  in the
underlying markets that cannot be reflected in the option markets.              

OTC  options  are  purchased  from  or  sold to  securities  dealers,  financial
institutions  or  other  parties  ("Counterparties")  through  direct  bilateral
agreement with the Counterparty.  In contrast to exchange listed options,  which
generally have standardized terms and performance mechanics, all the terms of an
OTC option, including such terms as method of settlement,  term, exercise price,
premium,  guarantees and security, are set by negotiation of the parties. A Fund
will only sell OTC options (other than OTC currency options) that are subject to
a buy-back  provision  permitting a Fund to require the Counterparty to sell the
option  back to a Fund at a formula  price  within  seven days.  A Fund  expects
generally  to enter  into OTC  options  that  have cash  settlement  provisions,
although it is not required to do so.                                           

Unless the  parties  provide  for it,  there is no central  clearing or guaranty
function in an OTC option.  As a result,  if the  Counterparty  fails to make or
take delivery of the security,  currency or other  instrument  underlying an OTC
option  it has  entered  into  with a Fund or  fails  to make a cash  settlement
payment due in  accordance  with the terms of that option,  a Fund will lose any
premium  it paid  for the  option  as well  as any  anticipated  benefit  of the
transaction.  Accordingly,  the Advisor must assess the creditworthiness of each
such Counterparty or any guarantor or credit  enhancement of the  Counterparty's
credit to  determine  the  likelihood  that the terms of the OTC option  will be
satisfied. A Fund will engage in OTC option transactions only with US government
securities  dealers  recognized  by

the Federal  Reserve Bank of New York as "primary  dealers," or  broker-dealers,
domestic or foreign banks or other  financial  institutions  which have received
(or the guarantors of the obligation of which have received) a short-term credit
rating of A-1 from S&P or P-1 from  Moody's  or an  equivalent  rating  from any
other nationally recognized statistical rating organization ("NRSRO") or, in the
case of OTC currency  transactions,  are  determined to be of equivalent  credit
quality by the Advisor.  The staff of the SEC currently  takes the position that
OTC options  purchased by the Fund,  and  portfolio  securities  "covering"  the
amount of a Fund's obligation  pursuant to an OTC option sold by it (the cost of
the  sell-back  plus the  in-the-money  amount,  if any) are  illiquid,  and are
subject to a Fund's  limitation  on investing no more than 15% of its net assets
in illiquid securities.                                                         

If a Fund sells a call  option,  the  premium  that it  receives  may serve as a
partial hedge,  to the extent of the option  premium,  against a decrease in the
value of the  underlying  securities  or  instruments  in its  portfolio or will
increase a Fund's income. The sale of put options can also provide income.      

A Fund may purchase and sell call  options on,  among other  things,  securities
including   US   Treasury   and  agency   securities,   municipal   obligations,
mortgage-backed  securities and Eurodollar instruments that are traded on US and
foreign  securities  exchanges  and  in  the  over-the-counter  markets,  and on
securities  indices  and  futures  contracts.  All calls  sold by a Fund must be
"covered"  (i.e., a Fund must own the securities or futures  contract subject to
the call) or must meet the asset  segregation  requirements  described  below as
long as the call is  outstanding.  Even  though a Fund will  receive  the option
premium to help  protect it against  loss,  a call sold by a Fund exposes a Fund
during  the term of the  option  to  possible  loss of  opportunity  to  realize
appreciation  in the market price of the  underlying  security or instrument and
may require a Fund to hold a security  or  instrument  which it might  otherwise
have sold.                                                                      

A Fund may  purchase  and sell put options on,  among other  things,  securities
including  US  Treasury  and  agency  securities,   mortgage-backed  securities,
municipal  obligations and Eurodollar  instruments  (whether or not it holds the
above  securities  in its  portfolio)  and on  securities  indices  and  futures
contracts other than futures on individual  corporate debt and individual equity
securities.  A Fund will not sell put options if, as a result,  more than 50% of
such Fund's  assets would be required to be  segregated  to cover its  potential
obligations  under such put options other than those with respect to futures and
options  thereon.  In selling  put  options,  there is a risk that a Fund may be
required to buy the  underlying  security at a  disadvantageous  price above the
market price.                                                                   

General  Characteristics  of Futures. A Fund may enter into futures contracts or
purchase  or sell  put and  call  options  on such  futures  as a hedge  against
anticipated  interest  rate or  fixed-income  market  changes  and for  duration
management,  risk  management  and  return  enhancement  purposes.  Futures  are
generally  bought and sold on the  commodities  exchanges  where they are listed
with payment of initial and variation  margin as described  below. The sale of a
futures contract creates a firm obligation by the seller to deliver to the buyer
the  specific  type of  financial  instrument  called for in the  contract  at a
specific  future  time for a  specified  price  (or,  with  respect  to  certain
instruments,  such as index  futures and  Eurodollar  instruments,  the net cash
amount)  and a firm  obligation  by the buyer to deliver  the  specified  price.
Options on futures contracts are similar to options on securities except that an
option on a futures  contract  gives the  purchaser  the right in return for the
premium paid to assume a position in a futures contract and obligates the seller
to deliver such position.                                                       

Each Fund has claimed  exclusion from the definition of the term "commodity pool
operator" under the Commodity Exchange Act. Therefore, the Funds are not subject
to commodity  pool  operator  registration  and  regulation  under the Commodity
Exchange  Act.  Futures and options on futures may be entered into for bona fide
hedging,  risk management (including duration management) or other portfolio and
return  enhancement  management  purposes.  Typically,   maintaining  a  futures
contract  or  selling  an  option  thereon  requires  a Fund to  deposit  with a
financial  intermediary  as security  for its  obligations  an amount of cash or
other specified  assets (initial  margin) which initially is typically 1% to 10%
of the face amount of the  contract  (but may be higher in some  circumstances).
Additional  cash or assets  (variation  margin) may be required to be  deposited
thereafter  on a  daily  basis  as the  mark-to-market  value  of  the  contract
fluctuates.  The purchase of options on financial  futures involves payment of a
premium for the option without any further  obligation on the part of a Fund. If
a Fund  exercises  an option on a futures  contract it will be obligated to post
initial margin (and  potential  subsequent  variation  margin) for the resulting
futures  position  just as it would  for any  position.  Futures  contracts  and
options thereon are generally settled by entering into an offsetting transaction
but                                                                             

15

there can be no assurance that the position can be offset prior to settlement at
an advantageous price, nor that delivery will occur.                            

A Fund will not enter into a futures  contract  or related  option  (except  for
closing transactions) if, immediately  thereafter,  the sum of the amount of its
initial margin and premiums on open futures  contracts and options thereon would
exceed 5% of a Fund's total assets  (taken at current  value);  however,  in the
case of an  option  that  is  in-the-money  at the  time  of the  purchase,  the
in-the-money  amount may be  excluded  in  calculating  the 5%  limitation.  The
segregation  requirements  with respect to futures contracts and options thereon
are described below.                                                            

Swaps, Caps, Floors and Collars.  Among the Strategic  Transactions into which a
Fund may enter are interest rate, index and other swaps and the purchase or sale
of  related  caps,  floors  and  collars.  A Fund  expects  to enter  into these
transactions primarily to preserve a return or spread on a particular investment
or portion of its  portfolio,  as a duration  management  technique,  to protect
against any increase in the price of securities a Fund anticipates purchasing at
a later date or to enhance  returns.  A Fund will not sell interest rate caps or
floors  where it does not own  securities  or other  instruments  providing  the
income  stream a Fund may be obligated to pay.  Interest  rate swaps involve the
exchange by a Fund with another party of their respective  commitments to pay or
receive  interest,  e.g.,  an exchange of floating  rate payments for fixed rate
payments  with respect to a notional  amount of  principal.  An index swap is an
agreement to swap cash flows on a notional amount based on changes in the values
of the  reference  indices.  The  purchase of a cap  entitles  the  purchaser to
receive payments on a notional  principal amount from the party selling such cap
to the extent that a specified  index exceeds a  predetermined  interest rate or
amount.  The purchase of a floor entitles the purchaser to receive payments on a
notional principal amount from the party selling such floor to the extent that a
specified index falls below a predetermined interest rate or amount. A collar is
a  combination  of a cap and a floor that  preserves a certain  return  within a
predetermined range of interest rates or values.                                

A Fund will  usually  enter  into swaps on a net basis,  i.e.,  the two  payment
streams  are  netted  out in a cash  settlement  on the  payment  date or  dates
specified in the  instrument,  with a Fund receiving or paying,  as the case may
be,  only the net  amount of the two  payments.  A Fund will not enter  into any
swap, cap, floor or collar transaction unless, at the time of entering into such
transaction, the unsecured long-term debt of the Counterparty, combined with any
credit enhancements,  is rated at least A by S&P or Moody's or has an equivalent
rating from an NRSRO or is determined to be of equivalent  credit quality by the
Advisor. If there is a default by the Counterparty,  a Fund may have contractual
remedies pursuant to the agreements related to the transaction.  The swap market
has  grown  substantially  in  recent  years  with a large  number  of banks and
investment  banking  firms  acting both as  principals  and as agents  utilizing
standardized  swap  documentation.  As a  result,  the swap  market  has  become
relatively  liquid.  Caps,  floors and collars are more recent  innovations  for
which  standardized   documentation  has  not  yet  been  fully  developed  and,
accordingly, they are less liquid than swaps.                                   

Use of Segregated and Other Special Accounts.  Many Strategic  Transactions,  in
addition to other  requirements,  require that a Fund  segregate  cash or liquid
assets with its  custodian  to the extent  Fund  obligations  are not  otherwise
"covered" through ownership of the underlying security,  financial instrument or
currency. In general,  either the full amount of any obligation by a Fund to pay
or deliver  securities or assets must be covered at all times by the securities,
instruments or currency required to be delivered,  or, subject to any regulatory
restrictions,  an amount of cash or liquid  assets at least equal to the current
amount of the obligation must be segregated  with the custodian.  The segregated
assets cannot be sold or transferred unless equivalent assets are substituted in
their place or it is no longer necessary to segregate them. For example,  a call
option written by a Fund will require a Fund to hold the  securities  subject to
the  call  (or  securities   convertible  into  the  needed  securities  without
additional  consideration)  or to segregate cash or liquid assets  sufficient to
purchase and deliver the securities if the call is exercised. A call option sold
by a Fund on an index  will  require a Fund to own  portfolio  securities  which
correlate  with the index or to  segregate  cash or liquid  assets  equal to the
excess of the index  value over the  exercise  price on a current  basis.  A put
option  written by a Fund requires that Fund to segregate  cash or liquid assets
equal to the exercise price.                                                    

Except when a Fund enters into a forward  contract for the purchase or sale of a
security denominated in a particular currency, which requires no segregation,  a
currency  contract which obligates a Fund to buy or sell currency will          

16

P-->497216th Page of 358TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 216th
generally  require that Fund to hold an amount of that currency or liquid assets
denominated in that currency equal to a Fund's  obligations or to segregate cash
or liquid assets equal to the amount of a Fund's obligation.                    

OTC options  entered into by a Fund,  including  those on securities,  currency,
financial  instruments  or  indices  and OCC issued and  exchange  listed  index
options,  will generally provide for cash settlement.  As a result,  when a Fund
sells  these  instruments  it will  only  segregate  an amount of cash or liquid
assets  equal to its accrued net  obligations,  as there is no  requirement  for
payment or delivery of amounts in excess of the net amount.  These  amounts will
equal 100% of the exercise price in the case of a non cash-settled put, the same
as an OCC guaranteed  listed option sold by a Fund, or the  in-the-money  amount
plus any sell-back  formula amount in the case of a cash-settled put or call. In
addition,  when a Fund  sells a call  option  on an  index  at a time  when  the
in-the-money amount exceeds the exercise price, a Fund will segregate, until the
option expires or is closed out, cash or cash equivalents equal in value to such
excess.  OCC issued and exchange  listed options sold by a Fund other than those
above  generally  settle with physical  delivery,  or with an election of either
physical  delivery or cash  settlement and that Fund will segregate an amount of
cash or  liquid  assets  equal to the  full  value of the  option.  OTC  options
settling with physical delivery, or with an election of either physical delivery
or cash  settlement  will be treated  the same as other  options  settling  with
physical delivery.                                                              

In the case of a futures  contract  or an option  thereon,  a Fund must  deposit
initial  margin and possible daily  variation  margin in addition to segregating
cash or liquid assets  sufficient to meet its  obligation to purchase or provide
securities  or  currencies,  or to pay the amount owed at the  expiration  of an
index-based  futures  contract.  Such liquid  assets may  consist of cash,  cash
equivalents, liquid debt or equity securities or other acceptable assets.       

With respect to swaps, a Fund will accrue the net amount of the excess,  if any,
of its obligations  over its  entitlements  with respect to each swap on a daily
basis and will segregate an amount of cash or liquid assets having a value equal
to the accrued excess.  Caps,  floors and collars require  segregation of assets
with a value equal to a Fund's net obligation, if any.                          

Strategic  Transactions  may be covered  by other  means  when  consistent  with
applicable   regulatory   policies.  A  Fund  may  also  enter  into  offsetting
transactions so that its combined position,  coupled with any segregated assets,
equals  its  net  outstanding   obligation  in  related  options  and  Strategic
Transactions.  For  example,  a Fund  could  purchase a put option if the strike
price of that option is the same or higher than the strike price of a put option
sold by a Fund. Moreover, instead of segregating cash or liquid assets if a Fund
held a futures or forward  contract,  it could purchase a put option on the same
futures or forward contract with a strike price as high or higher than the price
of the  contract  held.  Other  Strategic  Transactions  may also be  offset  in
combinations.  If the offsetting  transaction terminates at the time of or after
the primary  transaction no segregation is required,  but if it terminates prior
to such time, cash or liquid assets equal to any remaining obligation would need
to be segregated.                                                               

Tax-exempt  Custodial  Receipts.  DWS Managed  Municipal  Bond Fund may purchase
tax-exempt  custodial  receipts (the "Receipts") which evidence  ownership in an
underlying bond that is deposited with a custodian for  safekeeping.  Holders of
the Receipts  receive all payments of  principal  and interest  when paid on the
bonds.  Receipts  can  be  purchased  in an  offering  or  from  a  Counterparty
(typically an investment  bank). To the extent that any Receipt is illiquid,  it
is subject to the Fund's limit on illiquid securities.                          

Tax  Exempt  Pass-Through  Securities.  The DWS High  Yield  Tax  Free  Fund may
purchase tax exempt pass-through certificates.  These represent an interest in a
pool or group of fixed-rate long-term debt obligations issued by or on behalf of
primarily  not-for-profit  institutions,  the  interest  on which is exempt from
federal income taxation, including alternative minimum taxation. Such fixed-rate
long-term  debt  obligations  may be private  activity  bonds  issued by states,
municipalities or public authorities to provide funds, usually through a loan or
lease arrangement,  to a non-profit  corporation for the purpose of financing or
refinancing  the  construction  or  improvement  of a facility to be used by the
non-profit  corporation.  Distributions on tax exempt pass-through  certificates
may be adversely  affected by defaults in or prepayment of the  underlying  debt
obligations.  Certain tax exempt pass-through certificates are issued in several
classes  with  different  levels of yields and credit  protection.  The Fund may
invest in lower classes of tax exempt  pass-through  certificates that have less
credit protection.  Tax exempt pass-through  certificates have limited liquidity
and certain  transfer  restrictions  may apply.  There  currently  is no trading
market for tax exempt  pass-through  certificates  and there can be no assurance
that such a market will develop.

Third Party Puts. A Fund may purchase  long-term fixed rate bonds that have been
coupled with an option granted by a third party financial institution allowing a
Fund at specified  intervals  to tender (or "put") the bonds to the  institution
and receive the face value thereof (plus  accrued  interest).  These third party
puts are available in several  different  forms, may be represented by custodial
receipts or trust  certificates  and may be combined with other features such as
interest  rate swaps.  A Fund receives a short-term  rate of interest  (which is
periodically  reset),  and the interest rate differential  between that rate and
the  fixed  rate on the  bond is  retained  by the  financial  institution.  The
financial  institution  granting the option does not provide credit enhancement,
and in the  event  that  there is a  default  in the  payment  of  principal  or
interest,  or downgrading of a bond to below investment  grade, or a loss of the
bond's tax-exempt status, the put option will terminate automatically,  the risk
to a Fund will be that of holding such a long-term bond and the weighted average
maturity of that Fund's portfolio would be adversely affected.                  

These bonds coupled with puts may present the same tax issues as are  associated
with Stand-By Commitments.  As with any Stand-By Commitments acquired by a Fund,
the Fund  intends  to take the  position  that it is the owner of any  municipal
obligation  acquired subject to a third-party put, and that tax-exempt  interest
earned with respect to such  municipal  obligations  will be  tax-exempt  in its
hands.  There is no assurance  that the Service will agree with such position in
any particular case.  Additionally,  the federal income tax treatment of certain
other aspects of these  investments,  including the treatment of tender fees and
swap  payments,   in  relation  to  various  regulated  investment  company  tax
provisions is unclear.  However,  the Advisor seeks to manage a Fund's portfolio
in a manner designed to minimize any adverse impact from these investments.     

US   Government   Securities.   There   are   two   broad   categories   of   US
Government-related debt instruments:  (a) direct obligations of the US Treasury,
and (b) securities issued or guaranteed by US Government agencies.              

Examples of direct  obligations  of the US Treasury are Treasury  Bills,  Notes,
Bonds and other debt securities issued by the US Treasury. These instruments are
backed  by the  "full  faith and  credit"  of the  United  States.  They  differ
primarily in interest rates, the length of maturities and the dates of issuance.
Treasury bills have original maturities of one year or less. Treasury notes have
original  maturities  of one to ten  years and  Treasury  bonds  generally  have
original maturities of greater than ten years.                                  

Some  agency  securities  are  backed by the full faith and credit of the United
States (such as Maritime Administration Title XI Ship Financing Bonds and Agency
for  International  Development  Housing Guarantee Program Bonds) and others are
backed only by the rights of the issuer to borrow from the US Treasury  (such as
Federal Home Loan Bank Bonds and Federal National Mortgage  Association  Bonds),
while still others,  such as the securities of the Federal Farm Credit Bank, are
supported only by the credit of the issuer. With respect to securities supported
only by the credit of the issuing agency or by an additional line of credit with
the US  Treasury,  there is no  guarantee  that the US  Government  will provide
support  to such  agencies  and  such  securities  may  involve  risk of loss of
principal and interest.                                                         

US Government  securities  may include "zero coupon"  securities  that have been
stripped  by  the  US  Government  of  their  unmatured   interest  coupons  and
collateralized  obligations  issued or guaranteed  by a US Government  agency or
instrumentality.                                                                

Interest rates on US Government  obligations may be fixed or variable.  Interest
rates on variable rate obligations are adjusted at regular  intervals,  at least
annually,  according to a formula  reflecting  then-current  specified  standard
rates, such as 91-day US Treasury bill rates.  These adjustments  generally tend
to reduce fluctuations in the market value of the securities.                   

The government  guarantee of the US Government  securities in a Fund's portfolio
does not  guarantee  the net asset  value of the shares of that Fund.  There are
market  risks  inherent in all  investments  in  securities  and the value of an
investment  in  a  Fund  will  fluctuate  over  time.  Normally,  the  value  of
investments  in US  Government  securities  varies  inversely  with  changes  in
interest rates. For example,  as interest rates rise the value of investments in
US Government  securities  will tend to decline,  and as interest rates fall the
value of a Fund's investments will tend to increase. In addition,  the potential
for  appreciation  in the event of a decline in interest rates may be limited or
negated   by   increased   principal   prepayments   with   respect  to  certain
Mortgage-Backed  Securities,  such as  GNMA  Certificates.  Prepayments  of high
interest  rate  Mortgage-Backed  Securities  during times of declining  interest
rates will tend to lower the  return of a Fund and may even  result in losses to
the Fund if some securities were acquired at                                    

18

P-->497218th Page of 358TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 218th
a premium.  Moreover,  during periods of rising interest  rates,  prepayments of
Mortgage-Backed  Securities may decline,  resulting in the extension of a Fund's
average  portfolio  maturity.  As a result,  a Fund's  portfolio may  experience
greater  volatility  during  periods of rising  interest rates than under normal
market conditions.                                                              

When-Issued  Securities.  A Fund may from time to time purchase  equity and debt
securities on a "when-issued," "delayed  delivery" or "forward delivery" basis.
The price of such securities, which may be expressed in yield terms, is fixed at
the time the  commitment  to purchase is made,  but delivery and payment for the
securities  takes place at a later date.  During the period between purchase and
settlement,  no payment is made by a Fund to the issuer and no interest  accrues
to a Fund.  When a Fund purchases such  securities,  it immediately  assumes the
risks of ownership, including the risk of price fluctuation.  Failure to deliver
a security purchased on this basis may result in a loss or missed opportunity to
make an alternative investment.                                                 

To the extent that assets of a Fund are held in cash pending the settlement of a
purchase of securities,  a Fund would earn no income.  While such securities may
be sold prior to the settlement date, the Funds intend to purchase them with the
purpose  of  actually  acquiring  them  unless  a  sale  appears  desirable  for
investment  reasons.  At the time a Fund  makes the  commitment  to  purchase  a
security on this basis,  it will record the transaction and reflect the value of
the  security  in  determining  its net asset  value.  The  market  value of the
securities  may be more or less  than the  purchase  price.                     

Master/feeder Fund Structure. The Board of Trustees has the discretion to retain
the current distribution arrangement for a Fund while investing in a master fund
in a master/feeder fund structure as described below.                           

A master/feeder fund structure is one in which a fund (a "feeder fund"), instead
of investing  directly in a portfolio of securities,  invests most or all of its
investment  assets in a separate  registered  investment  company  (the  "master
fund") with  substantially  the same  investment  objective  and policies as the
feeder  fund.  Such a  structure  permits  the  pooling of assets of two or more
feeder funds,  preserving  separate  identities or distribution  channels at the
feeder  fund  level.  Based on the  premise  that  certain  of the  expenses  of
operating an investment  portfolio are  relatively  fixed,  a larger  investment
portfolio may eventually  achieve a lower ratio of operating expenses to average
net assets. An existing  investment  company is able to convert to a feeder fund
by  selling  all  of  its  investments,   which  involves  brokerage  and  other
transaction  costs and realization of a taxable gain or loss, or by contributing
its assets to the master  fund and  avoiding  transaction  costs and,  if proper
procedures are followed, the realization of taxable gain or loss.               

Portfolio Holdings Information                                                  

In addition to the public disclosure of Fund portfolio holdings through required
Securities and Exchange  Commission  ("SEC") quarterly  filings, a Fund may make
its portfolio holdings information publicly available on the DWS Funds' Web site
as  described  in  each  Fund's  prospectus.  Each  Fund  does  not  disseminate
non-public  information  about  portfolio  holdings  except in  accordance  with
policies and procedures adopted by each Fund.                                   

Each Fund's procedures permit non-public  portfolio  holdings  information to be
shared with Deutsche Asset Management and its affiliates  (collectively "DeAM"),
subadvisors, if any, custodians, independent registered public accounting firms,
attorneys,   officers  and  trustees/directors  and  each  of  their  respective
affiliates and advisers who require access to this  information to fulfill their
duties to each Fund and are subject to the duties of confidentiality,  including
the duty not to trade on non-public information,  imposed by law or contract, or
by each Fund's  procedures.  This non-public  information may also be disclosed,
subject to the  requirements  described  below,  to securities  lending  agents,
financial  printers,  proxy voting  firms,  mutual fund  analysts and rating and
tracking  agencies,  or to shareholders  in connection with in-kind  redemptions
(collectively, "Authorized Third Parties").                                     

Prior to any disclosure of each Fund's non-public portfolio holdings information
to Authorized  Third Parties,  a person  authorized by each Fund's Trustees must
make a good faith determination in light of the facts then known that a Fund has
a legitimate business purpose for providing the information, that the disclosure
is in the  best  interest  of each  Fund,  and  that the  recipient  assents  or
otherwise has a duty to keep the information confidential and to not trade based
on the  information  received  while  the  information  remains  non-public.  No
compensation is

received by each Fund or DeAM for disclosing  non-public  holdings  information.
Periodic  reports  regarding  these  procedures  will be provided to each Fund's
Trustees.                                                                       

Portfolio  holdings  information  distributed  by the trading desks of DeAM or a
subadvisor for the purpose of facilitating  efficient trading of such securities
and receipt of relevant  research is not subject to the foregoing  requirements.
Non-public   portfolio   holding   information   does  not   include   portfolio
characteristics (other than holdings or subsets of holdings) about each Fund and
information  derived therefrom,  including,  but not limited to, how each Fund's
investments are divided among various sectors, industries,  countries, value and
growth stocks,  bonds,  currencies and cash,  types of bonds,  bond  maturities,
duration,  bond coupons and bond credit  quality  ratings so long as each Fund's
holdings could not be derived from such information.                            

Registered  investment  companies  that are subadvised by DeAM may be subject to
different portfolio holdings disclosure policies,  and neither DeAM nor a fund's
Trustees  exercise  control over such policies.  In addition,  separate  account
clients of DeAM have access to their portfolio holdings and are not subject to a
fund's portfolio  holdings  disclosure policy. The portfolio holdings of some of
the funds  subadvised by DeAM and some of the separate  accounts managed by DeAM
may substantially overlap with the portfolio holdings of a fund.                

DeAM also  manages  certain  unregistered  commingled  trusts and creates  model
portfolios,  the portfolio holdings of which may substantially  overlap with the
portfolio  holdings of a fund. To the extent that investors in these  commingled
trusts  or  recipients  of model  portfolio  holdings  information  may  receive
portfolio  holdings  information  of their  trust or of a model  portfolio  on a
different basis from that on which fund portfolio  holdings  information is made
public,  DeAM has implemented  procedures  reasonably designed to encourage such
investors and recipients to keep such information  confidential,  and to prevent
those investors from trading on the basis of non-public holdings information.   

There is no assurance that a fund's  policies and procedures with respect to the
disclosure  of  portfolio  holdings  information  will  protect  a fund from the
potential  misuse of portfolio  holdings  information  by those in possession of
that information.                                                               

Regulatory Matters and Legal Proceedings                                        

On December 21, 2006,  Deutsche Asset Management  ("DeAM")  settled  proceedings
with the  Securities and Exchange  Commission  ("SEC") and the New York Attorney
General on behalf of Deutsche  Asset  Management,  Inc.  ("DAMI") and DIMA,  the
investment advisors to many of the DWS Scudder funds,  regarding  allegations of
improper  trading of fund  shares at DeAM and at the legacy  Scudder  and Kemper
organizations prior to their acquisition by DeAM in April 2002. These regulators
alleged that although the prospectuses for certain funds in the regulators' view
indicated  that the funds did not permit market  timing,  DAMI and DIMA breached
their  fiduciary  duty to those  funds in that their  efforts  to limit  trading
activity in the funds were not effective at certain times.  The regulators  also
alleged that DAMI and DIMA  breached  their  fiduciary  duty to certain funds by
entering into certain market timing  arrangements with investors.  These trading
arrangements  originated  in  businesses  that  existed  prior to the  currently
constituted  DeAM  organization,  which  came  together  as a result of  various
mergers of the legacy Scudder,  Kemper and Deutsche fund groups,  and all of the
arrangements were terminated prior to the start of the regulatory investigations
that  began in the summer of 2003.  No  current  DeAM  employee  approved  these
trading arrangements.  Under the terms of the settlements, DAMI and DIMA neither
admitted nor denied any wrongdoing.                                             

The terms of the SEC settlement, which identified improper trading in the legacy
Deutsche and Kemper mutual funds only,  provide for payment of  disgorgement  in
the  amount  of $17.2  million.  The terms of the  settlement  with the New York
Attorney  General  provide for payment of  disgorgement  in the amount of $102.3
million, which is inclusive of the amount payable under the SEC settlement, plus
a civil penalty in the amount of $20 million.  The total amount payable by DeAM,
approximately  $122.3 million,  will be distributed to funds and/or shareholders
of the affected funds in accordance with a distribution  plan to be developed by
a distribution  consultant.  The funds' investment advisors do not believe these
amounts  will have a material  adverse  financial  impact on them or  materially
affect their ability to perform  under their  investment  management  agreements
with the DWS funds.  The  above-described  amounts are not  material to Deutsche
Bank, and have already been reserved.

Among the terms of the settled orders,  DeAM is subject to certain  undertakings
regarding  the conduct of its business in the future,  including  formation of a
Code of Ethics  Oversight  Committee  to oversee all matters  relating to issues
arising  under  the  advisors'  Code of  Ethics;  establishment  of an  Internal
Compliance Controls Committee having overall compliance oversight responsibility
of the advisors; engagement of an Independent Compliance Consultant to conduct a
comprehensive review of the advisors' supervisory  compliance and other policies
and  procedures  designed to prevent  and detect  breaches  of  fiduciary  duty,
breaches  of the Code of Ethics and federal  securities  law  violations  by the
advisors and their employees; and commencing in 2008, the advisors shall undergo
a compliance review by an independent third party.                              

In addition,  DeAM is subject to certain  further  undertakings  relating to the
governance  of the mutual funds,  including  that at least 75% of the members of
the  Boards  of  Trustees/Directors  overseeing  the DWS  Funds  continue  to be
independent of DeAM; the Chairmen of the DWS Funds' Boards of Trustees/Directors
continue to be  independent  of DeAM;  DeAM  maintain  existing  management  fee
reductions  for  certain  funds  for a period  of five  years  and not  increase
management  fees for these certain funds during this period;  the funds retain a
senior  officer (or  independent  consultants,  as applicable)  responsible  for
assisting in the review of fee  arrangements  and  monitoring  compliance by the
funds and the investment advisors with securities laws,  fiduciary duties, codes
of ethics and other compliance policies,  the expense of which shall be borne by
DeAM; and periodic account  statements,  fund prospectuses and the mutual funds'
web site contain  additional  disclosure  and/or tools that assist  investors in
understanding  the fees and costs associated with an investment in the funds and
the impact of fees and expenses on fund returns.                                

DeAM has also settled proceedings with the Illinois Secretary of State regarding
market timing matters. The terms of the Illinois settlement provide for investor
education  contributions  totaling approximately $4 million and a payment in the
amount of $2 million to the Securities Audit and Enforcement Fund.              

On  September  28,  2006,  the SEC and the National  Association  of  Securities
Dealers  ("NASD")  announced  final  agreements  in  which  Deutsche  Investment
Management Americas Inc. ("DIMA"),  Deutsche Asset Management, Inc. ("DAMI") and
Scudder  Distributors,  Inc. ("DWS-SDI") (now known as DWS Scudder Distributors,
Inc.)  settled  administrative  proceedings  regarding  disclosure  of brokerage
allocation  practices in connection  with sales of the Scudder Funds' (now known
as the DWS Scudder Funds) shares during  2001-2003.  The agreements with the SEC
and NASD are reflected in orders which state, among other things,  that DIMA and
DAMI failed to disclose potential conflicts of interest to the funds' Boards and
to  shareholders   relating  to  DWS-SDI's  use  of  certain  funds'   brokerage
commissions to reduce revenue sharing costs to broker-dealer  firms with whom it
had  arrangements to market and distribute  Scudder Fund shares.  These directed
brokerage practices were discontinued in October 2003.                          

Under the terms of the  settlements,  in which DIMA,  DAMI and  DWS-SDI  neither
admitted  nor denied any of the  regulators'  findings,  DIMA,  DAMI and DWS-SDI
agreed to pay  disgorgement,  prejudgment  interest  and civil  penalties in the
total amount of $19.3 million. The portion of the settlements distributed to the
funds was approximately $17.8 million and was paid to the funds as prescribed by
the settlement  orders based upon the amount of brokerage  commissions from each
fund used to satisfy revenue sharing  agreements  with  broker-dealers  who sold
fund shares.                                                                    

As part of the  settlements,  DIMA,  DAMI and DWS-SDI  also agreed to  implement
certain measures and undertakings relating to revenue sharing payments including
making  additional  disclosures  in the funds'  Prospectuses  or  Statements  of
Additional  Information,  adopting or modifying relevant policies and procedures
and providing regular reporting to the fund Boards.                             

Additional  information announced by DeAM regarding the terms of the settlements
is available at www.dws-scudder.com/regulatory_settlements.                     

The matters alleged in the regulatory  settlements described above also serve as
the general basis of a number of private class action lawsuits involving the DWS
funds. These lawsuits name as defendants various persons,  including certain DWS
funds,  the  funds'  investment  advisors  and  their  affiliates,  and  certain
individuals,  including  in some cases fund  Trustees/Directors,  officers,  and
other parties.  Each DWS fund's  investment  advisor has agreed to indemnify the
applicable  DWS funds in connection  with these  lawsuits,  or other lawsuits or
regulatory actions that may be filed making similar allegations.                

21

P-->497221st Page of 358TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 221st
Based on currently available information, the funds' investment advisors believe
the likelihood that the pending lawsuits will have a material adverse  financial
impact on a DWS fund is remote and such  actions  are not  likely to  materially
affect their ability to perform  under their  investment  management  agreements
with the DWS funds.                                                             

 MANAGEMENT OF THE FUNDS

Investment Advisor                                                              

DIMA,  which is part of DeAM,  is the  investment  advisor  for each Fund,  with
headquarters  at 345 Park Avenue,  New York, New York.  Under the supervision of
the  Board  of  Trustees  of the  Funds,  , DIMA  makes  the  Funds'  investment
decisions,  buys and sells  securities for the Funds and conducts  research that
leads to these  purchase  and sale  decisions.  The Advisor  manages each Fund's
daily  investment and business  affairs  subject to the policies  established by
each Trust's Board of Trustees.  The Advisor is also  responsible  for selecting
brokers  and  dealers  and for  negotiating  brokerage  commissions  and  dealer
charges. The Advisor's duties are described in more detail below. DIMA, together
with its  predecessors,  has more than 80 years of  experience  managing  mutual
funds and provides a full range of investment advisory services to institutional
and retail clients.                                                             

DeAM is the  marketing  name in the US for the asset  management  activities  of
Deutsche  Bank AG,  DIMA,  Deutsche  Bank Trust  Company  Americas and DWS Trust
Company. DeAM is a global asset management organization that offers a wide range
of investing  expertise and resources,  including hundreds of portfolio managers
and analysts and an office  network  that reaches the world's  major  investment
centers.  This well-resourced  global investment platform brings together a wide
variety of experience and investment insight, across industries,  regions, asset
classes and investing styles.  DIMA is an indirect,  wholly-owned  subsidiary of
Deutsche Bank AG. Deutsche Bank AG is a major global banking institution that is
engaged in a wide range of financial services,  including investment management,
mutual fund,  retail,  private and commercial  banking,  investment  banking and
insurance.  The term "DWS Scudder" is the designation  given to the products and
services provided by DIMA and its affiliates to the DWS Mutual Funds.           

The Trustees have overall  responsibility  for the management of each Fund under
Massachusetts law.                                                              

The Advisor provides  investment  counsel for many individuals and institutions,
including  insurance  companies,  industrial  corporations,  and  financial  and
banking  organizations,  as well as  providing  investment  advice  to open- and
closed-end SEC registered funds.                                                

In certain cases the investments for a Fund are managed by the same  individuals
who manage one or more  other  mutual  funds  advised by the  Advisor  that have
similar names, objectives and investment styles. You should be aware that a Fund
is likely to differ from these other mutual funds in size, cash flow pattern and
tax matters. Accordingly, the holdings and performance of a Fund can be expected
to vary from those of the other mutual funds.                                   

Certain  investments  may be  appropriate  for a Fund and also for other clients
advised by the Advisor.  Investment  decisions  for a Fund and other clients are
made with a view to achieving their respective  investment  objectives and after
consideration  of such factors as their current  holdings,  availability of cash
for  investment  and the  size of their  investments  generally.  Frequently,  a
particular  security  may be bought or sold for only one client or in  different
amounts  and at  different  times for more  than one but less than all  clients.
Likewise,  a particular  security may be bought for one or more clients when one
or more other clients are selling the security. In addition,  purchases or sales
of the same  security  may be made for two or more  clients on the same day.  In
such event,  such  transactions  will be allocated among the clients in a manner
believed by the Advisor to be equitable to each. In some cases,  this  procedure
could have an adverse effect on the price or amount of the securities  purchased
or sold by a Fund.                                                              

22

P-->497222nd Page of 358TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 222nd
Purchase and sale orders for a Fund may be combined  with those of other clients
of the Advisor in the interest of achieving the most  favorable net results to a
Fund.                                                                           

Each Fund is  managed  by a team of  investment  professionals  who each play an
important  role in a Fund's  management  process.  Team members work together to
develop investment strategies and select securities for a Fund's portfolio. This
team works for the Advisor or its  affiliates  and is supported by a large staff
of economists,  research analysts, traders and other investment specialists. The
Advisor or its affiliates  believe(s) its team approach  benefits Fund investors
by bringing  together many  disciplines and leveraging its extensive  resources.
Team members with primary responsibility for management of the Funds, as well as
team members who have other ongoing management  responsibilities  for each Fund,
are  identified  in  each  Fund's  prospectus,  as of the  date  of  the  Fund's
prospectus.  Composition of the team may change over time, and Fund shareholders
and investors  will be notified of changes  affecting  individuals  with primary
Fund management responsibility.                                                 

In 2006,  the  Board and the  shareholders  approved  an  amended  and  restated
investment management agreement (the "Investment Management Agreement") for each
of the Funds.  Pursuant to the  Investment  Management  Agreements,  the Advisor
provides  continuing  investment  management  of the  assets  of each  Fund.  In
addition to the  investment  management of the assets of each Fund,  the Advisor
determines the  investments to be made for each Fund,  including what portion of
its assets  remain  uninvested  in cash or cash  equivalents,  and with whom the
orders for investments are placed, consistent with the Fund's policies as stated
in its Prospectus  and SAI, or as adopted by the Fund's Board.  The Advisor will
also monitor,  to the extent not monitored by the Fund's  administrator or other
agent,  the Fund's  compliance  with its investment and tax guidelines and other
compliance policies.                                                            

The Advisor  provides  assistance to the Fund's Board in valuing the  securities
and other  instruments  held by the Fund, to the extent  reasonably  required by
valuation policies and procedures that may be adopted by the Fund.              

Pursuant to the Investment Management  Agreement,  (unless otherwise provided in
the agreement or as  determined by the Fund's Board and to the extent  permitted
by applicable  law), the Advisor pays the  compensation  and expenses of all the
Board  members,  officers,  and executive  employees of the Fund,  including the
Fund's share of payroll taxes, who are affiliated persons of the Advisor.       

The  Investment  Management  Agreement  provides  that  the  Fund  is  generally
responsible  for expenses  that  include:  fees payable to the Advisor;  outside
legal,  accounting  or auditing  expenses,  including  with  respect to expenses
related to negotiation,  acquisition or  distribution of portfolio  investments;
maintenance  of books and records that are  maintained  by the Fund,  the Fund's
custodian,  or other agents of the Fund; taxes and  governmental  fees; fees and
expenses   of  the   Fund's   accounting   agent,   custodian,   sub-custodians,
depositories,  transfer  agents,  dividend  reimbursing  agents and  registrars;
payment  for  portfolio  pricing  or  valuation   services  to  pricing  agents,
accountants,  bankers and other specialists,  if any;  brokerage  commissions or
other costs of  acquiring  or disposing  of any  portfolio  securities  or other
instruments  of the  Fund;  and  litigation  expenses  and  other  extraordinary
expenses not incurred in the ordinary course of the Fund's business.            

The Investment  Management  Agreement  allows the Advisor to delegate any of its
duties under the  Agreement to a  subadvisor,  subject to a majority vote of the
Board of the Fund,  including  a  majority  of the Board who are not  interested
persons of the Fund, and, if required by applicable  law,  subject to a majority
vote of the Fund's shareholders.                                                

The  Investment  Management  Agreement  provides  that the Advisor  shall not be
liable for any error of judgment  or mistake of law or for any loss  suffered by
the Fund in  connection  with matters to which the agreement  relates,  except a
loss resulting from willful  malfeasance,  bad faith or gross  negligence on the
part of the Advisor in the performance of its duties or from reckless  disregard
by the Advisor of its obligations and duties under the agreement. The Investment
Management  Agreement may be terminated at any time, without payment of penalty,
by either party or by vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of
the Fund on 60 days' written notice.                                            

For all services provided under the Investment Management Agreements,  each Fund
pays the Advisor a fee, computed daily and paid monthly, at the annual rate as a
percentage of net assets shown below:

paid  operating  expenses of DWS  Intermediate  Tax/AMT  Free Fund to the extent
necessary to maintain the Fund's total  operating  expenses at a ratio no higher
than  0.79% for Class A shares  and 1.54% for Class B and Class C shares,  0.55%
for Institutional  Class shares.  These limitations  exclude  organizational and
offering  expenses,   taxes,  brokerage,   interest  expense  and  extraordinary
expenses.                                                                       

In 2006, the Board and  shareholders  approved a new subadvisor  approval policy
for each Fund (the "Subadvisor Approval Policy"). The Subadvisor Approval Policy
permits the Advisor,  subject to the approval of the Board, including a majority
of its  independent  board members,  to appoint and replace  subadvisors  and to
amend sub-advisory  contracts without obtaining shareholder approval.  Under the
Subadvisor Approval Policy, the Board,  including its independent board members,
will continue to evaluate and approve all new sub-advisory contracts between the
Advisor and any subadvisor,  as well as all changes to any existing sub-advisory
contract.  The Fund

cannot implement the Subadvisor  Approval Policy without the SEC either adopting
revisions  to current  rules (as it proposed to do in October  2003) or granting
the Fund exemptive relief from existing rules. The Fund and the Advisor would be
subject to certain  conditions  imposed by the SEC (and certain  conditions that
may be imposed in the future within either exemptive relief or a rule) to ensure
that the interests of the Fund and its  shareholders  are  adequately  protected
whenever the Advisor acts under the Subadvisor  Approval  Policy,  including any
shareholder notice requirements.                                                

Compensation of Portfolio Managers                                              

Each  Fund has been  advised  that the  Advisor  seeks to offer  its  investment
professionals  competitive  short-term  and  long-term  compensation.  Portfolio
managers and research professionals are paid (i) fixed base salaries,  which are
linked to job function,  responsibilities  and financial  services industry peer
comparison  and (ii)  variable  compensation,  which  is  linked  to  investment
performance, individual contributions to the team and DWS Scudder's and Deutsche
Bank's  financial  results.  Variable  compensation  may  include  a cash  bonus
incentive and  participation in a variety of long-term equity programs  (usually
in the form of Deutsche Bank equity).                                           

Bonus  and  long-term   incentives   comprise  a  greater  proportion  of  total
compensation as an investment  professional's  seniority and compensation levels
increase.  Top performing  investment  professionals  earn a total  compensation
package  that is highly  competitive,  including  a bonus that is a multiple  of
their base  salary.  The amount of equity  awarded  under the  long-term  equity
programs is generally based on the individual's total  compensation  package and
may  comprise  from  0%-40%  of  the  total  compensation  award.  As  incentive
compensation increases,  the percentage of compensation awarded in Deutsche Bank
equity also increases. Certain senior investment professionals may be subject to
a mandatory diverting of a portion of their equity compensation into proprietary
mutual funds that they manage.                                                  

To  evaluate  its  investment  professionals,  the  Advisor  uses a  Performance
Management  Process.   Objectives  evaluated  by  the  process  are  related  to
investment  performance and generally take into account peer group and benchmark
related data.  The ultimate goal of this process is to link the  performance  of
investment  professionals  with  client  investment  objectives  and to  deliver
investment   performance   that  meets  or  exceeds  clients'  risk  and  return
objectives. When determining total compensation,  the Advisor considers a number
of quantitative and qualitative factors such as:                                

o        DWS  Scudder   performance   and  the  performance  of  Deutsche  Asset
         Management, quantitative measures which include 1, 3 and 5 year pre-tax
         returns versus benchmark (such as the benchmark used in the prospectus)
         and appropriate  peer group,  taking into  consideration  risk targets.
         Additionally, the portfolio manager's retail/institutional asset mix is
weighted, as appropriate for evaluation purposes.             

o        Qualitative  measures include  adherence to the investment  process and
         individual  contributions  to  the  process,  among  other  things.  In
         addition, the Advisor assesses compliance, risk management and teamwork
skills.                                                       

o        Other factors,  including  contributions made to the investment team as
         well as  adherence  to  compliance,  risk  management,  and "living the
         values" of the Advisor,  are part of a  discretionary  component  which
         gives  management the ability to reward these behaviors on a subjective
basis through bonus incentives.                               

In addition,  the Advisor analyzes  competitive  compensation levels through the
use of extensive market data surveys. Portfolio manager compensation is reviewed
and may be modified each year as appropriate  to reflect  changes in the market,
as well as to adjust the  factors  used to  determine  overall  compensation  to
promote good sustained investment performance.

The following table shows the dollar range of shares owned  beneficially  and of
record by each member of each Fund's  portfolio  management team in each Fund as
well as in all DWS Funds as a group (i.e.  those funds advised by Deutsche Asset
Management or its affiliates),  including  investments by their immediate family
members sharing the

In  addition  to the  accounts  above,  an  investment  professional  may manage
accounts in a personal  capacity that may include  holdings that are similar to,
or the same as,  those of the Funds.  The  Advisor has in place a Code of Ethics
that is designed to address  conflicts of interest and that, among other things,
imposes  restrictions  on the ability of portfolio  managers  and other  "access
persons" to invest in securities  that may be recommended or traded in the Funds
and other client accounts.                                                      

Real,  potential  or apparent  conflicts  of interest may arise when a portfolio
manager has day-to-day  portfolio  management  responsibilities  with respect to
more than one fund or account,  including the following:                        

o        Certain investments may be appropriate for each Fund and also for other
         clients advised by the Advisor, including other client accounts managed
         by each Fund's portfolio management team.  Investment decisions for the
         Fund  and  other  clients  are  made  with a view  to  achieving  their
         respective  investment  objectives  and  after  consideration  of  such
         factors as their current holdings,  availability of cash for investment
         and the size of their investments  generally. A particular security may
         be bought or sold for only one client or in  different  amounts  and at
         different times for more than one but less than all clients.  Likewise,
         because   clients  of  the  Advisor  may  have   differing   investment
         strategies, a particular security may be bought for one or more clients
         when one or more other clients are selling the security. The investment
         results achieved for each Fund may differ from the results achieved for
         other  clients of the Advisor.  In addition,  purchases or sales of the
         same  security  may be made for two or more clients on the same day. In
         such event,  such transactions will be allocated among the clients in a
         manner  believed by the Advisor to be most  equitable  to each  client,
         generally utilizing a pro rata allocation  methodology.  In some cases,
         the allocation  procedure could  potentially  have an adverse effect or
         positive  effect on the price or amount of the securities  purchased or
         sold by each  Fund.  Purchase  and sale  orders  for  each  Fund may be
         combined  with those of other clients of the Advisor in the interest of
         achieving  the most  favorable  net  results to each Fund and the other
clients.                                                      

o        To the  extent  that  a  portfolio  manager  has  responsibilities  for
         managing  multiple client  accounts,  a portfolio  manager will need to
         divide time and attention among relevant accounts. The Advisor attempts
         to minimize these conflicts by aligning its portfolio  management teams
         by  investment  strategy and by  employing  similar  investment  models
across multiple client accounts.                              

o        In some cases, an apparent  conflict may arise where the Advisor has an
         incentive, such as a performance-based fee, in managing one account and
         not with  respect to other  accounts it manages.  The Advisor  will not
         determine  allocations based on whether it receives a performance-based
         fee from the client. Additionally, the Advisor has in place supervisory
         oversight processes to periodically monitor performance  deviations for
accounts with like strategies.                                

o        The Advisor and its affiliates and the investment team of the Funds may
         manage other mutual funds and separate  accounts on a long-short basis.
         The  simultaneous  management  of long  and  short  portfolios  creates
         potential  conflicts  of  interest  including  the risk that short sale
         activity  could   adversely   affect  the  market  value  of  the  long
         positions(and  vice versa),  the risk arising from sequential orders in
         long and short  positions,  and the  risks  associated  with  receiving
         opposing  orders at the same time.  The Advisor has adopted  procedures
         that it believes are reasonably  designed to mitigate  these  potential
         conflicts  of  interest.  Included  in these  procedures  are  specific
         guidelines  developed to ensure fair and  equitable  treatment  for all
         clients whose accounts are managed by each Fund's portfolio  management
         team. The Advisor and the portfolio  management  team have  established
         monitoring  procedures,  a protocol for supervisory reviews, as well as
         compliance  oversight  to ensure that  potential  conflicts of interest
relating to this type of activity are properly addressed.     

The Advisor is owned by Deutsche Bank AG, a  multi-national  financial  services
company.  Therefore,  the Advisor is affiliated  with a variety of entities that
provide, and/or engage in commercial banking, insurance,  brokerage,  investment
banking,  financial  advisory,  broker-dealer  activities  (including  sales and
trading),  hedge funds, real estate and private equity investing, in addition to
the provision of investment  management services to institutional and individual
investors.  Since  Deutsche  Bank AG, its  affiliates,  directors,  officers and
employees (the "Firm") are engaged in businesses  and have interests  other than
managing  asset  management  accounts,   such  other  activities  involve  real,
potential or apparent  conflicts of interest.  These  interests  and  activities
include potential  advisory,

transactional  and financial  activities  and other  interests in securities and
companies  that may be directly or indirectly  purchased or sold by the Firm for
its clients'  advisory  accounts.  These are  considerations  of which  advisory
clients  should be aware and which  may  cause  conflicts  that  could be to the
disadvantage  of the  Advisor's  advisory  clients.  The Advisor has  instituted
business and compliance  policies,  procedures and disclosures that are designed
to identify, monitor and mitigate conflicts of interest and, as appropriate,  to
report them to the Fund's Board.                                                

The Advisor may enter into  arrangements with affiliates and third party service
providers to perform  various  administrative,  back-office  and other  services
relating to client accounts.  Such service providers may be located in the US or
in non-US jurisdictions.                                                        

Codes of Ethics.  The Funds,  the Advisor and the Funds'  principal  underwriter
have each  adopted  codes of ethics  under Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act.  Board
members,  officers of the Trusts and  employees  of the  Advisor  and  principal
underwriter are permitted to make personal  securities  transactions,  including
transactions in securities  that may be purchased or held by the Funds,  subject
to requirements and restrictions set forth in the applicable Code of Ethics. The
Advisor's  Code of Ethics  contains  provisions  and  requirements  designed  to
identify and address certain  conflicts of interest between personal  investment
activities  and the interests of the Funds.  Among other  things,  the Advisor's
Code of Ethics  prohibits  certain types of transactions  absent prior approval,
imposes  time  periods  during which  personal  transactions  may not be made in
certain   securities,   and  requires  the   submission   of  duplicate   broker
confirmations  and quarterly  reporting of securities  transactions.  Additional
restrictions apply to portfolio managers,  traders, research analysts and others
involved  in the  investment  advisory  process.  Exceptions  to these and other
provisions  of the  Advisor's  Code  of  Ethics  may be  granted  in  particular
circumstances after review by appropriate personnel.                            

FUND SERVICE PROVIDERS

Administrator                                                                   

Effective  June 1, 2006,  each Fund entered into a new  administrative  services
agreement with the Advisor (the "Administrative  Services Agreement"),  pursuant
to which the Advisor  provides  administrative  services to the Fund  including,
among others,  providing the Fund with personnel,  preparing and making required
filings on behalf of the Fund,  maintaining  books and records for the Fund, and
monitoring  the  valuation  of Fund  securities.  The  services  provided by the
Advisor are described in more detail below. For all services  provided under the
Administrative   Services   Agreement,   the  Fund   pays  the   Advisor  a  fee
("Administration  Fee"),  computed  daily  and paid  monthly,  of 0.100% of each
Fund's  average  daily net assets.  For the fiscal year ended May 31, 2007,  the
Advisor received an  administrative  fee of $892,683 of which $82,020 was unpaid

Pursuant to an  agreement  between the  Administrator  and State Street Bank and
Trust Company ("SSB"),  the Administrator  has delegated certain  administrative
functions  to SSB. The costs and  expenses of such  delegation  are borne by the
Administrator, not by the Fund.                                                 

Pursuant to DeAM  procedures  approved by the Boards on behalf of the DWS funds,
proof of claim forms are  routinely  filed on behalf of the DWS funds by a third
party service provider,  with certain limited exceptions.  The Boards of the DWS
funds receive periodic reports regarding the implementation of these procedures.

Principal Underwriter                                                           

Pursuant to each Underwriting and Distribution Services Agreement ("Distribution
Agreement"),  DWS Scudder  Distributors,  Inc. ("DWS-SDI" or the "Distributor"),
222 South Riverside Plaza, Chicago, Illinois 60606, an affiliate of the Advisor,
is the principal  underwriter  and distributor for the Class A, Class B, Class C
and  Institutional  Class  shares of each Fund and acts as agent of each Fund in
the continuous  offering of its Shares. The Distribution  Agreement for DWS High
Yield Tax Free  Fund,  DWS  Managed  Municipal  Bond  Fund and DWS  Intermediate
Tax/AMT  Free Fund,  dated April 5, 2002,  was last  approved by the Trustees on
September  18,  2007.  The  Distribution  Agreement  will remain in effect until
September 30, 2008 and from year to year  thereafter  only if its continuance is
approved for each class at least  annually by a vote of the Board members of the
Fund,  including the Trustees who are not interested persons of the Fund and who
have no direct or indirect financial interest in the Distribution Agreement.    

Each  Distribution  Agreement  automatically  terminates  in  the  event  of its
assignment and may be terminated for a class at any time without penalty by each
Fund or by DWS-SDI upon 60 days' notice.  Termination  by each Fund with respect
to a class may be by vote of (i) a  majority  of the Board  members  who are not
interested  persons  of each Fund and who have no direct or  indirect  financial
interest in the Distribution  Agreement,  or (ii) a "majority of the outstanding
voting securities" of the class of each Fund, as defined under the 1940 Act. All
material  amendments  must be  approved  by the Board of  Trustees in the manner
described  above  with  respect  to  the  continuation  of  the  Agreement.  The
provisions concerning continuation,  amendment and termination of a Distribution
Agreement are on a series by series and class by class basis.                   

DWS-SDI  bears  all  of its  expenses  of  providing  services  pursuant  to the
Distribution Agreement,  including the payment of any commissions. The Fund pays
the cost for the  prospectus and  shareholder  reports to be typeset and printed
for existing shareholders,  and DWS-SDI, as principal underwriter,  pays for the
printing and distribution of copies thereof used in connection with the offering
of shares to prospective  investors.  DWS-SDI also pays for supplementary  sales
literature  and  advertising  costs.  As indicated  under  "Purchase of Shares,"
DWS-SDI retains the sales charge upon the purchase of Class A shares and pays or
allows  concessions  or  discounts  to firms for the sale of the Funds'  shares.
DWS-SDI  receives no  compensation  from the funds as principal  underwriter for
Class A and Institutional  shares.  DWS-SDI receives compensation from the Funds
as principal underwriter for Class B and Class C shares.                        

Shareholder and  administrative  services are provided to each Fund on behalf of
Class A, Class B and Class C shareholders under a Shareholder Services Agreement
(the "Services  Agreement") with DWS-SDI.  The Services  Agreement  continues in
effect from year to year so long as such continuance is approved for the Fund at
least  annually by a vote of the Board of the  applicable  Fund,  including  the
Board members who are not interested  persons of the Fund and who have no direct
or indirect financial interest in the Services Agreement. The Services Agreement
automatically terminates in the event of its assignment and may be terminated at
any time  without  penalty  by the  Fund or by  DWS-SDI  upon 60  days'  notice.
Termination  with  respect  to the  Class A, B or C shares of a Fund may be by a
vote of (i) the majority of the Board members of the Fund who are not interested
persons of the Fund and who have no direct or indirect financial interest in the
Services Agreement, or (ii) a "majority of the outstanding voting securities" of
the Class A, B or C shares,  respectively,  as defined  under the 1940 Act.  The
Services Agreement may not be amended for a class to increase materially the fee
to be paid by the Fund without approval of a majority of the outstanding  voting
securities of such class of the Fund,  and all material  amendments  must in any
event be approved by the Board of  Trustees in the manner  described  above with
respect to the continuation of the Services Agreement.

Under  the  Services   Agreement,   DWS-SDI  may  provide  or  appoint   various
broker-dealer  firms and other  service or  administrative  firms  ("firms")  to
provide  information  and services to investors  in a Fund.  Typically,  DWS-SDI
appoints  firms that provide  services  and  facilities  for their  customers or
clients who are  investors in a Fund.  Firms  appointed by DWS-SDI  provide such
office space and equipment,  telephone  facilities and personnel as is necessary
or beneficial  for providing  information  and services to their  clients.  Such
services and assistance may include,  but are not limited to,  establishing  and
maintaining   accounts  and   records,   processing   purchase  and   redemption
transactions, answering routine inquiries regarding a Fund, providing assistance
to clients in changing dividend and investment options, account designations and
addresses and such other administrative services as may be agreed upon from time
to time and permitted by applicable statute, rule or regulation.                

DWS-SDI bears all of its expenses of providing  those  services  pursuant to the
Services Agreement,  including the payment of a service fee to firms (as defined
above).  As indicated under the Rule 12b-1 Plan,  DWS-SDI receives  compensation
from the Funds for its services under the Services Agreement.                   

Rule 12b-1 Plans                                                                

Each Fund has  adopted a plan  pursuant to Rule 12b-1 under the 1940 Act (each a
"Rule 12b-1  Plan") that  provides for fees payable as an expense of the Class B
shares  and  Class C shares  that are used by  DWS-SDI  to pay for  distribution
services for those classes.  Pursuant to each Rule 12b-1 Plan,  shareholder  and
administrative  services  are provided to the  applicable  Fund on behalf of its
Class A, B and C shareholders under each Fund's Services Agreement with DWS-SDI.
Because 12b-1 fees are paid out of Fund assets on an ongoing  basis,  they will,
over time, increase the cost of an investment and may cost more than other types
of sales charges.                                                               

The Rule  12b-1  distribution  plans  for  Class B and  Class C  shares  provide
alternative methods for paying sales charges and may help funds grow or maintain
asset levels to provide  operational  efficiencies and economies of scale.  Rule
12b-1  service  plans  provide  compensation  to DWS-SDI or  intermediaries  for
post-sales  servicing.  Since  each  Distribution  Agreement  provides  for fees
payable as an expense of the Class B shares and the Class C shares that are used
by DWS-SDI to pay for distribution and services for those classes, the agreement
is  approved  and  reviewed  separately  for the Class B shares  and the Class C
shares in  accordance  with Rule 12b-1 under the 1940 Act,  which  regulates the
manner in which an  investment  company may,  directly or  indirectly,  bear the
expenses of  distributing  its shares.  The  Distribution  Agreement  may not be
amended to increase the fee to be paid by a Fund with respect to a class without
approval by a majority of the outstanding voting securities of such class of the
Fund. Similarly,  the Services Agreement is approved and reviewed separately for
the Class A shares,  Class B shares and Class C shares in  accordance  with Rule
12b-1.                                                                          

If a Rule 12b-1 Plan is terminated in accordance with its terms,  the obligation
of the  applicable  Fund to make payments to DWS-SDI  pursuant to the Rule 12b-1
Plan will  cease  and the Fund will not be  required  to make any  payments  not
previously accrued past the termination date. Thus, there is no legal obligation
for a Fund to pay any expenses  incurred by DWS-SDI  other than fees  previously
accrued  and payable  under a Rule 12b-1 Plan,  if for any reason the Rule 12b-1
Plan is  terminated  in  accordance  with its terms.  Future fees under the Rule
12b-1  Plan may or may not be  sufficient  to  cover  DWS-SDI  for its  expenses
incurred. On the other hand, under certain circumstances,  DWS-SDI might collect
in the  aggregate  over  certain  periods more in fees under the Rule 12b-1 Plan
than it has expended  over that same period in providing  distribution  services
for a Fund. In connection with Class B shares, for example,  if shares of a Fund
were to  appreciate  (resulting  in greater  asset base against which Rule 12b-1
fees are charged) and sales of the Fund's  shares were to decline  (resulting in
lower  expenditures  by DWS-SDI  under the Rule 12b-1 Plan),  fees payable could
exceed expenditures.  This may also happen over certain periods shorter than the
life of the Rule 12b-1 Plan  simply due to the timing of  expenses  incurred  by
DWS-SDI that is not matched to the timing of revenues  received  (e.g.,  a sales
commission may be paid by DWS-SDI  related to an investment in year 1, while the
Rule 12b-1 fee to DWS-SDI  related to that  investment  may accrue during year 1
through year 6 prior to  conversion of the  investment to Class A shares).  As a
result,  if DWS-SDI's  expenses are less than the Rule 12b-1 fees,  DWS-SDI will
retain its full fees and make a profit.

Class B and Class C Shares.  For its services under the Distribution  Agreement,
DWS-SDI  receives  a fee from  each  Fund  under its Rule  12b-1  Plan,  payable
monthly,  at the annual  rate of 0.75% of  average

daily net  assets of the Fund  attributable  to its Class B shares.  This fee is
accrued  daily as an  expense  of Class B  shares.  DWS-SDI  also  receives  any
contingent  deferred sales charges paid with respect to Class B shares.  DWS-SDI
currently  compensates firms for sales of Class B shares at a commission rate of
3.75%.                                                                          

For its services under the Distribution  Agreement,  DWS-SDI receives a fee from
each Fund under its Rule 12b-1  Plan,  payable  monthly,  at the annual  rate of
0.75% of average  daily net assets of the Fund  attributable  to Class C shares.
This fee is accrued  daily as an expense  of Class C shares.  DWS-SDI  currently
advances  to firms the  first  year  distribution  fee at a rate of 0.75% of the
purchase  price of Class C shares.  Effective  January 1, 2006,  DWS-SDI will no
longer  advance  the first year  distribution  fee to firms for sales of Class C
shares  to   employer-sponsored   employee  benefit  plans  using  the  OmniPlus
subaccount  record  keeping  system made  available  through ADP, Inc.  under an
alliance  with  DWS-SDI and its  affiliates.  For periods  after the first year,
DWS-SDI  currently  pays firms for sales of Class C shares a  distribution  fee,
payable  quarterly,  at an annual  rate of 0.75% of net assets  attributable  to
Class C shares  maintained  and serviced by the firm.  This fee continues  until
terminated  by  DWS-SDI  or the  applicable  Fund.  DWS-SDI  also  receives  any
contingent deferred sales charges paid with respect to Class C shares.          

Shareholder Services                                                            

Class A,  Class B and  Class C  Shares.  For its  services  under  the  Services
Agreement,  DWS-SDI  receives a shareholder  services fee from each Fund under a
Rule  12b-1  Plan,  payable  monthly,  at an  annual  rate of up to 0.25% of the
average daily net assets of Class A, B and C shares of that Fund.               

With respect to Class A Shares of a Fund,  DWS-SDI pays each firm a service fee,
payable  quarterly,  at an annual  rate of up to 0.25% of the net assets in Fund
accounts  that it  maintains  and services  attributable  to Class A Shares of a
Fund, commencing with the month after investment.                               

With respect to Class B and Class C Shares of a Fund, DWS-SDI currently advances
to firms the  first-year  service  fee at a rate of up to 0.25% of the  purchase
price of such shares.  Effective January 1, 2006, DWS-SDI will no longer advance
the  first  year   service  fee  to  firms  for  sales  of  Class  C  shares  to
employer-sponsored  employee benefit plans using the OmniPlus  subaccount record
keeping system made  available  through ADP, Inc. under an alliance with DWS-SDI
and its affiliates.  For periods after the first year, DWS-SDI currently intends
to pay firms a service fee at a rate of up to 0.25% (calculated monthly and paid
quarterly) of the net assets  attributable  to Class B and Class C shares of the
Fund  maintained  and serviced by the firm.  Firms to which  service fees may be
paid include affiliates of DWS-SDI.  In addition DWS-SDI may, from time to time,
pay  certain  firms  from  it  own  resources  additional  amounts  for  ongoing
administrative  services and assistance  provided to their customers and clients
who are shareholders of a Fund.                                                 

DWS-SDI also may provide  some of the above  services and may retain any portion
of the fee under the Services  Agreement not paid to firms to compensate  itself
for shareholder or administrative functions performed for a Fund. Currently, the
shareholder  services  fee payable to DWS-SDI is payable at an annual rate of up
to 0.25% of net  assets  based  upon Fund  assets in  accounts  for which a firm
provides  administrative  services and at the annual rate of 0.15% of net assets
based upon Fund assets in accounts  for which there is no firm of record  (other
than DWS-SDI) listed on a Fund's records. The effective shareholder services fee
rate to be charged  against all assets of each Fund while this  procedure  is in
effect will depend upon the  proportion  of Fund assets that is held in accounts
for  which a firm of record  provides  shareholder  services.  The Board of each
Fund,  in its  discretion,  may approve  basing the fee to DWS-SDI at the annual
rate of 0.25% on all Fund assets in the future.

Custodian, Transfer Agent and Shareholder Service Agent                         

State Street Bank and Trust Company,  (the "Custodian") 225 Franklin St. Boston,
MA 02110,  serves as Custodian to the Funds.  The Custodian's fee may be reduced
by certain earnings credits in favor of each Fund.  Custodian fees of $177, $271
and $428 were not imposed on DWS High Yield Tax Free Fund, DWS Managed Municipal
Bond Fund and DWS  Intermediate  Tax/AMT  Free Fund,  respectively,  after these
credits were applied for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2007.                    

DWS Scudder  Investments  Service Company  ("DWS-SISC" or the "Transfer Agent"),
210 W. 10th  Street,  Kansas  City,  Missouri 64105-1614,  an  affiliate of the
Advisor,  is the transfer agent,  dividend-paying  agent and shareholder service
agent for all classes of each Fund.                                             

The Transfer  Agent receives an annual service fee for each account of the Fund,
based on the type of account.  For open retail  accounts,  the fee is a flat fee
ranging from $20.00 to $27.50 per account,  for open  wholesale  money funds the
fee is $32.50 per account, while for certain retirement accounts serviced on the
recordkeeping system of ADP, Inc., the fee is a flat fee up to $3.46 per account
(as of October  2006,  indexed to  inflation)  plus an asset  based fee of up to
0.25% of  average  net  assets.  1/12th of the  annual  service  charge for each
account is  charged  and  payable to the  Transfer  Agent each  month.  A fee is
charged for any account  which at any time during the month had a share  balance
in the  Fund.  Smaller  fees are also  charged  for  closed  accounts  for which
information  must be retained on the Transfer Agent's system for up to 18 months
after closing for tax reporting purposes.                                       

Certain  out-of-pocket  expenses  incurred  by  the  Transfer  Agent,  including
expenses of printing and mailing  routine fund  disclosure  documents,  costs of
record retention and transaction  processing costs are reimbursed by the Fund or
are paid  directly  by the  Fund.  Certain  additional  out-of-pocket  expenses,
including costs of computer  hardware and software,  third party  record-keeping
and processing of proxy statements,  may only be reimbursed by the Fund with the
prior approval of the Fund's Board.                                             

Pursuant to a sub-transfer  agency  agreement  between DWS-SISC and DST Systems,
Inc. ("DST"),  DWS-SISC had delegated certain transfer agent and dividend paying
agent  functions to DST. The costs and expenses of such  delegation  are born by
DWS-SISC, not by a Fund.                                                        

Each Fund, or the Advisor (including any affiliate of the Advisor), or both, may
pay   unaffiliated   third  parties  for  providing   recordkeeping   and  other
administrative  services with respect to accounts of  participants in retirement
plans or other  beneficial  owners of Fund shares whose  interests are generally
held in an omnibus account.                                                     

PORTFOLIO TRANSACTIONS

The Advisor is generally responsible for placing the orders for the purchase and
sale of portfolio  securities,  including  the  allocation  of  brokerage.  With
respect to those  funds for which a  sub-investment  advisor  manages the fund's
investments,  references in this section to the "Advisor" should be read to mean
the Sub-Advisor, except as noted below.                                         

The  policy of the  Advisor  in  placing  orders  for the  purchase  and sale of
securities  for the Funds is to seek best  execution,  taking into  account such
factors,   among  others,   as  price;   commission  (where   applicable);   the
broker-dealer's   ability  to  ensure  that  securities  will  be  delivered  on
settlement date; the willingness of the  broker-dealer to commit its capital and
purchase  a  thinly  traded   security  for  its  own  inventory;   whether  the
broker-dealer   specializes  in  block  orders  or  large  program  trades;  the
broker-dealer's  knowledge of the market and the security;  the  broker-dealer's
ability  to  maintain   confidentiality;   the   financial   condition   of  the
broker-dealer;   and  whether  the  broker-dealer  has  the  infrastructure  and
operational  capabilities to execute and settle the trade.  The Advisor seeks to
evaluate the overall  reasonableness  of brokerage  commissions with commissions
charged on comparable  transactions  and compares the brokerage  commissions (if
any) paid by the Funds to  reported  commissions  paid by  others.  The  Advisor
routinely reviews commission rates,  execution and settlement services performed
and makes internal and external comparisons.

Commission  rates  on  transactions  in  equity  securities  on U.S.  securities
exchanges are subject to negotiation. Commission rates on transactions in equity
securities on foreign  securities  exchanges are generally fixed.  Purchases and
sales of  fixed-income  securities and certain  over-the-counter  securities are
effected  on  a  net  basis,  without  the  payment  of  brokerage  commissions.
Transactions  in  fixed  income  and  certain  over-the-counter  securities  are
generally  placed by the  Advisor  with the  principal  market  makers for these
securities  unless the Advisor  reasonably  believes more favorable  results are
available elsewhere.  Transactions with dealers serving as market makers reflect
the spread between the bid and asked prices.  Purchases of  underwritten  issues
will  include  an  underwriting  fee  paid  to  the  underwriter.  Money  market
instruments are normally purchased in principal  transactions  directly from the
issuer or from an underwriter or market maker.                                  

It is  likely  that the  broker-dealers  selected  based  on the  considerations
described in this section will include  firms that also sell shares of the Funds
to their  customers.  However,  the Advisor does not consider sales of shares of
the Funds as a factor in the selection of  broker-dealers  to execute  portfolio
transactions  for the Funds  and,  accordingly,  has  implemented  policies  and
procedures  reasonably designed to prevent its traders from considering sales of
shares of the Funds as a factor in the  selection of  broker-dealers  to execute
portfolio transactions for the Funds.                                           

The Advisor is  permitted  by Section  28(e) of the  Securities  Exchange Act of
1934, as amended ("1934 Act"), when placing  portfolio  transactions for a Fund,
to cause the Fund to pay brokerage  commissions  in excess of that which another
broker-dealer might charge for executing the same transaction in order to obtain
research and brokerage  services if the Advisor determines that such commissions
are  reasonable in relation to the overall  services  provided.  The Advisor may
from  time to time,  in  reliance  on  Section  28(e) of the 1934  Act,  execute
portfolio  transactions with  broker-dealers that provide research and brokerage
services to the Advisor.  Consistent  with the Advisor's  policy  regarding best
execution,  where more than one broker is  believed  to be capable of  providing
best execution for a particular  trade, the Advisor may take into  consideration
the receipt of research and brokerage services in selecting the broker-dealer to
execute  the trade.  Although  certain  research  and  brokerage  services  from
broker-dealers may be useful to a Fund and to the Advisor,  it is the opinion of
the Advisor that such information only supplements its own research effort since
the  information  must still be analyzed,  weighed and reviewed by the Advisor's
staff.  Research and brokerage  services  received from a  broker-dealer  may be
useful to the  Advisor in  providing  services  to  clients  other than the Fund
making  the  trade,  and not all  such  information  is used by the  Advisor  in
connection with such Fund. Conversely,  such information provided to the Advisor
by  broker-dealers  through which other clients of the Advisor effect securities
transactions may be useful to the Advisor in providing services to a Fund.      

Research and brokerage services provided by broker-dealers may include,  but are
not limited to,  information on the economy,  industries,  groups of securities,
individual   companies,   statistical   information,   accounting  and  tax  law
interpretations,  political developments, legal developments affecting portfolio
securities,  technical  market action,  pricing and appraisal  services,  credit
analysis,  risk measurement  analysis,  performance analysis and measurement and
analysis of corporate responsibility issues. Research and brokerage services are
typically  received  in the  form of  written  reports,  access  to  specialized
financial  publications,  and personal meetings with security analysts,  but may
also be provided in the form of access to various computer software and meetings
arranged with corporate and industry representatives.                           

The Advisor may also select  broker-dealers  and obtain from them  research  and
brokerage  services that are used in connection  with executing  trades provided
that such services are consistent  with  interpretations  under Section 28(e) of
the 1934 Act.  Typically,  these  services  take the form of  computer  software
and/or  electronic  communication  services  used by the  Advisor to  facilitate
trading activity with those broker-dealers.                                     

Research and brokerage services may include products obtained from third parties
if the Advisor determines that such product or service constitutes brokerage and
research as defined in Section 28(e) and interpretations thereunder.  Currently,
it  is  the  Advisor's  policy  that  Sub-Advisors  may  not  execute  portfolio
transactions on behalf of the Funds to obtain third party research and brokerage
services.  The  Advisor  may, in the future,  change  this  policy.  Regardless,
certain  Sub-Advisors may, as matter of internal policy, limit or preclude third
party research and brokerage services.                                          

DIMA will  monitor  regulatory  developments  and market  practice in the use of
client  commissions to obtain research and brokerage services and may adjust its
portfolio transactions policies in response thereto.

Investment  decisions for each Fund and for other investment accounts managed by
the  Advisor  are  made  independently  of each  other  in  light  of  differing
conditions. However, the same investment decision may be made for two or more of
such accounts. In such cases,  simultaneous  transactions are inevitable. To the
extent  permitted by law, the Advisor may aggregate the securities to be sold or
purchased  for a Fund with those to be sold or purchased  for other  accounts in
executing  transactions.  Purchases  or sales are then  averaged as to price and
commission  and  allocated  as to amount in a manner  deemed  equitable  to each
account.  While in some cases this practice  could have a detrimental  effect on
the price  paid or  received  by,  or on the size of the  position  obtained  or
disposed of for,  the Fund,  in other  cases it is believed  that the ability to
engage in volume transactions will be beneficial to the Fund.                   

DIMA and its affiliates and the Funds' management team manage other mutual funds
and separate accounts,  some of which use short sales of securities as a part of
its  investment  strategy.  The  simultaneous   management  of  long  and  short
portfolios creates potential conflicts of interest including the risk that short
sale activity could adversely affect the market value of the long positions (and
vice  versa),  the  risk  arising  from  sequential  orders  in long  and  short
positions,  and the risks associated with receiving  opposing orders at the same
time.                                                                           

DIMA has adopted procedures that it believes are reasonably designed to mitigate
these  potential  conflicts  of interest.  Incorporated  in the  procedures  are
specific  guidelines  developed to ensure fair and  equitable  treatment for all
clients. DIMA and the investment team have established monitoring procedures and
a protocol for supervisory  reviews,  as well as compliance  oversight to ensure
that  potential  conflicts  of interest  relating  to this type of activity  are
properly addressed.                                                             

Deutsche Bank AG or one of its affiliates (or in the case of a Sub-Advisor,  the
Sub-Advisor  or one of its  affiliates)  may act as a broker  for the  Funds and
receive brokerage commissions or other transaction-related compensation from the
Funds in the purchase and sale of securities, options or futures contracts when,
in the judgment of the Advisor,  and in accordance with  procedures  approved by
the Funds'  Boards,  the  affiliated  broker  will be able to obtain a price and
execution at least as favorable as those obtained from other  qualified  brokers
and if, in the  transaction,  the  affiliated  broker  charges  the Funds a rate
consistent  with that charged to  comparable  unaffiliated  customers in similar
transactions.                                                                   

The following shows total brokerage  commissions  paid for the past three fiscal
years:                                                                          

DWS High Yield Tax Free Fund: For the fiscal years ended May 31, 2007,  2006 and
2005, the Fund paid $0, $0 and $10,314 in commissions, respectively.            

DWS Managed  Municipal Bond Fund: For the fiscal years ended May 31, 2007,  2006
and 2005, the Fund paid $0, $2,448 and $70,452 in commissions, respectively.    

DWS  Intermediate  Tax/AMT  Free Fund:  For the fiscal years ended May 31, 2007,
2006 and 2005, the Fund paid $0, $0 and $6,858 in commissions, respectively.    

The Funds did not pay any affiliated  brokerage  commissions for the fiscal year

Each Fund is required to identify  any  securities  of its  "regular  brokers or
dealers" (as such term is defined in the 1940 Act) that the Funds have  acquired
during the most recent fiscal year.  As of May 31, 2007,  the Funds did not hold
any securities of their regular broker dealers.                                 

Portfolio Turnover                                                              

Portfolio  turnover  rate is  defined  by the SEC as the ratio of the  lesser of
sales or purchases to the monthly average value of such securities  owned during
the year,  excluding all securities  whose  remaining  maturities at the time of
acquisition were one year or less.

Higher levels of activity by a Fund result in higher  transaction  costs and may
also  result  in  taxes on  realized  capital  gains  to be borne by the  Fund's
shareholders.  Purchases and sales are made whenever necessary, in the Advisor's
discretion, to meet a Fund's objective.                                         

Portfolio turnover rates for the two most recent fiscal years are as follows:   

                                          2007          2006

 PURCHASE AND REDEMPTION OF SHARES

General Information                                                             

Policies and procedures affecting  transactions in Fund shares can be changed at
any  time  without  notice,  subject  to  applicable  law.  Transactions  may be
contingent  upon proper  completion of application  forms and other documents by
shareholders  and  their  receipt  by a Fund's  agents.  Transaction  delays  in
processing (and changing account features) due to circumstances within or beyond
the control of a Fund and its agents may occur. Shareholders (or their financial
service  firms)  are  responsible  for all losses  and fees  resulting  from bad
checks,  cancelled  orders or the failure to  consummate  transactions  effected
pursuant to instructions reasonably believed to be genuine.                     

A  distribution  will be  reinvested in shares of the same Fund and class if the
distribution check is returned as undeliverable.                                

Information  regarding  tax-deferred  retirement  plans is not applicable to the
Funds.                                                                          

Orders will be  confirmed at a price based on the net asset value of a Fund next
determined  after receipt in good order by DWS-SDI of the order  accompanied  by
payment.  Orders received by dealers or other financial  services firms prior to
the determination of net asset value and received in good order by DWS-SDI prior
to the  determination  of net asset value will be  confirmed at a price based on
the net asset value next determined after receipt by DWS-SDI ("trade date").    

Certificates. Share certificates will not be issued. Share certificates now in a
shareholder's  possession may be sent to the Transfer Agent for cancellation and
book-entry  credit to such  shareholder's  account.  Certain telephone and other
procedures   require   book-entry   holdings.   Shareholders   with  outstanding
certificates bear the risk of loss.                                             

Use of Financial  Services  Firms.  Investment  dealers and other firms  provide
varying  arrangements  for their clients to purchase and redeem a Fund's shares,
including higher minimum investments,  and may assess transaction or other fees.
Firms may arrange  with their  clients for other  investment  or  administrative
services.  Such firms may independently  establish and charge additional amounts
to their  clients  for such  services.  Firms  also may hold a Fund's  shares in
nominee or street  name as agent for and on behalf of their  customers.  In such
instances, a Fund's transfer agent, DWS Scudder Investments Service Company (the
"Transfer  Agent") will have no information  with respect to or control over the
accounts of specific shareholders.  Such shareholders may obtain access to their
accounts and information  about their accounts only from their firm.  Certain of
these firms may receive compensation from a Fund through the Shareholder Service
Agent for  record-keeping and other expenses relating to these nominee accounts.
In addition,  certain  privileges with respect to the purchase and redemption of
shares or the reinvestment of dividends may not be available through such firms.
Some firms may  participate in a program  allowing them access to their clients'
accounts for servicing including, without limitation,  transfers of registration
and dividend  payee  changes;  and may perform  functions  such as generation of
confirmation  statements  and  disbursement  of  cash  dividends.   Such  firms,
including  affiliates of DWS-SDI,  may receive  compensation from a Fund through
the Shareholder Service Agent for these services.

The Fund has authorized one or more financial  service  institutions,  including
certain members of the Financial Industry  Regulatory  Authority ("FINRA") other
than  the  Distributor  ("financial  institutions"),   to  accept  purchase  and
redemption  orders for the Fund's shares.  Such financial  institutions may also
designate other parties, including plan administrator intermediaries,  to accept
purchase and  redemption  orders on the Fund's  behalf.  Orders for purchases or
redemptions will be deemed to have been received by the Fund when such financial
institutions or, if applicable,  their  authorized  designees accept the orders.
Subject  to the  terms  of the  contract  between  the  Fund  and the  financial
institution, ordinarily orders will be priced at the Fund's net asset value next
computed  after  acceptance  by such  financial  institution  or its  authorized
designees and accepted by the Fund.  Further, if purchases or redemptions of the
Fund's  shares are arranged and  settlement  is made at an  investor's  election
through any other authorized financial  institution,  that financial institution
may,  at  its  discretion,   charge  a  fee  for  that  service.  The  Board  of
Trustees/Directors  and the Distributor,  also the Fund's principal underwriter,
each has the right to limit the  amount of  purchases  by, and to refuse to sell
to, any  person.  The  Trustees/Directors  and the  Distributor  may  suspend or
terminate the offering of shares of the Fund at any time for any reason.        

DWS-SDI has adopted an Incentive Plan (the "Plan") covering wholesalers that are
regional vice presidents  ("DWS Scudder  Wholesalers").  Generally,  DWS Scudder
Wholesalers  market shares of the DWS funds to your  financial  advisor,  who in
turn may  recommend  that you  purchase  shares  of a DWS  fund.  The Plan is an
incentive program that combines a monthly  incentive  component with a quarterly
strategic bonus component.  Under the Plan, DWS Scudder Wholesalers will receive
a monetary  monthly  incentive based on the amount of sales generated from their
marketing of the funds,  and that incentive will differ depending on the product
category  of  the  fund.   Each  fund  is  assigned  to  one  of  four   product
categories--"Core," "Strategic," "Satellite"   or   "Non-CSS"-taking   into
consideration, among other things, the following criteria, where applicable:    

o        The Fund's 3-year performance;                                         
o        The Fund's Morningstar rating;                                         
o        Market size for the fund category;                                     
o        The Fund's size, including sales and redemptions of the Fund's shares; 
o        The length of time the Fund's Portfolio Managers have managed the Fund;
and                                                           
o        The Fund's consistency with DWS Scudder's branding.                    

This  information  and other factors are  presented to a committee  comprised of
representatives  from  various  groups  within  DWS  Scudder,  who  review  on a
quarterly basis the funds assigned to each product category described above, and
make any  changes to those  assignments  at that time.  No one  factor,  whether
positive or negative,  determines a fund's  placement in a given  category;  all
these factors together are considered, and the designation of funds in the Core,
Strategic and Satellite categories represents management's judgment based on the
above criteria.  In addition,  management may consider a fund's profile over the
course  of  several  review  periods  before  making  a change  to its  category
assignment.  These  category  assignments  will be posted  quarterly  to the DWS
funds' Web site at www.dws-scudder.com, approximately one month after the end of
each quarter.  DWS Scudder Wholesalers will receive the highest compensation for
Core and Strategic  funds,  less for Satellite  funds and the lowest for Non-CSS
funds.                                                                          

In the normal course of business,  DWS Scudder will from time to time  introduce
new funds into the DWS family of funds. As a general rule, all new funds will be
placed in the  Strategic  compensation  category  for a  minimum  period of four
consecutive quarters, and DWS Scudder Wholesalers will be paid at a rate that is
equivalent to that of the Core Fund  category.  After that four quarter  period,
each new fund in the  Strategic  category  will be reviewed by the committee and
either  assigned to one of the four  categories or continued as a Strategic fund
at that time.                                                                   

The prospect of receiving,  or the receipt of, additional  compensation by a DWS
Scudder  Wholesaler  under the Plan may provide an incentive to favor  marketing
the Core,  Strategic  or  Satellite  funds  over the  Non-CSS  funds.  The Plan,
however,  will not change  the price that you pay for shares of a fund.  The DWS
Scudder  Compliance  Department  monitors DWS Scudder Wholesaler sales and other
activity  in an  effort  to  detect  unusual  activity  in  the  context  of the
compensation  structure under the Plan. However,  investors may wish to take the
Plan  and the  product  category  of the  fund  into  account  when  considering
purchasing a fund or evaluating any recommendations relating to fund shares.

Telephone  and  Electronic  Transaction  Procedures.  Shareholders  have various
telephone,  Internet, wire and other electronic privileges available.  Each Fund
or its agents will not be liable for any losses,  expenses or costs  arising out
of fraudulent or unauthorized  instructions pursuant to these privileges if that
Fund or its  agents  reasonably  believe,  based  upon  reasonable  verification
procedures, that the instructions were genuine.  Verification procedures include
recording instructions,  requiring certain identifying information before acting
upon instructions and sending written  confirmations.  During periods when it is
difficult to contact the  Shareholder  Service Agent, it may be difficult to use
telephone, wire and other privileges.                                           

QuickBuy and QuickSell. QuickBuy and QuickSell permits the transfer of money via
the Automated  Clearing House System (minimum $50 and maximum  $250,000) from or
to a shareholder's bank, savings and loan, or credit union account in connection
with the purchase or  redemption  of Fund shares.  Shares  purchased by check or
through  QuickBuy and QuickSell or Direct Deposit may not be redeemed under this
privilege  until  such  shares  have been owned for at least 10  calendar  days.
QuickBuy and QuickSell cannot be used with passbook savings accounts.           

Share Pricing.  Purchases will be filled without a sales charge at the net asset
value per share next computed  after receipt of the  application  in good order.
Net asset  value  normally  will be  computed  for each class as of the close of
regular  trading on the  Exchange on each day during  which the Exchange is open
for trading.  Orders received after the close of regular trading on the Exchange
will be executed at the next  business  day's net asset value.  If the order has
been  placed by a member of the  FINRA,  other than the  Distributor,  it is the
responsibility of the member broker, rather than a Fund, to forward the purchase
order to the  transfer  agent in Kansas City by the close of regular  trading on
the Exchange.                                                                   

Purchases                                                                       

Each Fund reserves the right to withdraw all or any part of the offering made by
its prospectus and to reject purchase orders for any reason.  Also, from time to
time, a Fund may temporarily  suspend the offering of any class of its shares to
new  investors.  During the period of such  suspension,  persons who are already
shareholders of such class of such Fund may be permitted to continue to purchase
additional shares of such class and to have dividends reinvested.               

To help the  government  fight the  funding of  terrorism  and money  laundering
activities,  federal law requires all financial  institutions to obtain,  verify
and record  information  that identifies  each person who opens an account.  For
more  information,  please  see  "Policies  You Should  Know  About" in the Fund
prospectus.                                                                     

Financial Services Firms' Compensation. Banks and other financial services firms
may provide  administrative  services  related to order placement and payment to
facilitate  transactions in shares of a Fund for their clients,  and DWS-SDI may
pay  them a  transaction  fee up to the  level  of the  discount  or  commission
allowable or payable to dealers.                                                

DWS-SDI may,  from time to time,  pay or allow to firms a 1%  commission  on the
amount  of  shares  of a Fund  sold  under  the  following  conditions:  (i) the
purchased  shares are held in a DWS  Scudder  IRA  account,  (ii) the shares are
purchased as a direct "roll over" of a distribution from a qualified  retirement
plan account  maintained on the subaccount  record keeping system maintained for
DWS-Scudder-branded  plans by ADP,  Inc.  under an alliance with DWS-SDI and its
affiliates, (iii) the registered representative placing the trade is a member of
Executive Council, a group of persons designated by DWS-SDI in acknowledgment of
their dedication to the employee benefit plan area, and (iv) the purchase is not
otherwise subject to a commission.                                              

In addition to the discounts or commissions described herein and the prospectus,
DWS-SDI,  the Advisor or its affiliates may pay or allow  additional  discounts,
commissions or promotional  incentives,  in the form of cash, to firms that sell
shares of a Fund. In some instances, such amounts may be offered only to certain
firms that sell or are expected to sell during  specified  time periods  certain
minimum amounts of shares of the Fund, or other Funds underwritten by DWS-SDI.  

Upon  notice to all  dealers,  DWS-SDI  may  re-allow  to dealers up to the full
applicable Class A sales charge during periods and for transactions specified in
such notice and such re-allowances may be based upon attainment of              

41

minimum  sales  levels.  During  periods when 90% or more of the sales charge is
re-allowed,  such  dealers  may be  deemed  to be  underwriters  as that term is
defined in the 1933 Act.                                                        

DWS-SDI may at its discretion  compensate  investment dealers or other financial
services  firms in  connection  with  the sale of Class A shares  of the Fund in
accordance  with the Large  Order NAV  Purchase  Privilege  and one of the three
compensation schedules up to the following amounts:

(1)      For purposes of determining the appropriate commission percentage to be
         applied to a particular sale under the foregoing schedule, DWS-SDI will
         consider the cumulative  amount invested by the purchaser in a Fund and
         other Funds including  purchases pursuant to the "Combined  Purchases,"
"Letter of Intent"  and  "Cumulative  Discount"  features  referred  to
below.                                                        

(2)      Compensation Schedules 2 applies to employer sponsored employee benefit
         plans  using  the  OmniPlus   subaccount  record  keeping  system  made
         available  through  ADP,  Inc.  under an alliance  with DWS-SDI and its
affiliates.                                                   

(3)      DWS-SDI compensates UBS Financial at the rate of 0.50%.                

DWS-SDI  compensates  firms for sales of Class B shares at the time of sale at a
commission  rate of up to 3.75%  of the  amount  of  Class B  shares  purchased.
DWS-SDI is  compensated  by the Fund for services as  distributor  and principal
underwriter for Class B shares.  Except as provided below,  for sales of Class C
shares,  DWS-SDI advances to firms the first year  distribution fee at a rate of
0.75% of the  purchase  price of such shares,  and, for periods  after the first
year,  DWS-SDI  currently  pays firms for sales of Class C shares a distribution
fee, payable quarterly, at an annual rate of 0.75% of net assets attributable to
Class C shares  maintained and serviced by the firm. For sales of Class C shares
to employer  sponsored  employee  benefit  plans using the  OmniPlus  subaccount
record keeping  system made  available  through ADP, Inc. under an alliance with
DWS-SDI and its affiliates, DWS-SDI does not advance the first year distribution
fee and for  periods  after the date of sale,  DWS-SDI  currently  pays  firms a
distribution  fee,  payable  quarterly,  at an annual rate of 0.75% based on net
assets as of the last business day of the month  attributable  to Class C shares
maintained  and  serviced by the firm.  DWS-SDI is  compensated  by the Fund for
services as distributor and principal underwriter for Class C shares.           

There are no sales charges for Institutional Class shares of each Fund.

***      Commission is payable by DWS-SDI as discussed below.                   

Class A  Quantity  Discounts.  An  investor  or the  investor's  dealer or other
financial  services  firm must notify the  Shareholder  Service Agent or DWS-SDI
whenever  a  quantity  discount  or  reduced  sales  charge is  applicable  to a
purchase.  In order to qualify  for a lower  sales  charge,  all orders  from an
organized  group will have to be placed  through a single  investment  dealer or
other firm and identified as originating from a qualifying purchaser.           

Combined  Purchases.  The  Fund's  Class A shares may be  purchased  at the rate
applicable to the sales charge discount  bracket  attained by combining same day
investments in Class A shares of any DWS Funds that bear a sales charge.        

Letter of Intent.  The reduced sales charges for Class A shares, as shown in the
applicable prospectus,  also apply to the aggregate amount of purchases of Class
A shares of DWS Funds that bear a sales  charge made by any  purchaser  within a
24-month period under a written Letter of Intent ("Letter") provided by DWS-SDI.
The Letter,  which imposes no obligation to purchase or sell additional  Class A
shares,  provides  for a price  adjustment  depending  upon                     

43

P-->497243rd Page of 358TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 243rd
the actual amount  purchased  within such period.  The Letter  provides that the
first  purchase  following  execution  of the Letter  must be at least 5% of the
amount of the  intended  purchase,  and that 5% of the  amount  of the  intended
purchase  normally  will  be held  in  escrow  in the  form  of  shares  pending
completion of the intended  purchase.  If the total investments under the Letter
are less than the  intended  amount and thereby  qualify only for a higher sales
charge  than  actually  paid,  the  appropriate  number of  escrowed  shares are
redeemed and the proceeds used toward  satisfaction of the obligation to pay the
increased sales charge.  The Letter for an  employer-sponsored  employee benefit
plan maintained on the subaccount  record keeping system available  through ADP,
Inc.  under an  alliance  with  DWS-SDI  and its  affiliates  may  have  special
provisions  regarding  payment of any increased  sales charge  resulting  from a
failure to complete the intended  purchase under the Letter.  A shareholder  may
include the value (at the maximum offering price,  which is determined by adding
the maximum applicable sales load charged to the net asset value) of all Class A
shares of such DWS Funds held of record as of the  initial  purchase  date under
the Letter as an "accumulation  credit" toward the completion of the Letter, but
no price adjustment will be made on such shares.                                

Class A Cumulative Discount. Class A shares of the Fund may also be purchased at
the rate  applicable to the discount  bracket  attained by adding to the cost of
shares being purchased, the value of all Class A shares of DWS Funds that bear a
sales charge (computed at the maximum offering price at the time of the purchase
for which the discount is  applicable)  already  owned by the investor or his or
her immediate family member (including the investor's spouse or life partner and
children or stepchildren age 21 or younger).                                    

For purposes of the Combined Purchases, Letter of Intent and Cumulative Discount
features  described above,  employer  sponsored employee benefit plans using the
Flex  subaccount  record  keeping  system  available  through ADP, Inc. under an
alliance with DWS-SDI and its affiliates may include:  (a) Money Market Funds as
"DWS  Funds," (b) all classes of shares of any DWS Fund and (c) the value of any
other plan  investments,  such as guaranteed  investment  contracts and employer
stock,  maintained on such subaccount record keeping system.  Once eligible plan
assets under this provision reach the $1,000,000  threshold,  a later decline in
assets  below the  $1,000,000  threshold  will not affect the plan's  ability to
continue to purchase Class A shares at net asset value.                         

Class A NAV Sales. Class A shares may be sold at net asset value to:            

(a)      a current  or former  director  or trustee  of  Deutsche  or DWS mutual
funds;                                                        

(b)      an  employee  (including  the  employee's  spouse or life  partner  and
         children or  stepchildren  age 21 or  younger) of Deutsche  Bank or its
         affiliates or of a subadvisor to any fund in the DWS family of funds or
         of a  broker-dealer  authorized  to sell  shares of the Fund or service
agents of the Funds;                                          

(c)      certain  professionals  who assist in the promotion of DWS mutual funds
         pursuant to personal services contracts with DWS-SDI, for themselves or
         members of their  families.  DWS-SDI in its  discretion  may compensate
         financial  services  firms  for  sales  of Class A  shares  under  this
         privilege at a commission rate of 0.50% of the amount of Class A shares
purchased;                                                    

(d)      any trust, pension,  profit-sharing or other benefit plan for only such
persons listed under the preceding paragraphs (a) and (b);    

(e)      persons who purchase such shares  through bank trust  departments  that
         process  such  trades  through an  automated,  integrated  mutual  fund
clearing program provided by a third party clearing firm;     

(f)      selected  employees  (including  their  spouses  or life  partners  and
         children  or  stepchildren  age  21 or  younger)  of  banks  and  other
         financial services firms that provide  administrative  services related
         to order placement and payment to facilitate  transactions in shares of
         the Fund for their clients pursuant to an agreement with DWS-SDI or one
         of its  affiliates.  Only those employees of such banks and other firms
         who  as  part  of  their  usual  duties  provide  services  related  to
transactions in Fund shares qualify;                          

44

(g)      unit  investment  trusts  sponsored  by Ranson &  Associates,  Inc. and
         unitholders of unit investment trusts sponsored by Ranson & Associates,
         Inc. or its predecessors through reinvestment programs described in the
prospectuses of such trusts that have such programs;          

(h)      through certain  investment  advisors  registered  under the Investment
         Advisers Act of 1940 and other  financial  services firms acting solely
         as  agent  for  their  clients,   that  adhere  to  certain   standards
         established  by DWS-SDI,  including a  requirement  that such shares be
         sold for the benefit of their  clients  participating  in an investment
         advisory program or agency commission  program under which such clients
         pay a fee to  the  investment  advisor  or  other  firm  for  portfolio
         management  or agency  brokerage  services.  Such  shares  are sold for
         investment  purposes and on the condition  that they will not be resold
except through redemption or repurchase by the Fund;          

(i)      employer  sponsored  employee  benefit plans using the Flex  subaccount
         recordkeeping system ("Flex Plans") made available through ADP under an
         alliance with DWS-SDI and its affiliates,  established prior to October
1, 2003,  provided  that the Flex Plan is a  participant-directed  plan
that has not less than 200 eligible employees;                

(j)      investors investing $1 million or more, either as a lump sum or through
         the "Combined  Purchases," "Letter of Intent" and "Cumulative Discount"
         features referred to above (collectively, the "Large Order NAV Purchase
         Privilege"). The Large Order NAV Purchase Privilege is not available if
another net asset value purchase privilege is available;      

(k)      defined contribution investment only plans with a minimum of $1,000,000
     in plan assets regardless of the amount allocated to the DWS funds;

In addition, Class A shares may be sold at net asset value in connection with:  

(l)      the  acquisition  of the  assets  of or merger  or  consolidation  with
         another investment  company,  or to shareholders in connection with the
         investment or reinvestment  of income and capital gain  dividends,  and
         under other circumstances  deemed appropriate by DWS-SDI and consistent
with regulatory requirements; and                             

(m)      a  direct  "roll  over"  of a  distribution  from a Flex  Plan  or from
         participants in employer sponsored employee benefit plans maintained on
         the OmniPlus  subaccount  record keeping system made available  through
         ADP, Inc. under an alliance with DWS-SDI and its affiliates  into a DWS
Scudder IRA;                                                  

(n)      reinvestment of fund dividends and distributions;                      

(o)      exchanging  an  investment in Class A shares of another fund in the DWS
family of funds for an investment in the fund.                

Class A shares also may be purchased at net asset value in any amount by members
of the plaintiff class in the proceeding known as Howard and Audrey Tabankin, et
al. v. Kemper  Short-Term  Global  Income Fund, et al., Case No. 93 C 5231 (N.D.
IL). This privilege is generally non-transferable and continues for the lifetime
of individual class members and for a ten-year period for  non-individual  class
members.  To make a  purchase  at net asset  value  under  this  privilege,  the
investor  must,  at the time of  purchase,  submit a  written  request  that the
purchase be processed at net asset value pursuant to this privilege specifically
identifying the purchaser as a member of the "Tabankin  Class." Shares purchased
under this privilege will be maintained in a separate account that includes only
shares  purchased  under  this  privilege.  For  more  details  concerning  this
privilege,  class members should refer to the Notice of (i) Proposed  Settlement
with Defendants;  and (ii) Hearing to Determine Fairness of Proposed Settlement,
dated  August 31,  1995,  issued in  connection  with the  aforementioned  court
proceeding.  For  sales of Fund  shares  at net  asset  value  pursuant  to this
privilege,  DWS-SDI  may in its  discretion  pay  investment  dealers  and other
financial services firms a concession,  payable quarterly,  at an annual rate of
up to 0.25% of net assets attributable to such shares maintained and serviced by
the firm.  A firm  becomes  eligible  for the  concession  based upon  assets in

45

P-->497245th Page of 358TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 245th
accounts  attributable  to shares  purchased  under this  privilege in the month
after the month of purchase and the  concession  continues  until  terminated by
DWS-SDI.  The  privilege of  purchasing  Class A shares of the Fund at net asset
value under this  privilege is not available if another net asset value purchase
privilege also applies.                                                         

Class B Purchases.  Class B shares of a fund are offered at net asset value.  No
initial  sales charge is imposed.  Class B shares sold without an initial  sales
charge allow the full amount of the investor's  purchase  payment to be invested
in Class B shares  for his or her  account.  Class B  shares  have a  contingent
deferred  sales charge of 4.00% that  declines over time (for shares sold within
six  years  of  purchase)  and Rule  12b-1  fees,  as  described  in the  Funds'
prospectuses  and SAI.  Class B shares  automatically  convert to Class A shares
after six years.                                                                

Class C Purchases.  Class C shares of a Fund are offered at net asset value.  No
initial sales charge is imposed,  which allows the full amount of the investor's
purchase payment to be invested in Class C shares for his or her account.  Class
C shares are subject to a contingent  deferred sales charge of 1.00% (for shares
sold within one year of  purchase)  and Rule 12b-1  fees,  as  described  in the
Funds' prospectus and Statement of Additional Information.                      

Purchase of Institutional Class Shares.  Information on how to buy Institutional
Class shares is set forth in the section entitled "Buying and Selling Shares" in
the Funds' prospectus.  The following supplements that information.  The minimum
initial  investment for  Institutional  Class shares is $1,000,000.  There is no
minimum subsequent  investment  requirement for the Institutional  Class shares.
These minimum amounts may be changed at any time in management's discretion.    

Investors  may  invest in  Institutional  Class  shares by setting up an account
directly  with DWS-SISC or through an authorized  service  agent.  Investors who
establish shareholder accounts directly with DWS-SISC should submit purchase and
redemption  orders as described in the prospectus.  Additionally,  each Fund has
authorized  brokers to accept purchase and redemption  orders for  Institutional
Class  shares  for a Fund.  Brokers,  including  authorized  brokers  of service
organizations,  are, in turn,  authorized to designate other  intermediaries  to
accept purchase and redemption  orders on a Fund's behalf.  Investors who invest
through brokers, service organizations or their designated intermediaries may be
subject  to  minimums  established  by their  broker,  service  organization  or
designated intermediary.                                                        

To sell  shares  by bank wire you will  need to sign up for  these  services  in
advance when completing your account application.                               

Multi-Class  Suitability.  DWS-SDI  has  established  the  following  procedures
regarding  the  purchase  of Class A,  Class B and  Class C  shares.  Orders  to
purchase  Class B shares of  $100,000  or more and  orders to  purchase  Class C
shares  of  $500,000  or more  will be  declined  with the  exception  of orders
received from financial  representatives acting for clients whose shares will be
held in an omnibus account and  employer-sponsored  employee benefit plans using
the subaccount record keeping system ("System")  maintained for  Scudder-branded
plans under an alliance  with  DWS-SDI and its  affiliates  ("DWS  Scudder  Flex
Plans" and "DWS Scudder Choice Plans").                                         

The following  provisions apply to DWS Scudder Flex Plans and DWS Scudder Choice
Plans.                                                                          

a.       Class B Share DWS Scudder Flex Plans. Class B shares have not been sold
         to DWS  Scudder  Flex Plans that were  established  on the Flex  System
         after  October 1,  2003.  Orders to  purchase  Class B shares for a DWS
         Scudder  Flex Plan  established  on the System prior to October 1, 2003
         that has  regularly  been  purchasing  Class B shares  will be invested
         instead  in  Class A  shares  at net  asset  value  when  the  combined
         subaccount value in DWS Funds or other eligible assets held by the plan
         is  $100,000  or more.  This  provision  will be imposed  for the first
         purchase  after  eligible plan assets reach the $100,000  threshold.  A
         later  decline in assets below the $100,000  threshold  will not affect
         the plan's  ability to continue to purchase Class A shares at net asset
value.                                                        

 b.      Class C Share DWS Scudder Flex Plans. Orders to purchase Class C shares
         for a  DWS  Scudder  Flex  Plan,  regardless  of  when  such  plan  was
         established  on the Flex  System,  will be invested  instead in Class A
         shares at net asset  value when the  combined  subaccount  value in DWS
         Funds or other eligible  assets held by the Plan is $1,000,000 or more.
         This  provision  will be imposed for the first  purchase after eligible

46

P-->497246th Page of 358TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 246th
         Plan assets reach the $1,000,000  threshold.  A later decline in assets
         below the  $1,000,000  threshold  will not affect the Plan's ability to
continue to purchase Class A shares at net asset value.       

c.       Class C Share DWS Scudder  Choice  Plans.  Orders to  purchase  Class C
         shares for a DWS Scudder Choice Plan that has been regularly purchasing
         Class C shares will be invested  instead in Class A shares at net asset
         value when the combined subaccount value in DWS Funds or other eligible
         assets held by the plan is $1,000,000 or more.  This  provision will be
         imposed for purchases  made  beginning in the month after eligible plan
         assets reach the $1,000,000  threshold.  In addition, as a condition to
         being permitted to use the Choice Plan platform, plans must agree that,
         within  one month  after  eligible  plan  assets  reach the  $1,000,000
         threshold,  all  existing  Class  C  shares  held in the  plan  will be
automatically converted to Class A shares.                    

 The procedures  described  above do not reflect in any way the suitability of a
 particular  class of shares for a particular  investor and should not be relied
 upon as such. A suitability  determination  must be made by investors  with the
assistance of their financial representative.                                 

Automatic  Investment  Plan. A shareholder may purchase shares of a Fund through
an automatic investment program.  With the Direct Deposit Purchase Plan ("Direct
Deposit"), investments are made automatically (minimum $500 and maximum $250,000
for initial investments and a minimum of $50 and maximum $250,000 for subsequent
investments)  from the  shareholder's  account  at a bank,  savings  and loan or
credit union into the shareholder's  Fund account.  Termination by a shareholder
will become effective within thirty days after the Shareholder Service Agent has
received the request.  A Fund may immediately  terminate a shareholder's  Direct
Deposit  in the event  that any item is unpaid  by the  shareholder's  financial
institution.                                                                    

Minimum Subsequent Investment Policies.  For current shareholders there is a $50
minimum investment requirement for subsequent investments in each fund. There is
no minimum subsequent  investment  requirement in Class A shares for investments
on behalf of participants in certain fee-based and wrap programs offered through
financial intermediaries approved by the Advisor.                               

Payroll  Investment  Plans. A shareholder  may purchase  shares through  Payroll
Direct Deposit or Government  Direct  Deposit.  Under these  programs,  all or a
portion of a shareholder's  net pay or government check is invested each payment
period.  A shareholder may terminate  participation  in these programs by giving
written  notice  to  the  shareholder's   employer  or  government   agency,  as
appropriate.  (A reasonable  time to act is required.) A Fund is not responsible
for the  efficiency of the employer or  government  agency making the payment or
any financial institutions transmitting payments.                               

It is our policy to offer purchase  privileges to current or former directors or
trustees of the Deutsche or DWS mutual funds,  employees,  their spouses or life
partners and children or step-children age 21 or younger of Deutsche Bank or its
affiliates  or a  sub-adviser  to any  fund  in the DWS  family  of  funds  or a
broker-dealer authorized to sell shares of the funds. Qualified individuals will
generally  be allowed to  purchase  shares in the class with the lowest  expense
ratio,  usually  the  Institutional  Class  shares.  If a fund  does  not  offer
Institutional  Class shares,  these  individuals  will be allowed to buy Class A
shares at NAV.  The funds also  reserve the right to waive the  minimum  account
balance  requirement for employee and director accounts.  Fees generally charged
to IRA accounts will be charged to accounts of employees and directors.         

Revenue Sharing                                                                 

In light of recent  regulatory  developments,  the Advisor,  the Distributor and
their affiliates have undertaken to furnish certain additional information below
regarding  the  level  of  payments  made  by them to  selected  affiliated  and
unaffiliated  brokers,  dealers,  participating  insurance  companies  or  other
financial  intermediaries  ("financial  advisors") in  connection  with the sale
and/or  distribution  of  Fund  shares  or the  retention  and/or  servicing  of
investors and Fund shares ("revenue sharing").

The  Advisor,  the  Distributor  and/or  their  affiliates  may  pay  additional
compensation,  out of their own  assets and not as an  additional  charge to the
Fund, to financial  advisors in connection with the sale and/or  distribution of
Fund shares or the retention and/or servicing of Fund investors and Fund shares.
Such revenue  sharing  payments are in addition to any  distribution  or service
fees  payable  under any Rule  12b-1 or  service  plan of any fund,  any  record
keeping/sub-transfer  agency/networking  fees  payable  by the  Fund  (generally
through the  Distributor  or an  affiliate)  and/or the  Distributor  to certain
financial   advisors  for  performing  such  services  and  any  sales  charges,
commissions,   non-cash  compensation  arrangements  expressly  permitted  under
applicable rules of the FINRA or other concessions described in the fee table or
elsewhere in the  Prospectuses or the SAI as payable to all financial  advisors.
For example, the Advisor, the Distributor and/or their affiliates may compensate
financial  advisors  for  providing  the Fund with "shelf  space" or access to a
third  party  platform  or fund  offering  list,  or  other  marketing  programs
including, without limitation, inclusion of the Fund on preferred or recommended
sales  lists,  mutual  fund  "supermarket"  platforms  and  other  formal  sales
programs;  granting the  Distributor  access to the  financial  advisor's  sales
force;  granting the Distributor access to the financial  advisor's  conferences
and meetings;  assistance  in training and  educating  the  financial  advisor's
personnel; and, obtaining other forms of marketing support. The level of revenue
sharing payments made to financial advisors may be a fixed fee or based upon one
or more of the following factors:  gross sales,  current assets and/or number of
accounts of the Fund attributable to the financial advisor,  the particular fund
or fund type or other  measures  as agreed to by the  Advisor,  the  Distributor
and/or their affiliates and the financial  advisors or any combination  thereof.
The amount of these payments is determined at the discretion of the Advisor, the
Distributor  and/or their affiliates from time to time, may be substantial,  and
may be different for different  financial  advisors  based on, for example,  the
nature of the services provided by the financial advisor.                       

The Advisor,  the  Distributor  and/or their  affiliates  currently make revenue
sharing  payments  from  their own  assets in  connection  with the sale  and/or
distribution of DWS Fund shares, or the retention and/or servicing of investors,
to financial  advisors in amounts that  generally  range from .01% up to .50% of
assets of the Fund serviced and  maintained by the  financial  advisor,  .10% to
..25% of sales of the Fund attributable to the financial  advisor, a flat fee of
$12,500 up to $500,000, or any combination thereof. These amounts are subject to
change  at  the  discretion  of  the  Advisor,   the  Distributor  and/or  their
affiliates.   Receipt  of,  or  the  prospect  of  receiving,   this  additional
compensation, may influence your financial advisor's recommendation of this Fund
or of any  particular  share class of the Fund. You should review your financial
advisor's  compensation  disclosure  and/or  talk to your  financial  advisor to
obtain  more  information  on how this  compensation  may have  influenced  your
financial advisor's recommendation of this Fund.                                

The Advisor,  the Distributor and/or their affiliates may also make such revenue
sharing  payments  to  financial  advisors  under the terms  discussed  above in
connection  with  the  distribution  of both  DWS  funds  and  non-DWS  funds by
financial  advisors to retirement plans that obtain record keeping services from
ADP, Inc. on the DWS Scudder branded  retirement plan platform (the  "Platform")
with the level of revenue  sharing  payments  being based upon sales of both the
DWS funds and the  non-DWS  funds by the  financial  advisor on the  Platform or
current  assets  of both  the DWS  funds  and the  non-DWS  funds  serviced  and
maintained by the financial advisor on the Platform.                            

As of the date  hereof,  the  Funds  have been  advised  that the  Advisor,  the
Distributor  and their  affiliates  expect that the following firms will receive
revenue sharing payments at different points during the coming year as described
above:

Any additions,  modifications or deletions to the financial advisors  identified
above that have occurred since the date hereof are not reflected.               

The Advisor,  the  Distributor  or their  affiliates  may enter into  additional
revenue sharing arrangements or change or discontinue existing arrangements with
financial advisors at any time without notice.                                  

The  prospect  of  receiving,  or the  receipt  of  additional  compensation  or
promotional  incentives  described above by financial  advisors may provide such
financial advisors and/or their salespersons with an incentive to favor sales of
shares of the DWS Funds or a particular  DWS Fund over sales of shares of mutual
funds (or  non-mutual  fund  investments)  with  respect to which the  financial
advisor does not receive additional compensation or promotional  incentives,  or
receives  lower levels of additional  compensation  or  promotional  incentives.
Similarly,  financial advisors may receive different  compensation or incentives
that may influence  their  recommendation  of any particular  share class of the
Fund or of other funds. These payment arrangements, however, will not change the
price that an investor pays for Fund shares or the amount that the Fund receives
to invest on behalf of an investor and will not increase Fund expenses.  You may
wish to take  such  payment  arrangements  into  account  when  considering  and
evaluating  any  recommendations  relating to Fund shares and you should discuss
this matter with your  financial  advisor  and review your  financial  advisor's
disclosures.

Redemptions                                                                     

Each  Fund  imposes  a  redemption  fee of 2% of  the  total  redemption  amount
(calculated  at net asset value,  without regard to the effect of any contingent
deferred sales charge; any contingent  deferred sales charge is also assessed on
the  total  redemption  amount  without  regard  to  the  assessment  of  the 2%
redemption  fee) on all Fund  shares  redeemed  or  exchanged  within 15 days of
buying  them  (either by  purchase  or  exchange).  The  redemption  fee is paid
directly to the Funds, and is designed to encourage long-term  investment and to
offset  transaction  and other costs  associated  with  short-term  or excessive
trading. For purposes of determining whether the redemption fee applies,  shares
held the longest  time will be treated as being  redeemed  first and shares held
the shortest time will be treated as being  redeemed last. The redemption fee is
applicable  to Fund  shares  purchased  either  directly  or through a financial
intermediary,   such  as  a  broker-dealer.   Transactions   through   financial
intermediaries  typically  are  placed  with the Funds on an  omnibus  basis and
include  both  purchase  and sale  transactions  placed on  behalf  of  multiple
investors. These purchase and sale transactions are generally netted against one
another and placed on an aggregate  basis;  consequently  the  identities of the
individuals on whose behalf the  transactions are placed generally are not known
to the Funds.  For this reason,  the Funds have  undertaken to notify  financial
intermediaries  of their  obligation  to assess the  redemption  fee on customer
accounts  and to collect and remit the  proceeds to the Funds.  However,  due to
operational   requirements,   the  intermediaries'   methods  for  tracking  and
calculating  the fee may be  inadequate  or  differ  in some  respects  from the
Funds'.                                                                         

Each Fund may suspend or postpone  redemptions as permitted  pursuant to Section
22(e) of the Investment Company Act of 1940. Generally,  those circumstances are
when: 1) the New York Stock Exchange is closed other than  customary  weekend or
holiday closings; 2) trading on the New York Stock Exchange is restricted; 3) an
emergency  exists which makes the disposal of securities  owned by a fund or the
fair  determination  of  the  value  of  a  fund's  net  assets  not  reasonably
practicable;  or 4) the SEC, by order,  permits the  suspension  of the right of
redemption.  Redemption  payments  by wire may also be delayed in the event of a
nonroutine closure of the Federal Reserve wire payment system.                  

A  request  for  repurchase  (confirmed  redemption)  may be  communicated  by a
shareholder  through a  financial  services  firm to  DWS-SDI,  which firms must
promptly submit orders to be effective.                                         

Redemption  requests  must be  unconditional.  Redemption  requests (and a stock
power for certificated  shares) must be duly endorsed by the account holder.  As
specified  in  the  prospectus,  signatures  may  need  to  be  guaranteed  by a
commercial bank, trust company,  savings and loan  association,  federal savings
bank,  member  firm  of  a  national  securities  exchange  or  other  financial
institution  permitted by SEC rule.  Additional  documentation  may be required,
particularly  from   institutional  and  fiduciary  account  holders,   such  as
corporations,  custodians  (e.g.,  under the Uniform  Transfers  to Minors Act),
executors, administrators, trustees or guardians.                               

If the proceeds of the  redemption  (prior to the  imposition of any  contingent
deferred  sales charge) are $100,000 or less and the proceeds are payable to the
shareholder of record at the address of record,  normally a telephone request   

51

P-->497251st Page of 358TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 251st
or a written request by any one account holder without a signature  guarantee is
sufficient for  redemptions by individual or joint account  holders,  and trust,
executor  and  guardian  account  holders,  provided  the  trustee,  executor or
guardian  is named in the  account  registration.  Other  institutional  account
holders may  exercise  this special  privilege of redeeming  shares by telephone
request or  written  request  without  signature  guarantee  subject to the same
conditions as individual account holders,  provided that this privilege has been
pre-authorized by the institutional account holder by written instruction to the
Shareholder Service Agent with signatures guaranteed.  This privilege may not be
used to  redeem  shares  held in  certificated  form  and may not be used if the
shareholder's account has had an address change within 15 days of the redemption
request.                                                                        

Wires.  Delivery of the proceeds of a wire redemption of $250,000 or more may be
delayed  by a Fund for up to  seven  days if a Fund or the  Shareholder  Service
Agent deems it appropriate under then-current market conditions.  The ability to
send wires is limited by the business hours and holidays of the firms  involved.
A Fund is not  responsible  for the efficiency of the federal wire system or the
account  holder's  financial  services  firm or  bank.  The  account  holder  is
responsible  for any charges  imposed by the account  holder's  firm or bank. To
change the  designated  account  to receive  wire  redemption  proceeds,  send a
written request to a Fund's Shareholder Service Agent with signatures guaranteed
as described above or contact the firm through which Fund shares were purchased.

Automatic  Withdrawal  Plan.  The owner of $5,000 or more of a class of a Fund's
shares at the  offering  price (net  asset  value  plus,  in the case of Class A
shares,  the initial  sales charge) may provide for the payment from the owner's
account of any  requested  dollar amount to be paid to the owner or a designated
payee monthly, quarterly, semiannually or annually. The minimum periodic payment
is $50. The maximum  annual rate at which shares subject to CDSC may be redeemed
is 12% of the net asset value of the  account.  Shares are  redeemed so that the
payee should receive  payment  approximately  the first of the month.  Investors
using this Plan must reinvest Fund distributions.                               

The purchase of Class A shares while  participating  in a systematic  withdrawal
plan will  ordinarily be  disadvantageous  to the investor  because the investor
will be paying a sales  charge on the  purchase  of shares at the same time that
the investor is redeeming shares upon which a sales charge may have already been
paid. Therefore, a Fund will not knowingly permit additional investments of less
than $2,000 if the investor is at the same time making systematic withdrawals.  

Contingent  Deferred Sales Charge (CDSC).  The following example will illustrate
the operation of the CDSC.  Assume that an investor  makes a single  purchase of
$10,000 of the Fund's  Class B shares and that 16 months  later the value of the
shares has grown by $1,000  through  reinvested  dividends  and by an additional
$1,000 of share appreciation to a total of $12,000. If the investor were then to
redeem the entire  $12,000 in share  value,  the CDSC would be payable only with
respect to $10,000  because  neither the $1,000 of reinvested  dividends nor the
$1,000 of share  appreciation  is subject to the charge.  The charge would be at
the rate of 3.00%  ($300)  because it was in the second year after the  purchase
was made.                                                                       

The rate of the CDSC is  determined  by the length of the  period of  ownership.
Investments  are tracked on a monthly  basis.  The period of ownership  for this
purpose  begins the first day of the month in which the order for the investment
is received.  For example, an investment made in March of the year of investment
will be eligible for the second  year's  charge if redeemed on or after March of
the following  year. In the event no specific  order is requested when redeeming
shares  subject  to a  CDSC,  the  redemption  will be made  first  from  shares
representing reinvested dividends and then from the earliest purchase of shares.
DWS-SDI  receives  any  CDSC  directly.  The  charge  will not be  imposed  upon
redemption of reinvested dividends or share appreciation.                       

The Class A CDSC will be waived in the event of:                                

(a)      redemptions  by  a   participant-directed   qualified  retirement  plan
         described in Code Section 401(a), a participant-directed  non-qualified
         deferred   compensation  plan  described  in  Code  Section  457  or  a
         participant-directed   qualified  retirement  plan  described  in  Code
     Section 403(b)(7) which is not sponsored by a K-12 school district;

(c)      redemption  of shares of a  shareholder  (including a registered  joint

(d)      redemption  of shares of a  shareholder  (including a registered  joint
         owner) who after purchase of the shares being redeemed  becomes totally
         disabled  (as  evidenced  by a  determination  by  the  federal  Social
Security Administration);                                     

(e)      redemptions under the Fund's Automatic  Withdrawal Plan at a maximum of
12% per year of the net asset value of the account; and       

(f)      redemptions  of  shares  whose  dealer  of  record  at the  time of the
         investment  notifies  DWS-SDI that the dealer waives the  discretionary
commission applicable to such Large Order NAV Purchase.       

The Class B CDSC will be waived  for the  circumstances  set forth in items (c),
(d) and (e) above for Class A shares. In addition, this CDSC will be waived:    

(g)      for redemptions made pursuant to any IRA systematic withdrawal based on
         the  shareholder's  life  expectancy  including,  but not  limited  to,
         substantially   equal  periodic  payments  described  in  Code  Section
72(t)(2)(A)(iv) prior to age 59 1/2;                          

(h)      for redemptions to satisfy required minimum  distributions after age 70
         1/2 from an IRA account (with the maximum amount subject to this waiver
        being based only upon the shareholder's DWS Scudder IRA accounts); and

(i)      in connection with the following redemptions of shares held by employer
         sponsored  employee benefit plans  maintained on the subaccount  record
         keeping system made available by ADP under an alliance with DWS-SDI and
         its  affiliates:  (1) to satisfy  participant  loan advances (note that
         loan  repayments  constitute new purchases for purposes of the CDSC and
         the  conversion   privilege),   (2)  in  connection   with   retirement
         distributions  (limited  at any one time to 12% of the  total  value of
         plan assets invested in the Fund), (3) in connection with distributions
         qualifying under the hardship  provisions of the Internal Revenue Code,
         (4) representing  returns of excess contributions to such plans and (5)
         in connection  with direct "roll over"  distributions  from a Flex Plan

privilege.                                                    

The Class C CDSC will be waived  for the  circumstances  set forth in items (b),
(c), (d) and (e) above for Class A shares and for the circumstances set forth in
items  (g) and (h) above for  Class B  shares.  In  addition,  this CDSC will be
waived for:                                                                     

(j)       redemption of shares by an  employer-sponsored  employee  benefit plan
          that offers  funds in addition to DWS Funds and whose dealer of record
          has waived the  advance of the first year  administrative  service and
          distribution fees applicable to such shares and agrees to receive such
fees quarterly; and                                         

(k)       redemption  of  shares  purchased  through  a  dealer-sponsored  asset
          allocation  program  maintained  on an omnibus  record-keeping  system
          provided the dealer of record had waived the advance of the first year
          administrative  services  and  distribution  fees  applicable  to such
shares and has agreed to receive such fees quarterly.       

In-kind  Redemptions.  A Fund  reserves  the  right to  honor  any  request  for
redemption  or  repurchase  by  making  payment  in whole or in part in  readily
marketable  securities.  These securities will be chosen by a Fund and valued as
they are for purposes of computing a Fund's net asset value.  A shareholder  may
incur transaction expenses in converting these securities to cash.

Checkwriting. For DWS Intermediate Tax/AMT Free Fund: the Checkwriting Privilege
is not offered to new  investors.  The  Checkwriting  Privilege is available for
shareholders  who previously  elected this  privilege  prior to August 19, 2002.
Checks may be used to pay any person,  provided  that each check is for at least
$100 and not more than $5 million.  By using the checks,  the  shareholder  will
receive daily  dividend  credit on his or her shares until the check has cleared
the banking  system.  Investors who  purchased  shares by check may write checks
against  those  shares  only  after  they have  been on a Fund's  book for seven
business days.  Shareholders  who use this service may also use other redemption
procedures.  No shareholder may write checks against certificated shares. A Fund
pays the bank charges for this service.  However, each Fund will review the cost
of operation  periodically  and reserve the right to determine if direct charges
to the persons who avail  themselves of this service would be appropriate.  Each
Fund,  DWS-SISC and State Street Bank and Trust Company reserve the right at any
time to suspend or terminate the Checkwriting procedure.                        

Exchanges                                                                       

Shareholders  may request a taxable  exchange of their  shares for shares of the
corresponding  class of other DWS Funds  without  imposition  of a sales charge,
subject to the provisions  below. For purposes of calculating any CDSC,  amounts
exchanged retain their original cost and purchase date.                         

Shares of money  market  funds that were  acquired  by purchase  (not  including
shares acquired by dividend  reinvestment)  are subject to the applicable  sales
charge on exchange.  Series of DWS Target Fund are  available  on exchange  only
during  the  offering  period for such  series as  described  in the  applicable
prospectus.  Cash Management Fund Investment, Tax Free Money Fund Investment, NY

with DWS-SDI.  All  exchanges  among money funds must meet  applicable  investor
eligibility  and investment  requirements.  Exchanges may only be made for funds
that are available for sale in the shareholder's state of residence.  Currently,
Tax-Exempt   California  Money  Market  Fund  is  available  for  sale  only  in
California.                                                                     

Shareholders  must obtain  prospectus(es)  of the fund they are exchanging  into
from dealers, other firms or DWS-SDI.                                           

Automatic Exchange Plan. The owner of $1,000 or more of any class of shares of a
DWS Fund may  authorize  the  automatic  exchange  of a  specified  amount  ($50
minimum) of such  shares for shares of the same class of another  such DWS Fund.
Exchanges  will  be made  automatically  until  the  shareholder  or  that  Fund
terminates  the  privilege.  Exchanges  are subject to the terms and  conditions
described above.                                                                

Multi-Class  Conversions.  For purposes of conversion to Class A shares,  shares
purchased  through the  reinvestment of dividends and other  distributions  paid
with respect to Class B shares in a shareholder's Fund account will be converted
to Class A shares on a pro rata basis.                                          

Dividends                                                                       

Each Fund intends to declare daily and distribute  monthly  substantially all of
its net investment  income (excluding  short-term  capital gains) resulting from
investment  activity.  Distributions,  if any,  of net  realized  capital  gains
(short-term  and  long-term)  will  normally  be made in November or December or
otherwise as needed.                                                            

An additional  distribution may also be made (or treated as made) in November or
December if  necessary  to avoid the excise tax enacted by the Tax Reform Act of
1986.  Both  types  of  distributions  will  be  made in  shares  of a Fund  and
confirmations  will be  mailed  to each  shareholder  unless a  shareholder  has
elected to receive cash, in which case a check will be sent.

Any dividends or capital gains  distributions  declared in October,  November or
December  with a record  date in such a month  and  paid  during  the  following
January will be treated by  shareholders  for federal  income tax purposes as if
received on December 31 of the calendar year declared.                          

Dividends  paid by the Fund with  respect to each  class of its  shares  will be
calculated in the same manner, at the same time and on the same day.            

The level of income  dividends  per share (as a  percentage  of net asset value)
will be lower for Class B and Class C Shares  than for Class A Shares  primarily
as a result of the  distribution  services fee applicable to Class B and Class C
Shares.  Distributions of capital gains, if any, will be paid in the same amount
for each class.                                                                 

Income  and  capital  gain  dividends,  if any,  of a Fund will be  credited  to
shareholder  accounts  in full and  fractional  shares of the same class of that
Fund at net asset value on the  reinvestment  date,  except  that,  upon written
request to the  Shareholder  Service Agent, a shareholder  may select one of the
following options:                                                              

1.       To receive  income and  short-term  capital gain  dividends in cash and
         long-term  capital  gain  dividends  in shares of the same class at net
asset value; or                                               

2.       To receive income and capital gain dividends in cash.                  

Dividends  will be  reinvested  in  shares  of the same  class of a Fund  unless
shareholders  indicate in writing  that they wish to receive  them in cash or in
shares  of other  DWS  Funds  with  multiple  classes  of shares or DWS Funds as
provided in the  prospectus.  To use this privilege of investing  dividends of a
Fund in shares of another DWS Fund, shareholders must maintain a minimum account
value of $1,000 in the Fund  distributing  the  dividends.  A Fund will reinvest
dividend checks (and future  dividends) in shares of that same Fund and class if
checks are returned as  undeliverable.  Dividends and other  distributions  of a
Fund in the  aggregate  amount of $10 or less are  automatically  reinvested  in
shares of that Fund and class unless the shareholder  requests in writing that a
check be issued for that particular distribution.                               

If  a  shareholder   has  elected  to  reinvest  any   dividends   and/or  other
distributions,  such  distributions  will be made in  shares  of that  Fund  and
confirmations will be mailed to each shareholder. If a shareholder has chosen to
receive cash, a check will be sent.  Distributions of investment company taxable
income and net realized  capital  gains are  taxable,  whether made in shares or
cash.                                                                           

Each  distribution  is  accompanied  by a  brief  explanation  of the  form  and
character of the  distribution.  The  characterization  of distributions on such
correspondence may differ from the characterization for federal tax purposes. In
January of each year each Fund issues to each  shareholder  a  statement  of the
federal income tax status of all distributions in the prior calendar year.      

Each Fund may at any time vary its foregoing dividend practices and,  therefore,
reserves  the  right  from  time to time to  either  distribute  or  retain  for
reinvestment  such of its net  investment  income  and  its net  short-term  and
long-term   capital  gains  as  its  Board  determines   appropriate  under  the
then-current circumstances. In particular, and without limiting the foregoing, a
Fund may make additional  distributions of net investment income or capital gain
net income in order to satisfy the minimum distribution  requirements  contained
in the Code.                                                                    

 TAXES

The following is intended to be a general  summary of certain federal income tax
consequences  of  investing  in the  Funds.  It is not  intended  as a  complete
discussion  of all such  consequences,  nor  does it  purport  to deal  with all
categories of investors.  Investors are therefore  advised to consult with their
tax advisors before making an investment in a Fund.

Federal  Taxation.  Each Fund intends to elect to be treated and to qualify each
year as a regulated  investment company under Subchapter M of the Code. In order
to qualify for the special tax treatment accorded regulated investment companies
and their shareholders, each Fund must, among other things:                     

(a)      derive at least 90% of its gross  income for each taxable year from (i)
         dividends, interest, payments with respect to certain securities loans,
         and gains from the sale or other  disposition  of stock,  securities or
         foreign currencies, or other income (including but not limited to gains
         from options,  futures,  or forward  contracts) derived with respect to
         its business of investing in such stock, securities,  or currencies and
         net income  derived  from an interest in a  qualified  publicly  traded
         partnership  and (ii) net income  derived from  interests in "qualified
publicly traded partnerships" (as defined below);             

(b)      diversify  its  holdings  so that,  at the end of each  quarter of each
         Fund's taxable year, (i) at least 50% of the market value of the Fund's
         total  assets is  represented  by cash and cash  items,  US  Government
         securities,  securities of other regulated  investment  companies,  and
         other  securities  limited  in respect of any one issuer to a value not
         greater  than 5% of the value of the Fund's  total  assets and not more
         than 10% of the outstanding  voting securities of such issuer, and (ii)
         not more than 25% of the value of the Fund's  total  assets is invested
         (x) in the  securities  (other than those of the US Government or other
         regulated  investment  companies)  of any one  issuer or of two or more
         issuers  which the Fund  controls  and which are  engaged  in the same,
         similar,  or related trades or businesses,  or (y) in the securities of
         one or more qualified publicly traded  partnerships (as defined below);
and                                                           

 (c)     distribute with respect to each taxable year at least 90% of the sum of
         its investment  company  taxable income (as that term is defined in the
         Code without  regard to the deduction  for  dividends  paid--generally,
         taxable  ordinary  income and the  excess,  if any,  of net  short-term
         capital gains over net  long-term  capital  losses) and net  tax-exempt
interest income, for such year.                               

In  general,  for  purposes of the 90% gross  income  requirement  described  in
paragraph  (a)  above,  income  derived  from a  partnership  will be treated as
qualifying  income only to the extent such  income is  attributable  to items of
income of the  partnership  which would be qualifying  income if realized by the
regulated investment company.  However, recent legislation provides that 100% of
the net  income  derived  from  an  interest  in a  "qualified  publicly  traded
partnership"  (defined as a partnership  (x) interests in which are traded on an
established  securities  market or readily tradable on a secondary market or the
substantial  equivalent thereof and (y) that derives less than 90% of its income
from the qualifying  income described in paragraph (a) above) will be treated as
qualifying  income.  In addition,  although in general the passive loss rules of
the Code do not apply to regulated investment companies,  such rules do apply to
a regulated investment company with respect to items attributable to an interest
in a qualified publicly traded partnership.  For purposes of a Fund's investment
in loan participations,  a Fund shall treat both the financial  intermediary and
the issuer of the  underlying  loan as an issuer for the purposes of meeting the
diversification  requirement  described in  paragraph  (b) above.  Finally,  for
purposes of paragraph (b) above, the term "outstanding voting securities of such
issuer"  will  include  the equity  securities  of a qualified  publicly  traded
partnership.                                                                    

If a Fund qualifies as a regulated  investment  company that is accorded special
tax  treatment,  such Fund will not be subject  to federal  income tax on income
distributed  in a timely  manner to its  shareholders  in the form of  dividends
(including Capital Gain Dividends, as defined below).                           

If for any taxable year a Fund does not qualify for the special  federal  income
tax treatment afforded regulated investment companies, all of its taxable income
will be subject to federal  income tax at regular  corporate  rates (without any
deduction for distributions to its  shareholders),  and all  distributions  from
earnings and profits,  including any  distributions of net tax-exempt income and
net long-term capital gains, will be taxable to shareholders as ordinary income.
Such  distributions  would be eligible (i) to be treated as "qualified  dividend
income," in the case of individual and other noncorporate shareholders,  subject
to reduced rates of federal income taxation for taxable years  beginning  before
January 1, 2011, and (ii) for the 70% dividends  received  deduction in the case
of corporate shareholders.  In addition, the Fund could be required to recognize
unrealized  gains,  pay  substantial  taxes and                                 

56

interest and make substantial  distributions  before requalifying as a regulated
investment company that is accorded special tax treatment.                      

Each Fund is subject to a 4% nondeductible  excise tax on amounts required to be
but that are not distributed  under a prescribed  formula.  The formula requires
payment to shareholders during a calendar year of distributions  representing at
least 98% of a Fund's  ordinary income for the calendar year and at least 98% of
the excess of its capital gains over capital losses realized during the one-year
period  ending  October 31 (in most cases) of such year as well as amounts  that
were neither  distributed  nor taxed to the Fund during the prior calendar year.
Although each Fund's distribution  policies should enable it to avoid excise tax
liability,  a Fund may  retain  (and be  subject  to income or excise  tax on) a
portion of its capital  gain or other income if it appears to be in the interest
of such Fund.                                                                   

Exempt-Interest  Dividends.  The Funds will be qualified to pay  exempt-interest
dividends  to their  shareholders  only if,  at the close of each  quarter  of a
Fund's taxable year, at least 50% of the total value of a Fund's assets consists
of  obligations  the  interest  on which is  exempt  from  federal  income  tax.
Distributions that the Funds properly designate as exempt-interest dividends are
treated as  interest  excludable  from  shareholders'  gross  income for federal
income tax  purposes  but may be taxable  for  federal  alternative  minimum tax
("AMT") purposes and for state and local tax purposes.  Because the Funds intend
to qualify to pay exempt-interest  dividends,  the Funds may be limited in their
ability  to enter  into  taxable  transactions  involving  forward  commitments,
repurchase  agreements,  financial  futures and options  contracts  on financial
futures, tax-exempt bond indexes and other assets.                              

Part or all of the interest on indebtedness,  if any, incurred or continued by a
shareholder  to  purchase  or  carry  shares  of a Fund  paying  exempt-interest
dividends is not  deductible.  The portion of interest that is not deductible is
equal to the total interest paid or accrued on the  indebtedness,  multiplied by
the percentage of a Fund's total distributions (not including distributions from
net long-term  capital gains) paid to the shareholder  that are  exempt-interest
dividends.  Under rules used by the Internal  Revenue  Service to determine when
borrowed  Funds are  considered  used for the purpose of  purchasing or carrying
particular  assets,  the purchase of shares may be  considered to have been made
with  borrowed  funds even though such Funds are not  directly  traceable to the
purchase of shares.                                                             

In general, exempt-interest dividends, if any, attributable to interest received
on certain private activity obligations and certain industrial development bonds
will not be tax-exempt to any  shareholder  who are  "substantial  users" of the
facilities financed by such obligations or bonds or who are "related persons" of
such substantial users.                                                         

The Funds,  which are qualified to pay  exempt-interest  dividends,  will inform
investors  within 60 days of a Fund's fiscal  year-end of the  percentage of its
income  distributions  designated  as  tax-exempt.  The  percentage  is  applied
uniformly to all  distributions  made during the year.  The percentage of income
designated as tax-exempt for any particular  distribution  may be  substantially
different from the percentage of a Fund's income that was tax-exempt  during the
period covered by the distribution.                                             

The U.S.  Supreme Court has agreed to hear an appeal of a  state-court  decision
that  might  significantly  affect  how states  tax  in-state  and  out-of-state
municipal  bonds.  A Kentucky  state court held that a Kentucky law violates the
U.S.  Constitution  by treating,  for Kentucky state tax purposes,  the interest
income on in-state  municipal bonds  differently from the income on out-of-state
municipal bonds. If the U.S. Supreme Court affirms this holding, each state will
likely revisit the way in which it treats the interest on municipal bonds,  and,
depending  on how  each  state  decides,  this  has the  potential  to  increase
significantly  the amount of state tax paid by shareholders  on  exempt-interest
dividends  and possibly  affect the value of the bonds.  The U.S.  Supreme Court
likely  will  hold oral  arguments  on this case in the fall of 2007 and issue a
decision sometime thereafter. You should consult your tax advisor to discuss the
tax consequences of your investment in a Fund.                                  

The exemption  from federal  income tax for  exempt-interest  dividends does not
necessarily result in exemption for such dividends under the income or other tax
laws of any state or local  authority.  You are advised to consult with your tax
advisor about state and local tax matters.                                      

Taxable  Distributions.  For  federal  income  tax  purposes,  distributions  of
investment income, other than exempt-interest  dividends,  are generally taxable
as ordinary  income.  Taxes on  distributions of capital gains are determined   

57

P-->497257th Page of 358TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 257th
by how long a Fund owned the investments  that generated  them,  rather than how
long a  shareholder  has owned his or her shares.  Distributions  of net capital
gains (that is, the excess of net long-term  capital  gains over net  short-term
capital losses) from the sale of investments that a Fund owned for more than one
year and that are  properly  designated  by the Fund as capital  gain  dividends
("Capital  Gain  Dividends")  will  be  taxable  as  long-term   capital  gains.
Distributions  of gains from the sale of  investments  that a Fund owned for one
year or less will be taxable as ordinary income. For the taxable years beginning
before January 1, 2011,  distributions of investment income designated by a Fund
as derived from "qualified dividend income" are taxed at the rates applicable to
long-term capital gain,  provided holding period and other  requirements are met
at both the shareholder and Fund level.                                         

For taxable years beginning before January 1, 2011,  distributions of investment
income designated by a Fund as derived from "qualified  dividend income" will be
taxed in the hands of an individual at the rates applicable to long-term capital
gain,  provided  holding  periods  and  other  requirements  are met at both the
shareholder  and the Funds levels.  Qualified  dividend  income does not include
interest  from  debt   securities.   Because  the  Funds  invest   primarily  in
tax-exempt-bonds, the Funds do not expect a significant portion of distributions
to be derived from qualified dividend income.                                   

Distributions  are taxable to shareholders  even if they are paid from income or
gains earned by a Fund before a  shareholder's  investment  (and thus might have
been reflected in the price the  shareholder  paid).  Distributions  are taxable
whether  shareholders receive them in cash or reinvest them in additional shares
through the  reinvestment  privilege.  A  shareholder  whose  distributions  are
reinvested in shares will be treated as having  received a dividend equal to the
fair market value of the new shares issued to the shareholder.                  

Long-term  capital gain rates  applicable to individuals  have been  temporarily
reduced -- in general,  to 15% with lower rates applying to taxpayers in the 10%
and 15% rate brackets -- for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2011.    

Special tax rules apply to investments  through defined  contribution  plans and
other  tax-qualified  plans.  Shareholders  should consult their tax advisors to
determine  the  suitability  of shares of a Fund as an  investment  through such
plans and the precise effect of an investment on their particular tax situation.

All distributions by a Fund result in a reduction in the net asset value of that
Fund's  shares.  Should  a  distribution  reduce  the net  asset  value  below a
shareholder's  cost basis,  such distribution may nevertheless be taxable to the
shareholder as ordinary income or capital gain as described above,  even though,
from an investment standpoint, it may constitute a partial return of capital. In
particular,  investors  should be careful to consider  the tax  implications  of
buying  shares just prior to a  distribution.  The price of shares  purchased at
that  time  may  include  the  amount  of the  forthcoming  distribution.  Those
purchasing just prior to a distribution will receive a partial return of capital
upon the distribution, which may nevertheless be taxable to them.               

Sale or  Redemption  of Shares.  The sale,  exchange or  redemption  of a Fund's
shares may give rise to a gain or loss.  In general,  any gain or loss  realized
upon a taxable  disposition of shares will be treated as long-term  capital gain
or loss if the  shares  have been held for more than 12 months.  Otherwise,  the
gain or loss on the taxable  disposition  of a Fund's  shares will be treated as
short-term  capital  gain or loss.  However,  any loss  realized  upon a taxable
disposition  of shares held for six months or less will be treated as long-term,
rather  than   short-term,   to  the  extent  of  any  long-term   capital  gain
distributions  received (or deemed  received) by the shareholder with respect to
the shares. All or a portion of any loss realized upon a taxable  disposition of
a Fund's shares will be disallowed if other  substantially  identical  shares of
the Fund are purchased within 30 days before or after the disposition. In such a
case,  the basis of the newly  purchased  shares will be adjusted to reflect the
disallowed loss.                                                                

Taxation of Certain  Transactions.  If a Fund  engages in hedging  transactions,
including hedging transactions in options,  futures contracts, and straddles, or
other similar  transactions,  it will be subject to special tax rules (including
constructive sale,  mark-to-market,  straddle, wash sale, and short sale rules),
the effect of which may be to accelerate income to the Fund, defer losses to the
Fund, cause adjustments in the holding periods of the Fund's securities, convert
long-term  capital gains into  short-term  capital  gains or convert  short-term
capital losses into long-term capital losses. These rules could therefore affect
the amount,  timing and character of distributions  to  shareholders.           

58

P-->497258th Page of 358TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 258th
Such Fund will  endeavor  to make any  available  elections  pertaining  to such
transactions in a manner believed to be in the best interests of the Fund.      

Certain  of a Fund's  hedging  activities  are  likely to  produce a  difference
between its book income and the sum of its net tax-exempt and taxable income. If
a Fund's book income exceeds its tax-exempt income, the distribution (if any) of
such  excess  will be  treated  as (i) a  dividend  to the  extent of the Fund's
remaining  earnings and profits  (including  earnings  and profits  arising from
tax-exempt income),  (ii) thereafter as a return of capital to the extent of the
recipient's  basis in the shares,  and (iii) thereafter as gain from the sale or
exchange of a capital asset. If a Fund's book income is less than the sum of its
net  tax-exempt  and  taxable  income,  such  Fund  could  be  required  to make
distributions exceeding book income to qualify as a regulated investment company
that is accorded special tax treatment.                                         

A Fund's  investment  in zero  coupon  bonds and other debt  obligations  having
original issue  discount may cause a Fund to recognize  taxable income in excess
of any cash received from the  investment.  A portion of the difference  between
the issue price of zero coupon  securities and their face value ('original issue
discount") is  considered  to be income to a Fund each year,  even though a Fund
will not receive cash  interest  payments from these  securities.  This original
issue discount  imputed  income will comprise a part of the  investment  company
taxable income of a Fund,  which must be distributed to shareholders in order to
maintain the  qualification of a Fund as a regulated  investment  company and to
avoid federal income tax at a Fund's level.                                     

Some debt  obligations with a fixed maturity date of more than one year from the
date of issuance (and all  zero-coupon  debt  obligations  with a fixed maturity
date of more than one year from the date of  issuance)  that are  acquired  by a
Fund  will be  treated  as debt  obligations  that are  issued  originally  at a
discount.  Generally,  the  amount of the  original  issue  discount  ("OID") is
treated as interest income and is included in taxable income (and required to be
distributed)  over the term of the debt  security,  even though  payment of that
amount  is not  received  until a later  time,  usually  when the debt  security
matures. In addition,  payment-in-kind securities will give rise to income which
is  required to be  distributed  and is taxable  even though a Fund  holding the
security receives no interest payment in cash on the security during the year.  

Some debt  obligations with a fixed maturity date of more than one year from the
date of  issuance  that are  acquired by a Fund in the  secondary  market may be
treated  as  having  market  discount.  Generally,  any gain  recognized  on the
disposition  of, and any partial payment of principal on, a debt security having
market  discount  is treated  as  ordinary  income to the  extent  the gain,  or
principal  payment,  does not exceed the "accrued market  discount" on such debt
security. Market discount generally accrues in equal daily installments.  A Fund
may make one or more of the  elections  applicable  to debt  obligations  having
market  discount,  which could affect the character and timing of recognition of
income.                                                                         

In addition, if a Fund invests in high yield original issue discount obligations
issued by  corporations  (including  tax-exempt  obligations),  a portion of the
original  issue  discount  accruing on the  obligation may be treated as taxable
dividend income. In such event,  dividends of investment  company taxable income
received from a fund by its  shareholders,  to the extent  attributable  to such
portion of accrued original issue discount, would be taxable. Any such dividends
received by a Fund's  corporate  shareholders  may be eligible for the deduction
for dividends received by corporations.                                         

Any market discount recognized on a bond is taxable as ordinary income. A market
discount bond is a bond  acquired on the  secondary  market at a price below its
redemption  value (or its  adjusted  issue price if issued with  original  issue
discount).  Absent an election  to include  the market  discount in income as it
accrues,  gain on the  disposition  of such an  obligation  will be  treated  as
ordinary  income  (instead  of capital  gain) to the  extent of  accrued  market
discount.                                                                       

Tax-Exempt Shareholders.  Under current law, each Fund serves to block unrelated
business   taxable  income  ("UBTI")  from  being  realized  by  its  tax-exempt
shareholders.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  a tax-exempt  shareholder  could
realize  UBTI by  virtue  of its  investment  in a Fund if  shares  in the  Fund
constitute  debt-financed  property in the hands of the  tax-exempt  shareholder
within the meaning of Code Section 514(b).  If a charitable                     

59

P-->497259th Page of 358TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 259th
remainder trust (as defined in Code Section 664) realizes any UBTI for a taxable
year, under recent legislation,  it will be subject to a 100% excise tax on such
income (rather than will lose its tax-exempt status, as previously).            

Withholding.  Under the backup  withholding  provisions of the Code,  redemption
proceeds  as  well  as  distributions  may be  subject  to  federal  income  tax
withholding for certain shareholders, including those who fail to furnish a Fund
with their taxpayer  identification  numbers and  certifications as to their tax
status.                                                                         

Non-US Shareholders. Capital Gain Dividends paid to non-US investors will not be
subject to  withholding  of US income  tax. In  general,  dividends  (other than
Capital  Gain  Dividends)  paid by the Fund to a  shareholder  that is not a "US
person" within the meaning of the Code (such  shareholder,  a "foreign  person")
are subject to  withholding  of US federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or lower
applicable  treaty  rate)  even if they are  funded by income or gains  (such as
portfolio  interest,  short-term  capital gains, or foreign-source  dividend and
interest  income)  that,  if paid to a  foreign  person  directly,  would not be
subject to  withholding.  However,  before January 1, 2008, the Fund will not be
required to withhold any amounts (i) with respect to  distributions  (other than
distributions  to a foreign  person  (w) that has not  provided  a  satisfactory
statement that the beneficial  owner is not a US person,  (x) to the extent that
the dividend is attributable to certain interest on an obligation if the foreign
person is the issuer or is a 10%  shareholder of the issuer,  (y) that is within
certain  foreign  countries that have inadequate  information  exchange with the
United  States,  or (z) to the extent the dividend is  attributable  to interest
paid by a person that is a related  person of the foreign person and the foreign
person is a controlled foreign  corporation) from US-source interest income that
would  not be  subject  to US  federal  income  tax  if  earned  directly  by an
individual  foreign  person,  to the  extent  such  distributions  are  properly
designated  by the Fund,  and (ii) with  respect to  distributions  (other  than
distributions  to an  individual  foreign  person  who is  present in the United
States for a period or periods  aggregating  183 days or more during the year of
the  distribution)  of net  short-term  capital gains in excess of net long-term
capital losses, to the extent such distributions are properly  designated by the
Fund.  Depending on the circumstances,  the Fund may make such designations with
respect to all, some or none of its potentially  eligible dividends and/or treat
such  dividends,  in whole or in part, as  ineligible  for this  exemption  from
withholding.  In order to qualify for this exemption from withholding, a foreign
person will need to comply with applicable  certification  requirements relating
to its non-US status  (including,  in general,  furnishing an IRS Form W-8BEN or
substitute  form).  In the case of shares  held  through  an  intermediary,  the
intermediary may withhold even if the Fund makes a designation with respect to a
payment. Foreign persons should consult their intermediaries with respect to the
application of these rules to their account.                                    

If a  beneficial  holder who is a foreign  person has a trade or business in the
United States,  and the dividends are effectively  connected with the conduct by
the beneficial holder of a trade or business in the United States,  the dividend
will be subject to US federal net income taxation at regular income tax rates.  

Tax Shelter Reporting Regulations.  Under Treasury regulations, if a shareholder
recognizes a loss with  respect to a Fund's  shares of $2 million or more for an
individual shareholder or $10 million or more for a corporate  shareholder,  the
shareholder must file with the Internal  Revenue Service a disclosure  statement
on Form 8886.  Direct  shareholders  of portfolio  securities  are in many cases
excepted  from  this  reporting   requirement,   but  under  current   guidance,
shareholders of a regulated investment company are not excepted. Future guidance
may extend the current exception from this reporting requirement to shareholders
of  most  or all  regulated  investment  companies.  The  fact  that  a loss  is
reportable under these  regulations  does not affect the legal  determination of
whether the  taxpayer's  treatment  of the loss is proper.  Shareholders  should
consult their tax advisors to determine the  applicability of these  regulations
in light of their individual circumstances.                                     

Investors  are advised to consult  their own advisors  with respect to their own
circumstances  regarding the above-referenced  federal income taxation rules and
with respect to other federal,  state, local or foreign tax consequences to them
of an investment in shares of a Fund.                                           

Tax-Equivalent Yield                                                            

Tax-equivalent  yield is the net  annualized  taxable  yield needed to produce a
specified  tax-exempt  yield at a given tax rate based on a specified 30-day (or
one-month)  period  assuming  semiannual  compounding of income.  Tax-          

60

P-->497260th Page of 358TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 260th
equivalent  yield is calculated by dividing that portion of a Fund's yield which
is  tax-exempt  by one minus a stated  income tax rate and adding the product to
that portion, if any, of the yield of a Fund that is not tax-exempt.            

Tax-Exempt  Versus Taxable Yield.  You may want to determine which investment --
tax-exempt  or taxable -- will provide you with a higher  after-tax  return.  To
determine  the  taxable  equivalent  yield,  simply  divide  the yield  from the
tax-exempt  investment by the sum of 1 minus your marginal tax rate.  The tables
below are provided for your  convenience in making this calculation for selected
tax-exempt  yields and taxable  income  levels.  These yields are  presented for
purposes of illustration only and are not representative of any yield a Fund may
generate.  The  tables  are  based  upon  current  law as to the 2007 tax  rates
schedules.

 NET ASSET VALUE

The net  asset  value of  shares  of each  Fund is  computed  as of the close of
regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange (the  "Exchange") on each day the
Exchange is open for trading (the "Value Time"). The Exchange is scheduled to be
closed on the following  holidays:  New Year's Day, Dr. Martin Luther King,  Jr.
Day,  Presidents' Day, Good Friday,  Memorial Day,  Independence Day, Labor Day,
Thanksgiving  and Christmas,  and on the preceding  Friday or subsequent  Monday
when one of these  holidays  falls on a Saturday  or Sunday,  respectively.  Net
asset  value  per share is  determined  separately  for each  class of shares by
dividing the value of the total assets of the Fund attributable to the shares of
that class, less all liabilities attributable to that class, by the total number
of shares of that class outstanding.  The per share net asset value may be lower
for  certain  classes  of the Fund  because  of higher  expenses  borne by these
classes.                                                                        

An equity  security is valued at its most  recent  sale price on the  security's
primary  exchange  or OTC market as of the Value Time.  Lacking  any sales,  the
security is valued at the calculated  mean between the most recent bid quotation
and the most recent asked quotation (the "Calculated  Mean") on such exchange or
OTC  market  as of the  Value  Time.  If it is not  possible  to  determine  the
Calculated Mean, the security is valued at the most recent bid quotation on such
exchange  or OTC market as of the Value  Time.  In the case of  certain  foreign
exchanges  or OTC  markets,  the closing  price  reported by the exchange or OTC
market  (which may  sometimes  be  referred  to as the  "official  close" or the
"official  closing  price" or other similar  term) will be  considered  the most
recent sale price.                                                              

Debt securities are valued as follows.  Money market instruments  purchased with
an  original or  remaining  maturity  of 60 days or less,  maturing at par,  are
valued at amortized  cost.  Other money market  instruments  are valued based on
information  obtained from an approved  pricing agent or, if such information is
not readily  available,  by using  matrix  pricing  techniques  (formula  driven
calculations based primarily on current market yields). Bank loans are valued at
prices supplied by an approved  pricing agent (which are intended to reflect the
mean between the bid and asked prices), if available,  and otherwise at the mean
of the most recent bid and asked quotations or evaluated  prices, as applicable,
based  on   quotations   or  evaluated   prices   obtained   from  one  or  more
broker-dealers.  Privately  placed  debt  securities,  other than Rule 144A debt
securities,  initially are valued at cost and  thereafter  based on all relevant
factors  including  type  of  security,  size of  holding  and  restrictions  on
disposition.  Municipal  debt  securities  are valued at prices  supplied  by an
approved  pricing  agent (which are intended to reflect the mean between the bid
and asked  prices),  if available,  and otherwise at the mean of the most recent
bid and asked quotations or evaluated price obtained from a broker-dealer. Other
debt securities are valued at prices  supplied by an approved  pricing agent, if
available, and otherwise at the most recent bid quotation or evaluated price, as
applicable,  obtained from one or more broker-dealers.  If it is not possible to
value a particular debt security pursuant to the above methods,  the security is
valued on the basis of factors including (but not limited to) maturity,  coupon,
creditworthiness, currency denomination, and the movement of the market in which
the security is normally traded.                                                

An exchange-traded option contract on securities, currencies and other financial
instruments  is valued at its most recent sale price on the  relevant  exchange.
Lacking any sales,  the option contract is valued at the Calculated  Mean. If it
is not possible to determine the Calculated  Mean, the option contract is valued
at the most recent bid quotation in the case of a purchased  option  contract or
the most recent asked  quotation in the case of a written  option  contract,  in
each case as of the Value Time. An option contract on securities, currencies and
other financial instruments traded in the OTC market is valued on the Value Date
at the evaluated price provided by the  broker-dealer  with which it was traded.
Futures contracts (and options thereon) are valued at the most recent settlement
price, if available,  on the exchange on which they are traded most extensively.
With the exception of stock index futures  contracts  which trade on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange,  closing settlement times are prior to the close of trading
on the New York Stock Exchange. For stock index futures contracts which trade on
the  Chicago  Mercantile  Exchange,   closing  settlement  prices  are  normally
available  at  approximately  4:20  Eastern  time.  If no  settlement  price  is
available, the last traded price on such exchange will be used.                 

If market  quotations  for a portfolio  asset are not readily  available  or the
value of a portfolio  asset as  determined  in  accordance  with Board  approved
procedures does not represent the fair market value of the portfolio  asset, the
value of the portfolio  asset is taken to be an amount which,  in the opinion of
the  Fund's  Pricing  Committee  (or,  in  some  cases,  the  Board's  Valuation
Committee),  represents fair market value. The value of other portfolio holdings
owned

by the Fund is  determined  in a manner which is intended to fairly  reflect the
fair  market  value  of the  asset on the  valuation  date,  based on  valuation
procedures  adopted by the Fund's  Board and  overseen  primarily  by the Fund's
Pricing Committee.                                                              

 TRUSTEES AND OFFICERS

The following table presents certain information  regarding the Board Members of
the Trust.  Each Board Member's year of birth is set forth in parentheses  after
his or her name.  Unless  otherwise  noted, (i) each Board Member has engaged in
the principal occupation(s) noted in the table for at least the most recent five
years,  although not  necessarily in the same capacity,  and (ii) the address of
each Board  Member that is not an  "interested  persons" (as defined in the 1940
Act) of the Trust or the Advisor (each, an "Independent  Board Member"),  is c/o
Dawn-Marie Driscoll, PO Box 100176, Cape Coral, FL 33904. The term of office for
each Board  Member is until the election and  qualification  of a successor,  or
until  such Board  Member  sooner  dies,  resigns,  is  removed or as  otherwise
provided in the governing documents of the Trust. Because the Fund does not hold
an annual  meeting of  shareholders,  each Board  Member will hold office for an
indeterminate  period.  The Board  Members may also serve in similar  capacities
with other funds in the DWS fund complex.

Fund's  accounting and financial  reporting  practices,  and performs such other
tasks as the full Board deems  necessary  or  appropriate.  The Audit  Committee

Keith R. Fox (Chair and Audit Committee Financial Expert),  Kenneth C. Froewiss,

Remuneration.  Each Independent Board Member receives compensation from the Fund
for his or her services, which includes an annual retainer and an attendance fee
for each meeting attended. No additional compensation is paid to any Independent
Board Member for travel time to meetings,  attendance at directors'  educational
seminars  or  conferences,   service  on  industry  or  association  committees,
participation  as speakers at directors'  conferences or service on special fund
industry director task forces or subcommittees. Independent Board Members do not
receive any employee  benefits such as pension or retirement  benefits or health
insurance from the Fund or any fund in the DWS fund complex.                    

Members of the Board who are officers,  directors,  employees or stockholders of
Deutsche Asset Management or its affiliates receive no direct  compensation from
a Fund, although they are compensated as employees of Deutsche Asset Management,
or its affiliates,  and as a result may be deemed to participate in fees paid by
the Funds.  The following tables show  compensation  from the Fund and aggregate
compensation  from all of the  funds in the DWS fund  complex  received  by each
Board Member during the calendar year 2006. Mr. Schwarzer became a member of the
Board on May 5,  2006,  is an  interested  person of the Funds and  received  no
compensation  from the  Funds or any fund in the DWS  fund  complex  during  the
relevant periods.

Agreement to Indemnify Independent Trustees for Certain Expenses                

In connection with litigation or regulatory  action related to possible improper
market timing or other improper trading activity or possible improper  marketing
and sales  activity  in the Funds,  each Fund's  investment  advisor has agreed,
subject to  applicable  law and  regulation,  to indemnify and hold harmless the
applicable  Funds  against  any and all loss,  damage,  liability  and  expense,
arising  from  market  timing or  marketing  and sales  matters  alleged  in any
enforcement actions brought by governmental authorities involving or potentially
affecting the Funds or the investment  advisor  ("Enforcement  Actions") or that
are the basis for private  actions  brought by shareholders of the Funds against
the Funds,  their directors and officers,  the Funds' investment  advisor and/or
certain other parties ("Private Litigation"), or any proceedings or actions that
may  be  threatened  or  commenced  in  the  future  by  any  person  (including
governmental authorities), arising from or similar to the matters alleged in the
Enforcement Actions or Private Litigation.  In recognition of its undertaking to
indemnify  the  applicable  Funds  and in  light of the  rebuttable  presumption
generally  afforded to independent  directors/trustees  of investment  companies
that they have not engaged in disabling conduct,  each Fund's investment advisor
has also agreed,  subject to  applicable  law and  regulation,  to indemnify the
applicable  Funds'   Independent   Trustees  against  certain   liabilities  the
Independent  Trustees  may incur from the  matters  alleged  in any  Enforcement
Actions or Private  Litigation or arising from or similar to the matters alleged
in the Enforcement Actions or Private Litigation,  and advance expenses that may
be  incurred by the  Independent  Trustees in  connection  with any  Enforcement
Actions  or  Private  Litigation.  The  applicable  investment  advisor  is not,
however,  required to provide  indemnification and advancement of expenses:  (1)
with respect to any  proceeding  or action with respect to which the  applicable
Fund's Board  determines that the Independent  Trustee  ultimately  would not be
entitled to indemnification or (2) for any liability of the Independent  Trustee
to the  Funds or their  shareholders  to which  the  Independent  Trustee  would
otherwise  be  subject  by reason  of  willful  misfeasance,  bad  faith,  gross
negligence  or  reckless  disregard  of the  Independent  Trustee's  duties as a
director or trustee of the Funds as determined in a final  adjudication  in such
action or proceeding.  The estimated amount of any expenses that may be advanced
to the Independent Trustees or indemnity that may be payable under

the indemnity  agreements is currently unknown.  These agreements by each Fund's
investment  advisor will survive the  termination of the  investment  management
agreements between the applicable investment advisor and the Funds.             

 FUND ORGANIZATION

Organizational Description                                                      

DWS  Municipal  Trust is a  Massachusetts  business  trust  established  under a
Declaration of Trust dated  September 24, 1976, as amended.  The Trustees of DWS
Municipal  Trust have  established  and designated two series of the Trust:  DWS
High Yield Tax Free Fund and DWS Managed  Municipal Bond Fund,  both open ended,
diversified  investment  companies.  Effective October 1, 2002,  Scudder Managed
Municipal  Bonds  changed its name to Scudder  Managed  Municipal  Bond Fund. On
February 6, 2006, the Trust and its series: Scudder High Yield Tax-Free Fund and
Scudder Managed  Municipal Bond Fund were renamed DWS Municipal  Trust, DWS High
Yield Tax Free Fund and DWS  Managed  Municipal  Bond  Fund,  respectively.  The
Trust's  authorized  capital  consists  of an  unlimited  number  of  shares  of
beneficial  interest,  par value $0.01 per share. DWS Intermediate  Tax/AMT Free
Fund  is a  series  of DWS  Tax  Free  Trust,  a  Massachusetts  business  trust
established  under a Declaration  of Trust dated  December 28, 1982, as amended.
The name and investment  objectives of the Fund were changed effective  November
1, 1990.  Effective  October 1, 2003,  Scudder Medium Term Tax-Free Fund changed
its name to Scudder  Intermediate  Tax/AMT Free Fund.  On February 6, 2006,  the
Trust and its series:  Scudder  Intermediate  Tax/AMT Free Fund were renamed DWS
Tax Free Trust and DWS Intermediate Tax/AMT Free Fund, respectively.  The Fund's
authorized  capital  consists  of an  unlimited  number of shares of  beneficial
interest, $.01 par value.                                                       

Currently, Class A, Class B, Class C, Class S and Institutional Class shares are
offered                                                                         

Each  Trust  is a  Massachusetts  business  trust  organized  under  the laws of
Massachusetts  and is governed by an Amended and Restated  Declaration  of Trust
that was  approved  by  shareholders  in the second  quarter of 2006,  as may be
further  amended  from time to time (the  "Declaration  of  Trust").  All shares
issued and  outstanding are fully paid and  non-assessable  (except as set forth
below), transferable, have no pre-emptive or conversion rights (except as may be
determined by the Board of Trustees) and are  redeemable as described in the SAI
and a Fund's  prospectus.  Each share has equal  rights with each other share of
the same  class  of the  Fund as to  voting,  dividends,  exchanges,  conversion
features and  liquidation.  Shareholders  are entitled to one vote for each full
share held and fractional votes for fractional shares held.                     

A Fund generally is not required to hold meetings of its shareholders. Under the
Declaration of Trust of DWS Municipal Trust, however,  shareholder meetings will
be held in connection  with the following  matters to the extent and as provided
in the  Declaration of Trust and as required by applicable law: (a) the election
or  removal  of  trustees  if a meeting  is  called  for such  purpose;  (b) the
termination  of the Trust or a Fund;  (c) an  amendment  of the  Declaration  of
Trust;  and  (d)  such  additional  matters  as  may be  required  by  law,  the
Declaration of Trust,  the By-laws of a Fund, or any registration of a Fund with
the  SEC,  or as the  Trustees  may  determine  to be  necessary  or  desirable.
Shareholders also vote upon changes in fundamental policies or restrictions.    

Under  the  Declaration  of Trust of DWS Tax Free  Trust,  however,  shareholder
meetings will be held in connection with the following matters to the extent and
as provided in the  Declaration of Trust and as required by applicable  law: (a)
the election or removal of trustees if a meeting is called for such purpose; (b)
the  termination of the Trust or a Fund; (c) an amendment of the  Declaration of
Trust;  (d) to  the  same  extent  as  stockholders  of  Massachusetts  business
corporation as to whether or not a court action,  proceeding or claims should or
should not be brought or maintained  derivatively or as a class action on behalf
of the Trust or the Shareholders; (e) a merger, consolidation or sale of assets;
(f) the  adoption of an  investment  advisory or  management  contract;  (g) the
incorporation of the Trust or any series;  (h) any plan adopted pursuant to Rule
12b-1  (or any  successor  rule)  under the 1940  Act;  and (i) such  additional
matters as may be required by law, the  Declaration  of Trust,  the By-laws of a
Fund,  or any  registration  of a Fund  with the  SEC,  or as the  Trustees  may
determine to be necessary or desirable.  Shareholders  also vote upon changes in
fundamental policies or restrictions.                                           

The Declaration of Trust provides that shareholder  meeting quorum  requirements
shall be established  in the Trust's  By-laws.  The By-laws  currently in effect
provide that the presence in person or by proxy of the holders of thirty        

75

P-->497275th Page of 358TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 275th
percent of the shares entitled to vote at a meeting (or of an individual  series
or class if  required  to vote  separately)  shall  constitute  a quorum for the
transaction of business at meetings of shareholders of the Trust.               

On any  matter  submitted  to a vote of  shareholders,  all  shares of the Trust
entitled to vote shall,  except as otherwise provided in the Trust's By-Laws, be
voted in the aggregate as a single class without  regard to series or classes of
shares,  except (a) when required by applicable  law or when the Trustees  shall
have  determined that the matter affects one or more series or classes of shares
materially differently, shares shall be voted by individual series or class; and
(b) when the Trustees have determined that the matter affects only the interests
of one or more series or classes,  only  shareholders  of such series or classes
shall be entitled to vote thereon.                                              

The  Declaration  of Trust  provides  that the  Board of  Trustees  may,  in its
discretion,  establish  minimum  investment  amounts for  shareholder  accounts,
impose  fees on  accounts  that do not  exceed a minimum  investment  amount and
involuntarily  redeem  shares in any such  account in payment of such fees.  The
Board of Trustees,  in its sole  discretion,  also may cause the Trust to redeem
all of the  shares of the Trust or one or more  series  or  classes  held by any
shareholder for any reason, to the extent permissible by the 1940 Act, including
(a) if the  shareholder  owns shares having an aggregate net asset value of less
than a specified minimum amount, (b) if a particular  shareholder's ownership of
shares would disqualify a series from being a regulated  investment company, (c)
upon a shareholder's failure to provide sufficient  identification to permit the
Trust to verify the shareholder's  identity, (d) upon a shareholder's failure to
pay for  shares  or meet or  maintain  the  qualifications  for  ownership  of a
particular  class or series of shares,  (e) if the Board of Trustees  determines
(or pursuant to policies  established by the Board it is determined)  that share
ownership by a particular  shareholder is not in the best interests of remaining
shareholders, (f) when a Fund is requested or compelled to do so by governmental
authority or applicable law and (g) upon a shareholder's  failure to comply with
a request for  information  with respect to the direct or indirect  ownership of
shares of the  Trust.  The  Declaration  of Trust also  authorizes  the Board of
Trustees to terminate a Fund or any class without shareholder approval,  and the
Trust may  suspend  the right of  shareholders  to  require  the Trust to redeem
shares to the extent permissible under the 1940 Act.                            

Upon the  termination  of the Trust or any series,  after  paying or  adequately
providing for the payment of all liabilities which may include the establishment
of a liquidating  trust or similar  vehicle,  and upon receipt of such releases,
indemnities   and  refunding   agreements  as  they  deem  necessary  for  their
protection, the Trustees may distribute the remaining Trust property or property
of the series,  in cash or in kind or partly each,  to the  shareholders  of the
Trust or the series involved,  ratably  according to the number of shares of the
Trust or such  series  held by the  several  shareholders  of the  Trust or such
series on the date of termination,  except to the extent  otherwise  required or
permitted by the  preferences  and special or relative  rights and privileges of
any classes of shares of a series  involved,  provided that any  distribution to
the  shareholders  of a  particular  class  of  shares  shall  be  made  to such
shareholders  pro rata in  proportion to the number of shares of such class held
by  each  of  them.  The  composition  of any  such  distribution  (e.g.,  cash,
securities  or  other  assets)  shall  be  determined  by the  Trust in its sole
discretion, and may be different among shareholders (including differences among
shareholders in the same series or class).                                      

Under Massachusetts law,  shareholders of a Massachusetts  business trust could,
under certain  circumstances,  be held  personally  liable for  obligations of a
Fund. The Declaration of Trust,  however,  disclaims  shareholder  liability for
acts or obligations  of the Fund and requires that notice of such  disclaimer be
given in each agreement,  obligation,  or instrument entered into or executed by
the Fund or the Fund's trustees. Moreover, the Declaration of Trust provides for
indemnification  out of  Fund  property  for  all  losses  and  expenses  of any
shareholder held personally  liable for the obligations of the Fund and the Fund
may be  covered by  insurance  which the  Trustees  consider  adequate  to cover
foreseeable  tort claims.  Thus, the risk of a shareholder  incurring  financial
loss on account of shareholder liability is considered by the Advisor remote and
not  material,  since it is limited to  circumstances  in which a disclaimer  is
inoperative and the Fund itself is unable to meet its obligations.              

 PROXY VOTING GUIDELINES

Each Fund has delegated proxy voting responsibilities to its investment advisor,
subject to each Board's general oversight.  Each Fund has delegated proxy voting
to the Advisor with the direction that proxies should be voted  consistent  with
each  Fund's  best  economic  interests.  The  Advisor has adopted its own Proxy
Voting  Policies  and  Procedures  ("Policies"),  and  Proxy  Voting  Guidelines
("Guidelines")  for this  purpose.  The Policies  address,  among               

76

P-->497276th Page of 358TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 276th
other things, conflicts of interest that may arise between the interests of each
Fund, and the interests of the Advisor and its affiliates, including each Fund's
principal  underwriter.  The Guidelines set forth the Advisor's general position
on various proposals, such as:                                                  

o        Shareholder  Rights -- The Advisor  generally  votes against  proposals
that restrict shareholder rights.                             

o        Corporate  Governance -- The Advisor  generally votes for  confidential
         and cumulative voting and against supermajority voting requirements for
         charter and bylaw amendments. The Advisor generally votes for proposals
         to restrict a chief  executive  officer from serving on more than three
         outside  board  of  directors.  The  Advisor  generally  votes  against
         proposals  that  require a company  to  appoint  a  Chairman  who is an
independent director.                                         

o        Anti-Takeover Matters -- The Advisor generally votes for proposals that
         require shareholder ratification of poison pills or that request boards
         to redeem poison pills,  and votes against the adoption of poison pills
         if  they  are  submitted  for  shareholder  ratification.  The  Advisor
generally votes for fair price proposals.                     

o        Compensation  Matters -- The Advisor generally votes for executive cash
         compensation  proposals,  unless they are unreasonably  excessive.  The
         Advisor generally votes against stock option plans that do not meet the
Advisor's criteria.                                           

o        Routine Matters -- The Advisor  generally votes for the ratification of
         auditors,  procedural matters related to the annual meeting and changes
 in company name, and against bundled proposals and adjournment.

The general provisions described above do not apply to investment companies. The
Advisor generally votes proxies solicited by investment  companies in accordance
with the  recommendations  of an  independent  third  party,  except for proxies
solicited by or with respect to investment companies for which the Advisor or an
affiliate  serves as investment  advisor or principal  underwriter  ("affiliated
investment companies").  The Advisor votes affiliated investment company proxies
in  the  same  proportion  as  the  vote  of  the  investment   company's  other
shareholders  (sometimes called "mirror" or "echo" voting).  Master fund proxies
solicited from feeder funds are voted in accordance with applicable requirements
of the Investment Company Act of 1940.                                          

Although the  Guidelines  set forth the Advisor's  general  voting  positions on
various proposals,  the Advisor may, consistent with each Fund's best interests,
determine under some circumstances to vote contrary to those positions.         

The  Guidelines  on a  particular  issue  may or may  not  reflect  the  view of
individual  members of each Board or of a majority of each Board.  In  addition,
the  Guidelines  may  reflect a voting  position  that  differs  from the actual
practices of the public  companies  within the Deutsche Bank  organization or of
the  investment  companies  for  which the  Advisor  or an  affiliate  serves as
investment advisor or sponsor.                                                  

The  Advisor  may  consider  the views of a portfolio  company's  management  in
deciding how to vote a proxy or in establishing general voting positions for the
Guidelines, but management's views are not determinative.                       

As mentioned above, the Policies  describe the way in which the Advisor resolves
conflicts  of  interest.  To  resolve  conflicts,   the  advisor,  under  normal
circumstances,  votes proxies in accordance with its Guidelines.  If the Advisor
departs  from  the  Guidelines  with  respect  to a  particular  proxy or if the
Guidelines do not specifically  address a certain proxy proposal, a proxy voting
committee established by the advisor will vote the proxy. Before voting any such
proxy,  however,  the  Advisor's  conflicts  review  committee  will  conduct an
investigation to determine whether any potential  conflicts of interest exist in
connection with the particular proxy proposal. If the conflicts review committee
determines  that the Advisor has a material  conflict  of  interest,  or certain
individuals on the proxy voting committee  should be recused from  participating
in a  particular  proxy vote,  it will  inform the proxy  voting  committee.  If
notified  that the Advisor has a material  conflict,  or fewer than three voting
members are eligible to  participate  in the proxy vote,  typically  the Advisor
will  engage an  independent  third  party to vote the proxy or follow the proxy
voting recommendations of an independent third party.

Under certain circumstances,  the Advisor may not be able to vote proxies or the
Advisor  may find that the  expected  economic  costs from voting  outweigh  the
benefits  associated with voting. For example,  the Advisor may not vote proxies
on certain foreign securities due to local restrictions or customs.  The Advisor
generally  does  not vote  proxies  on  securities  subject  to  share  blocking
restrictions.

portfolio  securities  during the 12-month  period ended June 30 by visiting the

RATINGS OF INVESTMENTS
BOND AND COMMERCIAL PAPER RATINGS                                               

Set forth below are  descriptions of ratings which represent  opinions as to the
quality of the securities.  It should be emphasized,  however,  that ratings are
relative and subjective and are not absolute standards of quality.              

MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE, INC.'S -- CORPORATE BOND RATINGS                     

Aaa:  Bonds  which are rated Aaa are judged to be of the highest  quality.  They
carry the smallest  degree of investment  risk and are generally  referred to as
"gilt-edged."  Interest payments are protected by a large or by an exceptionally
stable margin and principal is secure. While the various protective elements are
likely to change,  such changes as can be visualized are most unlikely to impair
the fundamentally strong position of such issues.                               

Aa: Bonds which are rated Aa are judged to be of high quality by all  standards.
Together with the Aaa group they comprise what are generally known as high grade
bonds.  They are rated lower than the best bonds  because  margins of protection
may not be as large as in Aaa securities or fluctuations of protective  elements
may be of greater  amplitude or there may be other  elements  present which make
the long-term risk appear somewhat larger than in Aaa securities.               

A: Bonds which are rated A possess many favorable investment  attributes and are
to be considered as upper -medium grade obligations.  Factors giving security to
principal  and interest  are  considered  adequate,  but elements may be present
which suggest a susceptibility to impairment sometime in the future.            

Baa:  Bonds  which are rated Baa are  considered  as medium  grade  obligations,
(i.e., they are neither highly protected nor poorly secured).  Interest payments
and principal  security appear adequate for the present,  but certain protective
elements may be lacking or may be  characteristically  unreliable over any great
length of time. Such bonds lack outstanding  investment  characteristics  and in
fact have speculative characteristics as well.                                  

Ba:  Bonds  which are rated Ba are judged to have  speculative  elements;  their
future cannot be considered  as well assured.  Often the  protection of interest
and principal  payments may be very  moderate and thereby not well  safe-guarded
during  both  good  and bad  times  over the  future.  Uncertainty  of  position
characterizes bonds in this class.                                              

B:  Bonds  which are  rated B are  considered  speculative  and  generally  lack
characteristics of the desirable investment. Assurance of interest and principal
payments or of  maintenance  of other terms of the contract over any long period
of time may be small.                                                           

Caa:  Bonds  which are rated Caa are of poor  standing.  Such  issues  may be in
default or there may be present  elements of danger with respect to principal or
interest.                                                                       

Ca: Bonds which are rated Ca represent obligations which are highly speculative.
Such issues are often in default or have other marked shortcomings.             

C: Bonds which are rated C are the lowest rated class of bonds, typically are in
default and can be regarded as having extremely poor prospects of ever attaining
any real investment standing.                                                   

Note:  Moody's  appends  numerical  modifiers 1, 2 and 3 to each generic  rating
classification  from Aa through Caa in its  corporate  bond rating  system.  The
modifier 1  indicates  that the issue  ranks in the  higher  end of its  generic
rating category;  the modifier 2 indicates a mid-range ranking; and the modifier
3  indicates  that  the  issue  ranks in the  lower  end of its  generic  rating
category.

MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE, INC.'S -- SHORT-TERM RATINGS                         

Moody's  short-term debt ratings are opinions of the ability of issuers to honor
short-term financial obligations. Ratings may be assigned to issuers, short-term
programs  or  to  individual  short-term  debt  instruments.   Such  obligations
generally  have an original  maturity  not  exceeding  thirteen  months,  unless
explicitly noted.                                                               

Issuers  rated  Prime-1  or P-1 (or  supporting  institutions)  have a  superior
ability for repayment of short-term debt  obligations.  Prime-1 or P-1 repayment
ability will often be evidenced by many of the following characteristics:       

Leading market positions in well established industries.                        

High rates of return on funds employed.                                         

Conservative  capitalization  structure with moderate reliance on debt and ample
asset protection.                                                               

Broad margins in earnings  coverage of fixed financial charges and high internal
cash generation.                                                                

Well established  access to a range of financial  markets and assured sources of
alternate liquidity.                                                            

Issuers rated Prime-2 or P-2 (or supporting  institutions) have a strong ability
for repayment of short term debt obligations. This will normally be evidenced by
many of the characteristics cited above but to a lesser degree.  Earnings trends
and  coverage   ratios,   while  sound,   may  be  more  subject  to  variation.
Capitalization characteristics, while still appropriate, may be more affected by
external conditions. Ample alternate liquidity is maintained.                   

MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE, INC.'S -- MUNICIPAL SHORT-TERM RATINGS               

MIG.  Moody's  short-term debt ratings are opinions of the ability of issuers to
honor  short-term  financial  obligations.  Ratings  may be assigned to issuers,
short-term  programs  or  to  individual   short-term  debt  instruments.   Such
obligations  generally have an original maturity not exceeding  thirteen months,
unless explicitly noted.                                                        

Moody's: The highest ratings for state and municipal short-term  obligations are
"MIG 1," "MIG 2," and "MIG 3" (or "VMIG 1," "VMIG 2" and "VMIG 3" in the case of
an issue having a variable rate demand feature). Notes rated "MIG 1" or "VMIG 1"
are judged to be of the "best  quality".  Notes rated "MIG 2" or "VMIG 2" are of
"high  quality," with margins or protection  "ample  although not as large as in
the  preceding  group".  Notes  rated  "MIG  3" or  "VMIG  3" are of  "favorable
quality," with all security  elements  accounted for but lacking the strength of
the preceding grades.                                                           

STANDARD & POOR'S RATINGS SERVICES -- CORPORATE BOND RATINGS                    

INVESTMENT GRADE 

AAA:  Debt  rated  AAA  has the  highest  rating  assigned  by  S&P's  to a debt
obligation. Capacity to pay interest and repay principal is extremely strong.   

AA: Debt rated AA has a very strong capacity to pay interest and repay principal
and differs from the higher rated issues only in small degree.                  

A: Debt  rated A has a strong  capacity  to pay  interest  and  repay  principal
although it is somewhat more  susceptible  to the adverse  effects of changes in
circumstances and economic conditions than bonds in higher rated categories.    

BBB:  Debt  rated  BBB  has an  adequate  capacity  to pay  interest  and  repay
principal. Whereas it normally exhibits adequate protection parameters,  adverse
economic  conditions  or  changing  circumstances  are more  likely to lead to a
weakened  capacity to pay interest and repay principal for debt in this category
than in higher rated categories.

SPECULATIVE GRADE                                                               

Debt rated BB, B, CCC,  CC, and C has  significant  speculative  characteristics
with respect to capacity to pay interest and repay  principal.  BB indicates the
least degree of speculation and C the highest.  While such debt will likely have
some quality and  protective  characteristics,  these may be outweighed by large
uncertainties or major exposures to adverse conditions.                         

BB:  Debt  rated BB has less  near-term  vulnerability  to  default  than  other
speculative issues. However, it faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to
adverse  business,  financial,  or  economic  conditions  which  could  lead  to
inadequate capacity to meet timely interest and principal payments.             

The BB rating category is also used for debt subordinated to senior debt that is
assigned an actual or implied BBB- rating.                                      

B: Debt rated B has a greater  vulnerability  to default but  currently  has the
capacity to meet interest payments and principal  repayments.  Adverse business,
financial,  or economic conditions will likely impair capacity or willingness to
pay interest and repay principal.                                               

The B rating category is also used for debt  subordinated to senior debt that is
assigned an actual or implied BB or BB- rating.                                 

CCC:  Debt rated CCC has a current  vulnerability  to default,  and is dependent
upon  favorable  business,  financial,  and economic  conditions  to meet timely
payment  of  interest  and  repayment  of  principal.  In the  event of  adverse
business,  financial,  or  economic  conditions,  it is not  likely  to have the
capacity to pay interest and repay principal.                                   

The CCC rating  category is also used for debt  subordinated to senior debt that
is assigned an actual or implied B or B- rating.                                

CC: Debt rated CC has a current high vulnerability to default,  and is dependent
upon  favorable  business,  financial,  and economic  conditions  to meet timely
payment of interest and repayment of principal.                                 

The  rating CC is also  applied  to debt  subordinated  to senior  debt which is
assigned an actual or implied CCC debt rating.                                  

C: The rating C is typically  applied to debt  subordinated to senior debt which
is assigned an actual or implied CCC- debt  rating.  The C rating may be used to
cover a situation where a bankruptcy  petition has been filed,  but debt service
payments are continued.                                                         

C1: The Rating C1 is  reserved  for income  bonds on which no  interest is being
paid.                                                                           

D:  Debt  rated D is in  payment  default.  The D rating  category  is used when
interest payments or principal payments are not made on the date due even if the
applicable grace period has not expired,  unless Standard & Poor's believes that
such payments  will be made during such grace period.  The D rating also will be
used upon the filing of a  bankruptcy  petition  if debt  service  payments  are
jeopardized.                                                                    

Plus  (+) or  Minus  (-):  The  ratings  from AA to CCC may be  modified  by the
addition  of a plus or minus  sign to show  relative  standing  within the major
rating categories.                                                              

R:  Debt  rated  "R" is under  regulatory  supervision  owing  to its  financial
condition. During the pendency of the regulatory supervision, the regulators may
have the  power to  favor  one  class of  obligations  over  others  or pay some
obligations and not others.

N.R.: Bonds may lack a S&P's rating because no public rating has been requested,
because there is insufficient  information on which to base a rating, or because
S&P's does not rate a particular type of obligation as a matter of policy.      

STANDARD & POOR'S RATINGS SERVICES -- SHORT-TERM RATINGS                        

S&P's  commercial  paper rating is a current  assessment  of the  likelihood  of
timely payment of debt considered short-term in the relevant market.            

A-1: This highest category  indicates that the degree of safety regarding timely
payment is strong.  Those issues  determined to possess  extremely strong safety
characteristics are denoted with a plus (+) sign designation.                   

A-2:   Capacity  for  timely   payment  on  issues  with  this   designation  is
satisfactory.  However,  the  relative  degree  of  safety is not as high as for
issues designated A-1.                                                          

A-3: Issues carrying this designation have adequate capacity for timely payment.
However,  adverse economic conditions or changing  circumstances are more likely
to lead to a weakened capacity of the issuer to meet its financial commitments. 

FITCH INVESTORS SERVICE, INC. -- BOND RATINGS                                   

INVESTMENT GRADE 

AAA: Bonds  considered to be investment grade and of the highest credit quality.
The  obligor  has an  exceptionally  strong  ability to pay  interest  and repay
principal, which is unlikely to be affected by reasonably foreseeable events.   

AA: Bonds considered to be investment grade and of very high credit quality. The
obligor's  ability to pay interest and repay principal is very strong,  although
not quite as strong as bonds rated AAA. Bonds rated in the AAA and AA categories
are not significantly vulnerable to foreseeable events.                         

A: Bonds  considered  to be  investment  grade and of high credit  quality.  The
obligor's  ability to pay  interest  and repay  principal  is  considered  to be
strong, but may be more vulnerable to adverse changes in economic conditions and
circumstances than bonds with higher ratings.                                   

BBB: Bonds  considered to be investment  grade and of good credit  quality.  The
obligor's  ability to pay  interest  and repay  principal  is  considered  to be
adequate. Adverse changes in economic conditions and circumstances, however, are
more likely to have adverse impact on these bonds, and therefore,  impair timely
payment.  The  likelihood  that the  ratings  of these  bonds  will  fall  below
investment grade is higher than for bonds with higher ratings.                  

SPECULATIVE GRADE                                                               

BB: Bonds are considered speculative.  The obligor's ability to pay interest and
repay principal may be affected over time by adverse economic changes.  However,
business or  financial  alternatives  may be  available  which could  assist the
obligor in satisfying its debt service requirements.                            

B:  Bonds are  considered  highly  speculative.  While  bonds in this  class are
currently meeting debt service requirements, the probability of continued timely
payment of principal  and  interest  reflects the  obligor's  limited  margin of
safety and the need for reasonable business and economic activity throughout the
life of the issue.                                                              

CCC: Bonds have certain identifiable characteristics which, if not remedied, may
lead to  default.  The  ability to meet  obligations  requires  an  advantageous
business and economic environment.                                              

CC:  Bonds are  minimally  protected.  Default  in payment  of  interest  and/or
principal seems probable over time.                                             

83

P-->497283rd Page of 358TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 283rd
C: Bonds are in imminent default in payment of interest or principal.           

DDD, DD, and D: Bonds are in default of interest and/or principal payments. Such
bonds  are  extremely  speculative  and  should  be valued on the basis of their
ultimate  recovery value in liquidation or  reorganization  of the obligor.  DDD
represents the highest  potential for recovery on these bonds,  and D represents
the lowest potential for recovery.                                              

Plus (+) or Minus (-): The ratings from AA to CC may be appended by the addition
of a plus or  minus  sign to  denote  the  relative  status  within  the  rating
category.                                                                       

NR: Indicates that Fitch Rating does not publicly rate the specific issue.      

FITCH INVESTORS SERVICE, INC. -- SHORT-TERM RATINGS                             

Fitch's  short-term ratings apply to debt obligations that are payable on demand
or have original maturities of generally up to three years, including commercial
paper, certificates of deposit,  medium-term notes, and municipal and investment
notes.                                                                          

F-1+:  Exceptionally  Strong  Credit  Quality.  Issues  assigned this rating are
regarded as having the strongest capacity for timely payment.                   

F-1: Very Strong Credit Quality.  Issues assigned this rating reflect a capacity
for timely payment only slightly less than issues rated F-1+.                   

F-2:  Good Credit  Quality.  Issues  assigned  this  rating have a  satisfactory
capacity  for  timely  payment,  but the margin of safety is not as great as the
F-1+ and F-1 categories.                                                        

F-3:  Fair Credit  Quality.  Issues  assigned  this rating have  characteristics
suggesting that the capacity for timely payment is adequate;  however, near-term
adverse changes could cause these securities to be rated below investment grade.

B:  Speculative.  Minimal capacity for timely payment of financial  commitments,
plus  vulnerability  to  near-term  adverse  changes in  financial  and economic
conditions.                                                                     

C: High  default  risk.  Default is a real  possibility.  Capacity  for  meeting
financial commitments is solely reliant upon a sustained, favorable business and
economic environment.                                                           

D: Default. Denotes actual or imminent payment default.

 INVESTMENT RESTRICTIONS

Except as otherwise indicated, each Fund's investment objective and policies are
not fundamental and may be changed without a vote of shareholders.  There can be
no assurance that a Fund's objective will be met.                               

Each Fund has elected to be classified  as a  diversified  series of an open-end
investment  company.  A  diversified  fund may not, with respect to 75% of total
assets, invest more than 5% of total assets in the securities of a single issuer
or invest in more than 10% of the outstanding  voting  securities of such issuer
(with certain exceptions).                                                      

If a percentage  restriction on investment or utilization of assets as set forth
under "Investment Restrictions" and "Other Investment Policies" is adhered to at
the time an  investment  is made, a later change in  percentage  resulting  from
changes in the value or the total cost of a Fund's assets will not be considered
a violation of the restriction.                                                 

Unless specified to the contrary,  the following fundamental policies may not be
changed without the approval of a majority of the outstanding  voting securities
of a Fund which, under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940
Act"),  and the rules  thereunder  and as used in this  Statement of  Additional
Information,  means  the  lesser  of (1) 67% or more  of the  voting  securities
present at a meeting,  if the holders of more than 50% of the outstanding voting
securities of a Fund are present or represented  by proxy,  or (2) more than 50%
of the outstanding voting securities of a Fund.                                 

As a matter of fundamental policy, each Fund may not:                           

(1)      borrow money,  except as permitted under the Investment  Company Act of
         1940,  as  amended,  and  as  interpreted  or  modified  by  regulatory
authority having jurisdiction, from time to time;             

(2)      issue  senior  securities,  except as  permitted  under the  Investment
         Company Act of 1940,  as  amended,  and as  interpreted  or modified by
regulatory authority having jurisdiction, from time to time;  

(3)      concentrate its investments in a particular  industry,  as that term is
         used  in  the  Investment  Company  Act of  1940,  as  amended,  and as
         interpreted or modified by regulatory  authority  having  jurisdiction,
from time to time;                                            

(4)      engage in the  business of  underwriting  securities  issued by others,
         except to the extent  that the Fund may be deemed to be an  underwriter
in connection with the disposition of portfolio securities;   

(5)      purchase or sell real estate, which term does not include securities of
         companies which deal in real estate or mortgages or investments secured
         by real estate or  interests  therein,  except  that the Fund  reserves
         freedom of action to hold and to sell real estate  acquired as a result
of the Fund's ownership of securities;                        

(6)      purchase or sell  commodities,  except as permitted by the 1940 Act, as
         amended,  and as interpreted  or modified by the  regulatory  authority
having jurisdiction, from time to time;                       

(7)      make loans  except as  permitted  under the  Investment  Company Act of
         1940,  as  amended,  and  as  interpreted  or  modified  by  regulatory
authority having jurisdiction, from time to time;             

Additionally, as a matter of fundamental policy, each Fund will:                

(8)      under normal  circumstances,  have at least 80% of its net assets (plus
         the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes in the case of the
         DWS Managed  Municipal Bond Fund and the DWS Intermediate  Tax/AMT Free
         Fund) invested in securities of municipalities across the United States
         and in other  securities  whose  income  is free from  regular  federal
income tax.

P-->497288th Page of 358TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 288th
With respect to fundamental  policy (8) above,  DWS Managed  Municipal Bond Fund
considers any investments in municipal  securities that pay interest  subject to
the Alternative  Minimum Tax ("AMT") as part of the 80% of the Fund's net assets
that must be invested in municipal securities.                                  

Other Investment Policies                                                       

The Board of Trustees has voluntarily adopted certain  non-fundamental  policies
and restrictions which are observed in the conduct of each Fund's affairs. These
represent  intentions  of the Trustees  based upon current  circumstances.  They
differ  from  fundamental  investment  policies  in that they may be  changed or
amended by action of the Trustees without  requiring prior notice to or approval
of the shareholders.                                                            

As a matter of non-fundamental policy, each Fund may not:                       

(1)      borrow money in an amount  greater than 5% of its total assets,  except
for temporary or emergency purposes;                          

(2)      purchase  securities  on margin or make short  sales,  except (i) short
         sales against the box, (ii) in connection with arbitrage  transactions,
         (iii) for margin deposits in connection with futures contracts, options
         or other  permitted  investments,  (iv) that  transactions  in  futures
         contracts  and  options  shall  not be  deemed  to  constitute  selling
         securities  short,  and (v)  that a Fund  may  obtain  such  short-term
         credits  as  may  be  necessary   for  the   clearance  of   securities
transactions;                                                 

(3)      purchase  options,  unless  the  aggregate  premiums  paid on all  such
         options  held by a Fund  at any  time do not  exceed  20% of its  total
         assets; or sell put options, if as a result, the aggregate value of the
         obligations  underlying  such put options would exceed 50% of its total
assets;                                                       

(4)      enter  into  futures  contracts  or  purchase  options  thereon  unless
         immediately  after the  purchase,  the value of the  aggregate  initial
         margin with respect to such futures contracts entered into on behalf of
         a Fund and the premiums paid for such options on futures contracts does
         not  exceed  5% of the fair  market  value of a  Fund's  total  assets;
         provided that in the case of an option that is in-the-money at the time
         of purchase,  the in-the-money  amount may be excluded in computing the
5% limit;                                                     

(5)      purchase warrants if as a result,  such securities,  taken at the lower
         of cost or market value, would represent more than 5% of the value of a
         Fund's total assets (for this  purpose,  warrants  acquired in units or
attached to securities will be deemed to have no value); and  

(6)      lend  portfolio  securities  in an amount  greater than 5% of its total
assets.                                                       

The  foregoing  non-fundamental  policies are in addition to policies  otherwise
stated in the Prospectus or this Statement of Additional Information.           

The DWS High Yield Tax Free Fund will invest at least 50% of its total assets in
municipal bonds rated, at the time of purchase,  within the four highest quality
rating categories of Moody's Investors Service,  Inc. ("Moody's") (Aaa, Aa, A or
Baa),  Standard & Poor's Ratings  Services  ("S&P") or Fitch Investors  Service,
Inc.  ("Fitch")  (AAA, AA, A or BBB), or their  equivalents as determined at the
time of purchase by Deutsche Investment  Management Americas Inc. ("DIMA" or the
"Advisor"). The Fund may invest, however, up to 50% of its total assets in bonds
rated below Baa by Moody's or below BBB by S&P or Fitch,  or unrated  securities
considered to be of equivalent  quality.  The Fund may not invest in bonds rated
below B by Moody's,  S&P or Fitch, or their  equivalent.  If a security's credit
quality is  downgraded,  the Advisor  will decide what to do with the  security,
based on its assessment of what would benefit shareholders most.                

Normally,  the DWS Managed  Municipal  Bond Fund invests at least 65% of its net
assets  in  securities  rated,  or  issued  by an  issuer  rated  at the time of
purchase, within the three highest quality rating categories of Moody's (Aaa, Aa
or A), S&P or Fitch (AAA, AA or A) or their equivalents,  or if unrated,  judged
by the Advisor to be of comparable quality at the time of purchase. The Fund may
invest  up to 10% of its  assets  in debt  securities  rated                    

2 

P-->497289th Page of 358TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 289th
lower  than Baa by  Moody's,  BBB by S&P or Fitch or of  equivalent  quality  as
determined by the Advisor, but will not purchase bonds rated below B by Moody's,
S&P or Fitch, or their equivalent.                                              

Normally, the DWS Intermediate Tax/AMT Free Fund invests at least 65% of its net
assets in municipal  bonds which are rated,  at the time of purchase  within the
three highest quality rating  categories of Moody's (Aaa, Aa or A), S&P or Fitch
(AAA, AA or A) or their equivalents,  or if unrated, judged by the Advisor to be
of comparable  quality at the time of purchase.  The Fund will not invest in any
debt  security  rated  lower  than  Baa by  Moody's,  BBB by S&P or  Fitch or of
equivalent quality as determined by the Advisor.                                

For temporary  defensive  purposes or if an unusual  disparity between after-tax
income on taxable and municipal securities makes it advisable, up to 100% of the
DWS High Yield Tax Free Fund's  assets (20% of assets in the case of DWS Managed
Municipal Bond Fund and DWS Intermediate  Tax/AMT Free Fund) may be held in cash
or  invested  in  short-term  taxable   investments,   including  US  Government
obligations and money market instruments.                                       

Although there is no current  intention to do so, each Fund may invest more than
25% of its total assets in  industrial  development  or other  private  activity
bonds, subject to a Fund's fundamental investment policies.  Because these bonds
are  frequently  subject to regular  federal  income tax and AMT,  investment in
these types of bonds is also  subject to a Fund's  limitation  on  investing  in
municipal securities whose investment income is subject to these taxes.         

INVESTMENT POLICIES AND TECHNIQUES

General Investment Objectives and Policies                                      

Descriptions  in  this  Statement  of  Additional  Information  of a  particular
investment  practice  or  technique  in which a Fund  may  engage  are  meant to
describe the spectrum of investments  that the Advisor in its discretion  might,
but is not  required  to, use in managing  each  Fund's  portfolio  assets.  The
Advisor,  may in its discretion at any time employ such  practice,  technique or
instrument  for  one or  more  Funds  but  not  for  all  funds  advised  by it.
Furthermore,  it is possible  that  certain  types of financial  instruments  or
investment  techniques  described  herein  may  not be  available,  permissible,
economically  feasible or effective for their intended  purposes in all markets.
Certain practices,  techniques or instruments may not be principal activities of
the Funds, but, to the extent employed,  could from time to time have a material
impact on a Fund's performance.                                                 

It is possible that certain investment  practices and techniques described below
may not be  permissible  for a Fund  based on its  investment  restrictions,  as
described herein, and in the Funds' applicable prospectus.                      

Advance  Refunded Bonds.  Each Fund may purchase  Municipal  Securities that are
subsequently refunded by the issuance and delivery of a new issue of bonds prior
to the date on which the outstanding issue of bonds can be redeemed or paid. The
proceeds  from the new issue of bonds  are  typically  placed in an escrow  fund
consisting  of US  Government  obligations  that are  used to pay the  interest,
principal  and call  premium  on the issue  being  refunded.  Each Fund may also
purchase  Municipal  Securities  that have been refunded  prior to purchase by a
Fund.                                                                           

High Yield/High Risk Bonds. The DWS High Yield Tax Free Fund and the DWS Managed
Municipal  Bond Fund may also  purchase  debt  securities  which are rated below
investment-grade  (commonly  referred to as "junk bonds"),  that is, rated below
Baa by  Moody's  or below BBB by S&P,  and  unrated  securities  judged to be of
equivalent quality as determined by the Advisor. These securities usually entail
greater risk  (including the possibility of default or bankruptcy of the issuers
of such securities),  generally involve greater  volatility of price and risk to
principal  and income,  and may be less liquid,  than  securities  in the higher
rating categories. The lower the ratings of such debt securities, the more their
risks render them like equity  securities.  Securities rated D may be in default
with respect to payment of principal or interest.  See "Ratings of  Investments"
for a more complete description of the ratings assigned by ratings organizations
and their respective characteristics.                                           

Issuers of such high yield  securities  often are highly  leveraged  and may not
have available to them more  traditional  methods of financing.  Therefore,  the
risk  associated  with  acquiring the  securities  of such issuers  generally is
greater than is the case with higher rated  securities.  For example,  during an
economic  downturn  or a  sustained  period of                                  

3 

P-->497290th Page of 358TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 290th
rising interest rates,  highly  leveraged  issuers of high yield  securities may
experience  financial  stress.  During such  periods,  such issuers may not have
sufficient  revenues to meet their interest  payment  obligations.  The issuer's
ability  to service  its debt  obligations  may also be  adversely  affected  by
specific  corporate  developments,  or the issuer's  inability to meet  specific
projected business forecasts, or the unavailability of additional financing. The
risk of loss from default by the issuer is significantly greater for the holders
of high yield securities because such securities are generally unsecured and are
often  subordinated to other creditors of the issuer.  Prices and yields of high
yield  securities  will  fluctuate  over time and,  during  periods of  economic
uncertainty,  volatility of high yield  securities may adversely affect a Fund's
net  asset  value.  In  addition,  investments  in high  yield  zero  coupon  or
pay-in-kind bonds, rather than income-bearing high yield securities, may be more
speculative  and may be subject to greater  fluctuations in value due to changes
in interest rates.                                                              

A Fund may have difficulty  disposing of certain  high-yield  securities because
they may have a thin trading market. Because not all dealers maintain markets in
all high yield securities, a Fund anticipates that such securities could be sold
only to a limited number of dealers or  institutional  investors.  The lack of a
liquid  secondary  market may have an adverse  effect on the market  price and a
Fund's  ability  to  dispose  of  particular  issues  and may also  make it more
difficult  for a Fund to obtain  accurate  market  quotations  for  purposes  of
valuing a Fund's assets.  Market quotations generally are available on many high
yield  issues  only from a limited  number of  dealers  and may not  necessarily
represent  firm  bids of such  dealers  or  prices  for  actual  sales.  Adverse
publicity and investor perceptions may decrease the values and liquidity of high
yield  securities.  These  securities  may  also  involve  special  registration
responsibilities,   liabilities   and  costs,   and   liquidity   and  valuation
difficulties.                                                                   

Credit  quality in the  high-yield  securities  market can change  suddenly  and
unexpectedly,  and even recently-issued credit ratings may not fully reflect the
actual risks posed by a particular high yield security. For these reasons, it is
generally the policy of the Advisor not to rely exclusively on ratings issued by
established credit rating agencies,  but to supplement such ratings with its own
independent and on-going  review of credit quality.  The achievement of a Fund's
investment  objective by investment in such  securities may be more dependent on
the Advisor's credit analysis than is the case for higher quality bonds.  Should
the rating of a portfolio  security be  downgraded,  the Advisor will  determine
whether  it is in the best  interests  of a Fund to  retain or  dispose  of such
security.                                                                       

Prices for high-yield  securities may be affected by legislative  and regulatory
developments.  Also, Congress has from time to time considered legislation which
would restrict or eliminate the corporate tax deduction for interest payments in
these  securities and regulate  corporate  restructurings.  Such legislation may
significantly depress the prices of outstanding securities of this type.        

A portion of the high-yield  securities acquired by a Fund may be purchased upon
issuance, which may involve special risks because the securities so acquired are
new issues. In such instances a Fund may be a substantial purchaser of the issue
and therefore have the  opportunity  to participate in structuring  the terms of
the offering.  Although this may enable a Fund to seek to protect itself against
certain of such risks, the  considerations  discussed herein would  nevertheless
remain applicable.                                                              

Illiquid  Securities and Restricted  Securities.  A Fund may purchase securities
that are subject to legal or  contractual  restrictions  on resale  ("restricted
securities").  Generally  speaking,  restricted  securities  may be sold  (i) to
qualified  institutional buyers; (ii) in a privately negotiated transaction to a
limited number of purchasers;  (iii) in limited  quantities after they have been
held for a specified  period of time and other conditions are met pursuant to an
exemption  from  registration;  or  (iv)  in  a  public  offering  for  which  a
registration statement is in effect under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the "1933 Act").  Issuers of  restricted  securities  may not be subject to the
disclosure and other investor  protection  requirements that would be applicable
if their securities were publicly traded.                                       

Restricted  securities  are often  illiquid,  but they may also be  liquid.  For
example,  restricted securities that are eligible for resale under Rule 144A are
often deemed to be liquid.                                                      

Each Fund's Board has approved  guidelines for use by the Advisor in determining
whether a security  is liquid or  illiquid.  Among the  factors  the Advisor may
consider in reaching  liquidity  decisions relating to Rule 144A securities are:
(1) the  frequency  of trades  and quotes  for the  security;  (2) the number of
dealers  wishing  to  purchase  or sell the                                     

4

security and the number of other potential  purchasers;  (3) dealer undertakings
to make a market in the  security;  and (4) the nature of the  security  and the
nature of the market for the security  (i.e.,  the time needed to dispose of the
security,  the method of soliciting  offers, and the mechanics of the transfer).
Issuers of restricted  securities may not be subject to the disclosure and other
investor  protection  requirements  that would be applicable if their securities
were publicly traded. Where a registration  statement is required for the resale
of  restricted  securities,  a fund may be  required  to bear all or part of the
registration  expenses. A fund may be deemed to be an "underwriter" for purposes
of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended when selling restricted  securities to
the  public  and,  in such  event,  a fund may be liable to  purchasers  of such
securities if the  registration  statement  prepared by the issuer is materially
inaccurate or misleading.                                                       

A Fund may also purchase securities that are not subject to legal or contractual
restrictions  on resale,  but that are deemed  illiquid.  Such securities may be
illiquid, for example, because there is a limited trading market for them.      

A Fund may be unable to sell a restricted or illiquid security.  In addition, it
may be more  difficult to determine a market  value for  restricted  or illiquid
securities.  Moreover,  if adverse market  conditions were to develop during the
period between a Fund's  decision to sell a restricted or illiquid  security and
the point at which a Fund is  permitted  or able to sell such  security,  a Fund
might  obtain a price  less  favorable  than the price  that  prevailed  when it
decided to sell.                                                                

Impact of Large  Redemptions  and  Purchases of Fund Shares.  From time to time,
shareholders  of a Fund  (which may  include  affiliated  and/or  non-affiliated
registered investment companies that invest in a Fund) may make relatively large
redemptions or purchases of Fund shares.  These transactions may cause a Fund to
have to sell securities or invest  additional cash, as the case may be. While it
is impossible  to predict the overall  impact of these  transactions  over time,
there could be adverse effects on a Fund's performance to the extent that a Fund
may be  required  to sell  securities  or invest cash at times when it would not
otherwise do so. These  transactions  could also  accelerate the  realization of
taxable income if sales of securities  resulted in gains and could also increase
transaction costs, which may impact a Fund's expense ratio.                     

Industrial  Development and Pollution Control Bonds.  Industrial Development and
Pollution  Control Bonds (which are types of private activity  bonds),  although
nominally  issued by municipal  authorities,  are  generally  not secured by the
taxing  power  of the  municipality  but  are  secured  by the  revenues  of the
authority  derived  from  payments by the  industrial  user.  Under  federal tax
legislation, certain types of Industrial Development Bonds and Pollution Control
Bonds may no longer be issued on a tax-exempt basis, although  previously-issued
bonds of these types and certain refundings of such bonds are not affected.  For
the purposes of the Funds'  investment  limitation  regarding  concentration  of
investments  in any  one  industry,  industrial  development  or  other  private
activity bonds ultimately  payable by companies within the same industry will be
considered as if they were issued by issuers in the same industry.              

Interfund  Borrowing  and Lending  Program.  The Funds have  received  exemptive
relief from the Securities and Exchange  Commission  ("SEC"),  which permits the
Funds to participate in an interfund  lending  program among certain  investment
companies  advised by the Advisor.  The  interfund  lending  program  allows the
participating  funds to  borrow  money  from and loan  money to each  other  for
temporary  or  emergency  purposes.  The  program  is  subject  to a  number  of
conditions  designed to ensure fair and equitable treatment of all participating
funds, including the following: (1) no fund may borrow money through the program
unless it receives a more favorable  interest rate than a rate approximating the
lowest  interest  rate at which  bank  loans  would be  available  to any of the
participating  funds  under a loan  agreement;  and (2) no fund may  lend  money
through  the  program  unless it  receives  a more  favorable  return  than that
available  from an  investment  in  repurchase  agreements  and,  to the  extent
applicable,  money  market  cash  swap  arrangements.  In  addition,  a fund may
participate in the program only if and to the extent that such  participation is
consistent with a fund's investment objectives and policies (for instance, money
market  funds would  normally  participate  only as lenders and tax exempt funds
only as borrowers).  Interfund  loans and borrowings may extend  overnight,  but
could have a maximum  duration of seven  days.  Loans may be called on one day's
notice.  A fund may have to borrow from a bank at a higher  interest  rate if an
interfund  loan is called or not  renewed.  Any delay in  repayment to a lending
fund could result in a lost  investment  opportunity  or additional  costs.  The
program is subject to the  oversight  and  periodic  review of the Boards of the
participating  funds. To the extent the Funds are actually  engaged in borrowing
through the interfund lending program, the Funds, as a matter of non-fundamental

5

policy,  may not borrow for other than temporary or emergency  purposes (and not
for  leveraging),  except  that the  Funds  may  engage  in  reverse  repurchase
agreements and dollar rolls for any purpose.                                    

Investment-Grade Bonds. A Fund may purchase  "investment-grade" bonds, which are
those  rated Aaa,  Aa, A or Baa by  Moody's  or AAA,  AA, A or BBB by S&P or, if
unrated,  judged to be of  equivalent  quality  as  determined  by the  Advisor.
Moody's  considers  bonds it rates Baa to have  speculative  elements as well as
investment-grade  characteristics.   To  the  extent  that  a  Fund  invests  in
higher-grade   securities,   a  Fund  will  not  be  able  to  avail  itself  of
opportunities for higher income which may be available at lower grades.         

Inverse Floaters.  A Fund may invest in inverse  floaters.  Inverse floaters are
debt instruments typically with a weekly floating rate of interest that bears an
inverse relationship to changes in short-term market interest rates. Investments
in this type of instrument  involve special risks as compared to investments in,
for example,  a fixed rate municipal  security.  The debt  instrument in which a
Fund  invests  may be a tender  option  bond  trust (the  "trust")  which can be
established  by a Fund,  a  financial  institution  or a broker,  consisting  of
underlying municipal  obligations.  Other investors in the trust usually consist
of money market fund investors  normally receiving weekly floating interest rate
payments who have put options with the financial institutions.  A Fund may enter
into  shortfall and  forbearance  agreements by which a Fund agrees to reimburse
the trust, in certain circumstances,  for the difference between the liquidation
value of the fixed rate municipal security held by the trust and the liquidation
value of the  floating  rate  notes.  A Fund  could lose money and its NAV could
decline as a result of investments in inverse  floaters if movements in interest
rates are incorrectly  anticipated.  Moreover,  the markets for inverse floaters
may be less  developed  and may have less  liquidity  than the  markets for more
traditional municipal securities.  A Fund's investments in inverse floaters will
not be considered  borrowing  within the meaning of the 1940 Act or for purposes
of a Fund's investment restrictions on borrowing.                               

Investment of Uninvested Cash Balances.  A Fund may have cash balances that have
not been invested in portfolio securities  ("Uninvested Cash").  Uninvested Cash
may result from a variety of sources,  including  dividends or interest received
from portfolio securities, unsettled securities transactions,  reserves held for
investment strategy purposes, scheduled maturity of investments,  liquidation of
investment securities to meet anticipated redemptions and dividend payments, and
new cash received from investors.  Uninvested  Cash may be invested  directly in
money market  instruments or other short-term debt  obligations.  Pursuant to an
Exemptive  Order issued by the SEC, a Fund may use  Uninvested  Cash to purchase
shares of affiliated  funds including money market funds,  short-term bond funds
and Cash  Management  QP Trust,  or one or more  future  entities  for which the
Advisor acts as trustee or  investment  advisor that operate as cash  management
investment  vehicles and that are excluded  from the  definition  of  investment
company  pursuant to section  3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act  (collectively,
the "Central  Funds") in excess of the  limitations  of Section  12(d)(1) of the
1940  Act.  Investment  by the Fund in shares of the  Central  Funds  will be in
accordance with a Fund's  investment  policies and  restrictions as set forth in
its registration statement.                                                     

Certain of the Central Funds comply with Rule 2a-7 under the 1940 Act. The other
Central Funds are or will be short-term  bond funds that invest in  fixed-income
securities  and maintain a dollar  weighted  average  maturity of three years or
less.  Each of the  Central  Funds will be managed  specifically  to  maintain a
highly liquid  portfolio,  and access to them will enhance the Funds' ability to
manage Uninvested Cash.                                                         

A Fund will invest  Uninvested  Cash in Central  Funds only to the extent that a
Fund's  aggregate  investment  in the  Central  Funds does not exceed 25% of its
total  assets.  Purchase  and sales of shares of  Central  Funds are made at net
asset value.                                                                    

Letters  of   Credit.   Municipal   obligations,   including   certificates   of
participation,  commercial paper and other short-term obligations, may be backed
by an  irrevocable  letter of credit of a bank which assumes the  obligation for
payment of principal  and  interest in the event of default by the issuer.  Only
banks which, in the opinion of the Advisor, are of investment quality comparable
to other permitted investments of a Fund may be used for letter of credit-backed
investments.                                                                    

Municipal  Securities.  Municipal  obligations  are  issued  by or on  behalf of
states,  territories  and  possessions of the United States and their  political
subdivisions,  agencies  and  instrumentalities  and the District of Columbia to
obtain funds for various public purposes.  The interest on these  obligations is
generally exempt from regular federal income

tax in the  hands  of most  investors.  The  two  principal  classifications  of
municipal obligations are "notes" and "bonds."                                  

Municipal  notes are generally used to provide for short-term  capital needs and
generally have  maturities of one year or less.  Municipal  notes  include:  Tax
Anticipation  Notes,  Revenue  Anticipation  Notes, Bond Anticipation Notes, and
Construction  Loan Notes.  Tax  Anticipation  Notes are sold to finance  working
capital needs of  municipalities.  They are generally  payable from specific tax
revenues expected to be received at a future date.  Revenue  Anticipation  Notes
are issued in expectation of receipt of other types of revenue. Tax Anticipation
Notes and  Revenue  Anticipation  Notes are  issued in  anticipation  of various
seasonal  revenue  such  as  income,   sales,  use  and  business  taxes.   Bond
Anticipation Notes are sold to provide interim financing,  and Construction Loan
Notes are sold to  provide  construction  financing.  These  notes are issued in
anticipation of long-term  financing in the market. In most cases,  these monies
provide for the  repayment of the notes.  After the  projects  are  successfully
completed and accepted,  many projects receive  permanent  financing through the
Federal Housing Administration under "Fannie Mae" (the Federal National Mortgage
Association) or "Ginnie Mae" (the  Government  National  Mortgage  Association).
There are,  of course,  a number of other  types of notes  issued for  different
purposes and secured differently than those described above.                    

Municipal  bonds,  which  meet  longer-term  capital  needs and  generally  have
maturities   of  more   than  one  year   when   issued,   have  two   principal
classifications:  "general  obligation"  bonds and "revenue"  bonds.  Issuers of
general obligation bonds include states,  counties,  cities,  towns and regional
districts.  The proceeds of these  obligations  are used to fund a wide range of
public projects  including the construction or improvement of schools,  highways
and roads,  water and sewer systems and a variety of other public purposes.  The
basic security  behind general  obligation  bonds is the issuer's  pledge of its
full faith,  credit, and taxing power for the payment of principal and interest.
The taxes that can be levied for the  payment of debt  service may be limited or
unlimited as to rate, amount or special assessments.                            

The principal  security for a revenue bond is generally the net revenues derived
from a particular  facility or group of facilities  or, in some cases,  from the
proceeds of a special excise or other  specific  revenue  source.  Revenue bonds
have been issued to fund a wide variety of capital projects including: electric,
gas, water and sewer systems;  highways,  bridges and tunnels;  port and airport
facilities;  colleges and  universities;  and hospitals.  Although the principal
security behind these bonds varies widely,  many provide additional  security in
the form of a debt  service  reserve  fund whose monies may also be used to make
principal and interest  payments on the issuer's  obligations.  Housing  finance
authorities have a wide range of security including  partially or fully insured,
rent-subsidized  and/or collateralized  mortgages,  and/or the net revenues from
housing or other public  projects.  In addition to a debt service  reserve fund,
some  authorities  provide  further  security  in the form of a state's  ability
(without  obligation) to make up  deficiencies  in the debt reserve fund.  Lease
rental  bonds  issued by a state or local  authority  for capital  projects  are
secured  by annual  lease  rental  payments  from the state or  locality  to the
authority sufficient to cover debt service on the authority's obligations.      

Some issues of municipal bonds are payable from United States Treasury bonds and
notes or agency obligations held in escrow by a trustee, frequently a commercial
bank.  The  interest  and  principal  on  these  US  Government  securities  are
sufficient  to pay all  interest and  principal  requirements  of the  municipal
securities  when  due.  Some  escrowed  Treasury  securities  are used to retire
municipal  bonds at their  earliest  call date,  while others are used to retire
municipal bonds at their maturity.                                              

Securities purchased for a Fund may include  variable/floating rate instruments,
variable  mode  instruments,  put  bonds,  and other  obligations  which  have a
specified maturity date but also are payable before maturity after notice by the
holder ("demand  obligations").  Demand  obligations are considered for a Fund's
purposes to mature at the demand date.                                          

There are,  in  addition,  a variety of hybrid and  special  types of  municipal
obligations  as  well as  numerous  differences  in the  security  of  municipal
obligations  both within and between the two  principal  classifications  (i.e.,
notes and bonds) discussed above.

An entire  issue of  municipal  securities  may be  purchased  by one or a small
number of institutional investors such as a Fund. Thus, such an issue may not be
said to be publicly offered. Unlike the equity securities of operating companies
or mutual funds which must be  registered  under the 1933 Act prior to offer and
sale  unless  an  exemption  from  such  registration  is  available,  municipal
securities,  whether publicly or privately offered,  may nevertheless be readily
marketable.  A secondary market exists for municipal  securities which have been
publicly  offered as well as  securities  which have not been  publicly  offered
initially but which may nevertheless be readily marketable. Municipal securities
purchased  for a Fund are subject to the  limitations  on holdings of securities
which are not readily marketable based on whether it may be sold in a reasonable
time consistent with the customs of the municipal  markets  (usually seven days)
at a price (or interest rate) which  accurately  reflects its recorded  value. A
Fund believes that the quality standards applicable to their investments enhance
marketability.  In addition,  stand-by commitments,  participation interests and
demand obligations also enhance marketability.                                  

Provisions  of the federal  bankruptcy  statutes  relating to the  adjustment of
debts of political  subdivisions  and authorities of states of the United States
provide that, in certain circumstances,  such subdivisions or authorities may be
authorized to initiate bankruptcy proceedings without prior notice to or consent
of  creditors,   which   proceedings   could  result  in  material  and  adverse
modification  or  alteration of the rights of holders of  obligations  issued by
such subdivisions or authorities.                                               

Litigation challenging the validity under state constitutions of present systems
of financing  public  education has been initiated or adjudicated in a number of
states,  and  legislation has been introduced to effect changes in public school
finances  in  some  states.   In  other  instances  there  has  been  litigation
challenging  the issuance of pollution  control revenue bonds or the validity of
their  issuance  under state or federal law which  litigation  could  ultimately
affect the validity of those Municipal  Securities or the tax-free nature of the
interest thereon.                                                               

In  some  cases,  municipalities  may  issue  bonds  relying  on  proceeds  from
litigation  settlements.  These  bonds may be further  secured  by debt  service
reserve  funds  established  at the time the bonds were  issued.  Bonds that are
supported in whole or in part by expected litigation proceeds are subject to the
risk that part or all of the expected proceeds may not be received. For example,
a damage  award  could be  overturned  or reduced by a court,  or the terms of a
settlement  or damages award may allow for reduced or  discontinued  payments if
certain  conditions  are met.  As a result,  bonds  that rely on  proceeds  from
litigation proceeds are subject to an increased risk of nonpayment or default   

For the purpose of the Funds' investment restrictions, the identification of the
"issuer" of municipal obligations which are not general obligation bonds is made
by the  Advisor  on  the  basis  of the  characteristics  of the  obligation  as
described  above,  the most  significant of which is the source of funds for the
payment of principal and interest on such obligations.                          

Municipal Lease Obligations and Participation Interests. Participation interests
represent  undivided  interests  in  municipal  leases,   installment   purchase
contracts, conditional sales contracts or other instruments. These are typically
issued  by a trust or other  entity  which has  received  an  assignment  of the
payments to be made by the state or political  subdivision  under such leases or
contracts. They may be variable rate or fixed rate.                             

Each Fund may  purchase  from banks  participation  interests  in all or part of
specific holdings of municipal obligations,  provided the participation interest
is fully  insured.  Each  participation  is backed by an  irrevocable  letter of
credit or guarantee of the selling  bank that the Advisor has  determined  meets
the prescribed quality standards of each Fund.  Therefore,  either the credit of
the issuer of the municipal  obligation or the selling bank, or both,  will meet
the quality  standards of the particular  Fund. A Fund has the right to sell the
participation  back to the bank after seven days' notice for the full  principal
amount of a Fund's interest in the municipal  obligation plus accrued  interest,
but only (i) as required to provide liquidity to a Fund, (ii) to maintain a high
quality  investment  portfolio  or (iii)  upon a default  under the terms of the
municipal  obligation.  The  selling  bank  will  receive  a fee  from a Fund in
connection  with  the  arrangement.  A  Fund  will  not  purchase  participation
interests unless in the opinion of bond counsel, counsel for the issuers of such
participations  or counsel  selected  by the  Advisor,  the  interest  from such
participations  is exempt from regular  federal  income tax and state income tax
for a Fund.                                                                     

A municipal lease obligation may take the form of a lease,  installment purchase
contract  or  conditional  sales  contract  which is  issued by a state or local
government and  authorities to acquire land,  equipment and  facilities.        

8 

P-->497295th Page of 358TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 295th
Income from such  obligations is generally  exempt from state and local taxes in
the state of issuance.  Municipal lease obligations  frequently  involve special
risks not normally  associated with general obligations or revenue bonds. Leases
and installment  purchase or conditional  sale contracts (which normally provide
for title in the leased asset to pass  eventually  to the  governmental  issuer)
have  evolved  as a means for  governmental  issuers  to  acquire  property  and
equipment without meeting the constitutional and statutory  requirements for the
issuance of debt. The debt issuance  limitations  are deemed to be  inapplicable
because of the  inclusion  in many leases or  contracts  of  "non-appropriation"
clauses that relieve the  governmental  issuer of any  obligation to make future
payments  under the lease or  contract  unless  money is  appropriated  for such
purpose by the appropriate legislative body on a yearly or other periodic basis.
In addition,  such leases or contracts may be subject to the temporary abatement
of payments in the event the issuer is prevented from  maintaining  occupancy of
the leased premises or utilizing the leased equipment.  Although the obligations
may be secured by the leased  equipment or  facilities,  the  disposition of the
property in the event of  nonappropriation or foreclosure might prove difficult,
time  consuming and costly,  and result in a delay in recovery or the failure to
fully recover a Fund's original investment.                                     

Certain municipal lease  obligations and  participation  interests may be deemed
illiquid  for the  purpose of a Fund's  limitation  on  investments  in illiquid
securities.  Other  municipal  lease  obligations  and  participation  interests
acquired by a Fund may be determined by the Advisor to be liquid  securities for
the purpose of such limitation.  In determining the liquidity of municipal lease
obligations and participation  interests, the Advisor will consider a variety of
factors including:  (1) the willingness of dealers to bid for the security;  (2)
the number of dealers  willing to purchase or sell the obligation and the number
of other  potential  buyers;  (3) the  frequency  of trades  or  quotes  for the
obligation;  and (4) the nature of the  marketplace  trades.  In  addition,  the
Advisor  will  consider  factors  unique to  particular  lease  obligations  and
participation  interests affecting the marketability  thereof. These include the
general  creditworthiness  of the issuer,  the  importance  to the issuer of the
property  covered by the lease and the likelihood that the  marketability of the
obligation  will be maintained  throughout  the time the obligation is held by a
Fund.                                                                           

A Fund may purchase participation  interests in municipal lease obligations held
by a commercial bank or other financial institution. Such participations provide
a Fund  with the  right  to a pro  rata  undivided  interest  in the  underlying
municipal lease obligations.  In addition, such participations generally provide
a Fund with the right to demand payment, on not more than seven days' notice, of
all  or any  part  of  such  fund's  participation  interest  in the  underlying
municipal lease obligation, plus accrued interest.                              

Participation  Interests.  A  Fund  may  purchase  from  financial  institutions
participation   interests  in  securities   in  which  a  fund  may  invest.   A
participation interest gives a Fund an undivided interest in the security in the
proportion that the Fund's participation  interest bears to the principal amount
of the security. These instruments may have fixed, floating or variable interest
rates.  If the  participation  interest is  unrated,  or has been given a rating
below  that which is  permissible  for  purchase  by a Fund,  the  participation
interest  will be backed by an  irrevocable  letter of credit or  guarantee of a
bank,  or  the  payment  obligation  will  be  collateralized  by US  Government
securities, or, in the case of unrated participation interest, determined by the
Advisor to be of  comparable  quality to those  instruments  in which a Fund may
invest.  For  certain  participation  interests,  a Fund  will have the right to
demand  payment,  on not more than seven days' notice,  for all or any part of a
Fund's  participation  interests in the security,  plus accrued interest.  As to
these  instruments,  a Fund  generally  intends to exercise  its right to demand
payment only upon a default under the terms of the security.                    

Repurchase Agreements.  A Fund may invest in repurchase  agreements,  subject to
its investment guidelines.  In a repurchase agreement, a Fund acquires ownership
of a security and simultaneously  commits to resell that security to the seller,
typically a bank or broker/dealer.                                              

A repurchase  agreement  provides a means for a Fund to earn income on funds for
periods as short as overnight.  It is an  arrangement  under which the purchaser
(i.e., a Fund) acquires a security  ("Obligation") and the seller agrees, at the
time of sale,  to  repurchase  the  Obligation  at a  specified  time and price.
Securities  subject to a repurchase  agreement are held in a segregated  account
and,  as  described  in more detail  below,  the value of the account is kept at
least equal to the repurchase  price on a daily basis.  The repurchase price may
be higher than the purchase price, the difference being income to a Fund, or the
purchase and repurchase  prices may be the same,  with interest at a stated rate
due to a Fund  together with the  repurchase  price upon  repurchase.  In either
case,  income to a Fund is  unrelated

to the interest rate on the Obligation  itself.  Obligations will be held by the
custodian or in the Federal Reserve Book Entry System.                          

It is not clear  whether a court would  consider the  Obligation  purchased by a
Fund  subject to a  repurchase  agreement  as being  owned by a Fund or as being
collateral for a loan by a Fund to the seller.  In the event of the commencement
of  bankruptcy  or  insolvency  proceedings  with  respect  to the seller of the
Obligation before repurchase of the Obligation under a repurchase  agreement,  a
Fund may encounter delay and incur costs before being able to sell the security.
Delays may involve  loss of interest or decline in price of the  Obligation.  If
the court characterizes the transaction as a loan and a Fund has not perfected a
security  interest  in the  Obligation,  a Fund may be  required  to return  the
Obligation to the seller's estate and be treated as an unsecured creditor of the
seller. As an unsecured creditor,  a Fund would be at risk of losing some or all
of the principal and income involved in the  transaction.  As with any unsecured
debt  obligation  purchased for a Fund,  the Advisor seeks to reduce the risk of
loss through  repurchase  agreements  by analyzing the  creditworthiness  of the
obligor,  in this case the  seller  of the  Obligation.  Apart  from the risk of
bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings, there is also the risk that the seller may
fail to repurchase  the  Obligation,  in which case the Fund may incur a loss if
the proceeds to a Fund of the sale to a third party are less than the repurchase
price.  However,  if the market value  (including  interest)  of the  Obligation
subject to the  repurchase  agreement  becomes  less than the  repurchase  price
(including interest), a Fund will direct the seller of the Obligation to deliver
additional  securities  so that the market  value  (including  interest)  of all
securities  subject  to the  repurchase  agreement  will  equal  or  exceed  the
repurchase price.                                                               

Reverse  Repurchase  Agreements.  A Fund  may  enter  into  "reverse  repurchase
agreements," which are repurchase agreements in which the Fund, as the seller of
the  securities,  agrees to  repurchase  such  securities  at an agreed time and
price.  The Fund maintains a segregated  account in connection with  outstanding
reverse  repurchase  agreements.  The Fund will  enter into  reverse  repurchase
agreements only when the Advisor  believes that the interest income to be earned
from the investment of the proceeds of the transaction  will be greater than the
interest expense of the transaction. Such transactions may increase fluctuations
in the market  value of Fund assets and its yield and may be viewed as a form of
leverage.                                                                       

Securities  Backed by  Guarantees.  The Fund may invest in securities  backed by
guarantees from banks, insurance companies and other financial  institutions.  A
money  market  fund's  ability to maintain a stable  share price may depend upon
such  guarantees,   which  are  not  supported  by  federal  deposit  insurance.
Consequently,  changes in the credit quality of these institutions could have an
adverse impact on securities they have  guaranteed or backed,  which could cause
losses to a Fund and affect its share price.                                    

Stand-by Commitments.  A stand-by commitment is a right acquired by a Fund, when
it purchases a municipal  obligation  from a broker,  dealer or other  financial
institution  ("seller"),  to  sell  up to the  same  principal  amount  of  such
securities  back to the  seller,  at a  Fund's  option,  at a  specified  price.
Stand-by  commitments  are also known as "puts." The investment  policies of the
DWS High Yield Tax Free Fund and the DWS Managed  Municipal Bond Fund permit the
acquisition of stand-by  commitments solely to facilitate  portfolio  liquidity.
The  exercise by a Fund of a stand-by  commitment  is subject to the ability and
willingness of the other party to fulfill its contractual commitment.           

Stand-by  commitments  acquired by a Fund will have the following features:  (1)
they will be in writing and will be physically held by the Fund's custodian; (2)
the Fund's right to exercise them will be  unconditional  and  unqualified;  (3)
they will be  entered  into only with  sellers  which in the  Advisor's  opinion
present a minimal risk of default; (4) although stand-by commitments will not be
transferable, municipal obligations purchased subject to such commitments may be
sold to a third party at any time,  even though the  commitment is  outstanding;
and (5) their exercise price will be (i) a Fund's  acquisition  cost  (excluding
any accrued interest which a Fund paid on their acquisition), less any amortized
market premium or plus any amortized  original issue discount  during the period
the Fund owned the securities,  plus (ii) all interest accrued on the securities
since the last interest payment date.                                           

The Funds expect that stand-by  commitments  generally will be available without
the payment of any direct or indirect  consideration.  However,  if necessary or
advisable,  a Fund will pay for stand-by commitments,  either separately in cash
or by paying a higher price for portfolio  securities which are acquired subject
to the commitments.

P-->497297th Page of 358TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 297th
It is difficult to evaluate the likelihood of use or the potential  benefit of a
stand-by commitment.  Therefore,  it is expected that the Advisor will determine
that stand-by commitments  ordinarily have a "fair value" of zero, regardless of
whether any direct or indirect  consideration was paid.  However,  if the market
price of the  security  subject  to the  stand-by  commitment  is less  than the
exercise  price of the stand-by  commitment,  such security  will  ordinarily be
valued at such exercise price. Where a Fund has paid for a stand-by  commitment,
its cost will be  reflected as  unrealized  depreciation  for the period  during
which the commitment is held.                                                   

The Advisor  understands  that the Internal  Revenue Service (the "Service") has
issued  a  favorable   revenue  ruling  to  the  effect  that,  under  specified
circumstances,  a registered  investment company will be the owner of tax-exempt
municipal  obligations  acquired  subject to a put option.  The Service has also
issued  private  letter  rulings  to  certain  taxpayers  (which do not serve as
precedent for other taxpayers) to the effect that tax-exempt  interest  received
by a regulated  investment  company  with  respect to such  obligations  will be
tax-exempt  in  the  hands  of  the  company  and  may  be  distributed  to  its
shareholders  as  exempt-interest   dividends.   The  Service  has  subsequently
announced  that it will not  ordinarily  issue advance  ruling letters as to the
identity of the true owner of property in cases involving the sale of securities
or participation  interests  therein if the purchaser has the right to cause the
security,  or the participation  interest therein, to be purchased by either the
seller or a third party.  A Fund  intends to take the position  that it owns any
municipal  obligations  acquired  subject  to a  Stand-by  Commitment  and  that
tax-exempt  interest earned with respect to such municipal  obligations  will be
tax-exempt in its hands.  There is no assurance that the Service will agree with
such position in any particular case.                                           

Strategic  Transactions  and  Derivatives.  A Fund may,  but is not required to,
utilize various other investment  strategies as described below for a variety of
purposes,  such as hedging various market risks, managing the effective maturity
or  duration  of the  Fund's  portfolio,  or  enhancing  potential  gain.  These
strategies may be executed through the use of derivative contracts.             

In the course of pursuing these  investment  strategies,  the Funds may purchase
and  sell  exchange-listed  and  over  the  counter  put  and  call  options  on
securities,  fixed-income indices and other financial instruments,  purchase and
sell futures contracts and options thereon,  and enter into various transactions
such as swaps, caps, floors or collars  (collectively,  all the above are called
"Strategic Transactions").  In addition, Strategic Transactions may also include
new  techniques,  instruments  or  strategies  that are  permitted as regulatory
changes occur.  Strategic  Transactions may be used without limit (except to the
extent  that 80% of each  Fund's net  assets  are  required  to be  invested  in
tax-exempt municipal securities,  and as limited by each Fund's other investment
restrictions  and subject to certain  limits imposed by the 1940 Act) to attempt
to protect against possible changes in the market value of securities held in or
to be  purchased  for a  Fund's  portfolio  resulting  from  securities  markets
fluctuations,  to  protect  the  Fund's  unrealized  gains  in the  value of its
portfolio  securities,  to facilitate the sale of such securities for investment
purposes, to manage the effective maturity or duration of a Fund's portfolio, or
to establish a position in the derivatives markets as a temporary substitute for
purchasing or selling  particular  securities.  Some Strategic  Transactions may
also be used to enhance  potential  gain although no more than 5% of each Fund's
assets will be committed to Strategic  Transactions entered into for non-hedging
purposes.  Any or all of these investment techniques may be used at any time and
in any combination, and there is no particular strategy that dictates the use of
one technique  rather than another,  as use of any  Strategic  Transaction  is a
function of numerous variables  including market conditions.  The ability of the
Funds to utilize these Strategic  Transactions  successfully  will depend on the
Advisor's  ability  to  predict  pertinent  market  movements,  which  cannot be
assured.  The Funds will comply with  applicable  regulatory  requirements  when
implementing   these   strategies,   techniques   and   instruments.   Strategic
Transactions  will  not be used to alter  fundamental  investment  purposes  and
characteristics  of a Fund, and a Fund will segregate  assets (or as provided by
applicable  regulations,  enter into certain offsetting  positions) to cover its
obligations under options, futures and swaps to limit leveraging of a Fund.     

Strategic  Transactions,  including derivative contracts,  have risks associated
with them  including  possible  default by the other  party to the  transaction,
illiquidity and, to the extent the Advisor's view as to certain market movements
is incorrect,  the risk that the use of such Strategic Transactions could result
in losses  greater  than if they had not been used.  Use of put and call options
may  result  in  losses  to a Fund,  force  the sale or  purchase  of  portfolio
securities  at  inopportune  times or for prices higher than (in the case of put
options)  or lower than (in the case of call  options)  current  market  values,
limit the amount of  appreciation a Fund can realize on its investments or cause
a Fund to hold a  security  it might  otherwise  sell.  The use of  options  and
futures  transactions  entails certain other risks. In particular,              

11

P-->497298th Page of 358TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 298th
the variable degree of correlation  between price movements of futures contracts
and price  movements  in the related  portfolio  position of a Fund  creates the
possibility  that losses on the hedging  instrument may be greater than gains in
the value of that Fund's position. In addition,  futures and options markets may
not be liquid in all circumstances and certain over-the-counter options may have
no markets.  As a result, in certain markets,  a Fund might not be able to close
out a transaction without incurring  substantial losses, if at all. Although the
use of futures and options  transactions for hedging should tend to minimize the
risk of loss due to a decline in the value of the hedged  position,  at the same
time they tend to limit any  potential  gain which might result from an increase
in value of such position.  Finally, the daily variation margin requirements for
futures contracts would create a greater ongoing  potential  financial risk than
would  purchase  of  options,  where the  exposure is limited to the cost of the
initial premium..  Losses resulting from the use of Strategic Transactions would
reduce net asset value, and possibly income, and such losses can be greater than
if the Strategic Transactions had not been utilized.                            

General  Characteristics of Options. Put options and call options typically have
similar structural  characteristics and operational  mechanics regardless of the
underlying  instrument on which they are purchased or sold.  Thus, the following
general  discussion relates to each of the particular types of options discussed
in greater  detail below.  In addition,  many Strategic  Transactions  involving
options  require  segregation of Fund assets in special  accounts,  as described
below under "Use of Segregated and Other Special Accounts."                     

A put option gives the purchaser of the option,  upon payment of a premium,  the
right to sell, and the writer the  obligation to buy, the  underlying  security,
commodity,  index,  currency or other  instrument  at the  exercise  price.  For
instance,  a Fund's  purchase of a put option on a security might be designed to
protect its holdings in the underlying  instrument (or, in some cases, a similar
instrument)  against a substantial  decline in the market value by giving a Fund
the right to sell such  instrument at the option  exercise price. A call option,
upon payment of a premium,  gives the  purchaser of the option the right to buy,
and the seller the obligation to sell, the underlying instrument at the exercise
price.  A Fund's  purchase  of a call option on a  security,  financial  future,
index,  currency or other instrument might be intended to protect a Fund against
an  increase  in the  price of the  underlying  instrument  that it  intends  to
purchase  in the  future  by  fixing  the  price at which it may  purchase  such
instrument.  An American  style put or call option may be  exercised at any time
during  the  option  period  while a  European  style put or call  option may be
exercised only upon expiration or during a fixed period prior thereto. Each Fund
is authorized to purchase and sell exchange listed options and  over-the-counter
options  ("OTC  options").  Exchange  listed  options  are issued by a regulated
intermediary such as the Options Clearing Corporation ("OCC"),  which guarantees
the  performance  of the  obligations  of  the  parties  to  such  options.  The
discussion  below uses the OCC as an example,  but is also  applicable  to other
financial intermediaries.                                                       

With certain exceptions, OCC issued and exchange listed options generally settle
by physical  delivery of the  underlying  security or currency,  although in the
future cash  settlement  may become  available.  Index  options  and  Eurodollar
instruments are cash settled for the net amount,  if any, by which the option is
"in-the-money"  (i.e., where the value of the underlying  instrument exceeds, in
the case of a call  option,  or is less than,  in the case of a put option,  the
exercise  price of the option) at the time the option is exercised.  Frequently,
rather than taking or making delivery of the underlying  instrument  through the
process of  exercising  the option,  listed  options are closed by entering into
offsetting  purchase or sale transactions that do not result in ownership of the
new option.                                                                     

A Fund's ability to close out its position as a purchaser or seller of an OCC or
exchange listed put or call option is dependent,  in part, upon the liquidity of
the option market. Among the possible reasons for the absence of a liquid option
market on an exchange are: (i) insufficient trading interest in certain options;
(ii) restrictions on transactions  imposed by an exchange;  (iii) trading halts,
suspensions or other restrictions  imposed with respect to particular classes or
series of  options or  underlying  securities  including  reaching  daily  price
limits;  (iv)  interruption of the normal  operations of the OCC or an exchange;
(v) inadequacy of the facilities of an exchange or OCC to handle current trading
volume;  or (vi) a decision by one or more exchanges to discontinue  the trading
of options  (or a  particular  class or series of  options),  in which event the
relevant market for that option on that exchange would cease to exist,  although
outstanding  options on that exchange would generally continue to be exercisable
in accordance with their terms.                                                 

12

P-->497299th Page of 358TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 299th
The hours of trading for listed  options may not coincide  with the hours during
which the underlying  financial  instruments are traded.  To the extent that the
option   markets  close  before  the  markets  for  the   underlying   financial
instruments,  significant  price  and  rate  movements  can  take  place  in the
underlying markets that cannot be reflected in the option markets.              

OTC  options  are  purchased  from  or  sold to  securities  dealers,  financial
institutions  or  other  parties  ("Counterparties")  through  direct  bilateral
agreement with the Counterparty.  In contrast to exchange listed options,  which
generally have standardized terms and performance mechanics, all the terms of an
OTC option, including such terms as method of settlement,  term, exercise price,
premium,  guarantees and security, are set by negotiation of the parties. A Fund
will only sell OTC options (other than OTC currency options) that are subject to
a buy-back  provision  permitting a Fund to require the Counterparty to sell the
option  back to a Fund at a formula  price  within  seven days.  A Fund  expects
generally  to enter  into OTC  options  that  have cash  settlement  provisions,
although it is not required to do so.                                           

Unless the  parties  provide  for it,  there is no central  clearing or guaranty
function in an OTC option.  As a result,  if the  Counterparty  fails to make or
take delivery of the security,  currency or other  instrument  underlying an OTC
option  it has  entered  into  with a Fund or  fails  to make a cash  settlement
payment due in  accordance  with the terms of that option,  a Fund will lose any
premium  it paid  for the  option  as well  as any  anticipated  benefit  of the
transaction.  Accordingly,  the Advisor must assess the creditworthiness of each
such Counterparty or any guarantor or credit  enhancement of the  Counterparty's
credit to  determine  the  likelihood  that the terms of the OTC option  will be
satisfied. A Fund will engage in OTC option transactions only with US government
securities  dealers  recognized  by the  Federal  Reserve  Bank  of New  York as
"primary  dealers,"  or  broker-dealers,  domestic  or  foreign  banks  or other
financial  institutions which have received (or the guarantors of the obligation
of which have  received) a short-term  credit rating of A-1 from S&P or P-1 from
Moody's or an equivalent rating from any other nationally recognized statistical
rating organization ("NRSRO") or, in the case of OTC currency transactions,  are
determined to be of equivalent  credit quality by the Advisor.  The staff of the
SEC  currently  takes the position  that OTC options  purchased  by a Fund,  and
portfolio securities "covering" the amount of a Fund's obligation pursuant to an
OTC option sold by it (the cost of the sell-back plus the  in-the-money  amount,
if any) are  illiquid,  and are subject to a Fund's  limitation  on investing no
more than 15% of its net assets in illiquid securities.                         

If a Fund sells a call  option,  the  premium  that it  receives  may serve as a
partial hedge,  to the extent of the option  premium,  against a decrease in the
value of the  underlying  securities  or  instruments  in its  portfolio or will
increase a Fund's income. The sale of put options can also provide income.      

A Fund may purchase and sell call  options on,  among other  things,  securities
including   US   Treasury   and  agency   securities,   municipal   obligations,
mortgage-backed  securities and Eurodollar instruments that are traded on US and
foreign  securities  exchanges  and  in  the  over-the-counter  markets,  and on
securities  indices  and  futures  contracts.  All calls  sold by a Fund must be
"covered"  (i.e., a Fund must own the securities or futures  contract subject to
the call) or must meet the asset  segregation  requirements  described  below as
long as the call is  outstanding.  Even  though a Fund will  receive  the option
premium to help  protect it against  loss,  a call sold by a Fund exposes a Fund
during  the term of the  option  to  possible  loss of  opportunity  to  realize
appreciation  in the market price of the  underlying  security or instrument and
may require a Fund to hold a security  or  instrument  which it might  otherwise
have sold.                                                                      

A Fund may  purchase  and sell put options on,  among other  things,  securities
including  US  Treasury  and  agency  securities,   mortgage-backed  securities,
municipal  obligations and Eurodollar  instruments  (whether or not it holds the
above  securities  in its  portfolio)  and on  securities  indices  and  futures
contracts other than futures on individual  corporate debt and individual equity
securities.  A Fund will not sell put options if, as a result,  more than 50% of
such Fund's  assets would be required to be  segregated  to cover its  potential
obligations  under such put options other than those with respect to futures and
options  thereon.  In selling  put  options,  there is a risk that a Fund may be
required to buy the  underlying  security at a  disadvantageous  price above the
market price.                                                                   

General  Characteristics  of Futures. A Fund may enter into futures contracts or
purchase  or sell  put and  call  options  on such  futures  as a hedge  against
anticipated  interest  rate or  fixed-income  market  changes  and for  duration
management,  risk  management  and  return  enhancement  purposes.  Futures  are
generally  bought and sold on the  commodities  exchanges  where they are listed
with payment of initial and variation  margin as described  below. The          

13

P-->497300th Page of 358TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 300th
sale of a futures contract  creates a firm obligation by the seller,  to deliver
to the  buyer  the  specific  type of  financial  instrument  called  for in the
contract at a specific  future time for a specified  price (or,  with respect to
certain instruments,  such as index futures and Eurodollar instruments,  the net
cash amount) and a firm obligation by the buyer to deliver the specified  price.
Options on futures contracts are similar to options on securities except that an
option on a futures  contract  gives the  purchaser  the right in return for the
premium paid to assume a position in a futures contract and obligates the seller
to deliver such position.                                                       

Each Fund has claimed  exclusion from the definition of the term "commodity pool
operator" under the Commodity Exchange Act. Therefore, the Funds are not subject
to commodity  pool  operator  registration  and  regulation  under the Commodity
Exchange  Act.  Futures and options on futures may be entered into for bona fide
hedging,  risk management (including duration management) or other portfolio and
return  enhancement  management  purposes.  Typically,   maintaining  a  futures
contract  or  selling  an  option  thereon  requires  a Fund to  deposit  with a
financial  intermediary  as security  for its  obligations  an amount of cash or
other specified  assets (initial  margin) which initially is typically 1% to 10%
of the face amount of the  contract  (but may be higher in some  circumstances).
Additional  cash or assets  (variation  margin) may be required to be  deposited
thereafter  on a  daily  basis  as the  mark-to-market  value  of  the  contract
fluctuates.  The purchase of options on financial  futures involves payment of a
premium for the option without any further  obligation on the part of a Fund. If
a Fund  exercises  an option on a futures  contract it will be obligated to post
initial margin (and  potential  subsequent  variation  margin) for the resulting
futures  position  just as it would  for any  position.  Futures  contracts  and
options thereon are generally settled by entering into an offsetting transaction
but  there  can be no  assurance  that  the  position  can be  offset  prior  to
settlement at an advantageous price, nor that delivery will occur.              

A Fund will not enter into a futures  contract  or related  option  (except  for
closing transactions) if, immediately  thereafter,  the sum of the amount of its
initial margin and premiums on open futures  contracts and options thereon would
exceed 5% of a Fund's total assets  (taken at current  value);  however,  in the
case of an  option  that  is  in-the-money  at the  time  of the  purchase,  the
in-the-money  amount may be  excluded  in  calculating  the 5%  limitation.  The
segregation  requirements  with respect to futures contracts and options thereon
are described below.                                                            

Swaps, Caps, Floors and Collars.  Among the Strategic  Transactions into which a
Fund may enter are interest rate, index and other swaps and the purchase or sale
of  related  caps,  floors  and  collars.  A Fund  expects  to enter  into these
transactions primarily to preserve a return or spread on a particular investment
or portion of its  portfolio,  as a duration  management  technique,  to protect
against  any  increase  in the  price  of  securities  that  a Fund  anticipates
purchasing at a later date or to enhance returns.  A Fund will not sell interest
rate  caps or  floors  where it does  not own  securities  or other  instruments
providing the income stream a Fund may be obligated to pay.  Interest rate swaps
involve  the  exchange  by  a  Fund  with  another  party  of  their  respective
commitments  to pay or receive  interest,  e.g.,  an exchange  of floating  rate
payments for fixed rate payments with respect to a notional amount of principal.
An index swap is an agreement  to swap cash flows on a notional  amount based on
changes in the values of the reference  indices.  The purchase of a cap entitles
the purchaser to receive payments on a notional  principal amount from the party
selling such cap to the extent that a specified  index  exceeds a  predetermined
interest  rate or amount.  The  purchase of a floor  entitles  the  purchaser to
receive  payments on a notional  principal  amount from the party  selling  such
floor to the extent that a specified index falls below a predetermined  interest
rate or amount.  A collar is a combination of a cap and a floor that preserves a
certain return within a predetermined range of interest rates or values.        

A Fund will  usually  enter  into swaps on a net basis,  i.e.,  the two  payment
streams  are  netted  out in a cash  settlement  on the  payment  date or  dates
specified in the  instrument,  with a Fund receiving or paying,  as the case may
be,  only the net  amount of the two  payments.  A Fund will not enter  into any
swap, cap, floor or collar transaction unless, at the time of entering into such
transaction, the unsecured long-term debt of the Counterparty, combined with any
credit enhancements,  is rated at least A by S&P or Moody's or has an equivalent
rating from an NRSRO or is determined to be of equivalent  credit quality by the
Advisor. If there is a default by the Counterparty,  a Fund may have contractual
remedies pursuant to the agreements

related to the  transaction.  The swap market has grown  substantially in recent
years with a large number of banks and  investment  banking firms acting both as
principals and as agents utilizing standardized swap documentation. As a result,
the swap market has become relatively liquid.  Caps, floors and collars are more
recent innovations for which  standardized  documentation has not yet been fully
developed and, accordingly, they are less liquid than swaps.                    

Use of Segregated and Other Special Accounts.  Many Strategic  Transactions,  in
addition to other  requirements,  require that a Fund  segregate  cash or liquid
assets with its  custodian  to the extent  Fund  obligations  are not  otherwise
"covered" through ownership of the underlying security,  financial instrument or
currency. In general,  either the full amount of any obligation by a Fund to pay
or deliver  securities or assets must be covered at all times by the securities,
instruments or currency required to be delivered,  or, subject to any regulatory
restrictions,  an amount of cash or liquid  assets at least equal to the current
amount of the obligation must be segregated  with the custodian.  The segregated
assets cannot be sold or transferred unless equivalent assets are substituted in
their place or it is no longer necessary to segregate them. For example,  a call
option written by a Fund will require a Fund to hold the  securities  subject to
the  call  (or  securities   convertible  into  the  needed  securities  without
additional  consideration)  or to segregate cash or liquid assets  sufficient to
purchase and deliver the securities if the call is exercised. A call option sold
by a Fund on an index will require that Fund to own portfolio  securities  which
correlate  with the index or to  segregate  cash or liquid  assets  equal to the
excess of the index  value over the  exercise  price on a current  basis.  A put
option  written by a Fund  requires a Fund to  segregate  cash or liquid  assets
equal to the exercise price.                                                    

Except when a Fund enters into a forward  contract for the purchase or sale of a
security denominated in a particular currency, which requires no segregation,  a
currency  contract which obligates a Fund to buy or sell currency will generally
require  that  Fund  to  hold  an  amount  of that  currency  or  liquid  assets
denominated in that currency equal to a Fund's  obligations or to segregate cash
or liquid assets equal to the amount of a Fund's obligation.                    

OTC options  entered into by a Fund,  including  those on securities,  currency,
financial  instruments  or  indices  and OCC issued and  exchange  listed  index
options,  will generally provide for cash settlement.  As a result,  when a Fund
sells  these  instruments  it will  only  segregate  an amount of cash or liquid
assets  equal to its accrued net  obligations,  as there is no  requirement  for
payment or delivery of amounts in excess of the net amount.  These  amounts will
equal 100% of the exercise price in the case of a non cash-settled put, the same
as an OCC guaranteed  listed option sold by a Fund, or the  in-the-money  amount
plus any sell-back  formula amount in the case of a cash-settled put or call. In
addition,  when a Fund  sells a call  option  on an  index  at a time  when  the
in-the-money amount exceeds the exercise price, a Fund will segregate, until the
option expires or is closed out, cash or cash equivalents equal in value to such
excess.  OCC issued and exchange  listed options sold by a Fund other than those
above  generally  settle with physical  delivery,  or with an election of either
physical delivery or cash settlement and a Fund will segregate an amount of cash
or liquid  assets  equal to the full value of the option.  OTC options  settling
with physical delivery,  or with an election of either physical delivery or cash
settlement  will be treated the same as other  options  settling  with  physical
delivery.                                                                       

In the case of a futures  contract  or an option  thereon,  a Fund must  deposit
initial  margin and possible daily  variation  margin in addition to segregating
cash or liquid assets  sufficient to meet its  obligation to purchase or provide
securities  or  currencies,  or to pay the amount owed at the  expiration  of an
index-based  futures  contract.  Such liquid  assets may  consist of cash,  cash
equivalents, liquid debt or equity securities or other acceptable assets.       

With respect to swaps, a Fund will accrue the net amount of the excess,  if any,
of its obligations  over its  entitlements  with respect to each swap on a daily
basis and will segregate an amount of cash or liquid assets having a value equal
to the accrued excess.  Caps,  floors and collars require  segregation of assets
with a value equal to a Fund's net obligation, if any.                          

Strategic  Transactions  may be covered  by other  means  when  consistent  with
applicable   regulatory   policies.  A  Fund  may  also  enter  into  offsetting
transactions so that its combined position,  coupled with any segregated assets,
equals  its  net  outstanding   obligation  in  related  options  and  Strategic
Transactions.  For  example,  a Fund  could  purchase a put option if the strike
price of that option is the same or higher than the strike price of a put option
sold by a Fund. Moreover, instead of segregating cash or liquid assets if a Fund
held a futures or forward  contract,  it could purchase a put option on the same
futures or forward contract with a strike price as high or higher than the price
of the  contract  held.  Other  Strategic  Transactions  may also be  offset  in
combinations.  If the offsetting  transaction                                   

15

terminates at the time of or after the primary  transaction  no  segregation  is
required,  but if it terminates  prior to such time, cash or liquid assets equal
to any remaining obligation would need to be segregated.                        

Tax-Exempt Custodial Receipts.  The DWS Managed Municipal Bond Fund may purchase
tax-exempt  custodial  receipts (the "Receipts") which evidence  ownership in an
underlying bond that is deposited with a custodian for  safekeeping.  Holders of
the Receipts  receive all payments of  principal  and interest  when paid on the
bonds.  Receipts  can  be  purchased  in an  offering  or  from  a  Counterparty
(typically an investment  bank). To the extent that any Receipt is illiquid,  it
is subject to the Fund's limit on illiquid securities.                          

Tax  Exempt  Pass-Through  Securities.  The DWS High  Yield  Tax  Free  Fund may
purchase tax exempt pass-through certificates.  These represent an interest in a
pool or group of fixed-rate long-term debt obligations issued by or on behalf of
primarily  not-for-profit  institutions,  the  interest  on which is exempt from
federal income taxation, including alternative minimum taxation. Such fixed-rate
long-term  debt  obligations  may be private  activity  bonds  issued by states,
municipalities or public authorities to provide funds, usually through a loan or
lease arrangement,  to a non-profit  corporation for the purpose of financing or
refinancing  the  construction  or  improvement  of a facility to be used by the
non-profit  corporation.  Distributions on tax exempt pass-through  certificates
may be adversely  affected by defaults in or prepayment of the  underlying  debt
obligations.  Certain tax exempt pass-through certificates are issued in several
classes  with  different  levels of yields and credit  protection.  The Fund may
invest in lower classes of tax exempt  pass-through  certificates that have less
credit protection.  Tax exempt pass-through  certificates have limited liquidity
and certain  transfer  restrictions  may apply.  There  currently  is no trading
market for tax exempt  pass-through  certificates  and there can be no assurance
that such a market will develop.                                                

Third Party Puts. A Fund may purchase  long-term fixed rate bonds that have been
coupled with an option granted by a third party financial institution allowing a
Fund at specified  intervals  to tender (or "put") the bonds to the  institution
and receive the face value thereof (plus  accrued  interest).  These third party
puts are available in several  different  forms, may be represented by custodial
receipts or trust  certificates  and may be combined with other features such as
interest rate swaps.  That Fund receives a short-term rate of interest (which is
periodically  reset),  and the interest rate differential  between that rate and
the  fixed  rate on the  bond is  retained  by the  financial  institution.  The
financial  institution  granting the option does not provide credit enhancement,
and in the  event  that  there is a  default  in the  payment  of  principal  or
interest,  or downgrading of a bond to below investment  grade, or a loss of the
bond's tax-exempt status, the put option will terminate automatically,  the risk
to that Fund will be that of  holding  such a  long-term  bond and the  weighted
average maturity of a Fund's portfolio would be adversely affected.             

These bonds coupled with puts may present the same tax issues as are  associated
with Stand-By Commitments.  As with any Stand-By Commitments acquired by a Fund,
the Fund  intends  to take the  position  that it is the owner of any  municipal
obligation  acquired subject to a third-party put, and that tax-exempt  interest
earned with respect to such  municipal  obligations  will be  tax-exempt  in its
hands.  There is no assurance  that the Service will agree with such position in
any particular case.  Additionally,  the federal income tax treatment of certain
other aspects of these  investments,  including the treatment of tender fees and
swap  payments,   in  relation  to  various  regulated  investment  company  tax
provisions is unclear.  However,  the Advisor seeks to manage a Fund's portfolio
in a manner designed to minimize any adverse impact from these investments.     

US   Government   Securities.   There   are   two   broad   categories   of   US
Government-related debt instruments:  (a) direct obligations of the US Treasury,
and (b) securities issued or guaranteed by US Government agencies.              

Examples of direct  obligations  of the US Treasury are Treasury  Bills,  Notes,
Bonds and other debt securities issued by the US Treasury. These instruments are
backed  by the  "full  faith and  credit"  of the  United  States.  They  differ
primarily in interest rates, the length of maturities and the dates of issuance.
Treasury bills have original maturities of one year or less. Treasury notes have
original  maturities  of one to ten  years and  Treasury  bonds  generally  have
original maturities of greater than ten years.                                  

Some  agency  securities  are  backed by the full faith and credit of the United
States (such as Maritime Administration Title XI Ship Financing Bonds and Agency
for  International  Development  Housing Guarantee Program Bonds) and others are
backed only by the rights of the issuer to borrow from the US Treasury  (such as
Federal Home Loan Bank Bonds and Federal National Mortgage  Association  Bonds),
while still others,  such as the securities of the Federal                      

16

P-->497303rd Page of 358TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 303rd
Farm Credit Bank, are supported  only by the credit of the issuer.  With respect
to  securities  supported  only by the  credit  of the  issuing  agency or by an
additional  line of credit with the US Treasury,  there is no guarantee that the
US  Government  will provide  support to such agencies and such  securities  may
involve risk of loss of principal and interest.                                 

US Government  securities  may include "zero coupon"  securities  that have been
stripped  by  the  US  Government  of  their  unmatured   interest  coupons  and
collateralized  obligations  issued or guaranteed  by a US Government  agency or
instrumentality.                                                                

Interest rates on US Government  obligations may be fixed or variable.  Interest
rates on variable rate obligations are adjusted at regular  intervals,  at least
annually,  according to a formula  reflecting  then-current  specified  standard
rates, such as 91-day US Treasury bill rates.  These adjustments  generally tend
to reduce fluctuations in the market value of the securities.                   

The government  guarantee of the US Government  securities in a Fund's portfolio
does not  guarantee  the net asset  value of the shares of that Fund.  There are
market  risks  inherent in all  investments  in  securities  and the value of an
investment  in  a  Fund  will  fluctuate  over  time.  Normally,  the  value  of
investments  in US  Government  securities  varies  inversely  with  changes  in
interest rates. For example,  as interest rates rise the value of investments in
US Government  securities  will tend to decline,  and as interest rates fall the
value of a Fund's investments will tend to increase. In addition,  the potential
for  appreciation  in the event of a decline in interest rates may be limited or
negated   by   increased   principal   prepayments   with   respect  to  certain
Mortgage-Backed  Securities,  such as  GNMA  Certificates.  Prepayments  of high
interest  rate  Mortgage-Backed  Securities  during times of declining  interest
rates will tend to lower the return of a Fund and may even result in losses to a
Fund if some securities were acquired at a premium.  Moreover, during periods of
rising interest rates,  prepayments of  Mortgage-Backed  Securities may decline,
resulting in the extension of a Fund's average portfolio maturity.  As a result,
a Fund's portfolio may experience  greater  volatility  during periods of rising
interest rates than under normal market conditions.                             

When-Issued  Securities.  A Fund may from time to time purchase  equity and debt
securities on a "when-issued," "delayed  delivery" or "forward delivery" basis.
The price of such securities, which may be expressed in yield terms, is fixed at
the time the  commitment  to purchase is made,  but delivery and payment for the
securities  takes place at a later date.  During the period between purchase and
settlement,  no payment is made by a Fund to the issuer and no interest  accrues
to a Fund.  When a Fund purchases such  securities,  it immediately  assumes the
risks of ownership, including the risk of price fluctuation.  Failure to deliver
a security purchased on this basis may result in a loss or missed opportunity to
make an alternative investment.                                                 

To the extent that assets of a Fund are held in cash pending the settlement of a
purchase of securities,  a Fund would earn no income.  While such securities may
be sold prior to the settlement date, the Funds intend to purchase them with the
purpose  of  actually  acquiring  them  unless  a  sale  appears  desirable  for
investment  reasons.  At the time a Fund  makes the  commitment  to  purchase  a
security on this basis,  it will record the transaction and reflect the value of
the  security  in  determining  its net asset  value.  The  market  value of the
securities  may be more or less  than the  purchase  price.                     

Master/feeder Fund Structure. The Board of Trustees has the discretion to retain
the current distribution arrangement for a Fund while investing in a master fund
in a master/feeder fund structure as described below.                           

A master/feeder fund structure is one in which a fund (a "feeder fund"), instead
of investing  directly in a portfolio of securities,  invests most or all of its
investment  assets in a separate  registered  investment  company  (the  "master
fund") with  substantially  the same  investment  objective  and policies as the
feeder  fund.  Such a  structure  permits  the  pooling of assets of two or more
feeder funds,  preserving  separate  identities or distribution  channels at the
feeder  fund  level.  Based on the  premise  that  certain  of the  expenses  of
operating an investment  portfolio are  relatively  fixed,  a larger  investment
portfolio may eventually  achieve a lower ratio of operating expenses to average
net assets. An existing  investment  company is able to convert to a feeder fund
by  selling  all  of  its  investments,   which  involves  brokerage  and  other
transaction  costs and realization of a taxable gain or loss, or by contributing
its assets to the                                                               

17

master  fund and  avoiding  transaction  costs  and,  if proper  procedures  are
followed, the realization of taxable gain or loss.                              

Portfolio Holdings Information                                                  

In addition to the public disclosure of Fund portfolio holdings through required
Securities and Exchange  Commission  ("SEC") quarterly  filings, a Fund may make
its portfolio holdings information publicly available on the DWS Funds' Web site
as  described  in  each  Fund's  prospectus.  Each  Fund  does  not  disseminate
non-public  information  about  portfolio  holdings  except in  accordance  with
policies and procedures adopted by each Fund.                                   

Each Fund's procedures permit non-public  portfolio  holdings  information to be
shared with Deutsche Asset Management and its affiliates  (collectively "DeAM"),
subadvisors, if any, custodians, independent registered public accounting firms,
attorneys,   officers  and  trustees/directors  and  each  of  their  respective
affiliates and advisers who require access to this  information to fulfill their
duties to each Fund and are subject to the duties of confidentiality,  including
the duty not to trade on non-public information,  imposed by law or contract, or
by each Fund's  procedures.  This non-public  information may also be disclosed,
subject to the  requirements  described  below,  to securities  lending  agents,
financial  printers,  proxy voting  firms,  mutual fund  analysts and rating and
tracking  agencies,  or to shareholders  in connection with in-kind  redemptions
(collectively, "Authorized Third Parties").                                     

Prior to any disclosure of each Fund's non-public portfolio holdings information
to Authorized  Third Parties,  a person  authorized by each Fund's Trustees must
make a good faith determination in light of the facts then known that a Fund has
a legitimate business purpose for providing the information, that the disclosure
is in the  best  interest  of each  Fund,  and  that the  recipient  assents  or
otherwise has a duty to keep the information confidential and to not trade based
on the  information  received  while  the  information  remains  non-public.  No
compensation is received by each Fund or DeAM for disclosing non-public holdings
information.  Periodic  reports  regarding these  procedures will be provided to
each Fund's Trustees.                                                           

Portfolio  holdings  information  distributed  by the trading desks of DeAM or a
subadvisor for the purpose of facilitating  efficient trading of such securities
and receipt of relevant  research is not subject to the foregoing  requirements.
Non-public   portfolio   holding   information   does  not   include   portfolio
characteristics (other than holdings or subsets of holdings) about each Fund and
information  derived therefrom,  including,  but not limited to, how each Fund's
investments are divided among various sectors, industries,  countries, value and
growth stocks,  bonds,  currencies and cash,  types of bonds,  bond  maturities,
duration,  bond coupons and bond credit  quality  ratings so long as each Fund's
holdings could not be derived from such information.                            

Registered  investment  companies  that are subadvised by DeAM may be subject to
different portfolio holdings disclosure policies,  and neither DeAM nor a fund's
Trustees  exercise  control over such policies.  In addition,  separate  account
clients of DeAM have access to their portfolio holdings and are not subject to a
fund's portfolio  holdings  disclosure policy. The portfolio holdings of some of
the funds  subadvised by DeAM and some of the separate  accounts managed by DeAM
may substantially overlap with the portfolio holdings of a fund.                

DeAM also  manages  certain  unregistered  commingled  trusts and creates  model
portfolios,  the portfolio holdings of which may substantially  overlap with the
portfolio  holdings of a fund. To the extent that investors in these  commingled
trusts  or  recipients  of model  portfolio  holdings  information  may  receive
portfolio  holdings  information  of their  trust or of a model  portfolio  on a
different basis from that on which fund portfolio  holdings  information is made
public,  DeAM has implemented  procedures  reasonably designed to encourage such
investors and recipients to keep such information  confidential,  and to prevent
those investors from trading on the basis of non-public holdings information.   

There is no assurance that a fund's  policies and procedures with respect to the
disclosure  of  portfolio  holdings  information  will  protect  a fund from the
potential  misuse of portfolio  holdings  information  by those in possession of
that information.

 MANAGEMENT OF THE FUNDS

Investment Advisor                                                              

DIMA,  which is part of DeAM,  is the  investment  advisor  for each Fund,  with
headquarters  at 345 Park Avenue,  New York, New York.  Under the supervision of
the Board of Trustees of the Funds, DIMA makes the Funds' investment  decisions,
buys and sells  securities  for the Funds and  conducts  research  that leads to
these  purchase  and sale  decisions.  The Advisor  manages  each  Fund's  daily
investment  and business  affairs  subject to the policies  established  by each
Trust's Board of Trustees.  The Fund's Advisor is also responsible for selecting
brokers  and  dealers  and for  negotiating  brokerage  commissions  and  dealer
charges. The Advisor's duties are described in more detail below. DIMA, together
with its  predecessors,  has more than 80 years of  experience  managing  mutual
funds and provides a full range of investment advisory services to institutional
and retail clients.                                                             

DeAM is the  marketing  name in the US for the asset  management  activities  of
Deutsche  Bank AG,  DIMA,  Deutsche  Bank Trust  Company  Americas and DWS Trust
Company. DeAM is a global asset management organization that offers a wide range
of investing  expertise and resources,  including hundreds of portfolio managers
and analysts and an office  network  that reaches the world's  major  investment
centers.  This well-resourced  global investment platform brings together a wide
variety of experience and investment insight, across industries,  regions, asset
classes and investing styles.  DIMA is an indirect,  wholly-owned  subsidiary of
Deutsche Bank AG. Deutsche Bank AG is a major global banking institution that is
engaged in a wide range of financial services,  including investment management,
mutual fund,  retail,  private and commercial  banking,  investment  banking and
insurance.  The term "DWS Scudder" is the designation  given to the products and
services provided by DIMA and its affiliates to the DWS Mutual Funds.           

The Trustees have overall  responsibility  for the management of each Fund under
Massachusetts law.                                                              

The Advisor provides  investment  counsel for many individuals and institutions,
including  insurance  companies,  industrial  corporations,  and  financial  and
banking  organizations,  as well as  providing  investment  advice  to open- and
closed-end SEC registered funds.                                                

In certain cases, the investments for a Fund are managed by the same individuals
who manage one or more  other  mutual  funds  advised by the  Advisor  that have
similar names, objectives and investment styles. You should be aware that a Fund
is likely to differ from these other mutual funds in size, cash flow pattern and
tax matters. Accordingly, the holdings and performance of a Fund can be expected
to vary from those of the other mutual funds.                                   

Certain  investments  may be  appropriate  for a Fund and also for other clients
advised by the Advisor.  Investment  decisions  for a Fund and other clients are
made with a view to achieving their respective  investment  objectives and after
consideration  of such factors as their current  holdings,  availability of cash
for  investment  and the  size of their  investments  generally.  Frequently,  a
particular  security  may be bought or sold for only one client or in  different
amounts  and at  different  times for more  than one but less than all  clients.
Likewise,  a particular  security may be bought for one or more clients when one
or more other clients are selling the security. In addition,  purchases or sales
of the same  security  may be made for two or more  clients on the same day.  In
such event,  such  transactions  will be allocated among the clients in a manner
believed by the Advisor to be equitable to each. In some cases,  this  procedure
could have an adverse effect on the price or amount of the securities  purchased
or sold by a Fund.  Purchase  and sale  orders for a Fund may be  combined  with
those of other  clients of the  Advisor in the  interest of  achieving  the most
favorable net results to a Fund.                                                

Each Fund is  managed  by a team of  investment  professionals  who each play an
important  role in a Fund's  management  process.  Team members work together to
develop investment strategies and select securities for a

Fund's  portfolio.  This team  works for the  Advisor or its  affiliates  and is
supported by a large staff of economists,  research analysts,  traders and other
investment  specialists.  The  Advisor  or its  affiliates  believe(s)  its team
approach  benefits  Fund  investors by bringing  together many  disciplines  and
leveraging its extensive resources. Team members with primary responsibility for
management  of the  Funds,  as well as  team  members  who  have  other  ongoing
management  responsibilities  for  each  Fund,  are  identified  in each  Fund's
prospectus, as of the date of the Fund's prospectus. Composition of the team may
change  over time,  and Fund  shareholders  and  investors  will be  notified of
changes affecting individuals with primary Fund management responsibility.      

In 2006,  the  Board and the  shareholders  approved  an  amended  and  restated
investment management agreement (the "Investment Management Agreement") for each
of the Funds.  Pursuant to the  Investment  Management  Agreements,  the Advisor
provides  continuing  investment  management  of the  assets  of each  Fund.  In
addition to the  investment  management of the assets of each Fund,  the Advisor
determines the  investments to be made for each Fund,  including what portion of
its assets  remain  uninvested  in cash or cash  equivalents,  and with whom the
orders for investments are placed, consistent with the Fund's policies as stated
in its Prospectus  and SAI, or as adopted by the Fund's Board.  The Advisor will
also monitor,  to the extent not monitored by the Fund's  administrator or other
agent,  the Fund's  compliance  with its investment and tax guidelines and other
compliance policies.                                                            

The Advisor  provides  assistance to the Fund's Board in valuing the  securities
and other  instruments  held by the Fund, to the extent  reasonably  required by
valuation policies and procedures that may be adopted by the Fund.              

Pursuant to the Investment Management  Agreement,  (unless otherwise provided in
the agreement or as  determined by the Fund's Board and to the extent  permitted
by applicable  law), the Advisor pays the  compensation  and expenses of all the
Board  members,  officers,  and executive  employees of the Fund,  including the
Fund's share of payroll taxes, who are affiliated persons of the Advisor.       

The  Investment  Management  Agreement  provides  that  the  Fund  is  generally
responsible  for expenses  that  include:  fees payable to the Advisor;  outside
legal,  accounting  or auditing  expenses,  including  with  respect to expenses
related to negotiation,  acquisition or  distribution of portfolio  investments;
maintenance  of books and records that are  maintained  by the Fund,  the Fund's
custodian,  or other agents of the Fund; taxes and  governmental  fees; fees and
expenses   of  the   Fund's   accounting   agent,   custodian,   sub-custodians,
depositories,  transfer  agents,  dividend  reimbursing  agents and  registrars;
payment  for  portfolio  pricing  or  valuation   services  to  pricing  agents,
accountants,  bankers and other specialists,  if any;  brokerage  commissions or
other costs of  acquiring  or disposing  of any  portfolio  securities  or other
instruments  of the  Fund;  and  litigation  expenses  and  other  extraordinary
expenses not incurred in the ordinary course of the Fund's business.            

The Investment  Management  Agreement  allows the Advisor to delegate any of its
duties under the  Agreement to a  subadvisor,  subject to a majority vote of the
Board of the Fund,  including  a  majority  of the Board who are not  interested
persons of the Fund, and, if required by applicable  law,  subject to a majority
vote of the Fund's shareholders.                                                

The  Investment  Management  Agreement  provides  that the Advisor  shall not be
liable for any error of judgment  or mistake of law or for any loss  suffered by
the Fund in  connection  with matters to which the agreement  relates,  except a
loss resulting from willful  malfeasance,  bad faith or gross  negligence on the
part of the Advisor in the performance of its duties or from reckless  disregard
by the Advisor of its obligations and duties under the agreement. The Investment
Management  Agreement may be terminated at any time, without payment of penalty,
by either party or by vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of
the Fund on 60 days' written notice.                                            

For all services provided under the Investment Management Agreements,  each Fund
pays the Advisor a fee, computed daily and paid monthly, at the annual rate as a
percentage of net assets shown below:

In 2006, the Board and  shareholders  approved a new subadvisor  approval policy
for each Fund (the "Subadvisor Approval Policy"). The Subadvisor Approval Policy
permits the Advisor,  subject to the approval of the Board, including a majority
of its  independent  board members,  to appoint and replace  subadvisors  and to
amend sub-

advisory contracts without obtaining shareholder approval.  Under the Subadvisor
Approval  Policy,  the Board,  including its  independent  board  members,  will
continue to evaluate  and approve  all new  sub-advisory  contracts  between the
Advisor and any subadvisor,  as well as all changes to any existing sub-advisory
contract.  The Fund cannot implement the Subadvisor  Approval Policy without the
SEC either adopting  revisions to current rules (as it proposed to do in October
2003) or granting the Fund exemptive  relief from existing  rules.  The Fund and
the  Advisor  would be  subject to  certain  conditions  imposed by the SEC (and
certain  conditions  that may be imposed in the future within  either  exemptive
relief or a rule) to ensure that the interests of the Fund and its  shareholders
are adequately protected whenever the Advisor acts under the Subadvisor Approval
Policy, including any shareholder notice requirements.                          

Compensation of Portfolio Managers                                              

Each  Fund has been  advised  that the  Advisor  seeks to offer  its  investment
professionals  competitive  short-term  and  long-term  compensation.  Portfolio
managers and research professionals are paid (i) fixed base salaries,  which are
linked to job function,  responsibilities  and financial  services industry peer
comparison  and (ii)  variable  compensation,  which  is  linked  to  investment
performance, individual contributions to the team and DWS Scudder's and Deutsche
Bank's  financial  results.  Variable  compensation  may  include  a cash  bonus
incentive and  participation in a variety of long-term equity programs  (usually
in the form of Deutsche Bank equity).                                           

Bonus  and  long-term   incentives   comprise  a  greater  proportion  of  total
compensation as an investment  professional's  seniority and compensation levels
increase.  Top performing  investment  professionals  earn a total  compensation
package  that is highly  competitive,  including  a bonus that is a multiple  of
their base  salary.  The amount of equity  awarded  under the  long-term  equity
programs is generally based on the individual's total  compensation  package and
may  comprise  from  0%-40%  of  the  total  compensation  award.  As  incentive
compensation increases,  the percentage of compensation awarded in Deutsche Bank
equity also increases. Certain senior investment professionals may be subject to
a mandatory diverting of a portion of their equity compensation into proprietary
mutual funds that they manage.                                                  

To  evaluate  its  investment  professionals,  the  Advisor  uses a  Performance
Management  Process.   Objectives  evaluated  by  the  process  are  related  to
investment  performance and generally take into account peer group and benchmark
related data.  The ultimate goal of this process is to link the  performance  of
investment  professionals  with  client  investment  objectives  and to  deliver
investment   performance   that  meets  or  exceeds  clients'  risk  and  return
objectives. When determining total compensation,  the Advisor considers a number
of quantitative and qualitative factors such as:                                

o        DWS  Scudder   performance   and  the  performance  of  Deutsche  Asset
         Management, quantitative measures which include 1, 3 and 5 year pre-tax
         returns versus benchmark (such as the benchmark used in the prospectus)
         and appropriate  peer group,  taking into  consideration  risk targets.
         Additionally, the portfolio manager's retail/institutional asset mix is
weighted, as appropriate for evaluation purposes.             

o        Qualitative  measures include  adherence to the investment  process and
         individual  contributions  to  the  process,  among  other  things.  In
         addition, the Advisor assesses compliance, risk management and teamwork
skills.                                                       

o        Other factors,  including  contributions made to the investment team as
         well as  adherence  to  compliance,  risk  management,  and "living the
         values" of the Advisor,  are part of a  discretionary  component  which
         gives  management the ability to reward these behaviors on a subjective
basis through bonus incentives.                               

In addition,  the Advisor analyzes  competitive  compensation levels through the
use of extensive market data surveys. Portfolio manager compensation is reviewed
and may be modified each year as appropriate  to reflect  changes in the market,
as well as to adjust the  factors  used to  determine  overall  compensation  to
promote good sustained investment performance.

In  addition  to the  accounts  above,  an  investment  professional  may manage
accounts in a personal  capacity that may include  holdings that are similar to,
or the same as,  those of the Funds.  The  Advisor has in place a Code of Ethics
that is designed to address  conflicts of interest and that, among other things,
imposes  restrictions  on the ability of portfolio  managers  and other  "access
persons" to invest in securities  that may be recommended or traded in the Funds
and other client accounts.                                                      

Real,  potential  or apparent  conflicts  of interest may arise when a portfolio
manager has day-to-day  portfolio  management  responsibilities  with respect to
more than one fund or account, including the following:                         

o        Certain investments may be appropriate for each Fund and also for other
         clients advised by the Advisor, including other client accounts managed
         by each Fund's portfolio management team.  Investment decisions for the
         Fund  and  other  clients  are  made  with a view  to  achieving  their
         respective  investment  objectives  and  after  consideration  of  such
         factors as their current holdings,  availability of cash for investment
         and the size of their investments  generally. A particular security may
         be bought or sold for only one client or in  different  amounts  and at
         different times for more than one but less than all clients.  Likewise,
         because   clients  of  the  Advisor  may  have   differing   investment
         strategies, a particular security may be bought for one or more clients
         when one or more other clients are selling the security. The investment
         results achieved for each Fund may differ from the results achieved for
         other  clients of the Advisor.  In addition,  purchases or sales of the
         same  security  may be made for two or more clients on the same day. In
         such event,  such transactions will be allocated among the clients in a
         manner  believed by the Advisor to be most  equitable  to each  client,
         generally utilizing a pro rata allocation  methodology.  In some cases,
         the allocation  procedure could  potentially  have an adverse effect or
         positive  effect on the price or amount of the securities  purchased or
         sold by each  Fund.  Purchase  and sale  orders  for  each  Fund may be
         combined  with those of other clients of the Advisor in the interest of
         achieving  the most  favorable  net  results to each Fund and the other
clients.                                                      

o        To the  extent  that  a  portfolio  manager  has  responsibilities  for
         managing  multiple client  accounts,  a portfolio  manager will need to
         divide time and attention among relevant accounts. The Advisor attempts
         to minimize these conflicts by aligning its portfolio  management teams
         by  investment  strategy and by  employing  similar  investment  models
across multiple client accounts.                              

o        In some cases, an apparent  conflict may arise where the Advisor has an
         incentive, such as a performance-based fee, in managing one account and
         not with  respect to other  accounts it manages.  The Advisor  will not
         determine  allocations based on whether it receives a performance-based
         fee from the client. Additionally, the Advisor has in place supervisory
         oversight processes to periodically monitor performance  deviations for
accounts with like strategies.                                

o        The Advisor and its affiliates and the investment team of the Funds may
         manage other mutual funds and separate  accounts on a long-short basis.
         The  simultaneous  management  of long  and  short  portfolios  creates
         potential  conflicts  of  interest  including  the risk that short sale
         activity  could   adversely   affect  the  market  value  of  the  long
         positions(and  vice versa),  the risk arising from sequential orders in
         long and short  positions,  and the  risks  associated  with  receiving
         opposing  orders at the same time.  The Advisor has adopted  procedures
         that it believes are reasonably  designed to mitigate  these  potential
         conflicts  of  interest.  Included  in these  procedures  are  specific
         guidelines  developed to ensure fair and  equitable  treatment  for all

26

         clients whose accounts are managed by each Fund's portfolio  management
         team. The Advisor and the portfolio  management  team have  established
         monitoring  procedures,  a protocol for supervisory reviews, as well as
         compliance  oversight  to ensure that  potential  conflicts of interest
relating to this type of activity are properly addressed.     

The Advisor is owned by Deutsche Bank AG, a  multi-national  financial  services
company.  Therefore,  the Advisor is affiliated  with a variety of entities that
provide, and/or engage in commercial banking, insurance,  brokerage,  investment
banking,  financial  advisory,  broker-dealer  activities  (including  sales and
trading),  hedge funds, real estate and private equity investing, in addition to
the provision of investment  management services to institutional and individual
investors.  Since  Deutsche  Bank AG, its  affiliates,  directors,  officers and
employees (the "Firm") are engaged in businesses  and have interests  other than
managing  asset  management  accounts,   such  other  activities  involve  real,
potential or apparent  conflicts of interest.  These  interests  and  activities
include potential  advisory,  transactional  and financial  activities and other
interests  in  securities  and  companies  that may be  directly  or  indirectly
purchased  or sold by the Firm for its  clients'  advisory  accounts.  These are
considerations  of which  advisory  clients  should be aware and which may cause
conflicts that could be to the disadvantage of the Advisor's  advisory  clients.
The Advisor has  instituted  business and  compliance  policies,  procedures and
disclosures  that are  designed to identify,  monitor and mitigate  conflicts of
interest and, as appropriate, to report them to the Fund's Board.               

The Advisor may enter into  arrangements with affiliates and third party service
providers to perform  various  administrative,  back-office  and other  services
relating to client accounts.  Such service providers may be located in the US or
in non-US jurisdictions.                                                        

Codes of Ethics.  The Funds,  the Advisor and the Funds'  principal  underwriter
have each  adopted  codes of ethics  under Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act.  Board
members,  officers of the Trusts and  employees  of the  Advisor  and  principal
underwriter are permitted to make personal  securities  transactions,  including
transactions in securities  that may be purchased or held by the Funds,  subject
to requirements and restrictions set forth in the applicable Code of Ethics. The
Advisor's  Code of Ethics  contains  provisions  and  requirements  designed  to
identify and address certain  conflicts of interest between personal  investment
activities  and the interests of the Funds.  Among other  things,  the Advisor's
Code of Ethics  prohibits  certain types of transactions  absent prior approval,
imposes  time  periods  during which  personal  transactions  may not be made in
certain   securities,   and  requires  the   submission   of  duplicate   broker
confirmations  and quarterly  reporting of securities  transactions.  Additional
restrictions apply to portfolio managers,  traders, research analysts and others
involved  in the  investment  advisory  process.  Exceptions  to these and other
provisions  of the  Advisor's  Code  of  Ethics  may be  granted  in  particular
circumstances after review by appropriate personnel.                            

FUND SERVICE PROVIDERS

Administrator                                                                   

Effective  June 1, 2006,  each Fund entered into a new  administrative  services
agreement with the Advisor (the "Administrative  Services Agreement"),  pursuant
to which the Advisor  provides  administrative  services to the Fund  including,
among others,  providing the Fund with personnel,  preparing and making required
filings on behalf of the Fund,  maintaining  books and records for the Fund, and
monitoring  the  valuation  of Fund  securities.  The  services  provided by the
Advisor are described in more detail below. For all services  provided under the
Administrative  Services  Agreement,  the Fund pays the Advisor a fee,  computed
daily and paid monthly,  of 0.100% of the Fund's  average daily net assets.  For
the fiscal year ended May 31, 2007, the Advisor received an  administrative  fee
of  $892,683  of which  $82,020  was unpaid by the DWS High Yield Tax Free Fund,
$4,005,286 of which  $329,443 is unpaid by the DWS Managed  Municipal Bond Fund,
and  $668,436 of which  $53,924 is unpaid by the DWS  Intermediate  Tax/AMT Free
Fund.                                                                           

Under  the  Administrative  Services  Agreement,  the  Advisor,  acting  as  the
Administrator, is obligated on a continuous basis to provide such administrative
services  as the Board of the Fund  reasonably  deems  necessary  for the proper
administration  of the Fund.  The  Advisor  provides  the Fund  with  personnel;
arranges for the preparation and filing of the Fund's tax returns;  prepares and
submits  reports  and  meeting  materials  to the  Board  and the  shareholders;
prepares and files updates to the Fund's  prospectus and statement of additional
information as well as

negotiates  the  contracts  of and  monitors the  performance  of third  parties
contractors;  oversees the  tabulation  of proxies;  monitors  the  valuation of

dividend  notifications  and provides  information to agents to effect  payments
thereof; provides to the Board periodic and special reports; provides assistance
with investor and public  relations  matters;  and monitors the  registration of
shares under applicable federal and state law. The Advisor also performs certain
fund  accounting  services  under the  Administrative  Services  Agreement.  The
Administrative  Services  Agreement provides that the Advisor will not be liable
under the Administrative Services Agreement except for willful misfeasance,  bad
faith or  negligence  in the  performance  of its  duties  or from the  reckless
disregard by it of its duties and obligations thereunder.                       

Pursuant to an  agreement  between the  Administrator  and State Street Bank and
Trust Company ("SSB"),  the Administrator  has delegated certain  administrative
functions  to SSB. The costs and  expenses of such  delegation  are borne by the
Administrator, not by the Fund.                                                 

Pursuant to DeAM  procedures  approved by the Boards on behalf of the DWS funds,
proof of claim forms are  routinely  filed on behalf of the DWS funds by a third
party service provider,  with certain limited exceptions.  The Boards of the DWS
funds receive periodic reports regarding the implementation of these procedures.

Underwriter                                                                     

Each  Trust,  on behalf of the Funds,  has an  underwriting  agreement  with DWS
Scudder Distributors,  Inc., 222 South Riverside Plaza, Chicago,  Illinois 60606
("DWS-SDI"  or the  "Distributor"),  a  Massachusetts  corporation,  which  is a
subsidiary of the Advisor, a Delaware corporation.  The underwriting  agreement,
dated  September  30, 2002,  will remain in effect until  September 30, 2008 and
from year to year thereafter  only if its continuance is approved  annually by a
majority  of the  members of the Board of  Trustees  who are not parties to such
agreement  or  interested  persons  of any such  party  and  either by vote of a
majority  of the Board of  Trustees  or a  majority  of the  outstanding  voting
securities  of each  Fund.  The  underwriting  agreement  of each  Fund was last
approved by the Trustees on September 18, 2007.                                 

Under its underwriting  agreement,  each Fund is responsible for: the payment of
all fees and expenses in connection with the preparation and filing with the SEC
of its registration  statement and prospectus and any amendments and supplements
thereto;  the registration  and  qualification of shares for sale in the various
states, including registering each Fund as a broker or dealer in various states,
as  required;  the  fees  and  expenses  of  preparing,   printing  and  mailing
prospectuses  annually to existing shareholders (see below for expenses relating

redemptions (unless paid by the shareholder who initiates the transaction);  the
cost of printing and postage of business reply  envelopes;  and a portion of the
cost of computer terminals used by both the Funds and the Distributor.          

The Distributor will pay for printing and  distributing  prospectuses or reports
prepared for its use in  connection  with the offering of each Fund's  shares to
the  public  and  preparing,  printing  and  mailing  any  other  literature  or
advertising  in  connection  with the  offering  of  shares  of each Fund to the
public.  The  Distributor  will pay all fees and expenses in connection with its
qualification  and  registration  as a broker or dealer under  federal and state
laws,  a portion of the cost of  toll-free  telephone  service  and  expenses of
shareholder  service  representatives,   a  portion  of  the  cost  of  computer
terminals, and expenses of any activity which is primarily intended to result in
the sale of shares  issued by each  Fund,  unless a Rule 12b-1 Plan is in effect
which provides that a Fund shall bear some or all of such expenses.

Although this Class of the Funds does not currently  have a 12b-1 Plan,  and the
Trustees  have no current  intention of adopting  one for this Class,  each Fund
will also pay those  fees and  expenses  permitted  to be paid or assumed by the
Trust  pursuant to a 12b-1 Plan, if any,  adopted by the Trust,  notwithstanding
any other provision to the contrary in the underwriting agreement.              

The Distributor  currently  offers shares of each Fund on a continuous  basis to
investors  in all  states in which  shares of each Fund may from time to time be
registered or where  permitted by  applicable  law. The  underwriting  agreement
provides that the Distributor accepts orders for shares at net asset value as no
sales commission or load is charged to the investor. the Distributor has made no
firm commitment to acquire shares of each Fund.

State Street Bank and Trust  Company,  (the  "Custodian")  225 Franklin  Street,

be reduced by certain earnings credits in favor of each Fund.  Custodian fees of
$177,  $271 and $428  were not  imposed  on DWS High  Yield Tax Free  Fund,  DWS
Managed   Municipal   Bond  Fund  and  DWS   Intermediate   Tax/AMT  Free  Fund,
respectively, after these credits were applied for the fiscal year ended May 31,
2007.                                                                           

DWS Scudder  Investments  Service Company  ("DWS-SISC" or the "Transfer Agent"),
210 W. 10th  Street,  Kansas  City,  Missouri 64105-1614,  an  affiliate of the
Advisor,  is the transfer agent,  dividend-paying  agent and shareholder service
agent for all classes of each Fund.                                             

Each Fund, or the Advisor (including any affiliate of the Advisor), or both, may
pay   unaffiliated   third  parties  for  providing   recordkeeping   and  other
administrative  services with respect to beneficial  owners of Fund shares whose
interests are generally held in an omnibus account.                             

The Transfer  Agent receives an annual service fee for each account of the Fund,
based on the type of account.  For open retail  accounts,  the fee is a flat fee
ranging from $20.00 to $27.50 per account,  for open  wholesale  money funds the
fee is $32.50 per account, while for certain retirement accounts serviced on the
recordkeeping system of ADP, Inc., the fee is a flat fee up to $3.46 per account
(as of October  2006,  indexed to  inflation)  plus an asset  based fee of up to
0.25% of  average  net  assets.  1/12th of the  annual  service  charge for each

information  must be retained on the Transfer Agent's system for up to 18 months
after closing for tax reporting purposes.

Certain  out-of-pocket  expenses  incurred  by  the  Transfer  Agent,  including
expenses of printing and mailing  routine fund  disclosure  documents,  costs of
record retention and transaction  processing costs are reimbursed by the Fund or
are paid  directly  by the  Fund.  Certain  additional  out-of-pocket  expenses,
including costs of computer  hardware and software,  third party  record-keeping
and processing of proxy statements,  may only be reimbursed by the Fund with the
prior approval of the Fund's Board.                                             

Effective April 1, 2007, DWS Scudder Investments Service Company is the Transfer

Systems,  Inc.  ("DST"),  DWS-SISC  had  delegated  certain  transfer  agent and
dividend  paying  agent  functions  to  DST.  The  costs  and  expenses  of such
delegation are born by DWS-SISC, not by a Fund.                                 

Regulatory Matters and Legal Proceedings                                        

On December 21, 2006,  Deutsche Asset Management  ("DeAM")  settled  proceedings
with the  Securities and Exchange  Commission  ("SEC") and the New York Attorney
General on behalf of Deutsche  Asset  Management,  Inc.  ("DAMI") and DIMA,  the
investment advisors to many of the DWS Scudder funds,  regarding  allegations of
improper  trading of fund  shares at DeAM and at the legacy  Scudder  and Kemper
organizations prior to their acquisition by DeAM in April 2002. These regulators
alleged that although the prospectuses for certain funds in the regulators' view
indicated  that the funds did not permit market  timing,  DAMI and DIMA breached
their  fiduciary  duty to those  funds in that their  efforts  to limit  trading
activity in the funds were not effective at certain times.  The regulators  also
alleged that DAMI and DIMA  breached  their  fiduciary  duty to certain funds by
entering into certain market timing  arrangements with investors.  These trading
arrangements  originated  in  businesses  that  existed  prior to the  currently
constituted  DeAM  organization,  which  came  together  as a result of  various
mergers of the legacy Scudder,  Kemper and Deutsche fund groups,  and all of the
arrangements were terminated prior to the start of the regulatory investigations
that  began in the summer of 2003.  No  current  DeAM  employee  approved  these
trading arrangements.  Under the terms of the settlements, DAMI and DIMA neither
admitted nor denied any wrongdoing.                                             

The terms of the SEC settlement, which identified improper trading in the legacy
Deutsche and Kemper mutual funds only,  provide for payment of  disgorgement  in
the  amount  of $17.2  million.  The terms of the  settlement  with the New York
Attorney  General  provide for payment of  disgorgement  in the amount of $102.3
million, which is inclusive of the amount payable under the SEC settlement, plus
a civil penalty in the amount of $20 million.  The total amount payable by DeAM,
approximately  $122.3 million,  will be distributed to funds and/or shareholders
of the affected funds in accordance with a distribution  plan to be developed by
a distribution  consultant.  The funds' investment advisors do not believe these
amounts  will have a material  adverse  financial  impact on them or  materially
affect their ability to perform  under their  investment  management  agreements
with the DWS funds.  The  above-described  amounts are not  material to Deutsche
Bank, and have already been reserved.                                           

Among the terms of the settled orders,  DeAM is subject to certain  undertakings
regarding  the conduct of its business in the future,  including  formation of a
Code of Ethics  Oversight  Committee  to oversee all matters  relating to issues
arising  under  the  advisors'  Code of  Ethics;  establishment  of an  Internal
Compliance Controls Committee having overall compliance oversight responsibility
of the advisors; engagement of an Independent Compliance Consultant to conduct a
comprehensive review of the advisors' supervisory  compliance and other policies
and  procedures  designed to prevent  and detect  breaches  of  fiduciary  duty,
breaches  of the Code of Ethics and federal  securities  law  violations  by the
advisors and their employees; and commencing in 2008, the advisors shall undergo
a compliance review by an independent third party.                              

In addition,  DeAM is subject to certain  further  undertakings  relating to the
governance  of the mutual funds,  including  that at least 75% of the members of
the  Boards  of  Trustees/Directors  overseeing  the DWS  Funds  continue  to be
independent of DeAM; the Chairmen of the DWS Funds' Boards of Trustees/Directors
continue to be  independent  of DeAM;  DeAM  maintain  existing  management  fee
reductions  for  certain  funds  for a period  of five  years  and not  increase
management  fees for these certain funds during this period;  the funds retain a
senior  officer (or  independent  consultants,  as applicable)  responsible  for
assisting in the review of fee  arrangements  and  monitoring  compliance by the
funds and the investment advisors with securities laws,  fiduciary duties, codes
of

ethics and other  compliance  policies,  the  expense of which shall be borne by
DeAM; and periodic account  statements,  fund prospectuses and the mutual funds'
web site contain  additional  disclosure  and/or tools that assist  investors in
understanding  the fees and costs associated with an investment in the funds and
the impact of fees and expenses on fund returns.                                

DeAM has also settled proceedings with the Illinois Secretary of State regarding
market timing matters. The terms of the Illinois settlement provide for investor
education  contributions  totaling approximately $4 million and a payment in the
amount of $2 million to the Securities Audit and Enforcement Fund.              

On  September  28,  2006,  the SEC and the National  Association  of  Securities
Dealers  ("NASD")  announced  final  agreements  in  which  Deutsche  Investment
Management Americas Inc. ("DIMA"),  Deutsche Asset Management, Inc. ("DAMI") and
Scudder  Distributors,  Inc. ("DWS-SDI") (now known as DWS Scudder Distributors,
Inc.)  settled  administrative  proceedings  regarding  disclosure  of brokerage
allocation  practices in connection  with sales of the Scudder Funds' (now known
as the DWS Scudder Funds) shares during  2001-2003.  The agreements with the SEC
and NASD are reflected in orders which state, among other things,  that DIMA and
DAMI failed to disclose potential conflicts of interest to the funds' Boards and
to  shareholders   relating  to  DWS-SDI's  use  of  certain  funds'   brokerage
commissions to reduce revenue sharing costs to broker-dealer  firms with whom it
had  arrangements to market and distribute  Scudder Fund shares.  These directed
brokerage practices were discontinued in October 2003.                          

Under the terms of the  settlements,  in which DIMA,  DAMI and  DWS-SDI  neither
admitted  nor denied any of the  regulators'  findings,  DIMA,  DAMI and DWS-SDI
agreed to pay  disgorgement,  prejudgment  interest  and civil  penalties in the
total amount of $19.3 million. The portion of the settlements distributed to the
funds was approximately $17.8 million and was paid to the funds as prescribed by
the settlement  orders based upon the amount of brokerage  commissions from each
fund used to satisfy revenue sharing  agreements  with  broker-dealers  who sold
fund shares.                                                                    

As part of the  settlements,  DIMA,  DAMI and DWS-SDI  also agreed to  implement
certain measures and undertakings relating to revenue sharing payments including
making  additional  disclosures  in the funds'  Prospectuses  or  Statements  of
Additional  Information,  adopting or modifying relevant policies and procedures
and providing regular reporting to the fund Boards.                             

Additional  information announced by DeAM regarding the terms of the settlements
is available at www.dws-scudder.com/regulatory_settlements.                     

The matters alleged in the regulatory  settlements described above also serve as
the general basis of a number of private class action lawsuits involving the DWS
funds. These lawsuits name as defendants various persons,  including certain DWS
funds,  the  funds'  investment  advisors  and  their  affiliates,  and  certain
individuals,  including  in some cases fund  Trustees/Directors,  officers,  and
other parties.  Each DWS fund's  investment  advisor has agreed to indemnify the
applicable  DWS funds in connection  with these  lawsuits,  or other lawsuits or
regulatory actions that may be filed making similar allegations.                

Based on currently available information, the funds' investment advisors believe
the likelihood that the pending lawsuits will have a material adverse  financial
impact on a DWS fund is remote and such  actions  are not  likely to  materially
affect their ability to perform  under their  investment  management  agreements
with the DWS funds.                                                             

PORTFOLIO TRANSACTIONS

The Advisor is generally responsible for placing the orders for the purchase and
sale of portfolio  securities,  including  the  allocation  of  brokerage.  With
respect to those  funds for which a  sub-investment  advisor  manages the fund's
investments,  references in this section to the "Advisor" should be read to mean
the Sub-Advisor, except as noted below.                                         

The  policy of the  Advisor  in  placing  orders  for the  purchase  and sale of
securities  for the Funds is to seek best  execution,  taking into  account such
factors,   among  others,   as  price;   commission  (where   applicable);   the
broker-

dealer's ability to ensure that securities will be delivered on settlement date;
the willingness of the broker-dealer to commit its capital and purchase a thinly
traded security for its own inventory;  whether the broker-dealer specializes in
block  orders or large  program  trades;  the  broker-dealer's  knowledge of the
market   and   the   security;   the   broker-dealer's   ability   to   maintain
confidentiality;  the financial condition of the broker-dealer;  and whether the
broker-dealer has the infrastructure and operational capabilities to execute and
settle the trade.  The Advisor seeks to evaluate the overall  reasonableness  of
brokerage  commissions with commissions  charged on comparable  transactions and
compares  the  brokerage  commissions  (if any)  paid by the  Funds to  reported
commissions paid by others.  The Advisor  routinely  reviews  commission  rates,
execution and  settlement  services  performed  and makes  internal and external
comparisons.                                                                    

Commission  rates  on  transactions  in  equity  securities  on U.S.  securities
exchanges are subject to negotiation. Commission rates on transactions in equity
securities on foreign  securities  exchanges are generally fixed.  Purchases and
sales of  fixed-income  securities and certain  over-the-counter  securities are
effected  on  a  net  basis,  without  the  payment  of  brokerage  commissions.
Transactions  in  fixed  income  and  certain  over-the-counter  securities  are
generally  placed by the  Advisor  with the  principal  market  makers for these
securities  unless the Advisor  reasonably  believes more favorable  results are
available elsewhere.  Transactions with dealers serving as market makers reflect
the spread between the bid and asked prices.  Purchases of  underwritten  issues
will  include  an  underwriting  fee  paid  to  the  underwriter.  Money  market
instruments are normally purchased in principal  transactions  directly from the
issuer or from an underwriter or market maker.                                  

It is  likely  that the  broker-dealers  selected  based  on the  considerations
described in this section will include  firms that also sell shares of the Funds
to their  customers.  However,  the Advisor does not consider sales of shares of
the Funds as a factor in the selection of  broker-dealers  to execute  portfolio
transactions  for the Funds  and,  accordingly,  has  implemented  policies  and
procedures  reasonably designed to prevent its traders from considering sales of
shares of the Funds as a factor in the  selection of  broker-dealers  to execute
portfolio transactions for the Funds.                                           

The Advisor is  permitted  by Section  28(e) of the  Securities  Exchange Act of
1934, as amended ("1934 Act"), when placing  portfolio  transactions for a Fund,
to cause the Fund to pay brokerage  commissions  in excess of that which another
broker-dealer might charge for executing the same transaction in order to obtain
research and brokerage  services if the Advisor determines that such commissions
are  reasonable in relation to the overall  services  provided.  The Advisor may
from  time to time,  in  reliance  on  Section  28(e) of the 1934  Act,  execute
portfolio  transactions with  broker-dealers that provide research and brokerage
services to the Advisor.  Consistent  with the Advisor's  policy  regarding best
execution,  where more than one broker is  believed  to be capable of  providing
best execution for a particular  trade, the Advisor may take into  consideration
the receipt of research and brokerage services in selecting the broker-dealer to
execute  the trade.  Although  certain  research  and  brokerage  services  from
broker-dealers may be useful to a Fund and to the Advisor,  it is the opinion of
the Advisor that such information only supplements its own research effort since
the  information  must still be analyzed,  weighed and reviewed by the Advisor's
staff.  Research and brokerage  services  received from a  broker-dealer  may be
useful to the  Advisor in  providing  services  to  clients  other than the Fund
making  the  trade,  and not all  such  information  is used by the  Advisor  in
connection with such Fund. Conversely,  such information provided to the Advisor
by  broker-dealers  through which other clients of the Advisor effect securities
transactions may be useful to the Advisor in providing services to a Fund.      

Research and brokerage services provided by broker-dealers may include,  but are
not limited to,  information on the economy,  industries,  groups of securities,
individual   companies,   statistical   information,   accounting  and  tax  law
interpretations,  political developments, legal developments affecting portfolio
securities,  technical  market action,  pricing and appraisal  services,  credit
analysis,  risk measurement  analysis,  performance analysis and measurement and
analysis of corporate responsibility issues. Research and brokerage services are
typically  received  in the  form of  written  reports,  access  to  specialized
financial  publications,  and personal meetings with security analysts,  but may
also be provided in the form of access to various computer software and meetings
arranged with corporate and industry representatives.                           

The Advisor may also select  broker-dealers  and obtain from them  research  and
brokerage  services that are used in connection  with executing  trades provided
that such services are consistent  with  interpretations  under Section 28(e) of
the 1934 Act.  Typically,  these  services  take the form of  computer  software
and/or  electronic  communication  services  used by the  Advisor to  facilitate
trading activity with those broker-dealers.

Research and brokerage services may include products obtained from third parties
if the Advisor determines that such product or service constitutes brokerage and
research as defined in Section 28(e) and interpretations thereunder.  Currently,
it  is  the  Advisor's  policy  that  Sub-Advisors  may  not  execute  portfolio
transactions on behalf of the Funds to obtain third party research and brokerage
services.  The  Advisor  may, in the future,  change  this  policy.  Regardless,
certain  Sub-Advisors may, as matter of internal policy, limit or preclude third
party research and brokerage services.                                          

DIMA will  monitor  regulatory  developments  and market  practice in the use of
client  commissions to obtain research and brokerage services and may adjust its
portfolio transactions policies in response thereto.                            

Investment  decisions for each Fund and for other investment accounts managed by
the  Advisor  are  made  independently  of each  other  in  light  of  differing
conditions. However, the same investment decision may be made for two or more of
such accounts. In such cases,  simultaneous  transactions are inevitable. To the
extent  permitted by law, the Advisor may aggregate the securities to be sold or
purchased  for a Fund with those to be sold or purchased  for other  accounts in
executing  transactions.  Purchases  or sales are then  averaged as to price and
commission  and  allocated  as to amount in a manner  deemed  equitable  to each
account.  While in some cases this practice  could have a detrimental  effect on
the price  paid or  received  by,  or on the size of the  position  obtained  or
disposed of for,  the Fund,  in other  cases it is believed  that the ability to
engage in volume transactions will be beneficial to the Fund.                   

DIMA and its affiliates and the Funds' management team manage other mutual funds
and separate accounts,  some of which use short sales of securities as a part of
its  investment  strategy.  The  simultaneous   management  of  long  and  short
portfolios creates potential conflicts of interest including the risk that short
sale activity could adversely affect the market value of the long positions (and
vice  versa),  the  risk  arising  from  sequential  orders  in long  and  short
positions,  and the risks associated with receiving  opposing orders at the same
time.                                                                           

DIMA has adopted procedures that it believes are reasonably designed to mitigate
these  potential  conflicts  of interest.  Incorporated  in the  procedures  are
specific  guidelines  developed to ensure fair and  equitable  treatment for all
clients. DIMA and the investment team have established monitoring procedures and
a protocol for supervisory  reviews,  as well as compliance  oversight to ensure
that  potential  conflicts  of interest  relating  to this type of activity  are
properly addressed.                                                             

Deutsche Bank AG or one of its affiliates (or in the case of a Sub-Advisor,  the
Sub-Advisor  or one of its  affiliates)  may act as a broker  for the  Funds and
receive brokerage commissions or other transaction-related compensation from the
Funds in the purchase and sale of securities, options or futures contracts when,
in the judgment of the Advisor,  and in accordance with  procedures  approved by
the Funds'  Boards,  the  affiliated  broker  will be able to obtain a price and
execution at least as favorable as those obtained from other  qualified  brokers
and if, in the  transaction,  the  affiliated  broker  charges  the Funds a rate
consistent  with that charged to  comparable  unaffiliated  customers in similar
transactions.                                                                   

The following shows total brokerage  commissions  paid for the past three fiscal
years:                                                                          

DWS High Yield Tax Free Fund: For the fiscal years ended May 31, 2007,  2006 and
2005, the Fund paid $0, $0 and $10,314 in commissions, respectively.            

DWS Managed  Municipal Bond Fund: For the fiscal years ended May 31, 2007,  2006
and 2005, the Fund paid $0, $2,448 and $70,452 in commissions, respectively.    

DWS  Intermediate  Tax/AMT  Free Fund:  For the fiscal years ended May 31, 2007,
2006 and 2005, the Fund paid $0, $0 and $6,858 in commissions, respectively.    

The Funds did not pay any affiliated  brokerage  commissions for the fiscal year
ended May 31, 2007.

Each Fund is required to identify  any  securities  of its  "regular  brokers or
dealers" (as such term is defined in the 1940 Act) that the Funds have  acquired
during the most recent fiscal year.  As of May 31, 2007,  the Funds did not hold
any securities of their regular broker dealers.                                 

Portfolio Turnover                                                              

Portfolio  turnover  rate is  defined  by the SEC as the ratio of the  lesser of
sales or purchases to the monthly average value of such securities  owned during
the year,  excluding all securities  whose  remaining  maturities at the time of
acquisition were one year or less.                                              

Higher levels of activity by a Fund result in higher  transaction  costs and may
also  result  in  taxes on  realized  capital  gains  to be borne by the  Fund's
shareholders.  Purchases and sales are made whenever necessary, in the Advisor's
discretion, to meet a Fund's objective.                                         

Portfolio turnover rates for the two most recent fiscal years are as follows:   

                                      2007                    2006
                                      ----                    ----

DWS High Yield Tax Free Fund                 57%                     43%        
DWS Managed Municipal Bond Fund              19%                     28%        
DWS Intermediate Tax/AMT Free Fund           45%                     41%        

 PURCHASE AND REDEMPTION OF SHARES

General Information                                                             

Policies and procedures affecting  transactions in Fund shares can be changed at
any  time  without  notice,  subject  to  applicable  law.  Transactions  may be
contingent  upon proper  completion of application  forms and other documents by
shareholders  and their  receipt by the  Fund's  agents.  Transaction  delays in
processing (and changing account features) due to circumstances within or beyond
the  control  of the Fund and its  agents  may  occur.  Shareholders  (or  their
financial  service firms) are responsible for all losses and fees resulting from
bad checks,  cancelled orders or the failure to consummate transactions effected
pursuant to instructions reasonably believed to be genuine.                     

A  distribution  will be  reinvested in shares of the same Fund and class if the
distribution check is returned as undeliverable.                                

Information  regarding  tax-deferred  retirement  plans is not applicable to the
Funds.                                                                          

Orders  will be  confirmed  at a price  based on the net asset value of the Fund
next determined after receipt in good order by DWS-SDI of the order  accompanied
by payment.  Orders received by dealers or other financial  services firms prior
to the  determination  of net asset value and  received in good order by DWS-SDI
prior to the determination of net asset value will be confirmed at a price based
on the net asset value next determined after receipt by DWS-SDI ("trade date"). 

Additional  Minimum  Balance  Policies.  For  fiduciary  accounts and  custodial
accounts such as Uniform Gifts to Minors Act and Uniform Transfers to Minors Act
accounts,  the minimum  balance is $1,000 for Class S. A shareholder may open an
account  with at least  $1,000 ($500 for  fiduciary/custodial  accounts),  if an
automatic  investment  plan (AIP) of $50 per month is  established.  DWS Scudder
group  retirement  plans and certain  other DWS  accounts  have similar or lower
minimum share balance requirements.                                             

Reductions in value that result solely from market  activity will not trigger an
involuntary  redemption.  Shareholders with a combined household account balance
in any of the DWS Funds of $100,000  or more,  as well as group  retirement  and
certain other accounts, will not be subject to a fee or automatic redemption.   

34

P-->497321st Page of 358TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 321st
Fiduciary  (e.g., IRA or Roth IRA) and custodial  accounts (e.g.,  UGMA or UTMA)
with balances below $100 are subject to automatic  redemption following 60 days'
written notice to applicable shareholders.                                      

Certificates. Share certificates will not be issued. Share certificates now in a
shareholder's  possession may be sent to the Transfer Agent for cancellation and
book-entry  credit to such  shareholder's  account.  Certain telephone and other
procedures   require   book-entry   holdings.   Shareholders   with  outstanding
certificates bear the risk of loss.                                             

Use of Financial  Services  Firms.  Investment  dealers and other firms  provide
varying  arrangements  for their clients to purchase and redeem a Fund's shares,
including higher minimum investments,  and may assess transaction or other fees.
Firms may arrange  with their  clients for other  investment  or  administrative
services.  Such firms may independently  establish and charge additional amounts
to their  clients  for such  services.  Firms  also may hold a Fund's  shares in
nominee or street  name as agent for and on behalf of their  customers.  In such
instances, a Fund's transfer agent, DWS Scudder Investments Service Company (the
"Transfer  Agent") will have no information  with respect to or control over the
accounts of specific shareholders.  Such shareholders may obtain access to their
accounts and information  about their accounts only from their firm.  Certain of
these firms may receive compensation from a Fund through the Shareholder Service
Agent for  record-keeping and other expenses relating to these nominee accounts.
In addition,  certain  privileges with respect to the purchase and redemption of
shares or the reinvestment of dividends may not be available through such firms.
Some firms may  participate in a program  allowing them access to their clients'
accounts for servicing including, without limitation,  transfers of registration
and dividend  payee  changes;  and may perform  functions  such as generation of
confirmation  statements  and  disbursement  of  cash  dividends.   Such  firms,
including affiliates of DWS Scudder Distributors, Inc., may receive compensation
from a Fund through the Shareholder Service Agent for these services.           

The Fund has authorized one or more financial  service  institutions,  including
certain members of the Financial Industry  Regulatory  Authority ("FINRA") other
than  the  Distributor  ("financial  institutions"),   to  accept  purchase  and
redemption  orders for the Fund's shares.  Such financial  institutions may also
designate other parties, including plan administrator intermediaries,  to accept
purchase and  redemption  orders on the Fund's  behalf.  Orders for purchases or
redemptions will be deemed to have been received by the Fund when such financial
institutions or, if applicable,  their  authorized  designees accept the orders.
Subject  to the  terms  of the  contract  between  the  Fund  and the  financial
institution, ordinarily orders will be priced at the Fund's net asset value next
computed  after  acceptance  by such  financial  institution  or its  authorized
designees and accepted by the Fund.  Further, if purchases or redemptions of the
Fund's  shares are arranged and  settlement  is made at an  investor's  election
through any other authorized financial  institution,  that financial institution
may,  at  its  discretion,   charge  a  fee  for  that  service.  The  Board  of
Trustees/Directors  and the Distributor,  also the Fund's principal underwriter,
each has the right to limit the  amount of  purchases  by, and to refuse to sell
to, any  person.  The  Trustees/Directors  and the  Distributor  may  suspend or
terminate the offering of shares of the Fund at any time for any reason.        

DWS-SDI has adopted an Incentive Plan (the "Plan") covering wholesalers that are
regional vice presidents  ("DWS Scudder  Wholesalers").  Generally,  DWS Scudder
Wholesalers  market shares of the DWS funds to your  financial  advisor,  who in
turn may  recommend  that you  purchase  shares  of a DWS  fund.  The Plan is an
incentive program that combines a monthly  incentive  component with a quarterly
strategic bonus component.  Under the Plan, DWS Scudder Wholesalers will receive
a monetary  monthly  incentive based on the amount of sales generated from their
marketing of the funds,  and that incentive will differ depending on the product
category  of  the  fund.   Each  fund  is  assigned  to  one  of  four   product
categories--"Core," "Strategic," "Satellite"   or   "Non-CSS"-taking   into
consideration, among other things, the following criteria, where applicable:    

o        The Fund's 3-year performance;                                         
o        The Fund's Morningstar rating;                                         
o        Market size for the fund category;                                     
o        The Fund's size, including sales and redemptions of the Fund's shares; 
o        The length of time the Fund's Portfolio Managers have managed the Fund;
and                                                           
o        The Fund's consistency with DWS Scudder's branding.                    

35

P-->497322nd Page of 358TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 322nd
This  information  and other factors are  presented to a committee  comprised of
representatives  from  various  groups  within  DWS  Scudder,  who  review  on a
quarterly basis the funds assigned to each product category described above, and
make any  changes to those  assignments  at that time.  No one  factor,  whether
positive or negative,  determines a fund's  placement in a given  category;  all
these factors together are considered, and the designation of funds in the Core,
Strategic and Satellite categories represents management's judgment based on the
above criteria.  In addition,  management may consider a fund's profile over the
course  of  several  review  periods  before  making  a change  to its  category
assignment.  These  category  assignments  will be posted  quarterly  to the DWS
funds' Web site at www.dws-scudder.com, approximately one month after the end of
each quarter.  DWS Scudder Wholesalers will receive the highest compensation for
Core and Strategic  funds,  less for Satellite  funds and the lowest for Non-CSS
funds.                                                                          

In the normal course of business,  DWS Scudder will from time to time  introduce
new funds into the DWS family of funds. As a general rule, all new funds will be
placed in the  Strategic  compensation  category  for a  minimum  period of four
consecutive quarters, and DWS Scudder Wholesalers will be paid at a rate that is
equivalent to that of the Core Fund  category.  After that four quarter  period,
each new fund in the  Strategic  category  will be reviewed by the committee and
either  assigned to one of the four  categories or continued as a Strategic fund
at that time.                                                                   

The prospect of receiving,  or the receipt of, additional  compensation by a DWS
Scudder  Wholesaler  under the Plan may provide an incentive to favor  marketing
the Core,  Strategic  or  Satellite  funds  over the  Non-CSS  funds.  The Plan,
however,  will not change  the price that you pay for shares of a fund.  The DWS
Scudder  Compliance  Department  monitors DWS Scudder Wholesaler sales and other
activity  in an  effort  to  detect  unusual  activity  in  the  context  of the
compensation  structure under the Plan. However,  investors may wish to take the
Plan  and the  product  category  of the  fund  into  account  when  considering
purchasing a fund or evaluating any recommendations relating to fund shares.    

Telephone  and  Electronic  Transaction  Procedures.  Shareholders  have various
telephone,  Internet, wire and other electronic privileges available.  Each Fund
or its agents will not be liable for any losses,  expenses or costs  arising out
of fraudulent or unauthorized  instructions pursuant to these privileges if that
Fund or its  agents  reasonably  believe,  based  upon  reasonable  verification
procedures, that the instructions were genuine.  Verification procedures include
recording instructions,  requiring certain identifying information before acting
upon instructions and sending written  confirmations.  During periods when it is
difficult to contact the  Shareholder  Service Agent, it may be difficult to use
telephone, wire and other privileges.                                           

QuickBuy and QuickSell. QuickBuy and QuickSell permits the transfer of money via
the Automated  Clearing House System (minimum $50 and maximum  $250,000) from or
to a shareholder's bank, savings and loan, or credit union account in connection
with the purchase or  redemption  of Fund shares.  Shares  purchased by check or
through  QuickBuy and QuickSell or Direct Deposit may not be redeemed under this
privilege  until  such  shares  have been owned for at least 10  calendar  days.
QuickBuy and QuickSell cannot be used with passbook savings accounts.           

Dividend  Payment  Option.   Investors  may  have  dividends  and  distributions
automatically   deposited  to  their  predesignated  bank  account  through  DWS
Scudder's Dividend Payment Option request form. Shareholders whose predesignated
checking  account of record is with a member bank of  Automated  Clearing  House
Network  (ACH) can have  income and  capital  gain  distributions  automatically
deposited to their  personal  bank account  usually  within three  business days
after a Fund pays its  distribution.  A Dividend Payment Option request form can
be  obtained  by  visiting  our Web  site  at:  www.dws-scudder.com  or  calling
1-800-728-3337.  Confirmation  Statements  will be  mailed  to  shareholders  as
notification that distributions have been deposited.                            

Purchases                                                                       

Each Fund reserves the right to withdraw all or any part of the offering made by
its prospectus and to reject purchase orders for any reason.  Also, from time to
time, a Fund may temporarily  suspend the offering of any class of its shares to
new  investors.  During the period of such  suspension,  persons who are already
shareholders of such class of such Fund may be permitted to continue to purchase
additional shares of such class and to have dividends reinvested.

To help the  government  fight the  funding of  terrorism  and money  laundering
activities,  federal law requires all financial  institutions to obtain,  verify
and record  information  that identifies  each person who opens an account.  For
more  information,  please  see  "Policies  You Should  Know  About" in the fund
prospectus.                                                                     

Eligible Class S Investors                                                      

A.        The  following  investors  may  purchase  Class S shares  of DWS Funds

Revenue Sharing                                                                 

In light of recent  regulatory  developments,  the Advisor,  the Distributor and
their affiliates have undertaken to furnish certain additional information below
regarding  the  level  of  payments  made  by them to  selected  affiliated  and
unaffiliated  brokers,  dealers,  participating  insurance  companies  or  other
financial  intermediaries  ("financial  advisors") in  connection  with the sale
and/or  distribution  of  Fund  shares  or the  retention  and/or  servicing  of
investors and Fund shares ("revenue sharing").                                  

The  Advisor,  the  Distributor  and/or  their  affiliates  may  pay  additional
compensation,  out of their own  assets and not as an  additional  charge to the
Fund, to financial  advisors in connection with the sale and/or  distribution of
Fund shares or the retention and/or servicing of Fund investors and Fund shares.
Such revenue  sharing  payments are in addition to any  distribution  or service
fees  payable  under any Rule  12b-1 or  service  plan of any fund,  any  record
keeping/sub-transfer  agency/networking  fees  payable  by the  Fund  (generally
through the  Distributor  or an  affiliate)  and/or the  Distributor  to certain
financial   advisors  for  performing  such  services  and  any  sales  charges,
commissions,   non-cash  compensation  arrangements  expressly  permitted  under
applicable rules of the FINRA or other concessions described in the fee table or
elsewhere in the  Prospectuses or the SAI as payable to all financial  advisors.
For example, the Advisor, the Distributor and/or their affiliates may compensate
financial  advisors  for  providing  the Fund with "shelf  space" or access to a
third  party  platform  or fund  offering  list,  or  other  marketing  programs
including, without limitation, inclusion of the Fund on preferred or recommended
sales  lists,  mutual  fund  "supermarket"  platforms  and  other  formal  sales
programs;  granting the  Distributor  access to the  financial  advisor's  sales
force;  granting the Distributor access to the financial  advisor's  conferences
and meetings;  assistance  in training and  educating  the  financial  advisor's
personnel; and, obtaining other forms of marketing support. The level of revenue
sharing payments made to financial advisors may be a fixed fee or based upon one
or more of the following factors:  gross sales,  current assets and/or number of
accounts of the Fund attributable to the financial advisor,  the particular fund
or fund type or other  measures  as agreed to by the  Advisor,  the  Distributor
and/or their affiliates and the financial  advisors or any combination  thereof.
The amount of these payments is determined at the discretion of the Advisor, the
Distributor  and/or their affiliates from time to time, may be substantial,  and
may be different for different  financial  advisors  based on, for example,  the
nature of the services provided by the financial advisor.                       

The Advisor,  the  Distributor  and/or their  affiliates  currently make revenue
sharing  payments  from  their own  assets in  connection  with the sale  and/or
distribution of DWS Fund shares, or the retention and/or servicing of investors,
to financial  advisors in amounts that  generally  range from .01% up to .50% of
assets of the Fund serviced and  maintained by the  financial  advisor,  .10% to
..25% of sales of the Fund attributable to the financial  advisor, a flat fee of
$12,500 up to $500,000, or any combination thereof. These amounts are subject to
change  at  the  discretion  of  the  Advisor,   the  Distributor  and/or  their
affiliates.   Receipt  of,  or  the  prospect  of  receiving,   this  additional
compensation, may influence your financial advisor's recommendation of this Fund
or of any  particular  share class of the Fund. You should review your financial
advisor's  compensation  disclosure  and/or  talk to your  financial  advisor to
obtain  more  information  on how this  compensation  may have  influenced  your
financial advisor's recommendation of this Fund.

The Advisor,  the Distributor and/or their affiliates may also make such revenue
sharing  payments  to  financial  advisors  under the terms  discussed  above in
connection  with  the  distribution  of both  DWS  funds  and  non-DWS  funds by
financial  advisors to retirement plans that obtain record keeping services from
ADP, Inc. on the DWS Scudder branded  retirement plan platform (the  "Platform")
with the level of revenue  sharing  payments  being based upon sales of both the
DWS funds and the  non-DWS  funds by the  financial  advisor on the  Platform or
current  assets  of both  the DWS  funds  and the  non-DWS  funds  serviced  and
maintained by the financial advisor on the Platform.

Any additions,  modifications or deletions to the financial advisors  identified
above that have occurred since the date hereof are not reflected.               

The Advisor,  the  Distributor  or their  affiliates  may enter into  additional
revenue sharing arrangements or change or discontinue existing arrangements with
financial advisors at any time without notice.                                  

The  prospect  of  receiving,  or the  receipt  of  additional  compensation  or
promotional  incentives  described above by financial  advisors may provide such
financial advisors and/or their salespersons with an incentive to favor sales of
shares of the DWS Funds or a particular  DWS Fund over sales of shares of mutual
funds (or  non-mutual  fund  investments)  with  respect to which the  financial
advisor does not receive additional compensation or promotional  incentives,  or
receives  lower levels of additional  compensation  or  promotional  incentives.
Similarly,  financial advisors may receive different  compensation or incentives
that may influence  their  recommendation  of any particular  share class of the
Fund or of other funds. These payment arrangements, however, will not change the
price that an investor pays for Fund shares or the amount that the Fund receives
to invest on behalf of an investor and will not increase Fund expenses.  You may
wish to take  such  payment  arrangements  into  account  when  considering  and
evaluating  any  recommendations  relating to Fund shares and you should discuss
this matter with your  financial  advisor  and review your  financial  advisor's
disclosures.                                                                    

Automatic  Investment  Plan. A shareholder may purchase shares of a Fund through
an automatic investment program.  With the Direct Deposit Purchase Plan ("Direct
Deposit"),  investments  are made  automatically  (minimum  $1,000  and  maximum
$250,000 for initial  investments and a minimum of $50 and maximum  $250,000 for
subsequent  investments) from the shareholder's  account at a bank,  savings and
loan or credit  union into the  shareholder's  Fund  account.  Termination  by a
shareholder  will become  effective  within  thirty  days after the  Shareholder
Service  Agent has  received  the request.  A Fund may  immediately  terminate a
shareholder's  Direct  Deposit  in the  event  that  any item is  unpaid  by the
shareholder's financial institution.                                            

Minimum Subsequent Investment Policies.  For current shareholders there is a $50
minimum investment requirement for subsequent investments in each fund. There is
no  minimum  subsequent  investment  requirement  for  investments  on behalf of
participants in certain  fee-based and wrap programs  offered through  financial
intermediaries approved by the Advisor.                                         

Payroll  Investment  Plans. A shareholder  may purchase  shares through  Payroll
Direct Deposit or Government  Direct  Deposit.  Under these  programs,  all or a
portion of a shareholder's  net pay or government check is invested each payment
period.  A shareholder may terminate  participation  in these programs by giving
written  notice  to  the  shareholder's   employer  or  government   agency,  as
appropriate.  (A reasonable  time to act is required.) A Fund is not responsible
for the  efficiency of the employer or  government  agency making the payment or
any financial institutions transmitting payments.                               

Expedited Purchase Procedures for Existing  Shareholders.  Shareholders of other
DWS funds who have  submitted an account  application  and have  certified a tax
identification  number, clients having a regular investment counsel account with
the Advisor or its affiliates and members of their immediate families,  officers
and  employees  of the  Advisor  or of any  affiliated  organization  and  their
immediate families,  members of the FINRA, and banks may open an account by wire
by  calling  1-800-728-3337  for  instructions.  The  investor  must send a duly
completed and signed  application  to the Fund promptly.  A subsequent  purchase
order for $10,000 or more that is not greater  than four times an account  value
may be placed by  telephone,  etc. by  established  shareholders  (except by DWS
Scudder  Individual  Retirement  Account  (IRA),  DWS Scudder  Horizon Plan, DWS
Scudder Profit Sharing and Money Purchase  Pension Plans, DWS Scudder 401(k) and
DWS Scudder 403(b) Plan holders), members of the FINRA, and banks.

Redemptions                                                                     

Each  Fund  imposes  a  redemption  fee of 2% of  the  total  redemption  amount
(calculated at net asset value) on all Fund shares redeemed or exchanged  within
15 days of buying them (either by purchase or exchange).  The  redemption fee is
paid directly to the Funds,  and is designed to encourage  long-term  investment
and to  offset  transaction  and  other  costs  associated  with  short-term  or
excessive  trading.  For  purposes of  determining  whether the  redemption  fee
applies,  shares held the longest time will be treated as being  redeemed  first
and shares held the shortest time will be treated as being  redeemed  last.  The
redemption fee is applicable to Fund shares purchased either directly or through
a  financial  intermediary,  such  as  a  broker-dealer.   Transactions  through
financial intermediaries typically are placed with the Funds on an omnibus basis
and include  both  purchase and sale  transactions  placed on behalf of multiple
investors. These purchase and sale transactions are generally netted against one
another and placed on an aggregate  basis;  consequently  the  identities of the
individuals on whose behalf the  transactions are placed generally are not known
to the Funds.  For this reason,  the Funds have  undertaken to notify  financial
intermediaries  of their  obligation  to assess the  redemption  fee on customer
accounts  and to collect and remit the  proceeds to the Funds.  However,  due to
operational   requirements,   the  intermediaries'   methods  for  tracking  and
calculating  the fee may be  inadequate  or  differ  in some  respects  from the
Funds'.                                                                         

Each Fund may suspend or postpone  redemptions as permitted  pursuant to Section
22(e) of the Investment Company Act of 1940. Generally,  those circumstances are
when: 1) the New York Stock Exchange is closed other than  customary  weekend or
holiday closings; 2) trading on the New York Stock Exchange is restricted; 3) an
emergency  exists which makes the disposal of securities  owned by a fund or the
fair  determination  of  the  value  of  a  fund's  net  assets  not  reasonably
practicable;  or 4) the SEC, by order,  permits the  suspension  of the right of
redemption.  Redemption  payments  by wire may also be delayed in the event of a
nonroutine closure of the Federal Reserve wire payment system.                  

A  request  for  repurchase  (confirmed  redemption)  may be  communicated  by a
shareholder  through a  financial  services  firm to  DWS-SDI,  which firms must
promptly submit orders to be effective.                                         

Redemption  requests  must be  unconditional.  Redemption  requests (and a stock
power for certificated  shares) must be duly endorsed by the account holder.  As
specified  in  the  prospectus,  signatures  may  need  to  be  guaranteed  by a
commercial bank, trust company,  savings and loan  association,  federal savings
bank,  member  firm  of  a  national  securities  exchange  or  other  financial
institution  permitted by SEC rule.  Additional  documentation  may be required,
particularly  from   institutional  and  fiduciary  account  holders,   such  as
corporations,  custodians  (e.g.,  under the Uniform  Transfers  to Minors Act),
executors, administrators, trustees or guardians.                               

If the proceeds of the  redemption  (prior to the  imposition of any  contingent
deferred  sales charge) are $100,000 or less and the proceeds are payable to the
shareholder of record at the address of record,  normally a telephone request or
a written  request by any one account  holder  without a signature  guarantee is
sufficient for  redemptions by individual or joint account  holders,  and trust,
executor  and  guardian  account  holders,  provided  the  trustee,  executor   

42

P-->497329th Page of 358TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 329th
or guardian is named in the account  registration.  Other institutional  account
holders may  exercise  this special  privilege of redeeming  shares by telephone
request or  written  request  without  signature  guarantee  subject to the same
conditions as individual account holders,  provided that this privilege has been
pre-authorized by the institutional account holder by written instruction to the
Shareholder Service Agent with signatures guaranteed.  This privilege may not be
used to  redeem  shares  held in  certificated  form  and may not be used if the
shareholder's account has had an address change within 15 days of the redemption
request.                                                                        

Wires.  Delivery of the proceeds of a wire redemption of $250,000 or more may be
delayed  by a Fund for up to  seven  days if a Fund or the  Shareholder  Service
Agent deems it appropriate under then-current market conditions.  The ability to
send wires is limited by the business hours and holidays of the firms  involved.
A Fund is not  responsible  for the efficiency of the federal wire system or the
account  holder's  financial  services  firm or  bank.  The  account  holder  is
responsible  for any charges  imposed by the account  holder's  firm or bank. To
change the  designated  account  to receive  wire  redemption  proceeds,  send a
written  request  to that  Fund's  Shareholder  Service  Agent  with  signatures
guaranteed as described above or contact the firm through which Fund shares were
purchased.                                                                      

Automatic  Withdrawal  Plan.  The owner of $5,000 or more of a class of a Fund's
shares at the  offering  price (net  asset  value  plus,  in the case of Class A
shares,  the initial  sales charge) may provide for the payment from the owner's
account of any  requested  dollar amount to be paid to the owner or a designated
payee monthly,  quarterly,  semiannually or annually.  The $5,000 minimum is not
applicable to IRAs. The minimum periodic payment is $50. The maximum annual rate
at which  shares,  subject to CDSC may be redeemed is 12% of the net asset value
of the account.  Shares are redeemed so that the payee  should  receive  payment
approximately  the first of the month.  Investors  using this Plan must reinvest
Fund distributions.                                                             

The purchase of Class A shares while  participating  in a systematic  withdrawal
plan will  ordinarily be  disadvantageous  to the investor  because the investor
will be paying a sales  charge on the  purchase  of shares at the same time that
the investor is redeeming shares upon which a sales charge may have already been
paid.  Therefore,  the Fund will not knowingly permit additional  investments of
less  than  $2,000  if  the  investor  is at the  same  time  making  systematic
withdrawals.                                                                    

In-kind  Redemptions.  A Fund  reserves  the  right to  honor  any  request  for
redemption  or  repurchase  by  making  payment  in whole or in part in  readily
marketable  securities.  These securities will be chosen by a Fund and valued as
they are for purposes of computing a Fund's net asset value.  A shareholder  may
incur transaction expenses in converting these securities to cash.              

Checkwriting. For DWS Intermediate Tax/AMT Free Fund: the Checkwriting Privilege
is not offered to new  investors.  The  Checkwriting  Privilege is available for
shareholders  who previously  elected this  privilege  prior to August 19, 2002.
Checks may be used to pay any person,  provided  that each check is for at least
$100 and not more than $5 million.  By using the checks,  the  shareholder  will
receive daily  dividend  credit on his or her shares until the check has cleared
the banking  system.  Investors who  purchased  shares by check may write checks
against  those  shares  only  after  they have  been on a Fund's  book for seven
business days.  Shareholders  who use this service may also use other redemption
procedures.  No shareholder may write checks against certificated shares. A Fund
pays the bank charges for this service.  However, each Fund will review the cost
of operation  periodically  and reserve the right to determine if direct charges
to the persons who avail  themselves of this service would be appropriate.  Each
Fund,  DWS-SISC and State Street Bank and Trust Company reserve the right at any
time to suspend or terminate the Checkwriting procedure.                        

Exchanges                                                                       

Shareholders  may request a taxable  exchange of their  shares for shares of the
corresponding  class of other DWS Funds  without  imposition  of a sales charge,
subject to the provisions below.                                                

Shares of money  market  funds that were  acquired  by purchase  (not  including
shares acquired by dividend  reinvestment)  are subject to the applicable  sales
charge on exchange.  Series of DWS Target Fund are  available  on exchange  only
during  the  offering  period for such  series as  described  in the  applicable
prospectus.  Cash Management Fund Investment, Tax Free Money Fund Investment, NY

Treasury Series, Tax-Exempt California Money Market Fund, Cash Account Trust and
Investors  Cash Trust are  available  on exchange  but only  through a financial
services  firm having a services  agreement  with DWS-SDI.  All exchanges  among
money  funds  must  meet   applicable   investor   eligibility   and  investment
requirements.  Exchanges  may only be made for funds that are available for sale
in the shareholder's state of residence.  Currently, Tax-Exempt California Money
Market Fund is available for sale only in California.                           

Shareholders  must obtain  prospectus(es)  of the fund they are exchanging  into
from dealers, other firms or DWS-SDI.                                           

Automatic Exchange Plan. The owner of $1,000 or more of any class of shares of a
DWS Fund may  authorize  the  automatic  exchange  of a  specified  amount  ($50
minimum) of such  shares for shares of the same class of another  such DWS Fund.
Exchanges  will  be made  automatically  until  the  shareholder  or  that  Fund
terminates  the  privilege.  Exchanges  are subject to the terms and  conditions
described above.                                                                

Dividends                                                                       

Each Fund intends to declare daily and distribute  monthly  substantially all of
its net investment  income (excluding  short-term  capital gains) resulting from
investment  activity.  Distributions,  if any,  of net  realized  capital  gains
(short-term  and  long-term)  will  normally  be made in November or December or
otherwise as needed.                                                            

An additional  distribution may also be made (or treated as made) in November or
December if  necessary  to avoid the excise tax enacted by the Tax Reform Act of
1986.  Both  types  of  distributions  will  be  made in  shares  of a Fund  and
confirmations  will be  mailed  to each  shareholder  unless a  shareholder  has
elected to receive cash, in which case a check will be sent.                    

Any dividends or capital gains  distributions  declared in October,  November or
December  with a record  date in such a month  and  paid  during  the  following
January will be treated by  shareholders  for federal  income tax purposes as if
received on December 31 of the calendar year declared.                          

Dividends  paid by a Fund  with  respect  to each  class of its  shares  will be
calculated in the same manner, at the same time and on the same day.            

Income  and  capital  gain  dividends,  if any,  of a Fund will be  credited  to
shareholder  accounts  in full and  fractional  shares of the same class of that
Fund at net asset value on the  reinvestment  date,  except  that,  upon written
request to the  Shareholder  Service Agent, a shareholder  may select one of the
following options:                                                              

1.       To receive  income and  short-term  capital gain  dividends in cash and
         long-term  capital  gain  dividends  in shares of the same class at net
asset value; or                                               

2.       To receive income and capital gain dividends in cash.                  

Dividends  will be  reinvested  in  shares  of the same  class of a Fund  unless
shareholders  indicate in writing  that they wish to receive  them in cash or in
shares  of other  DWS  Funds  with  multiple  classes  of shares or DWS Funds as
provided in the Prospectus.  To use this privilege of investing dividends of the
Fund in shares of another DWS Fund, shareholders must maintain a minimum account
value of $1,000 in the Fund  distributing the dividends.  The Fund will reinvest
dividend checks (and future  dividends) in shares of that same Fund and class if
checks are returned as undeliverable.  Dividends and other  distributions of the
Fund in the  aggregate  amount of $10 or less are  automatically  reinvested  in
shares of the same Fund and class  unless the  shareholder  requests  in writing
that a check be issued for that particular distribution.                        

If  a  shareholder   has  elected  to  reinvest  any   dividends   and/or  other
distributions,  such  distributions  will be made in  shares  of that  Fund  and
confirmations will be mailed to each shareholder. If a shareholder has chosen to
receive

cash, a check will be sent.  Distributions of investment  company taxable income
and net realized capital gains are taxable, whether made in shares or cash.     

Each  distribution  is  accompanied  by a  brief  explanation  of the  form  and
character of the  distribution.  The  characterization  of distributions on such
correspondence may differ from the characterization for federal tax purposes. In
January of each year each Fund issues to each  shareholder  a  statement  of the
federal income tax status of all distributions in the prior calendar year.      

Each Fund may at any time vary its foregoing dividend practices and,  therefore,
reserves  the  right  from  time to time to  either  distribute  or  retain  for
reinvestment  such of its net  investment  income  and  its net  short-term  and
long-term   capital  gains  as  its  Board  determines   appropriate  under  the
then-current circumstances. In particular, and without limiting the foregoing, a
Fund may make additional  distributions of net investment income or capital gain
net income in order to satisfy the minimum distribution  requirements  contained
in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").                  

 TAXES

The following is intended to be a general  summary of certain federal income tax
consequences  of  investing  in the  Funds.  It is not  intended  as a  complete
discussion  of all such  consequences,  nor  does it  purport  to deal  with all
categories of investors.  Investors are therefore  advised to consult with their
tax advisors before making an investment in a Fund.                             

Federal  Taxation.  Each Fund intends to elect to be treated and to qualify each
year as a regulated  investment company under Subchapter M of the Code. In order
to qualify for the special tax treatment accorded regulated investment companies
and their shareholders, each Fund must, among other things:                     

(a)      derive at least 90% of its gross  income for each taxable year from (i)
         dividends, interest, payments with respect to certain securities loans,
         and gains from the sale or other  disposition  of stock,  securities or
         foreign currencies, or other income (including but not limited to gains
         from options,  futures,  or forward  contracts) derived with respect to
         its business of investing in such stock, securities,  or currencies and
         net income  derived  from an interest in a  qualified  publicly  traded
         partnership  and (ii) net income  derived from  interests in "qualified
publicly traded partnerships" (as defined below);             

(b)      diversify  its  holdings  so that,  at the end of each  quarter of each
         Fund's taxable year, (i) at least 50% of the market value of the Fund's
         total  assets is  represented  by cash and cash  items,  US  Government
         securities,  securities of other regulated  investment  companies,  and
         other  securities  limited  in respect of any one issuer to a value not
         greater  than 5% of the value of the Fund's  total  assets and not more
         than 10% of the outstanding  voting securities of such issuer, and (ii)
         not more than 25% of the value of the Fund's  total  assets is invested
         (x) in the  securities  (other than those of the US Government or other
         regulated  investment  companies)  of any one  issuer or of two or more
         issuers  which the Fund  controls  and which are  engaged  in the same,
         similar,  or related trades or businesses,  or (y) in the securities of
         one or more qualified publicly traded  partnerships (as defined below);
and                                                           

(c)      distribute with respect to each taxable year at least 90% of the sum of
         its investment  company  taxable income (as that term is defined in the
         Code without  regard to the deduction  for  dividends  paid--generally,
         taxable  ordinary  income and the  excess,  if any,  of net  short-term
         capital gains over net  long-term  capital  losses) and net  tax-exempt
interest income, for such year.                               

In  general,  for  purposes of the 90% gross  income  requirement  described  in
paragraph  (a)  above,  income  derived  from a  partnership  will be treated as
qualifying  income only to the extent such  income is  attributable  to items of
income of the  partnership  which would be qualifying  income if realized by the
regulated investment company.  However, recent legislation provides that 100% of
the net  income  derived  from  an  interest  in a  "qualified  publicly  traded
partnership"  (defined as a partnership  (x) interests in which are traded on an
established  securities  market or

readily tradable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof and
(y)  that  derives  less  than 90% of its  income  from  the  qualifying  income
described  in  paragraph  (a) above) will be treated as  qualifying  income.  In
addition, although in general the passive loss rules of the Code do not apply to
regulated  investment  companies,  such rules do apply to a regulated investment
company  with  respect  to items  attributable  to an  interest  in a  qualified
publicly  traded  partnership.  For  purposes  of a  Fund's  investment  in loan
participations,  a Fund shall  treat  both the  financial  intermediary  and the
issuer of the  underlying  loan as an issuer for the  purposes  of  meeting  the
diversification  requirement  described in  paragraph  (b) above.  Finally,  for
purposes of paragraph (b) above, the term "outstanding voting securities of such
issuer"  will  include  the equity  securities  of a qualified  publicly  traded
partnership.                                                                    

If a Fund qualifies as a regulated  investment  company that is accorded special
tax  treatment,  such Fund will not be subject  to federal  income tax on income
distributed  in a timely  manner to its  shareholders  in the form of  dividends
(including Capital Gain Dividends, as defined below).                           

If for any taxable year a Fund does not qualify for the special  federal  income
tax treatment afforded regulated investment companies, all of its taxable income
will be subject to federal  income tax at regular  corporate  rates (without any
deduction for distributions to its  shareholders),  and all  distributions  from
earnings and profits,  including any  distributions of net tax-exempt income and
net long-term capital gains, will be taxable to shareholders as ordinary income.
Such  distributions  would be eligible (i) to be treated as  qualified  dividend
income  in the  case of  shareholders  taxed  as  individuals  and  (ii) for the
dividends received deduction in the case of corporate shareholders. In addition,
the Fund could be required to recognize  unrealized gains, pay substantial taxes
and  interest  and  make  substantial  distributions  before  requalifying  as a
regulated investment company that is accorded special tax treatment.            

Each Fund is subject to a 4% nondeductible  excise tax on amounts required to be
but that are not distributed  under a prescribed  formula.  The formula requires
payment to shareholders during a calendar year of distributions  representing at
least 98% of a Fund's  ordinary income for the calendar year and at least 98% of
the excess of its capital gains over capital losses realized during the one-year
period  ending  October 31 (in most cases) of such year as well as amounts  that
were neither  distributed  nor taxed to the Fund during the prior calendar year.
Although each Fund's distribution  policies should enable it to avoid excise tax
liability,  a Fund may  retain  (and be  subject  to income or excise  tax on) a
portion of its capital  gain or other income if it appears to be in the interest
of such Fund.                                                                   

Exempt-Interest  Dividends.  The Funds will be qualified to pay  exempt-interest
dividends  to their  shareholders  only if,  at the close of each  quarter  of a
Fund's taxable year, at least 50% of the total value of a Fund's assets consists
of  obligations  the  interest  on which is  exempt  from  federal  income  tax.
Distributions that the Funds properly designate as exempt-interest dividends are
treated as  interest  excludable  from  shareholders'  gross  income for federal
income tax  purposes  but may be taxable  for  federal  alternative  minimum tax
("AMT") purposes and for state and local tax purposes.  Because the Funds intend
to qualify to pay exempt-interest  dividends,  the Funds may be limited in their
ability  to enter  into  taxable  transactions  involving  forward  commitments,
repurchase  agreements,  financial  futures and options  contracts  on financial
futures, tax-exempt bond indexes and other assets.                              

Part or all of the interest on indebtedness,  if any, incurred or continued by a
shareholder  to  purchase  or  carry  shares  of a Fund  paying  exempt-interest
dividends is not  deductible.  The portion of interest that is not deductible is
equal to the total interest paid or accrued on the  indebtedness,  multiplied by
the percentage of a Fund's total distributions (not including distributions from
net long-term  capital gains) paid to the shareholder  that are  exempt-interest
dividends.  Under rules used by the Internal  Revenue  Service to determine when
borrowed  Funds are  considered  used for the purpose of  purchasing or carrying
particular  assets,  the purchase of shares may be  considered to have been made
with  borrowed  funds even though such Funds are not  directly  traceable to the
purchase of shares.                                                             

In general, exempt-interest dividends, if any, attributable to interest received
on certain private activity obligations and certain industrial development bonds
will not be tax-exempt to any  shareholder  who are  "substantial  users" of the
facilities financed by such obligations or bonds or who are "related persons" of
such substantial users.                                                         

The Funds,  which are qualified to pay  exempt-interest  dividends,  will inform
investors  within 60 days of a Fund's fiscal  year-end of the  percentage of its
income  distributions  designated  as  tax-exempt.  The  percentage  is  applied

46

P-->497333rd Page of 358TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 333rd
uniformly to all  distributions  made during the year.  The percentage of income
designated as tax-exempt for any particular  distribution  may be  substantially
different from the percentage of a Fund's income that was tax-exempt  during the
period covered by the distribution.                                             

The U.S.  Supreme Court has agreed to hear an appeal of a  state-court  decision
that  might  significantly  affect  how states  tax  in-state  and  out-of-state
municipal  bonds.  A Kentucky  state court held that a Kentucky law violates the
U.S.  Constitution  by treating,  for Kentucky state tax purposes,  the interest
income on in-state  municipal bonds  differently from the income on out-of-state
municipal bonds. If the U.S. Supreme Court affirms this holding, each state will
likely revisit the way in which it treats the interest on municipal bonds,  and,
depending  on how  each  state  decides,  this  has the  potential  to  increase
significantly  the amount of state tax paid by shareholders  on  exempt-interest
dividends  and possibly  affect the value of the bonds.  The U.S.  Supreme Court
likely  will  hold oral  arguments  on this case in the fall of 2007 and issue a
decision sometime thereafter. You should consult your tax advisor to discuss the
tax consequences of your investment in a Fund.                                  

The exemption  from federal  income tax for  exempt-interest  dividends does not
necessarily result in exemption for such dividends under the income or other tax
laws of any state or local  authority.  You are advised to consult with your tax
advisor about state and local tax matters.                                      

Taxable  Distributions.  For  federal  income  tax  purposes,  distributions  of
investment income, other than exempt-interest  dividends,  are generally taxable
as ordinary  income.  Taxes on  distributions of capital gains are determined by
how long a Fund owned the investments that generated them,  rather than how long
a shareholder  has owned his or her shares.  Distributions  of net capital gains
(that is, the excess of net long-term capital gains over net short-term  capital
losses)  from the sale of  investments  that a Fund owned for more than one year
and that are properly designated by the Fund as capital gain dividends ("Capital
Gain  Dividends") will be taxable as long-term  capital gains.  Distributions of
gains from the sale of  investments  that a Fund owned for one year or less will
be taxable as ordinary income. For the taxable years beginning before January 1,
2011,  distributions of investment  income  designated by a Fund as derived from
"qualified  dividend  income"  are taxed at the rates  applicable  to  long-term
capital gain, provided holding period and other requirements are met at both the
shareholder and Fund level.                                                     

For taxable years beginning before January 1, 2011,  distributions of investment
income designated by a Fund as derived from "qualified  dividend income" will be
taxed in the hands of an individual at the rates applicable to long-term capital
gain,  provided  holding  periods  and  other  requirements  are met at both the
shareholder  and the Funds levels.  Qualified  dividend  income does not include
interest  from  debt   securities.   Because  the  Funds  invest   primarily  in
tax-exempt-bonds, the Funds do not expect a significant portion of distributions
to be derived from qualified dividend income.                                   

Distributions  are taxable to shareholders  even if they are paid from income or
gains earned by a Fund before a  shareholder's  investment  (and thus might have
been reflected in the price the  shareholder  paid).  Distributions  are taxable
whether  shareholders receive them in cash or reinvest them in additional shares
through the  reinvestment  privilege.  A  shareholder  whose  distributions  are
reinvested in shares will be treated as having  received a dividend equal to the
fair market value of the new shares issued to the shareholder.                  

Long-term  capital gain rates  applicable to individuals  have been  temporarily
reduced -- in general,  to 15% with lower rates applying to taxpayers in the 10%
and 15% rate brackets -- for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2011.    

Special tax rules apply to investments  through defined  contribution  plans and
other  tax-qualified  plans.  Shareholders  should consult their tax advisors to
determine  the  suitability  of shares of a Fund as an  investment  through such
plans and the precise effect of an investment on their particular tax situation.

All distributions by a Fund result in a reduction in the net asset value of that
Fund's  shares.  Should  a  distribution  reduce  the net  asset  value  below a
shareholder's  cost basis,  such distribution may nevertheless be taxable to the
shareholder as ordinary income or capital gain as described above,  even though,
from an investment standpoint, it may constitute a partial return of capital. In
particular,  investors  should be careful to consider  the tax  implications  of

47

P-->497334th Page of 358TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 334th
buying  shares just prior to a  distribution.  The price of shares  purchased at
that  time  may  include  the  amount  of the  forthcoming  distribution.  Those
purchasing just prior to a distribution will receive a partial return of capital
upon the distribution, which may nevertheless be taxable to them.               

Sale or  Redemption  of Shares.  The sale,  exchange or  redemption  of a Fund's
shares may give rise to a gain or loss.  In general,  any gain or loss  realized
upon a taxable  disposition of shares will be treated as long-term  capital gain
or loss if the  shares  have been held for more than 12 months.  Otherwise,  the
gain or loss on the taxable  disposition  of a Fund's  shares will be treated as
short-term  capital  gain or loss.  However,  any loss  realized  upon a taxable
disposition  of shares held for six months or less will be treated as long-term,
rather  than   short-term,   to  the  extent  of  any  long-term   capital  gain
distributions  received (or deemed  received) by the shareholder with respect to
the shares. All or a portion of any loss realized upon a taxable  disposition of
a Fund's shares will be disallowed if other  substantially  identical  shares of
the Fund are purchased within 30 days before or after the disposition. In such a
case,  the basis of the newly  purchased  shares will be adjusted to reflect the
disallowed loss.                                                                

Taxation of Certain  Transactions.  If a Fund  engages in hedging  transactions,
including hedging transactions in options,  futures contracts, and straddles, or
other similar  transactions,  it will be subject to special tax rules (including
constructive sale,  mark-to-market,  straddle, wash sale, and short sale rules),
the effect of which may be to accelerate income to the Fund, defer losses to the
Fund, cause adjustments in the holding periods of the Fund's securities, convert
long-term  capital gains into  short-term  capital  gains or convert  short-term
capital losses into long-term capital losses. These rules could therefore affect
the amount, timing and character of distributions to shareholders. The Fund will
endeavor to make any available  elections  pertaining to such  transactions in a
manner believed to be in the best interests of the Fund.                        

Certain  of a Fund's  hedging  activities  are  likely to  produce a  difference
between its book income and the sum of its net tax-exempt and taxable income. If
a Fund's book income exceeds its tax-exempt income, the distribution (if any) of
such  excess  will be  treated  as (i) a  dividend  to the  extent of the Fund's
remaining  earnings and profits  (including  earnings  and profits  arising from
tax-exempt income),  (ii) thereafter as a return of capital to the extent of the
recipient's  basis in the shares,  and (iii) thereafter as gain from the sale or
exchange of a capital asset. If a Fund's book income is less than the sum of its
net  tax-exempt  and  taxable  income,  such  Fund  could  be  required  to make
distributions exceeding book income to qualify as a regulated investment company
that is accorded special tax treatment.                                         

A Fund's  investment  in zero  coupon  bonds and other debt  obligations  having
original issue  discount may cause a Fund to recognize  taxable income in excess
of any cash received from the  investment.  A portion of the difference  between
the issue price of zero coupon  securities and their face value ('original issue
discount") is  considered  to be income to a Fund each year,  even though a Fund
will not receive cash  interest  payments from these  securities.  This original
issue discount  imputed  income will comprise a part of the  investment  company
taxable income of a Fund,  which must be distributed to shareholders in order to
maintain the  qualification of a Fund as a regulated  investment  company and to
avoid federal income tax at a Fund's level.                                     

Some debt  obligations with a fixed maturity date of more than one year from the
date of issuance (and all  zero-coupon  debt  obligations  with a fixed maturity
date of more than one year from the date of  issuance)  that are  acquired  by a
Fund  will be  treated  as debt  obligations  that are  issued  originally  at a
discount.  Generally,  the  amount of the  original  issue  discount  ("OID") is
treated as interest income and is included in taxable income (and required to be
distributed)  over the term of the debt  security,  even though  payment of that
amount  is not  received  until a later  time,  usually  when the debt  security
matures. In addition,  payment-in-kind securities will give rise to income which
is  required to be  distributed  and is taxable  even though a Fund  holding the
security receives no interest payment in cash on the security during the year.  

Some debt  obligations with a fixed maturity date of more than one year from the
date of  issuance  that are  acquired by a Fund in the  secondary  market may be
treated  as  having  market  discount.  Generally,  any gain  recognized  on the
disposition  of, and any partial payment of principal on, a debt security having
market  discount  is treated  as  ordinary  income to the  extent  the gain,  or
principal  payment,  does not exceed the "accrued market  discount" on such debt
security. Market discount generally accrues in equal daily installments.  A Fund
may make one or more of the                                                     

48

P-->497335th Page of 358TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 335th
elections  applicable to debt obligations  having market  discount,  which could
affect the character and timing of recognition of income.                       

In addition, if a Fund invests in high yield original issue discount obligations
issued by  corporations  (including  tax-exempt  obligations),  a portion of the
original  issue  discount  accruing on the  obligation may be treated as taxable
dividend income. In such event,  dividends of investment  company taxable income
received from a fund by its  shareholders,  to the extent  attributable  to such
portion of accrued original issue discount, would be taxable. Any such dividends
received by a Fund's  corporate  shareholders  may be eligible for the deduction
for dividends received by corporations.                                         

Any market discount recognized on a bond is taxable as ordinary income. A market
discount bond is a bond  acquired on the  secondary  market at a price below its
redemption  value (or its  adjusted  issue price if issued with  original  issue
discount).  Absent an election  to include  the market  discount in income as it
accrues,  gain on the  disposition  of such an  obligation  will be  treated  as
ordinary  income  (instead  of capital  gain) to the  extent of  accrued  market
discount.                                                                       

Tax-Exempt Shareholders.  Under current law, each Fund serves to block unrelated
business   taxable  income  ("UBTI")  from  being  realized  by  its  tax-exempt
shareholders.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  a tax-exempt  shareholder  could
realize  UBTI by  virtue  of its  investment  in a Fund if  shares  in the  Fund
constitute  debt-financed  property in the hands of the  tax-exempt  shareholder
within the meaning of Code Section 514(b).  If a charitable  remainder trust (as
defined in Code Section 664) realizes any UBTI for a taxable year,  under recent
legislation, it will be subject to a 100% excise tax on such income (rather than
will lose its tax-exempt status, as previously).                                

Withholding.  Under the backup  withholding  provisions of the Code,  redemption
proceeds  as  well  as  distributions  may be  subject  to  federal  income  tax
withholding for certain shareholders, including those who fail to furnish a Fund
with their taxpayer  identification  numbers and  certifications as to their tax
status.                                                                         

Non-US Shareholders. Capital Gain Dividends paid to non-US investors will not be
subject to  withholding  of US income  tax. In  general,  dividends  (other than
Capital  Gain  Dividends)  paid by the Fund to a  shareholder  that is not a "US
person" within the meaning of the Code (such  shareholder,  a "foreign  person")
are subject to  withholding  of US federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or lower
applicable  treaty  rate)  even if they are  funded by income or gains  (such as
portfolio  interest,  short-term  capital gains, or foreign-source  dividend and
interest  income)  that,  if paid to a  foreign  person  directly,  would not be
subject to withholding.  However, for taxable years beginning after December 31,
2004 and before  January 1, 2008,  the Fund will  generally  not be  required to
withhold any amounts (i) with respect to distributions (other than distributions
to a foreign person (w) that has not provided a satisfactory  statement that the
beneficial  owner is not a US person,  (x) to the extent  that the  dividend  is
attributable  to certain  interest on an obligation if the foreign person is the
issuer or is a 10% shareholder of the issuer, (y) that is within certain foreign
countries that have inadequate  information  exchange with the United States, or
(z) to the extent the dividend is attributable to interest paid by a person that
is a related person of the foreign person and the foreign person is a controlled
foreign corporation) from US-source interest income that would not be subject to
US federal income tax if earned directly by an individual foreign person, to the
extent such  distributions  are properly  designated by the Fund,  and (ii) with
respect to  distributions  (other than  distributions  to an individual  foreign
person who is present in the United  States for a period or periods  aggregating
183 days or more during the year of the distribution) of net short-term  capital
gains  in  excess  of  net  long-term   capital  losses,   to  the  extent  such
distributions   are  properly   designated   by  the  Fund.   Depending  on  the
circumstances,  the Fund may make such designations with respect to all, some or
none of its potentially eligible dividends and/or treat such dividends, in whole
or in part, as  ineligible  for this  exemption  from  withholding.  In order to
qualify  for this  exemption  from  withholding,  a foreign  person will need to
comply with applicable certification  requirements relating to its non-US status
(including,  in general,  furnishing an IRS Form W-8BEN or substitute  form). In
the case of shares held through an  intermediary,  the intermediary may withhold
even if the Fund makes a designation with respect to a payment.  Foreign persons
should  consult their  intermediaries  with respect to the  application of these
rules to their account.                                                         

If a  beneficial  holder who is a foreign  person has a trade or business in the
United States,  and the dividends are effectively  connected with the conduct by
the beneficial holder of a trade or business in the United States,  the dividend
will be subject to US federal net income taxation at regular income tax rates.

Tax Shelter Reporting Regulations.  Under Treasury regulations, if a shareholder
recognizes a loss with  respect to a Fund's  shares of $2 million or more for an
individual shareholder or $10 million or more for a corporate  shareholder,  the
shareholder must file with the Internal  Revenue Service a disclosure  statement
on Form 8886.  Direct  shareholders  of portfolio  securities  are in many cases
excepted  from  this  reporting   requirement,   but  under  current   guidance,
shareholders of a regulated investment company are not excepted. Future guidance
may extend the current exception from this reporting requirement to shareholders
of  most  or all  regulated  investment  companies.  The  fact  that  a loss  is
reportable under these  regulations  does not affect the legal  determination of
whether the  taxpayer's  treatment  of the loss is proper.  Shareholders  should
consult their tax advisors to determine the  applicability of these  regulations
in light of their individual circumstances.                                     

Investors  are advised to consult  their own advisors  with respect to their own
circumstances  regarding the above-referenced  federal income taxation rules and
with respect to other federal,  state, local or foreign tax consequences to them
of an investment in shares of a Fund.                                           

Tax-Equivalent Yield                                                            

Tax-equivalent  yield is the net  annualized  taxable  yield needed to produce a
specified  tax-exempt  yield at a given tax rate based on a specified 30-day (or
one month) period  assuming  semiannual  compounding  of income.  Tax-equivalent
yield is  calculated  by dividing that portion of a Fund's yield (as computed in
the yield  description  above) which is  tax-exempt by one minus a stated income
tax rate and adding the  product to that  portion,  if any,  of the yield of the
Fund that is not tax-exempt.                                                    

Tax-Exempt  Versus Taxable Yield.  You may want to determine which investment --
tax-exempt  or taxable -- will provide you with a higher  after-tax  return.  To
determine  the  taxable  equivalent  yield,  simply  divide  the yield  from the
tax-exempt  investment by the sum of 1 minus your marginal tax rate.  The tables
below are provided for your  convenience in making this calculation for selected
tax-exempt  yields and taxable  income  levels.  These yields are  presented for
purposes of  illustration  only and are not  representative  of any yield that a
Fund may  generate.  The tables are based  upon  current  law as to the 2007 tax
rates schedules.

 NET ASSET VALUE

The net  asset  value of  shares  of each  Fund is  computed  as of the close of
regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange (the  "Exchange") on each day the
Exchange is open for trading (the "Value Time"). The Exchange is scheduled to be
closed on the following  holidays:  New Year's Day, Dr. Martin Luther King,  Jr.
Day,  Presidents' Day, Good Friday,  Memorial Day,  Independence Day, Labor Day,
Thanksgiving  and Christmas,  and on the preceding  Friday or subsequent  Monday
when one of these  holidays  falls on a Saturday  or Sunday,  respectively.  Net
asset  value  per share is  determined  separately  for each  class of shares by
dividing the value of the total assets of the Fund attributable to the shares of
that class, less all liabilities attributable to that class, by the total number
of shares of that class outstanding.  The per share net asset value may be lower
for  certain  classes  of the Fund  because  of higher  expenses  borne by these
classes.                                                                        

An equity  security is valued at its most  recent  sale price on the  security's
primary  exchange  or OTC market as of the Value Time.  Lacking  any sales,  the
security is valued at the calculated  mean between the most recent bid quotation
and the most recent asked quotation (the "Calculated  Mean") on such exchange or
OTC  market  as of the  Value  Time.  If it is not  possible  to  determine  the
Calculated Mean, the security is valued at the most recent bid quotation on such
exchange  or OTC market as of the Value  Time.  In the case of  certain  foreign
exchanges  or OTC  markets,  the closing  price  reported by the exchange or OTC
market  (which may  sometimes  be  referred  to as the  "official  close" or the
"official  closing  price" or other similar  term) will be  considered  the most
recent sale price.                                                              

Debt securities are valued as follows.  Money market instruments  purchased with
an  original or  remaining  maturity  of 60 days or less,  maturing at par,  are
valued at amortized  cost.  Other money market  instruments  are valued based on
information  obtained from an approved  pricing agent or, if such information is
not readily  available,  by using  matrix  pricing  techniques  (formula  driven
calculations based primarily on current market yields). Bank loans are valued at
prices supplied by an approved  pricing agent (which are intended to reflect the
mean between the bid and asked prices), if available,  and otherwise at the mean
of the most recent bid and asked quotations or evaluated  prices, as applicable,
based  on   quotations   or  evaluated   prices   obtained   from  one  or  more
broker-dealers.  Privately  placed  debt  securities,  other than Rule 144A debt
securities,  initially are valued at cost and  thereafter  based on all relevant
factors  including  type  of  security,  size of  holding  and  restrictions  on
disposition.  Municipal  debt  securities  are valued at prices  supplied  by an
approved  pricing  agent (which are intended to reflect the mean between the bid
and asked  prices),  if available,  and otherwise at the mean of the most recent
bid and asked quotations or evaluated price obtained from a broker-dealer. Other
debt securities are valued at prices  supplied by an approved  pricing agent, if
available, and otherwise at the most recent bid quotation or evaluated price, as
applicable,  obtained from one or more broker-dealers.  If it is not possible to
value a particular debt security pursuant to the above methods,  the security is
valued on the basis of factors including (but not limited to) maturity,  coupon,
creditworthiness, currency denomination, and the movement of the market in which
the security is normally traded.                                                

An exchange-traded option contract on securities, currencies and other financial
instruments  is valued at its most recent sale price on the  relevant  exchange.
Lacking any sales,  the option contract is valued at the Calculated  Mean. If it
is not possible to determine the Calculated  Mean, the option contract is valued
at the most recent bid quotation in the case of a purchased  option  contract or
the most recent asked  quotation in the case of a written  option  contract,  in
each case as of the Value Time. An option contract on securities, currencies and
other financial instruments traded in the OTC market is valued on the Value Date
at the evaluated price provided by the  broker-dealer  with which it was traded.
Futures contracts (and options thereon) are valued at the most recent settlement
price, if available,  on the exchange on which they are traded most extensively.
With the exception of stock index futures  contracts  which trade on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange,  closing settlement times are prior to the close of trading
on the New York Stock Exchange. For stock index futures contracts which trade on
the  Chicago  Mercantile  Exchange,   closing  settlement  prices  are  normally
available  at  approximately  4:20  Eastern  time.  If no  settlement  price  is
available, the last traded price on such exchange will be used.                 

If market  quotations  for a portfolio  asset are not readily  available  or the
value of a portfolio  asset as  determined  in  accordance  with Board  approved
procedures does not represent the fair market value of the portfolio  asset, the
value of the portfolio  asset is taken to be an amount which,  in the opinion of
the  Fund's  Pricing  Committee  (or,  in  some  cases,  the  Board's  Valuation
Committee),  represents fair market value. The value of other portfolio holdings
owned

by the Fund is  determined  in a manner which is intended to fairly  reflect the
fair  market  value  of the  asset on the  valuation  date,  based on  valuation
procedures  adopted by the Fund's  Board and  overseen  primarily  by the Fund's
Pricing Committee.                                                              

 TRUSTEES AND OFFICERS

The following table presents certain information  regarding the Board Members of
the Trust.  Each Board Member's year of birth is set forth in parentheses  after
his or her name.  Unless  otherwise  noted, (i) each Board Member has engaged in
the principal occupation(s) noted in the table for at least the most recent five
years,  although not  necessarily in the same capacity,  and (ii) the address of
each Board  Member that is not an  "interested  persons" (as defined in the 1940
Act) of the Trust or the Advisor (each, an "Independent  Board Member"),  is c/o
Dawn-Marie Driscoll, PO Box 100176, Cape Coral, FL 33904. The term of office for
each Board  Member is until the election and  qualification  of a successor,  or
until  such Board  Member  sooner  dies,  resigns,  is  removed or as  otherwise
provided in the governing documents of the Trust. Because the Fund does not hold
an annual  meeting of  shareholders,  each Board  Member will hold office for an
indeterminate  period.  The Board  Members may also serve in similar  capacities
with other funds in the DWS fund complex.

Keith R. Fox (Chair and Audit Committee Financial Expert),  Kenneth C. Froewiss,

Remuneration.  Each Independent Board Member receives compensation from the Fund
for his or her services, which includes an annual retainer and an attendance fee
for each meeting attended. No additional compensation is paid to any Independent
Board Member for travel time to meetings,  attendance at directors'  educational
seminars  or  conferences,   service  on  industry  or  association  committees,
participation  as speakers at directors'  conferences or service on special fund
industry director task forces or subcommittees. Independent Board Members do not
receive any employee  benefits such as pension or retirement  benefits or health
insurance from the Fund or any fund in the DWS fund complex.                    

Members of the Board who are officers,  directors,  employees or stockholders of
Deutsche Asset Management or its affiliates receive no direct  compensation from
a Fund, although they are compensated as employees of Deutsche Asset Management,
or its affiliates,  and as a result may be deemed to participate in fees paid by
the Funds.  The following tables show  compensation  from the Fund and aggregate
compensation  from all of the  funds in the DWS fund  complex  received  by each
Board Member during the calendar year 2006. Mr. Schwarzer became a member of the
Board on May 5,  2006,  is an  interested  person of the Funds and  received  no
compensation  from the  Funds or any fund in the DWS  fund  complex  during  the
relevant periods.

Agreement to Indemnify Independent Trustees for Certain Expenses                

In connection with litigation or regulatory  action related to possible improper
market timing or other improper trading activity or possible improper  marketing
and sales  activity  in the Funds,  each Fund's  investment  advisor has agreed,
subject to  applicable  law and  regulation,  to indemnify and hold harmless the
applicable  Funds  against  any and all loss,  damage,  liability  and  expense,
arising  from  market  timing or  marketing  and sales  matters  alleged  in any
enforcement actions brought by governmental authorities involving or potentially
affecting the Funds or the investment  advisor  ("Enforcement  Actions") or that
are the basis for private  actions  brought by shareholders of the Funds against
the Funds,  their directors and officers,  the Funds' investment  advisor and/or
certain other parties ("Private Litigation"), or any proceedings or actions that
may  be  threatened  or  commenced  in  the  future  by  any  person  (including
governmental authorities), arising from or similar to the matters alleged in the
Enforcement Actions or Private Litigation.  In recognition of its undertaking to
indemnify  the  applicable  Funds  and in  light of the  rebuttable  presumption
generally  afforded to independent  directors/trustees  of investment  companies
that they have not engaged in disabling conduct,  each Fund's investment advisor
has also agreed,  subject to  applicable  law and  regulation,  to indemnify the
applicable  Funds'   Independent   Trustees  against  certain   liabilities  the
Independent  Trustees  may incur from the  matters  alleged  in any  Enforcement
Actions or Private  Litigation or arising from or similar to the matters alleged
in the Enforcement Actions or Private Litigation,  and advance expenses that may
be  incurred by the  Independent  Trustees in  connection  with any  Enforcement
Actions  or  Private  Litigation.  The  applicable  investment  advisor  is not,
however,  required to provide  indemnification and advancement of expenses:  (1)
with respect to any  proceeding  or action with respect to which the  applicable
Fund's Board  determines that the Independent  Trustee  ultimately  would not be
entitled to indemnification or (2) for any liability of the Independent  Trustee
to the  Funds or their  shareholders  to which  the  Independent  Trustee  would
otherwise  be  subject  by reason  of  willful  misfeasance,  bad  faith,  gross
negligence  or  reckless  disregard  of the  Independent  Trustee's  duties as a
director or trustee of the Funds as determined in a final  adjudication  in such
action or proceeding.  The estimated amount of any expenses that may be advanced
to the Independent Trustees or indemnity that may be payable under

the indemnity  agreements is currently unknown.  These agreements by each Fund's
investment  advisor will survive the  termination of the  investment  management
agreements between the applicable investment advisor and the Funds.             

 FUND ORGANIZATION

Organizational Description                                                      

DWS  Municipal  Trust is a  Massachusetts  business  trust  established  under a
Declaration of Trust dated  September 24, 1976, as amended.  The Trustees of DWS
Municipal  Trust have  established  and designated two series of the Trust:  DWS
High Yield Tax-Free Fund and DWS Managed  Municipal Bond Fund,  both open ended,
diversified  investment  companies.  Effective October 1, 2002,  Scudder Managed
Municipal  Bonds  changed its name to Scudder  Managed  Municipal  Bond Fund. On
February 6, 2006, the Trust and its series: Scudder High Yield Tax-Free Fund and
Scudder Managed  Municipal Bond Fund were renamed DWS Municipal  Trust, DWS High
Yield Tax Free Fund and DWS  Managed  Municipal  Bond  Fund,  respectively.  The
Trust's  authorized  capital  consists  of an  unlimited  number  of  shares  of
beneficial  interest,  par value $0.01 per share. DWS Intermediate  Tax/AMT Free
Fund  is a  series  of DWS  Tax  Free  Trust,  a  Massachusetts  business  trust
established  under a Declaration  of Trust dated  December 28, 1982, as amended.
The name and investment  objectives of the Fund were changed effective  November
1, 1990.  Effective  October 1, 2003,  Scudder Medium Term Tax-Free Fund changed
its name to Scudder  Intermediate  Tax/AMT Free Fund.  On February 6, 2006,  the
Trust and its series:  Scudder  Intermediate  Tax/AMT Free Fund were renamed DWS
Tax Free Trust and DWS Intermediate Tax/AMT Free Fund, respectively.  The Fund's
authorized  capital  consists  of an  unlimited  number of shares of  beneficial
interest, $.01 par value.                                                       

Currently, Class A, Class B, Class C, Class S and Institutional Class shares are
offered.                                                                        

Each  Trust  is a  Massachusetts  business  trust  organized  under  the laws of
Massachusetts  and is governed by an Amended and Restated  Declaration  of Trust
that was  approved  by  shareholders  in the second  quarter of 2006,  as may be
further  amended  from time to time (the  "Declaration  of  Trust").  All shares
issued and  outstanding are fully paid and  non-assessable  (except as set forth
below), transferable, have no pre-emptive or conversion rights (except as may be
determined by the Board of Trustees) and are  redeemable as described in the SAI
and a Fund's  prospectus.  Each share has equal  rights with each other share of
the same  class  of the  Fund as to  voting,  dividends,  exchanges,  conversion
features and  liquidation.  Shareholders  are entitled to one vote for each full
share held and fractional votes for fractional shares held.                     

A Fund generally is not required to hold meetings of its shareholders. Under the
Declaration of Trust of DWS Municipal Trust, however,  shareholder meetings will
be held in connection  with the following  matters to the extent and as provided
in the  Declaration of Trust and as required by applicable law: (a) the election
or  removal  of  trustees  if a meeting  is  called  for such  purpose;  (b) the
termination  of the Trust or a Fund;  (c) an  amendment  of the  Declaration  of
Trust;  and  (d)  such  additional  matters  as  may be  required  by  law,  the
Declaration of Trust,  the By-laws of a Fund, or any registration of a Fund with
the  SEC,  or as the  Trustees  may  determine  to be  necessary  or  desirable.
Shareholders also vote upon changes in fundamental policies or restrictions.    

Under  the  Declaration  of Trust of DWS Tax Free  Trust,  however,  shareholder
meetings will be held in connection with the following matters to the extent and
as provided in the  Declaration of Trust and as required by applicable  law: (a)
the election or removal of trustees if a meeting is called for such purpose; (b)
the  termination of the Trust or a Fund; (c) an amendment of the  Declaration of
Trust;  (d) to  the  same  extent  as  stockholders  of  Massachusetts  business
corporation as to whether or not a court action,  proceeding or claims should or
should not be brought or maintained  derivatively or as a class action on behalf
of the Trust or the Shareholders; (e) a merger, consolidation or sale of assets;
(f) the  adoption of an  investment  advisory or  management  contract;  (g) the
incorporation of the Trust or any series;  (h) any plan adopted pursuant to Rule
12b-1  (or any  successor  rule)  under the 1940  Act;  and (i) such  additional
matters as may be required by law, the  Declaration  of Trust,  the By-laws of a
Fund,  or any  registration  of a Fund  with the  SEC,  or as the  Trustees  may
determine to be necessary or desirable.  Shareholders  also vote upon changes in
fundamental policies or restrictions.                                           

The Declaration of Trust provides that shareholder  meeting quorum  requirements
shall be established  in the Trust's  By-laws.  The By-laws  currently in effect
provide that the presence in person or by proxy of the holders of thirty        

64

P-->497351st Page of 358TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 351st
percent of the shares entitled to vote at a meeting (or of an individual  series
or class if  required  to vote  separately)  shall  constitute  a quorum for the
transaction of business at meetings of shareholders of the Trust.               

On any  matter  submitted  to a vote of  shareholders,  all  shares of the Trust
entitled to vote shall,  except as otherwise provided in the Trust's By-Laws, be
voted in the aggregate as a single class without  regard to series or classes of
shares,  except (a) when required by applicable  law or when the Trustees  shall
have  determined that the matter affects one or more series or classes of shares
materially differently, shares shall be voted by individual series or class; and
(b) when the Trustees have determined that the matter affects only the interests
of one or more series or classes,  only  shareholders  of such series or classes
shall be entitled to vote thereon.                                              

The  Declaration  of Trust  provides  that the  Board of  Trustees  may,  in its
discretion,  establish  minimum  investment  amounts for  shareholder  accounts,
impose  fees on  accounts  that do not  exceed a minimum  investment  amount and
involuntarily  redeem  shares in any such  account in payment of such fees.  The
Board of Trustees,  in its sole  discretion,  also may cause the Trust to redeem
all of the  shares of the Trust or one or more  series  or  classes  held by any
shareholder for any reason, to the extent permissible by the 1940 Act, including
(a) if the  shareholder  owns shares having an aggregate net asset value of less
than a specified minimum amount, (b) if a particular  shareholder's ownership of
shares would disqualify a series from being a regulated  investment company, (c)
upon a shareholder's failure to provide sufficient  identification to permit the
Trust to verify the shareholder's  identity, (d) upon a shareholder's failure to
pay for  shares  or meet or  maintain  the  qualifications  for  ownership  of a
particular  class or series of shares,  (e) if the Board of Trustees  determines
(or pursuant to policies  established by the Board it is determined)  that share
ownership by a particular  shareholder is not in the best interests of remaining
shareholders, (f) when a Fund is requested or compelled to do so by governmental
authority or applicable law and (g) upon a shareholder's  failure to comply with
a request for  information  with respect to the direct or indirect  ownership of
shares of the  Trust.  The  Declaration  of Trust also  authorizes  the Board of
Trustees to terminate a Fund or any class without shareholder approval,  and the
Trust may  suspend  the right of  shareholders  to  require  the Trust to redeem
shares to the extent permissible under the 1940 Act.                            

Upon the  termination  of the Trust or any series,  after  paying or  adequately
providing for the payment of all liabilities which may include the establishment
of a liquidating  trust or similar  vehicle,  and upon receipt of such releases,
indemnities   and  refunding   agreements  as  they  deem  necessary  for  their
protection, the Trustees may distribute the remaining Trust property or property
of the series,  in cash or in kind or partly each,  to the  shareholders  of the
Trust or the series involved,  ratably  according to the number of shares of the
Trust or such  series  held by the  several  shareholders  of the  Trust or such
series on the date of termination,  except to the extent  otherwise  required or
permitted by the  preferences  and special or relative  rights and privileges of
any classes of shares of a series  involved,  provided that any  distribution to
the  shareholders  of a  particular  class  of  shares  shall  be  made  to such
shareholders  pro rata in  proportion to the number of shares of such class held
by  each  of  them.  The  composition  of any  such  distribution  (e.g.,  cash,
securities  or  other  assets)  shall  be  determined  by the  Trust in its sole
discretion, and may be different among shareholders (including differences among
shareholders in the same series or class).                                      

Under Massachusetts law,  shareholders of a Massachusetts  business trust could,
under certain  circumstances,  be held  personally  liable for  obligations of a
Fund. The Declaration of Trust,  however,  disclaims  shareholder  liability for
acts or obligations  of the Fund and requires that notice of such  disclaimer be
given in each agreement,  obligation,  or instrument entered into or executed by
the Fund or the Fund's trustees. Moreover, the Declaration of Trust provides for
indemnification  out of  Fund  property  for  all  losses  and  expenses  of any
shareholder held personally  liable for the obligations of the Fund and the Fund
may be  covered by  insurance  which the  Trustees  consider  adequate  to cover
foreseeable  tort claims.  Thus, the risk of a shareholder  incurring  financial
loss on account of shareholder liability is considered by the Advisor remote and
not  material,  since it is limited to  circumstances  in which a disclaimer  is
inoperative and the Fund itself is unable to meet its obligations.              

 PROXY VOTING GUIDELINES

Each Fund has delegated proxy voting responsibilities to its investment advisor,
subject to each Board's general oversight.  Each Fund has delegated proxy voting
to the Advisor with the direction that proxies should be voted  consistent  with
each  Fund's  best  economic  interests.  The  Advisor has adopted its own Proxy
Voting  Policies  and  Procedures  ("Policies"),  and  Proxy  Voting  Guidelines
("Guidelines")  for this  purpose.  The Policies  address,  among               

65

P-->497352nd Page of 358TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 352nd
other things, conflicts of interest that may arise between the interests of each
Fund, and the interests of the Advisor and its affiliates, including each Fund's
principal  underwriter.  The Guidelines set forth the Advisor's general position
on various proposals, such as:                                                  

o        Shareholder  Rights -- The Advisor  generally  votes against  proposals
that restrict shareholder rights.                             

o        Corporate  Governance -- The Advisor  generally votes for  confidential
         and cumulative voting and against supermajority voting requirements for
         charter and bylaw amendments. The Advisor generally votes for proposals
         to restrict a chief  executive  officer from serving on more than three
         outside  board  of  directors.  The  Advisor  generally  votes  against
         proposals  that  require a company  to  appoint  a  Chairman  who is an
independent director.                                         

o        Anti-Takeover Matters -- The Advisor generally votes for proposals that
         require shareholder ratification of poison pills or that request boards
         to redeem poison pills,  and votes against the adoption of poison pills
         if  they  are  submitted  for  shareholder  ratification.  The  Advisor
generally votes for fair price proposals.                     

o        Compensation  Matters -- The Advisor generally votes for executive cash
         compensation  proposals,  unless they are unreasonably  excessive.  The
         Advisor generally votes against stock option plans that do not meet the
Advisor's criteria.                                           

o        Routine Matters -- The Advisor  generally votes for the ratification of
         auditors,  procedural matters related to the annual meeting and changes
 in company name, and against bundled proposals and adjournment.

The general provisions described above do not apply to investment companies. The
Advisor generally votes proxies solicited by investment  companies in accordance
with the  recommendations  of an  independent  third  party,  except for proxies
solicited by or with respect to investment companies for which the Advisor or an
affiliate  serves as investment  advisor or principal  underwriter  ("affiliated
investment companies").  The Advisor votes affiliated investment company proxies
in  the  same  proportion  as  the  vote  of  the  investment   company's  other
shareholders  (sometimes called "mirror" or "echo" voting).  Master fund proxies
solicited from feeder funds are voted in accordance with applicable requirements
of the Investment Company Act of 1940.                                          

Although the  Guidelines  set forth the Advisor's  general  voting  positions on
various proposals,  the Advisor may, consistent with each Fund's best interests,
determine under some circumstances to vote contrary to those positions.         

The  Guidelines  on a  particular  issue  may or may  not  reflect  the  view of
individual  members of each Board or of a majority of each Board.  In  addition,
the  Guidelines  may  reflect a voting  position  that  differs  from the actual
practices of the public  companies  within the Deutsche Bank  organization or of
the  investment  companies  for  which the  Advisor  or an  affiliate  serves as
investment advisor or sponsor.                                                  

The  Advisor  may  consider  the views of a portfolio  company's  management  in
deciding how to vote a proxy or in establishing general voting positions for the
Guidelines, but management's views are not determinative.                       

As mentioned above, the Policies  describe the way in which the Advisor resolves
conflicts  of  interest.  To  resolve  conflicts,   the  advisor,  under  normal
circumstances,  votes proxies in accordance with its Guidelines.  If the Advisor
departs  from  the  Guidelines  with  respect  to a  particular  proxy or if the
Guidelines do not specifically  address a certain proxy proposal, a proxy voting
committee established by the advisor will vote the proxy. Before voting any such
proxy,  however,  the  Advisor's  conflicts  review  committee  will  conduct an
investigation to determine whether any potential  conflicts of interest exist in
connection with the particular proxy proposal. If the conflicts review committee
determines  that the Advisor has a material  conflict  of  interest,  or certain
individuals on the proxy voting committee  should be recused from  participating
in a  particular  proxy vote,  it will  inform the proxy  voting  committee.  If
notified  that the Advisor has a material  conflict,  or fewer than three voting
members are eligible to  participate  in the proxy vote,  typically  the Advisor
will  engage an  independent  third  party to vote the proxy or follow the proxy
voting recommendations of an independent third party.

Under certain circumstances,  the Advisor may not be able to vote proxies or the
Advisor  may find that the  expected  economic  costs from voting  outweigh  the
benefits  associated with voting. For example,  the Advisor may not vote proxies
on certain foreign securities due to local restrictions or customs.  The Advisor
generally  does  not vote  proxies  on  securities  subject  to  share  blocking
restrictions.

portfolio  securities  during the 12-month  period ended June 30 by visiting the

RATINGS OF INVESTMENTS
BOND AND COMMERCIAL PAPER RATINGS                                               

Set forth below are  descriptions of ratings which represent  opinions as to the
quality of the securities.  It should be emphasized,  however,  that ratings are
relative and subjective and are not absolute standards of quality.              

MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE, INC.'S -- CORPORATE BOND RATINGS                     

Aaa:  Bonds  which are rated Aaa are judged to be of the highest  quality.  They
carry the smallest  degree of investment  risk and are generally  referred to as
"gilt-edged."  Interest payments are protected by a large or by an exceptionally
stable margin and principal is secure. While the various protective elements are
likely to change,  such changes as can be visualized are most unlikely to impair
the fundamentally strong position of such issues.                               

Aa: Bonds which are rated Aa are judged to be of high quality by all  standards.
Together with the Aaa group they comprise what are generally known as high grade
bonds.  They are rated lower than the best bonds  because  margins of protection
may not be as large as in Aaa securities or fluctuations of protective  elements
may be of greater  amplitude or there may be other  elements  present which make
the long-term risk appear somewhat larger than in Aaa securities.               

A: Bonds which are rated A possess many favorable investment  attributes and are
to be considered as upper -medium grade obligations.  Factors giving security to
principal  and interest  are  considered  adequate,  but elements may be present
which suggest a susceptibility to impairment sometime in the future.            

Baa:  Bonds  which are rated Baa are  considered  as medium  grade  obligations,
(i.e., they are neither highly protected nor poorly secured).  Interest payments
and principal  security appear adequate for the present,  but certain protective
elements may be lacking or may be  characteristically  unreliable over any great
length of time. Such bonds lack outstanding  investment  characteristics  and in
fact have speculative characteristics as well.                                  

Ba:  Bonds  which are rated Ba are judged to have  speculative  elements;  their
future cannot be considered  as well assured.  Often the  protection of interest
and principal  payments may be very  moderate and thereby not well  safe-guarded
during  both  good  and bad  times  over the  future.  Uncertainty  of  position
characterizes bonds in this class.                                              

B:  Bonds  which are  rated B are  considered  speculative  and  generally  lack
characteristics of the desirable investment. Assurance of interest and principal
payments or of  maintenance  of other terms of the contract over any long period
of time may be small.                                                           

Caa:  Bonds  which are rated Caa are of poor  standing.  Such  issues  may be in
default or there may be present  elements of danger with respect to principal or
interest.                                                                       

Ca: Bonds which are rated Ca represent obligations which are highly speculative.
Such issues are often in default or have other marked shortcomings.             

C: Bonds which are rated C are the lowest rated class of bonds, typically are in
default and can be regarded as having extremely poor prospects of ever attaining
any real investment standing.                                                   

Note:  Moody's  appends  numerical  modifiers 1, 2 and 3 to each generic  rating
classification  from Aa through Caa in its  corporate  bond rating  system.  The
modifier 1  indicates  that the issue  ranks in the  higher  end of its  generic
rating category;  the modifier 2 indicates a mid-range ranking; and the modifier
3  indicates  that  the  issue  ranks in the  lower  end of its  generic  rating
category.

MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE, INC.'S -- SHORT-TERM RATINGS                         

Moody's  short-term debt ratings are opinions of the ability of issuers to honor
short-term financial obligations. Ratings may be assigned to issuers, short-term
programs  or  to  individual  short-term  debt  instruments.   Such  obligations
generally  have an original  maturity  not  exceeding  thirteen  months,  unless
explicitly noted.                                                               

Issuers  rated  Prime-1  or P-1 (or  supporting  institutions)  have a  superior
ability for repayment of short-term debt  obligations.  Prime-1 or P-1 repayment
ability will often be evidenced by many of the following characteristics:       

Leading market positions in well established industries.                        

High rates of return on funds employed.                                         

Conservative  capitalization  structure with moderate reliance on debt and ample
asset protection.                                                               

Broad margins in earnings  coverage of fixed financial charges and high internal
cash generation.                                                                

Well established  access to a range of financial  markets and assured sources of
alternate liquidity.                                                            

Issuers rated Prime-2 or P-2 (or supporting  institutions) have a strong ability
for repayment of short term debt obligations. This will normally be evidenced by
many of the characteristics cited above but to a lesser degree.  Earnings trends
and  coverage   ratios,   while  sound,   may  be  more  subject  to  variation.
Capitalization characteristics, while still appropriate, may be more affected by
external conditions. Ample alternate liquidity is maintained.                   

MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE, INC.'S -- MUNICIPAL SHORT-TERM RATINGS               

MIG.  Moody's  short-term debt ratings are opinions of the ability of issuers to
honor  short-term  financial  obligations.  Ratings  may be assigned to issuers,
short-term  programs  or  to  individual   short-term  debt  instruments.   Such
obligations  generally have an original maturity not exceeding  thirteen months,
unless explicitly noted.                                                        

Moody's: The highest ratings for state and municipal short-term  obligations are
"MIG 1," "MIG 2," and "MIG 3" (or "VMIG 1," "VMIG 2" and "VMIG 3" in the case of
an issue having a variable rate demand feature). Notes rated "MIG 1" or "VMIG 1"
are judged to be of the "best  quality".  Notes rated "MIG 2" or "VMIG 2" are of
"high  quality," with margins or protection  "ample  although not as large as in
the  preceding  group".  Notes  rated  "MIG  3" or  "VMIG  3" are of  "favorable
quality," with all security  elements  accounted for but lacking the strength of
the preceding grades.                                                           

STANDARD & POOR'S RATINGS SERVICES -- CORPORATE BOND RATINGS                    

INVESTMENT GRADE 

AAA:  Debt  rated  AAA  has the  highest  rating  assigned  by  S&P's  to a debt
obligation. Capacity to pay interest and repay principal is extremely strong.   

AA: Debt rated AA has a very strong capacity to pay interest and repay principal
and differs from the higher rated issues only in small degree.                  

A: Debt  rated A has a strong  capacity  to pay  interest  and  repay  principal
although it is somewhat more  susceptible  to the adverse  effects of changes in
circumstances and economic conditions than bonds in higher rated categories.    

BBB:  Debt  rated  BBB  has an  adequate  capacity  to pay  interest  and  repay
principal. Whereas it normally exhibits adequate protection parameters,  adverse
economic  conditions  or  changing  circumstances  are more  likely to lead to a
weakened  capacity to pay interest and repay principal for debt in this category
than in higher rated categories.

SPECULATIVE GRADE                                                               

Debt rated BB, B, CCC,  CC, and C has  significant  speculative  characteristics
with respect to capacity to pay interest and repay  principal.  BB indicates the
least degree of speculation and C the highest.  While such debt will likely have
some quality and  protective  characteristics,  these may be outweighed by large
uncertainties or major exposures to adverse conditions.                         

BB:  Debt  rated BB has less  near-term  vulnerability  to  default  than  other
speculative issues. However, it faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to
adverse  business,  financial,  or  economic  conditions  which  could  lead  to
inadequate capacity to meet timely interest and principal payments.             

The BB rating category is also used for debt subordinated to senior debt that is
assigned an actual or implied BBB- rating.                                      

B: Debt rated B has a greater  vulnerability  to default but  currently  has the
capacity to meet interest payments and principal  repayments.  Adverse business,
financial,  or economic conditions will likely impair capacity or willingness to
pay interest and repay principal.                                               

The B rating category is also used for debt  subordinated to senior debt that is
assigned an actual or implied BB or BB- rating.                                 

CCC:  Debt rated CCC has a current  vulnerability  to default,  and is dependent
upon  favorable  business,  financial,  and economic  conditions  to meet timely
payment  of  interest  and  repayment  of  principal.  In the  event of  adverse
business,  financial,  or  economic  conditions,  it is not  likely  to have the
capacity to pay interest and repay principal.                                   

The CCC rating  category is also used for debt  subordinated to senior debt that
is assigned an actual or implied B or B- rating.                                

CC: Debt rated CC has a current high vulnerability to default,  and is dependent
upon  favorable  business,  financial,  and economic  conditions  to meet timely
payment of interest and repayment of principal.                                 

The  rating CC is also  applied  to debt  subordinated  to senior  debt which is
assigned an actual or implied CCC debt rating.                                  

C: The rating C is typically  applied to debt  subordinated to senior debt which
is assigned an actual or implied CCC- debt  rating.  The C rating may be used to
cover a situation where a bankruptcy  petition has been filed,  but debt service
payments are continued.                                                         

C1: The Rating C1 is  reserved  for income  bonds on which no  interest is being
paid.                                                                           

D:  Debt  rated D is in  payment  default.  The D rating  category  is used when
interest payments or principal payments are not made on the date due even if the
applicable grace period has not expired,  unless Standard & Poor's believes that
such payments  will be made during such grace period.  The D rating also will be
used upon the filing of a  bankruptcy  petition  if debt  service  payments  are
jeopardized.                                                                    

Plus  (+) or  Minus  (-):  The  ratings  from AA to CCC may be  modified  by the
addition  of a plus or minus  sign to show  relative  standing  within the major
rating categories.                                                              

R:  Debt  rated  "R" is under  regulatory  supervision  owing  to its  financial
condition. During the pendency of the regulatory supervision, the regulators may
have the  power to  favor  one  class of  obligations  over  others  or pay some
obligations and not others.

N.R.: Bonds may lack a S&P's rating because no public rating has been requested,
because there is insufficient  information on which to base a rating, or because
S&P's does not rate a particular type of obligation as a matter of policy.      

STANDARD & POOR'S RATINGS SERVICES -- SHORT-TERM RATINGS                        

S&P's  commercial  paper rating is a current  assessment  of the  likelihood  of
timely payment of debt considered short-term in the relevant market.            

A-1: This highest category  indicates that the degree of safety regarding timely
payment is strong.  Those issues  determined to possess  extremely strong safety
characteristics are denoted with a plus (+) sign designation.                   

A-2:   Capacity  for  timely   payment  on  issues  with  this   designation  is
satisfactory.  However,  the  relative  degree  of  safety is not as high as for
issues designated A-1.                                                          

A-3: Issues carrying this designation have adequate capacity for timely payment.
However,  adverse economic conditions or changing  circumstances are more likely
to lead to a weakened capacity of the issuer to meet its financial commitments. 

FITCH INVESTORS SERVICE, INC. -- BOND RATINGS                                   

INVESTMENT GRADE 

AAA: Bonds  considered to be investment grade and of the highest credit quality.
The  obligor  has an  exceptionally  strong  ability to pay  interest  and repay
principal, which is unlikely to be affected by reasonably foreseeable events.   

AA: Bonds considered to be investment grade and of very high credit quality. The
obligor's  ability to pay interest and repay principal is very strong,  although
not quite as strong as bonds rated AAA. Bonds rated in the AAA and AA categories
are not significantly vulnerable to foreseeable events.                         

A: Bonds  considered  to be  investment  grade and of high credit  quality.  The
obligor's  ability to pay  interest  and repay  principal  is  considered  to be
strong, but may be more vulnerable to adverse changes in economic conditions and
circumstances than bonds with higher ratings.                                   

BBB: Bonds  considered to be investment  grade and of good credit  quality.  The
obligor's  ability to pay  interest  and repay  principal  is  considered  to be
adequate. Adverse changes in economic conditions and circumstances, however, are
more likely to have adverse impact on these bonds, and therefore,  impair timely
payment.  The  likelihood  that the  ratings  of these  bonds  will  fall  below
investment grade is higher than for bonds with higher ratings.                  

SPECULATIVE GRADE                                                               

BB: Bonds are considered speculative.  The obligor's ability to pay interest and
repay principal may be affected over time by adverse economic changes.  However,
business or  financial  alternatives  may be  available  which could  assist the
obligor in satisfying its debt service requirements.                            

B:  Bonds are  considered  highly  speculative.  While  bonds in this  class are
currently meeting debt service requirements, the probability of continued timely
payment of principal  and  interest  reflects the  obligor's  limited  margin of
safety and the need for reasonable business and economic activity throughout the
life of the issue.                                                              

CCC: Bonds have certain identifiable characteristics which, if not remedied, may
lead to  default.  The  ability to meet  obligations  requires  an  advantageous
business and economic environment.                                              

CC:  Bonds are  minimally  protected.  Default  in payment  of  interest  and/or
principal seems probable over time.                                             

71

P-->497Last Page of 358TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 358th
C: Bonds are in imminent default in payment of interest or principal.           

DDD, DD, and D: Bonds are in default of interest and/or principal payments. Such
bonds  are  extremely  speculative  and  should  be valued on the basis of their
ultimate  recovery value in liquidation or  reorganization  of the obligor.  DDD
represents the highest  potential for recovery on these bonds,  and D represents
the lowest potential for recovery.                                              

Plus (+) or Minus (-): The ratings from AA to CC may be appended by the addition
of a plus or  minus  sign to  denote  the  relative  status  within  the  rating
category.

FITCH INVESTORS SERVICE, INC. -- SHORT-TERM RATINGS                             

Fitch's  short-term ratings apply to debt obligations that are payable on demand
or have original maturities of generally up to three years, including commercial
paper, certificates of deposit,  medium-term notes, and municipal and investment
notes.                                                                          

F-1+:  Exceptionally  Strong  Credit  Quality.  Issues  assigned this rating are
regarded as having the strongest capacity for timely payment.                   

F-1: Very Strong Credit Quality.  Issues assigned this rating reflect a capacity
for timely payment only slightly less than issues rated F-1+.                   

F-2:  Good Credit  Quality.  Issues  assigned  this  rating have a  satisfactory
capacity  for  timely  payment,  but the margin of safety is not as great as the
F-1+ and F-1 categories.                                                        

F-3:  Fair Credit  Quality.  Issues  assigned  this rating have  characteristics
suggesting that the capacity for timely payment is adequate;  however, near-term
adverse changes could cause these securities to be rated below investment grade.

B:  Speculative.  Minimal capacity for timely payment of financial  commitments,
plus  vulnerability  to  near-term  adverse  changes in  financial  and economic
conditions.                                                                     

C: High  default  risk.  Default is a real  possibility.  Capacity  for  meeting
financial commitments is solely reliant upon a sustained, favorable business and
economic environment.                                                           

D: Default. Denotes actual or imminent payment default.
