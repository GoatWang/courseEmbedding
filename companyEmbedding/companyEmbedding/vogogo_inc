The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve 
              
              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.              
              
            

12:40 p.m. July 28, 2017






What a constant stream of oil company spending cuts means for crude prices
              
              Oil companies are sounding a recurring theme: lower exploration and production spending estimates. Will that lead to a rally in oil prices?              
              
            

5:47 p.m. July 27, 2017






Put your money where your mindset is

Beyond Tesla: 7 stocks driving the autonomous car revolution
              
              Look at these component manufacturers rather than the car companies, says Jeff Reeves.

These 7 highly taxed companies need Congress to finally act on tax reform
              
              It wasn’t Trump’s “movement” that lifted stocks late last year, says Jeff Reeves. It was the promise of lower corporate tax rates.

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks 
              
              Still, a chart of the S&P 500 reveals an undercurrent of bullishness, says Lawrence G. McMillan.

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

Dollar turns lower for the week following GDP report
              
              The U.S. dollar fell on Friday, erasing its gains for the week after a read on economic growth came in below expectations, though analysts said the beleaguered currency was potentially nearing a bottom.              
              
            

3:47 p.m. July 28, 2017






Dollar rises from 13-month low
              
              The U.S. dollar rises on Thursday, gaining against major rivals in what analysts suggest a mild consolidation following precipitous declines over recent weeks.

Bitcoin Exchange Celery Partners with Vogogo Inc. to Expand to Canada

by Joseph Young 
   Sep 10, 2015  5:30 PM EST









New York-based bitcoin exchange Celery has integrated the products of Vogogo risk management and bank/payment verification platform to enable Canadian residents to exchange between bitcoin and fiat currencies. Celery was founded in 2013 and has been funded by Draper Associates and BoostVC.
Celery supports more than 10,000 users in the United States and has processed more than $2 million in volume since its launch in early 2015.
Due to its success in the U.S., the company has decided to launch its services in Canada with the integration of Vogogo’s bank verification API and risk-management technologies.
“This release marks the first expansion of Celery outside the U.S. Vogogo’s unified payments, risk and bank verification API enabled Celery’s Canadian integration to be straightforward and exceptionally fast. Snowbirds, Canadian professionals and businesses who make cross-border payments in U.S. and Canada, now have a new and highly-accessible bitcoin-based option,” said Celery co-founder Divya Thakur.
Over the past few months, leading bitcoin startups and exchanges, including BitPay, ChangeTip, Genesis Global Trading and Zinger, have integrated the technologies and APIs of Vogogo to protect themselves from money-laundering attempts with advanced decision-making technology.
“Vogogo continues to position itself as a pivotal partner to the crypto industry’s largest and most influential companies as well as new, smart and dynamic organizations like Celery which are scaling rapidly and experiencing significant growth. We’re immensely excited to be working with each of these groups and helping to solidify the global crypto ecosystem,” said Vogogo CEO Geoff Gordon.

                            Vogogo Raises $8.5 Million to Boost Bitcoin Exchange Security

Calgary-based online payment services provider Vogogo, a platform that automates payment processing, regulatory compliance and risk management for businesses, including clients in the bitcoin and digital currency sector, has raised $8.5m in new funding.
The round was led by Cormark Securities Inc and included Beacon Securities Limited, Canaccord Genuity Corp, Clarus Securities and Salmon Partners, with the capital aimed at helping the company expand its service beyond Canada to the US and Europe.
Speaking to CoinDesk, Vogogo CSO Rodney Thompson said that his firm has become more actively involved in the digital currency space, owing to the need of the industry's businesses for a partner that can handle fiat compliance and the associated fraud mitigation responsibilities that coincide with these offerings.
Thompson told CoinDesk that most of his firm's partners are digital currency exchanges that have turned to Vogogo to handle their risk management, know your customer (KYC), anti-money laundering (AML), fraud mitigation and dispute resolution needs, explaining:
"Our banking partners are willing to work with us so we can put our payment processing behind that. It's been proven that [the digital currency industry] is trying to put its best foot forward, but people are having a difficult time with managing the platform side of it."
Thompson indicates that Vogogo has become a valuable third-party partner that allows digital currency businesses to mitigate fraud in real time, without having to build in-house systems that meet this need.
Now, Thompson indicated, his firm is looking to build on this success to perform similar services to digital currency companies operating outside of Canada, adding:
"For us, it's just about growth, taking what we've been doing in Canada and expanding out globally. From our side, we're specializing this piece of what we do for the crypto industry, for crypto businesses."
Early market entrance
Thompson indicated that though Vogogo and its employees have had an internal interest in bitcoin for some time, as the company's CTO was an early and active bitcoin miner.
Despite the familiarity, it wasn't until the June 2013 closure of LibertyBit, then the second-largest exchange in Canada, that the company became convinced it could serve a real business need in the budding industry.
Thompson recalls:
"LibertyBit really stands out to me, because they were ran into a problem where they were doing online bank maintenance and they thought they were indemnified, and of course there really is no such thing as an indemnified payment, and they went down. So, it was then that you were just starting to see the issues around it."
This development, as well as similar shutdowns from other major exchanges, pushed Vogogo to look more closely at the opportunity. After about three months of development, Vogogo tailored its offering to the digital currency space and began serving the market.
How Vogogo works
Thompson revealed Vogogo is currently working on a new product release that will allow it to handle KYC, AML and compliance requirements for digital currency exchanges.
"We [will] do the ongoing fraud mitigation. So, we will set the customer with their payment and all the ongoing fraud mitigation around it," Thompson said. "What that means is we'll manage all your bad debt, any fraud scenarios that happen, we manage all that."

Vogogo doesn't actually handle bitcoins or altcoins for its clients. Instead, Vogogo ensures that fiat payments are managed correctly, limiting its clients' risk for chargebacks and the other previously mentioned issues that come with the responsibility for customer funds.
Thompson added: "When an end user gets to that exchange to deal in bitcoin or altcoin, that's on the exchange. When they want to take whatever they've sold and move the fiat back into the currency of their choice, that's also on [the exchange."
No pivot needed
Thompson said that while Vogogo is happy to serve clients in the digital currency space, extending its services to this community doesn't necessitate a fundamental change in its business. Vogogo had historically served e-commerce platforms, and continues to do so.
Rather, Thompson indicated that all Vogogo needed to do was gear its existing offerings to the needs of the space while capitalizing on existing expertise.
He continued:
"We've always dealt in secondary payment options, and that being payments that aren't credit card related, and because of that, we've always had a risk engine in front of those payments."
When asked about potential upcoming digital currency regulation in Canada, the CSO said that this, too, won't require Vogogo to shift or change its product offering.
"For us, we have a really strong payments team, we have a really strong risk management team, legal team, so we're constantly adapting what we do on the shifts, regulatory or other. If there is a change on the regulatory side that we need to address, it's pretty easy for us to make those changes and to make our platforms compliant."
Expanding to new markets
As for the funding, Thompson indicated that it will be necessary given the company's desire to enter new markets in Europe and North America, especially owing to the expense of expanding a risk platform globally.
This expansion, Thompson said, will require Vogogo's payment solutions to be customized and integrated with domestic banks.
Thompson concluded:
"We take working with our banking partners and any regulatory requirements very seriously, we don't cut any corners. [If] we're set up to be somewhere, it's all set up properly."
