Pre-IPO Insider: Your Shot At Being A Baller


January 26, 2017, 12:30:00 PM EDT
By Joseph Hogue, StreetAuthority









































Shutterstock photo


  This is BIG... For the first time since 1933, the SEC is now   allowing regular people like you and me to invest in brand-new   explosive-growth companies BEFORE THEY GO PUBLIC. Imagine getting   in on the next Facebook for 33 cents a share or the next Apple at   78 cents. In StreetAuthority's    Pre-IPO Millionaire   , I vet six to eight deals like this one each month, and   offer my exclusive in-depth analysis of a single opportunity that   I believe could return 1,000% or more.   Click here for more information    . -- Joseph Hogue, CFA  Where do billionaires put their money? That's 10-digits' worth of money to invest, probably more than   you ever dreamed you would have. You might as well have fun with   it, right? For many of the billionaires in Forbes' annual list of the   richest people in the world, their idea of fun -- or prestige, at   least -- is owning a professional sports team. According to ESPN,   billionaires in North America own 20 NBA teams, 19 NFL   franchises, 10 NHL organizations and eight MLB teams. Microsoft billionaires Steve Ballmer (Los Angeles Clippers)   and Paul Allen (Seattle Seahawks and Portland Trail Blazers) are   on the list, as is real estate mogul Stephen Ross (Miami   Dolphins). Of course, don't forget the flamboyant Mark Cuban   (Dallas Mavericks). But unless you're able to put down at least a few million for   a team, your options are limited. Main Street investors can buy   shares of Madison Square Garden Co. (NYSE:   MSG    ), owner of the New York Knicks (NBA) and the New York Rangers   (NHL). The stock has done well, with a 42% annualized gain over   the last five years, but each share at $169.68 buys you just   0.000004% of the company... hardly enough to get you on   center-court. But that is all about to change. There's a new professional   league coming to town, and with it your chance to own a team with   players straight out of the NBA. You can't buy shares in the stock market. This is still a   private company. But you can get a piece of the action as a pre-IPO   investor.  This Investment Could Make You A Baller     The Champions Basketball League begins its first regular season   in July in 16 major cities including Chicago, Miami, Dallas and   Los Angeles. An average ticket price of nearly $100 for NBA games   drove the league's creation as a way to bring professional   basketball back to the fans with ticket prices that start at less   than $15 each. The   Gotham Ballers    is in the league's biggest market, New York City, and it's giving   ordinary investors like you and me the chance to get in on the   action.    According to Forbes, the average NBA team has increased in   value 10-fold over the past 20 years. All players in the new Champions Basketball League have been   recruited straight out of the NBA for games that will be exciting   and affordable to millions of fans. The league has secured an   ESPN broadcast deal and has already gotten strong reviews for   exhibition games. Early investors in the Gotham Ballers include an impressive   list of venture capital and sports franchise investors. The   equity crowdfunding campaign gets you in at $7.00 per share with   a $140 minimum investment. The campaign launched on the   StartEngine platform and has already raised $34,000 from 107   investors. Besides the investment upside, investor perks include premium   seats, jerseys and the opportunity to meet the team.    As with all investments, I encourage you to do your own due   diligence. I haven't yet done the detailed market and valuation   analysis on the Gotham Ballers that I do for the companies   featured in     Pre-IPO Millionaire      but the team could be a real fan-favorite and a great opportunity   for investors.

The company expects to make about $3 million in 2017
This is a high-risk investment and the valuation is steep. On the flip side, as Forbes reported, the average NBA team has gone up in value over ten-fold in the past 20 years.
The league already has a broadcast deal with ESPN.

Can the Gotham Ballers beat the Knicks?
Former Knick Al Harrington won’t go that far, but thinks the new Champions Basketball League product will serve as summer itch for NBA-starved fans.
The concept of the upstart 16-team semi-pro league to debut in July has changed over the past year. Instead of dawning as an over-30 league for former NBA players, age is no longer a requirement. The only résumé requirement is being on an NBA training camp roster sometime during the previous three years.
Gotham’s roster is not yet complete, but Harrington is expected to be joined by ex-Knick and Net Kenyon Martin, ex-Sun Shawn Marion, Brooklyn product/former Pacers point guard Jamaal Tinsley, ex-Knick Renaldo Balkman, Chris Smith, J.R. Smith’s brother who had a cup of coffee with the Knicks, and Anthony Mason Jr., son of the former Knicks tough guy who played at St. John’s.
According to a league source, Gotham is recruiting ex-Knick point guard Nate Robinson, who currently is lobbying to join the Cavaliers.
Kenyon MartinCharles Wenzelberg
“It’s quality — getting guys who are in shape and still passionate to play basketball, guys who are going to take it seriously,” Harrington told The Post. “At the end of the day, we’ll put on a real good product out there at a time in the dead of summer when nothing’s going on as a supplement. It should be right at the level of the D-League.”
But with a lot more name recognition. Gotham will play its two-month season at the newly remodeled Nassau Coliseum as well as Barclays Center. The Nets may step into a managerial role for Gotham.
The 16 teams are owned by the league for now. But Gotham is in the process of having fans be able to buy shares of stock in the franchise. Part of the player’s salary also will be stock options.
In an attempt to market to kids, fans will be allowed to take photos with the players before and after games. Ticket prices will be around $35-$40.
“That will have a huge impact, having former All-Stars with name recognition definitely helps this league,” Harrington said. “We’ve rounded up guys who are still in great shape and have basketball left.”
Harrington, the Jersey native who played for the Knicks from 2008-10, played professionally last year in Australia, but only for a month. Can he make an NBA roster?

“Of course I could,’’ said Harrington, 36. “But probably for 50 games and playoffs.”
Harrington said he is “pretty close’’ to being in game shape, but will have a tough time keeping up in practice with Marion.
“Shawn is one of the guys forever will be in shape no matter what,” said Harrington, who will make a league promotional appearance at the Garden on Friday during the Knicks game with the Hornets.
Walt Frazier and Earl Monroe have lent their names as Gotham’s team presidents. Former Syracuse star and former Knicks first-rounder John Wallace will be head coach. Wallace never has coached.
“That’s the cool thing about the league, it’s giving a chance to guys who still want to be connected to the game but haven’t had a chance,” Harrington said.
The Champions League organizers believes it will fill a void.
“We saw an opportunity to play in established NBA markets during the summer months, because there is no nationwide competitive men’s basketball league for hoops fans during that time,” said Carl George, CEO of the CBL. “We’ve found that fans of basketball love to watch the sport all year round, not just during the season.”
And who knows, after the disasters the Knicks and Nets have become, the town may finally have a winning men’s basketball team.
“Our team is built very nicely to be successful,” Harrington said.
Gotham Ballers roster
Al Harrington: The 15-year NBA veteran played 140 games with the Knicks over a two-season span, averaging 19.2 points. Age: 36.
Kenyon Martin: Martin’s 15 years in the NBA included four with the then New Jersey Nets and two with the Knicks. Age: 39.
Shawn Marion: Unorthodox shooter spent 16 seasons in the NBA, making four All-Star teams. Age: 38.
Chris Smith: J.R. Smith’s brother played in two games for the Knicks in 2013. Age: 29.
Kareem Rush: First-round pick of the Lakers in 2002, played in 346 NBA games. Age: 36.
Daniel Gibson: Second-round pick of the Cavaliers played seven seasons before leaving the NBA to pursue a rap career. Age: 30.
Tyshawn Taylor: Second-round pick of the Trail Blazers who was traded to the Nets, playing in just 61 games. Age: 26.
Jamaal Tinsley: First-round pick of the Pacers, played in 547 games over 11 NBA seasons. Age: 38.
Renaldo Balkman: Isiah Thomas’ first-round pick for the Knicks in 2006 played in 150 games while in New York. Age: 32.
Anthony Mason Jr.: Son of the late Knicks great Anthony Mason, Mason Jr. played four seasons for St. John’s. Age: 30.

                                            less than two months left to invest, $140 is a cheap price to be a partial owner!

                                            Looks like a cool concept but if you get to the real basketball lovers they would start buying this up hardcore IMO

Smith, Tinsley and Harrington will play for the New York City-based Gotham Ballers, a team that has Walt Frazier and Earl "The Pearl" Monroe in their front office. But while Frazier and Monroe are managing the team, fans can actually become owners of the Ballers by buying shares of stock. These owners and fans will get exclusive benefits, and it's one way how the Champions League is truly embracing being a fan-friendly league.The fan and community aspect is one of the main reasons Harrington has decided to play in the Champions League. He has been linked to the Big 3 league as well but Harrington is "on the fence" about actually playing, prioritizing the Champions League instead.Harrington spoke with CBS Sports about the Ballers, the Champions League and his 16-year NBA career (this interview has been edited and condensed):What attracted you to the Champions League?Al Harrington: I thought it was a great opportunity for older players to continue doing what they love. I think a lot of us retired before we were actually ready, but this gives us the opportunity to still go out and get those competitive juices out of our system. And the main reason I wanted to be a part of [the Champions League] is because the league is very community-oriented and that really hit home for me.Was the fact that you'd be playing in front of fans one reason why you decided to play?AH: Yeah man, it's a huge difference. When you go to a gym and there's nobody there, it's not the same as playing in front of 20,000 people. When you got fans cheering and booing, it gets different emotions going in your body and makes it a lot more fun.Who are going to be some of your teammates on the Gotham Ballers?AH: We are still building the roster out, but right now: Jamaal Tinsley, Chris Smith, Josh Childress, Kenyon Martin and Shawn Marion.And is this going to be similar to the NBA? Like, are you guys going to practice and run plays?AH: I think we are going to have practices the night before games and we are also going to have a training camp and different things like that. During the season, recovery and keeping in shape is on us but at this point, we all know how to do that. We can do it in our sleep.Was the chance to reconnect with some of your former teammates and rivals in that locker room type of setting another reason why you joined the Champions League?AH: That wasn't one of the main reasons but I definitely missed it. I sit at home sometimes watching games and start to think about some of the stories and events that happened in my career. The locker room was just entertaining as the games. With these guys, all we do is reminiscence about when we played against each other or when we dunked on each other and different things.You were drafted out of high school. At that time, did you think you would have such a long career?AH: No, man. My story is kind of funny, I didn't start playing basketball until I was essentially in high school. I never dreamed about playing in the NBA as a kid but coach made me play because I was 6-foot-4. And I fell in love with the game and the game fell in love with me back, so I was able to have a great career that I will never forget. I'm just blessed to have played for such a long time in the greatest league in the world.During your career, who had the greatest impact on you?AH: Antonio Davis, he took me under his wing from Day 1. He taught me everything I know. He taught me how to pay my taxes, write a check, manage my bank account and he taught me how to work. He made sure I was the first in the gym, and the last one to leave. He taught me the type of work ethic needed to survive in the NBA.Regret is a strong word but if you could change or do something different in your career, what would it be?AH: If I had one regret, I wish I never left Indiana, I should've been a Pacer for life. I left thinking that the grass would be greener on the other side and it wasn't. But it still worked out for me, I was able to play for a lot of great teams with a lot of different players that I still have relationships with. It's not a real regret, but sometimes I wish I wore just one uniform my whole career.Those Pacers teams with Jermaine O'Neal, Ron Artest and you were very good, why do you think you guys could never take the next step? Was it just because the Pistons were that good?AH:  We were just young. That's why I said it was kind of a regret because if we all stayed together maybe two more years, we could've gotten a championship during that era. It was right there for us. Even the year that I left and they had [the Malice at the Palace], I think that year even without me, they had a good chance of winning the championship. It is what it is. It was just an experience thing and the Pistons had a little bit more experience than we did. We were right there but what could you do?Are you surprised that Metta World Peace has shifted to more of a mentoring role in the later stages of his career?AH: The thing about Ron is that he is one of the most sincere, real guys you will ever be around. So despite all of the crazy s--- he used to do, you always respected him. And you just knew that if you got in a pinch, he would be there for you. That's invaluable and I think the Lakers see that in him and that's the reason why he's still playing.You also played with Carmelo Anthony, who seems to be always the subject of some sort of controversy. How was he as a teammate?AH: Melo is a good teammate. I never had any issues with him and he never had any issues with anybody in the locker room. He always got his work in, so you respect him from that standpoint and he came to play at a high level every night. Some people may have issues on how he played but from a teammate standpoint, we understood who he was and we valued him for that. I think that's the key to playing with a guy like Melo. Instead of trying to figure out what's wrong with him, you have to embrace his strengths.You also played with Stephen Jackson, who recently said he got high before games. Did that really happen?AH: I could only report on what I saw and I never saw him high before a game. I think he's bulls------- and I don't think he ever did that.One of the stranger moments in your career was when you got two technicals against the Clippers for hanging on the rim when you played for the Knicks. In both cases, the Knicks had the lead and then ended up losing to the Clippers. Do you remember those instances and what happened there?AH: Yeah, I remember. All I know is I see guys hang on the rim way longer than I did so that's just a ref calling what they wanted to call, when they feel like calling it. I see LeBron hanging on the rim, pulling himself up on it and they don't call it. That's such a high-school call. I don't even know why they call that in the NBA. A Note from your Ballers: Some things never change, here is Al hanging around at our last practice.

          Coach Wallace Plans to Win the 1st Championship.

Thanks to the SB Nation, Ridiculous Upside and Jasmine D Brow for their fantastic feature on John Wallace and the Gotham Ballers.  The Future is Bright for the Gotham Ballers and the Champions Basketball League.FULL STORY TEXT: In 2015, The Champions Basketball League was announced, featuring a whole crop of former NBA players that would be playing on 16 individual teams.Die hard basketball fans are definitely in or a treat, for when the NBA Finals are over, they are ushered in to more basketball. This time being former players they have known to love.On August 2016, the Champions Basketball League introduced their New York area team, the Gotham Ballers. The roster includes the following: Al Harrington, Kenyon Martin, Shawn Marion, Kareem Rush, Tyshawn Taylor, Jamaal Tinsley, Daniel Gibson, Chris Smith, Anthony Mason Jr and Renaldo Balkman. Perhaps even more intriguing than their roster is how the team is currently offering fans an opportunity to invest in a piece of the Gotham Ballers.The Gotham Ballers has a lot of former standouts, and will be coached by former Knicks forward John Wallace. He describes being the head coach for the team as “incredible.” It’s an amazing opportunity for myself, my family and my friends, said the 2x Syracuse first team All-Big East player.Wallace was elated in talking about the format for the season and said he is ready to get his season started.“It’s going to have more of an All-Star game feel to it. It’s going to be a lot of offensive fire power going on. It’s going to be fun family friendly exciting basketball and I just cant wait for the first game; just roll out the carpet and get this season on its way.The goals for Wallace and the Champions Basketball League were simple, yet inspiring, and that is to be a part of one of the best basketball leagues in the world.“We’re going to have the best league under the NBA, Wallace said. “The NBA is obviously the creme de la creme, that’s the best league in the world for basketball. The Champions League will be second best and were going to prove that.”It’s obvious that Coach Wallace’s mentality is about winning, and he seems to still present to that old school flair of a winning mindset that was around in his days of basketball.When asked about the goals of the Gotham Ballers, Wallace stated that the goals will always remain the same for years to come.“The goal is always the same. We plan on winning the first championship in Champions League History. That’s the focus of the Gotham Ballers from day 1 of training camp. We’re thinking about the championship that’s going to be everyday. We’re going to practice like we’re ready for the championship, we’re going to play like we’re getting ready for the championship and that’s the only way to win the championship.”“We’re going to set a very high standard with Gotham Ballers and that’s going to always remain the same, not just the first year or second year, but every year. That’s going going to be the precedence that’s going to be set. Every team that follows and every player that follows is going to fall into that same precedence.”The Gotham Ballers is slated to play a 14 game schedule and will start this July and August.Coach Wallace means business and if his goals and achievements are executed perfectly, the Gotham Ballers would be the team to look out for and possibly the team to put the Champions Basketball League on the map. If that’s the case, basketball fans would sure be able to look forward to, as they’ll be able to see the splash of former talent quench their basketball thirst for the rest of their summer.Here is the link to the story:http://www.ridiculousupside.com/2017/1/26/14393366/champions-basketball-league-nba-john-wallace- We are with you Coach Wallace - #MakeHistory

Here is the Text: Can the Gotham Ballers beat the Knicks?Former Knick Al Harrington won’t go that far, but thinks the new Champions Basketball League product will serve as summer itch for NBA-starved fans.The concept of the upstart 16-team semi-pro league to debut in July has changed over the past year. Instead of dawning as an over-30 league for former NBA players, age is no longer a requirement. The only résumé requirement is being on an NBA training camp roster sometime during the previous three years.Gotham’s roster is not yet complete, but Harrington is expected to be joined by ex-Knick and Net Kenyon Martin, ex-Sun Shawn Marion, Brooklyn product/former Pacers point guard Jamaal Tinsley, ex-Knick Renaldo Balkman, Chris Smith, J.R. Smith’s brother who had a cup of coffee with the Knicks, and Anthony Mason Jr., son of the former Knick tough guy who played at St. John’s.According to a league source, Gotham is recruiting ex-Knick point guard Nate Robinson, who currently is lobbying to join the Cavaliers.“It’s quality — getting guys who are in shape and still passionate to play basketball, guys who are going to take it seriously,” Harrington told The Post. “At the end of the day, we’ll put on a real good product out there at a time in the dead of summer when nothing’s going on as a supplement. It should be right at the level of the D-League.”But with a lot more name recognition. Gotham will play its two-month season at the newly remodeled Nassau Coliseum as well as Barclays Center. The Nets may step into a managerial role for Gotham.The 16 teams are owned by the league for now. But Gotham is in the process of having fans be able to buy shares of stock in the franchise. Part of the player’s salary also will be stock options.In an attempt to market to kids, fan will be allowed to take photos with the players before and after games. Ticket prices will be around $35-$40.“That will have a huge impact, having former All-Stars with name recognition definitely helps this league,” Harrington said. “We’ve rounded up guys who are still in great shape and have basketball left.”Harrington, the Jersey native who played for the Knicks from 2008-10, played professionally last year in Australia, but only for a month. Can he make an NBA roster?“Of course I could,’’ Harrington said. “But probably for 50 games and playoffs.”Harrington said he is “pretty close’’ to being in game shape but will have a tough time keeping up in practice with Marion.“Shawn is one of the guys forever will be in shape no matter what,” said Harrington, who will make a league promotional appearance at the Garden on Friday during the Knicks game with the Hornets.Walt Frazier and Earl Monroe have lent their names as Gotham’s team presidents. Former Syracuse star and former Knicks first-rounder John Wallace will be head coach. Wallace never has coached.“That’s the cool thing about the league, it’s giving a chance to guys who still want to be connected to the game but haven’t had a chance,” Harrington said.The Champions League organizers believes it will fill a void.“We saw an opportunity to play in established NBA markets during the summer months, because there is no nationwide competitive men’s basketball league for hoops fans during that time,” said Carl George, CEO of the CBL. “We’ve found that fans of basketball love to watch the sport all year round, not just during the season.”And who knows, after the disasters the Knicks and Nets have become, the town may finally have a winning men’s basketball team.“Our team is built very nicely to be successful,” Harrington said.Gotham Ballers’ rosterAl Harrington: The 15-year NBA veteran played 140 games with the Knicks over a two-season span, averaging 19.2 points.Kenyon Martin: Martin’s 15 years in the NBA included four with the then New Jersey Nets and two with the Knicks.Shawn Marion: Unorthodox shooter spent 16 seasons in the NBA, making four All-Star teams.Chris Smith: J.R. Smith’s brother played in two games for the Knicks in 2013.Kareem Rush: First-round pick of the Lakers in 2002, played in 346 NBA games.Daniel Gibson: Second-round pick of the Cavaliers played seven seasons before leaving the NBA to pursue a rap career.Tyshawn Taylor: Second-round pick of the Trail Blazers who was traded to the Nets, playing in just 61 games.Jamaal Tinsley: First-round pick of the Pacers, played in 547 games over 11 NBA seasons.Renaldo Balkman: Isaiah Thomas’ first-round pick for the Knicks in 2006 played in 150 games while in New York.Anthony Mason Jr.: Son of the late Knicks’ great Anthony Mason, Mason Jr. played four seasons for St. John’s.GOTHAM'S NOTE: Thanks to Gotham Baller Al Harrington, We are really big Fans Al and NY Post/Marc Berman - See you this summer, Thank You.
