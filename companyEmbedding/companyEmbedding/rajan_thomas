Tell me, what is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life?



I believe I can fly.
		
		Comfortably.
And so should everyone else.
Only a half-century ago, it took my grandfather over a month to make the journey here from India by ship. It was the only means of travel he could afford. 
Today, I can travel half way around the world in less than a day — all thanks to the marvel that is flight.
This wonder has driven me thus far — from the little boy who often stared longingly through airport windows at planes soaring to parts unknown, to the determined professional who decided where in the world those planes would fly to. 
I will commit myself to rebuilding an industry one airline at a time to where value isn't just a fair ticket price or a healthy balance sheet, but where customers and employees are treated with dignity and respect as well.
To lift nations to the heights of their economic promise by expanding their reach across borders through sound and just aviation and trade policy. 
I will commit myself to make flying accessible to all and take us to places we never dreamed possible. To see each other as never before, so that despite our boundless diversity, we recognize the essence of our shared humanity.
To restore the magic of the journey once again and allow people to soar and see the world from our Creator's perspective, where even if only for a few fleeting moments, our problems seem so small. 
Or even perhaps catch a glimpse of His smile in a star-lit night sky.
So come, take my hand.
Won't you fly with me?
— Thomas Rajan



Class of 2009
