Merck Announces Appointment of Robert M. Davis as Chief Financial 
      Officer; Succeeds Peter N. Kellogg, Who Has Served in the Role Since 2007






March 27, 2014 07:20 AM Eastern Daylight Time



WHITEHOUSE STATION, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Merck (NYSE:MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, 
      today announced the appointment of Robert M. Davis, 47, as executive 
      vice president and chief financial officer, effective April 23, 2014. 
      Davis, who will also oversee corporate strategy and corporate business 
      development, will succeed Peter N. Kellogg, 58. After having made 
      significant contributions to the company as Merck’s CFO since 2007, 
      Kellogg will work closely with Davis to ensure a seamless transition and 
      will leave Merck on May 16.
    


      "Rob is an accomplished executive with significant financial and 
      operational expertise, including as a CFO, and will be an exceptional 
      addition to our team,” said Kenneth C. Frazier, chairman and chief 
      executive officer, Merck. “Rob’s broad, global business and healthcare 
      experience, which encompasses commercial, R&D, quality, regulatory, 
      manufacturing and supply chain, will be an asset to us in implementing a 
      significantly streamlined, more flexible cost structure and operating 
      model, while enabling us to focus on our highest-potential growth 
      opportunities.”
    

      Davis is corporate vice president and president of Baxter’s Medical 
      Products business where he oversaw the successful integration of that 
      company’s Global Medication Delivery and Renal businesses, along with 
      corporate manufacturing and R&D functions, into a single, integrated 
      division, improving R&D productivity and eliminating significant costs. 
      Prior to his current role, Davis served as corporate vice president and 
      president of Baxter’s Renal business, as corporate vice president and 
      chief financial officer from May of 2006 through May of 2010, and as 
      treasurer from 2004 through May of 2006. Davis joined Baxter as 
      treasurer in 2004 after more than 14 years at Eli Lilly and Company.
    

      "It is a tremendous opportunity to join Merck at such an exciting time,” 
      said Davis. “Merck’s long-standing commitment to science, innovation and 
      improving global health is unsurpassed among pharmaceutical companies.”
    

      Kellogg joined Merck in 2007 as executive vice president and chief 
      financial officer. He played a major role in driving the execution of 
      Merck’s merger with Schering-Plough and in designing the company’s 
      capital structure to enhance shareholder returns, including its 2013 
      accelerated share repurchase program. To ensure a smooth transition, 
      Kellogg will oversee the closing and reporting of the company’s first 
      quarter sales and earnings on April 29.
    

      "Peter has been an important member of the Merck leadership team and 
      instrumental in helping to guide Merck during a period of significant 
      change at our company and in our industry,” said Frazier. “Peter leaves 
      Merck a stronger company, better positioned to deliver long-term value 
      to our shareholders.”
    

      "I am extremely proud of what we have accomplished together during my 
      seven year tenure at Merck,” said Kellogg. “And while I am excited to 
      open another chapter of my professional life, it is heartening that I 
      can do so having had the opportunity to contribute to Merck’s legacy and 
      long-term success.”
