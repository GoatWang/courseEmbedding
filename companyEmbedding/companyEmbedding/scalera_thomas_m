It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Melissa Trombetta. You may begin.
Melissa Trombetta 
Thanks, Lori. Good morning, and welcome to ITT's first quarter 2014 investor review. I'd like to highlight that this morning's presentation, press release and reconciliations of GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures can be found on our website at itt.com/ir.

We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Forward-looking statements made on this call should be evaluated together with the risks and uncertainties that affect our business, particularly those disclosed in our SEC filings.
Now let's turn to Slide 3, where Denise will discuss our results.
Denise L. Ramos
Good morning, everyone. I appreciate you joining us as we announce our financial results for the first quarter of 2014.
We are off to a great start. In Q1, we demonstrated our ability to extend our execution track record that reflects the strategic focus and dedication of our 9,400 global employees. The impact of their commitment and contributions are clearly reflected in our ability to continue to grow across key global end markets and geographies today while we invest in our future by focusing on strategic actions that drive profitable growth and value creation.
So let me share some of the Q1 financial highlights: Total revenue, up 11%; organic revenue, up 10%, with all 4 businesses contributing to the growth. We delivered solid growth in global chemicals and oil and gas project pumps in key markets. We also drove automotive brake pad market share gains in both Europe and China and aftermarket expansion, and we made market share gains across our strategic connector end markets.
During the quarter, industrial pump projects grew 43% over prior year. Included in that growth is a number of large, complex projects with longer production times and higher dollar values. As a result, the Q1 revenue includes 3 percentage points of growth related to these large, long-term, industrial pump projects that are recorded over the life of the contract.
We are also very pleased with our adjusted segment operating margin expansion of 90 basis points, driven by strong volume gains, strong net operating productivity and restructuring savings from actions we have been taking in our Interconnect Solutions and KONI shock absorber businesses to optimize our cost structures. Both businesses are producing significant growth while they redefine their long-term strategies.
So let me share these well-earned results. Interconnect Solutions grew its adjusted operating margins at 870 basis points, to 12%. And KONI expanded its adjusted operating margins by 750 basis points, to 10%. A big thank you to the teams for such outstanding performance. Keep it up.

These gains helped to overcome the negative effects of the mix shift to large pump projects at Industrial Process and the constant pricing pressure from the automotive industry, as well as to help fund our strategic growth investments. These solid operating results are reflected in our adjusted EPS of $0.62 per share, which was up 32% versus last year, excluding special items. The growth reflects a 19% increase in adjusted segment operating income, a lower effective tax rate and lower interest expense in the quarter.
Special items are primarily related to effective [indiscernible] and restructuring, transformation and repositioning costs. This comprehensive growth directly reflects the advantages we gained from our diversified model, as well as our ongoing commitment to build a stronger, more focused, multi-industrial company.
Orders were up modestly in the quarter. Total orders were up 2% and organic orders were up 3%, reflecting strength in both Motion Technologies and Interconnect Solutions, partially offset by a difficult prior-year comparison in mining and delayed timing of large pump projects at Industrial Process.
So moving on to guidance. As a result of our operating and strategic momentum, as well as our expected lower full year effective tax rate, I am pleased to announce that we are raising our full year adjusted EPS guidance to a new range of $2.28 to $2.36, which raises our midpoint to 15% growth versus 2013. We are maintaining our total and organic revenue guidance at 4% to 6% for 2014.
Let's next turn to Slide #4 for an update on our strategic growth drivers. Our strategic execution is focused on 4 key areas: market expansion; a differentiated customer experience; operational excellence; and effective capital deployment. These 4 pillars are the drivers of our long-term strategy and our results this quarter are a clear indication that we are focused in the right areas.
In Q1, we delivered against our key market expansion initiatives by growing an impressive 15% in emerging markets and 9% in developed markets. These results were partially attributable to our ability to provide our customers with a differentiated experience. So let me give you a few examples of how we win.
During the quarter, Motion Technologies grew their highly profitable aftermarket brake pad business 10%. This increase is in part due to our strong OEM performance over the last several years, which is now entering the dealer service cycle. Growth was also due to the expanded aftermarket brake pad opportunity that we announced last quarter with Continental.
Another example of this progression is at both Interconnect Solutions and Control Technologies, where we have put more emphasis on working directly with customers to provide differentiated solutions rather than just being a component supplier. As a result of this strategy, Interconnect Solutions gained market share across all of their strategic end markets and Control Technologies just celebrated their fourth consecutive quarter of order growth in the general industrial market.
In Q1, we had another significant quarter of productivity, generating $27 million of growth savings, resulting from the acceleration of our lean transformation, leveraging our global strategic sourcing group and benefits from prior-year restructuring actions. During the quarter, we took restructuring actions totaling $15 million, largely at Interconnect Solutions, related to headcount reductions associated with the movement of certain production lines to an existing facility in a lower-cost region. This action is a continuation of our ongoing optimization of our Interconnect Solutions global footprint and will provide long-term benefits for the business.
Finally, we had another quarter of balanced capital deployment. The organic investments we made during the quarter were focused on rebalancing and expanding our global auto brake pad production capacity, expanding our oil and gas Western Hemisphere Center of Excellence facility in Seneca Falls and building out our aftermarket reach and capabilities. These targeted investments continue to help us build on our already-strong foundations and will drive our long-term organic growth.

In addition to these organic investments, we also committed to returning capital to shareholders in the form of a dividend increase, which we announced in late February of this year. We raised our quarterly dividend 10%, to $0.11 per share.
So before I pass it over to Tom, I would just like to appreciate our highly valued people for their dedication and commitment to ITT. In April, I got to see firsthand the global energy and enthusiasm of our team, where 200 of our leaders came together to advance our efforts to create a stronger, healthier, high-performing culture. This collaborative effort with leaders from all parts of our organization and globe is a key component of taking our organization to the next level and creating added benefits for all our stakeholders. It is clear our employees are truly engaged in driving our strategy and positioning ITT for even longer-term success that delivers profitable growth and value creation for the future.
I'll now turn it over to Tom.
Thomas M. Scalera
Thanks, Denise. Now let's turn to Slide 5 for a detailed review of our first quarter results. In the quarter, we delivered organic revenue growth of 10% that reflected the power of our diversifications, as each business grew in excess of 6%.
Industrial Process led the way with 13% organic growth, fueled by projects in the chemical and oil and gas markets, which were up 35% and 17%, respectively. Mining grew 25% in the quarter, mostly driven by project activity in the Americas. Revenue growth in Industrial Process included $22 million of favorable timing for certain large, long-term industrial pump projects, mostly in the developed oil and gas markets. This growth reflects our expanded portfolio and improved capabilities to execute against an increasing number of complex projects.
Motion Technologies delivered another strong quarter, with organic growth of 9%. Motion Technologies team delivered exceptional 8% auto growth, driven by a 10% increase in the dealer service and independent aftermarket channels. The growth in the independent aftermarket included the ramp up of our expanded contract with Continental. We also experienced above-market OEM growth in Europe and, in China, we grew 33%, which is a direct reflection of the organic investments we've recently made in our Wuxi, China, capabilities.
Also contributing to Motion Technologies' strength in the quarter was the KONI shock absorber business, which was up 16% globally. This growth reflects the lasting power of the respected KONI brand and the tireless efforts of the team to improve our operational effectiveness and end market focus.
Interconnect Solutions delivered its third consecutive quarter of double-digit organic growth and their fourth consecutive quarter with $100 million or more in revenue. The 10% first quarter growth at ICS included gains of 12% in transportation and industrial, 10% in aerospace and defense and 13% in oil and gas. These gains were partially offset by declines in non-strategic product lines.
Control Technologies also delivered solid organic top line growth of 6% as strong commercial aerospace component growth more than offset Defense and end-of-life program headwinds.
Shifting to orders. Organic orders increased 3% this quarter, driven by strength in global automotive friction and strategic connector end markets. These gains were partially offset by a 4% decline in our Industrial Process business due to a difficult prior-year mining order compare, continued softness in our base pump business and some large project order delays. Our organic book-to-bill ratio in the quarter was 1.04, with each business contributing to this result by delivering ratios at or above 1.02.
Q1 adjusted segment operating income of $93 million grew 19% due to strong volumes, net productivity gains from our ongoing lean transformation and accelerated benefits from our turnaround and restructuring actions at both ICS and KONI. These gains funded our key Q1 strategic investments in the aftermarket expansion and our lean transformation.

For the quarter, our adjusted EPS of $0.62 per share exceeded our expectations and was 32% higher than the prior year. The growth reflected the 19% increase in segment operating income, the lower effective tax rate and lower interest expense. The lower tax rate partially reflects mix but it also reflects the planning and execution of our tax team, who has worked together to drive a 400-basis-point reduction in our effective rate since then.
Turning to our total revenue growth by end market, on Slide 6. Growth in the quarter once again reflected the diversification benefits of the attractive end markets that we serve with our highly engineered solutions. Our industrial market revenue was up 13%, driven by chemical and industrial pumps, which improved 15% on strong petrochemical activity in North America and emerging markets. Mining growth of 25% tied to fertilizer and copper projects also contributed, along with general industrial strength in connectors tied to our renewed focus on strategic end markets.
In the transportation market, we drove 9% growth. Global automotive revenue grew 8% due to aftermarket expansion, improved global production rates and share gains in Europe and China. Aerospace and defense was up 8% due to strong commercial aerospace component demand. And in addition, rail was a significant contributor this quarter, posting a 28% increase, largely due to the turnaround efforts at KONI.
And lastly, energy was up 9%, driven by a 17% increase in oil and gas and Industrial Process related to large project timing and aftermarket growth in Latin America. The growth in the oil and gas market is a direct reflection of recent organic and inorganic investments that we are making in our Industrial Process business that include our broader range of complex products, our new world-class Korean facility, the expansion of our engineered Center of Excellence in Seneca Falls, New York, and our acquisition of Bornemann Pumps.
Now let's turn to revenue by geography, on Slide 7. In the quarter, we delivered revenue growth of 7% in the U.S. and Canada due to project pump growth in the chemical, oil and gas and mining end markets. We also benefited from a 16% increase in aerospace, with contributions from both our Control Technologies and Interconnect Solutions segments. These strengths were partially offset by weak power shipments compared to a very strong prior year, softness in our North American short-cycle base pump business and lower automotive brake pad sales due to weather, dealer inventory rebalancing and the timing of platform launches.
Total European revenue was up 13%, or 9% on an organic basis, reflecting 8% growth in automotive friction and strength in our general industrial connector business. The automotive growth reflects aftermarket expansion due to strength in the original equipment service network and the ramp up of the expanded aftermarket contract with Continental. We also continued to outpace auto production rates and gained share in the OEM market due to our ability to reliably produce high-quality brake pads that consistently meet our customer specifications.
Total emerging markets grew 15% in total and 17% organically, primarily due to share gains in Latin America and China. These improvements were driven by 20% growth in Industrial Process and 16% growth at Motion Technologies. The industrial Process performance reflects a 41% increase in Latin America in the oil and gas, mining and chemical markets, and the growth at Motion Technologies reflects automotive market share gains in China.
On Slide 8, you can see that the segment operating margins expanded 90 basis points compared to the prior year. As we've highlighted, this expansion was largely the result of strong volume growth and operational execution that was driven by our ongoing lean transformation. These results also reflected the effectiveness of our turnaround activities at Interconnect Solutions and KONI. These gains self-funded our organic investments and offset the negative pricing impacts from constant automotive industry pressures and the unfavorable mix impacts due to a significantly higher weighting of large pump projects.

And finally, let's turn to Slide 9 for our 2014 guidance update. As a result of our Q1 performance, we are tightening our full year adjusted EPS guidance range and raising the midpoint. Our new full year adjusted EPS range of $2.28 to $2.36 per share reflects an increase of $0.04 at the midpoint, generating a new growth rate of 15% compared to 2013.
Provided on this slide is a roll forward from our previously issued guidance. The new adjusted EPS guidance reflects first quarter operational impacts of $0.03 that were driven by higher-than-expected automotive volumes in both OEM and the aftermarket and strong operating performances from our Interconnect Solutions and our KONI shock absorber turnarounds.
In addition, in Q1, we did experience $0.02 of favorable timing benefits, primarily due to large pump projects in our Industrial Process business, which has no impact on our full year expectations. The guidance increase also reflects a $0.03 benefit from a lower projected full year effective tax rate of 28%, partially offset by unfavorable FX and other nonoperational items. Please note that our guidance does not specifically reflect any foreign exchange impacts related to potential future devaluations in Venezuela.
As it relates to revenue, we are maintaining our previous full year total and organic revenue growth ranges of 4% to 6% over the prior year. The 2014 top line growth is expected to be driven by strength in our core markets of oil and gas, chemical and industrial pumps and continued share gains in global automotive. It should be noted that the lower end of the revenue range contemplates some potential impacts on our Industrial Process business related to increasing geopolitical uncertainty in certain emerging markets.
While we do not provide quarterly guidance due to the lumpiness of our projects business, as evidenced in Q1, I would like to provide some color into our second quarter and second half expectations. We project Q2 revenue and growth rates to be lower than the first quarter due to the typical aftermarket seasonality in Motion Technologies and project timing in Industrial Process. And from a segment margin perspective, we do expect a sequential decline from the first quarter. This decline is mostly due to typical seasonality in the high-margin aftermarket sales at Motion Technologies, partially offset by slightly more favorable mix in Industrial Process due to a lower weighting of large pump projects and higher restructuring benefits at Interconnect Solutions.
In the second quarter, we also expect a significant increase in corporate costs compared to Q1 and the prior year. This reflects incremental investments in culture and talent and higher environmental costs. As a result of these factors, second quarter EPS is expected to be generally in line with the prior year.
And from the first half or second half perspective, we continue to expect revenues to be second-half weighted, and we expect second half segment margins to be approximately 80 basis points higher than the first half. And lastly, our adjusted EPS guidance also assumes a second-half weighting in excess of 50% [ph].
So now let me turn it back over to Lori to start the Q&A session.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Matt Summerville of KeyBanc.
Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division
I wanted to ask a couple of questions about the Industrial Process business. First, can you quantify the magnitude of push out you saw in orders? And do you expect to recapture that, still, in 2014? And then also, maybe a little more granularity in terms of what you saw overall in IP, in aftermarket? And then maybe comment a little bit on the softness you're seeing in baseline pumps.

Denise L. Ramos
Let me talk a little bit about projects and what we saw with projects. We saw very strong project sales in the quarter for oil and gas, petrochemical and, actually, mining. In fact, we had a 43% project growth in Q1, which, as we indicated, negatively impacted some of our margins. We do see that global oil and gas and petrochemical project orders are increasing from where they were in the second half of 2014 -- 2013, but these very large projects continue to be delayed. We do expect a pickup to happen in the second half of the year. And the reason that we believe that is because we see that some of the longer lead time projects are being released to EPCs, and that the EPCs are starting to order longer lead-time equipment in oil and gas and petrochemical market. So that's really a good sign for the IP business and why we expect improvement as we get into the back half of the year. In terms of the aftermarket. Service has been weak globally and that's, we believe, due to cost-cutting actions by customers and just some general uncertainty about the recovery -- the economic recovery that's taking place. From a parts perspective, North America has been very weak for us, and that's because of a slowdown in MRO spending, which has been impacted by the economic uncertainty. And we did see some weather-related impacts in the first quarter. We do expect that to pick up in the second half. In terms of the rest of the world outside of North America, we've seen good growth, and that's been due to the growing installed base that we have. Remember, capital spares are important and they can be lumpy. It really depends on when plants begin to start up. And so we do expect that, as we get into the back half of the year, that we'll see more improvement in our capital spares. And then let me just also comment on our baseline business, which is a very profitable business for us. And we saw, also, North America softness in our baseline business for the same reasons that I articulated in the parts business. International continues to grow nicely due to some market share gains that we've had with our new ISO pumps there. So, in general, we expect to see improvements in the IP orders as we go into the back part of the year. We should see some of these larger projects picking up and we do expect to see some improvements in the aftermarket in these baseline pumps, which will help the IP margins as we get into the back half. But it's something, still, that we're waiting to see. We've seen some improvement in the baseline pumps in March and April. We're still waiting to see some improvement on the aftermarket side.
Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division
And then, just as a follow-up. Organically, by segment, can you sort of talk about where the businesses should fall relative to the 4% to 6%? Which are going to be above, maybe below or in-line? Some sort of commentary like that?
Thomas M. Scalera
Yes, Matt. As we look across the year, certainly, we like the opportunities that we see in the Industrial Process business. A lot of that growth is going to be project specific. So we would expect IP, given the demand signals we're seeing in oil and gas and chemical markets, in particular, to give us potentially organic revenue growth at the higher end of our guidance. And I think the other businesses are kind of more in line with the middle of the range, as if you just kind of spread it out. But the one I would really point to is, in our Interconnect Solutions business, we are not planning on significant top line growth this year. We did about $100 million of revenue, I think, for a fourth quarter in a row. And I think that's becoming a little bit of a new trend line for this year. But what's happening, Matt, is we're growing in our strategic end markets and we are deemphasizing some non-core markets. And, really, as a result of that, we're probably maintaining revenue that's pretty close to what we're seeing in Q1 carry out through the rest of the year. So the story at ICS, as you know, is around the turnaround and improving the underlying operational efficiencies. That will set us up for more top line growth, certainly, going into 2015. But on balance, I would say, IP would be at the higher end, really based on project activity. Connectors would be at the lower end of our range. And then Motion Tech and Control Technologies will be in the middle.

Denise L. Ramos
Yes. I think it's important to understand with Motion Technologies that, while we've seen some very strong growth rates at the end of last year -- second half of last year and what we saw in Q1, a lot of that was attributable to the OES, the aftermarket. And so as we get into the back half of this year, when you think about lapping that from a year ago, we don't expect to see those high volumes that we saw a year ago. So we do expect that -- on the Motion Technology side that, that should moderate as we get into the back half of the year from a growth perspective.

Your next question comes from the line of Mike Halloran of Robert W. Baird.
Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division
So just a follow-up on the Interconnection growth comments. So the trick here is that you're basically saying the organic growth x these end-of-life contracts remains healthy but it's-- the offset's there. Are you seeing a pretty consistent bleed down on those contracts as you work through the year? Or these step up, step downs that happen at the beginning of the year? How does that cadence kind of work out through the year?
Denise L. Ramos
It's really these end-of-life product lines that we identified about 1 year or so ago. It's just a gradual decline that we're seeing in those end-of-life projects. So that's -- it's going to extend over this year and into next year also. So you'll continue to see some moderation on the top line growth for ICS. As Tom indicated, the focus that we've had on ICS has been largely to deal with the cost structure because the cost structure that we had in place was too high relative to where the revenue base was. And so we've been focused quite a bit on driving optimization from a facility perspective in that business, which is why, in the second quarter, you saw us announce a further restructuring in their facilities, moving from a facility in California down to a facility in Mexico. Before that, we announced a facility move out of the U.K. And so we continue to work on optimizing the cost structure, not only with the facilities but also how we operate these facilities, operationally. So we hired a new individual that came in and has really been bringing in a lot of lean activities into these facilities and really leaning them out. So that's been, also, a big part of the cost structure decline that we're experiencing in Interconnect solutions. Now, for the future, we've recognized that we needed to make sure that we had the team aligned around key end markets. So we put GMs in place for each of the key markets for ICS. We have a GM for oil and gas, we have a GM for aerospace and defense, a GM for transportation and industrial and a GM for medical. That's important to us as we go out into the future because we want these teams aligned and if full P&Ls associated with these teams, we want them to go after the most profitable parts of their business. And so eventually, you're going to see the top line growing at ICS. We just don't expect to see a lot of traction around that this year, with these end-of-life programs and these new teams that we've gotten into place. So the margin expansion that you're seeing is really related to the cost structure actions that we've had underway.
Thomas M. Scalera
And just one quick point on the ICS defense market. Aerospace and defense is one of the key segments. And we've had some strength, to date, in defense but, as you know, it's a market these days that's very difficult to predict. So that's something we also watch as it relates to the revenue and connector business as the year progresses.
Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division
And then, related, on the margin side that you guys we're talking about, very healthy margin gains in the quarter here. Anything about those levels that's not sustainable versus the revenue levels you're at on a go-forward basis?

Thomas M. Scalera
Is that for connectors, Mike, or for across the business?
Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division
Yes, just for connectors.
Thomas M. Scalera
Connectors. Yes, I think we have great traction. We -- as we go through this transformation, as Denise is articulating, the complexity will continue to increase. So we are moving product lines, consolidating facilities and footprint actions. We built a nice foundation but I think we've done that largely by going after the low-lying fruit and using those gains to fund the additional wave of activities that we have coming through this year. But we like where we are at this point in the progression. The complexity does increase as we go. I think once we get through this next wave of complexity and reset the footprint and put the changes in place that Denise was mentioning, I think that gives us a step up from where we are now. But I think getting to this point was an important foundational element for the margins. We just need to execute the transformation as we go through the back half of the year.
Denise L. Ramos
And as we indicated, this year we wanted to be above 10%. We hit it in Q1. And we do expect to see some nice, steady progressions from there based on these actions that we've taken because these are systemic changes that we're making in this business. So, as Tom said, we had some low-hanging fruit but we've been going in there and we have really been reworking and rewiring the operational gearing in this business. And those benefits do not go away. They will sustain. So we're going to continue to grow this business. We're going to continue to see margin improvement in it. But it's going to be just gradual because we've got to get these changes in place.

Your next question comes from the line of Brian Konigsberg of Vertical Research.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC
Just starting off, just with Industrial Process. So Denise, you mentioned that you're still seeing more delays. I'm curious, are those incremental delays? I just find it curious because we have heard some of your peers talk about actually starting to book some of the early ethane crackers, at least, that has gotten off the ground. We've seen a couple more of that hit EPC in late '13. From my perspective, it looks like things are actually getting more traction, not less. So I'm just curious, is this a delay that you're seeing between EPC and procurements? Or maybe just kind of elaborate on that.
Denise L. Ramos
It is true that, when we look at North America and we look at the petrochemical market, we did see orders pick up momentum during the first quarter in the Gulf Coast region. And so I think that's probably what you're referring to. So we did see that pick up. It's when you go outside of North America and you look at some of the other locations that we have in Latin America and in the Middle East that we were seeing, on the oil and gas side, some of the delays. Even though we had some good projects coming through, it was more the medium-sized projects. It's the larger ones that we've seen some delays on. But we have seen the improvement in the petrochemical market in the Gulf Coast region in North America.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC
Okay. And maybe you can just touch on pricing. So that, actually, is a pretty big concern as far as the early work that's coming to market. How are you viewing that? Do you -- are you more interested in, I guess, biding your time and waiting for pricing to firm up? Or do you anticipate being aggressive and trying to, I don't know, use productivity to try to make that a good project over time?
Denise L. Ramos
It's very project specific. I would say pricing is very competitive out there because you've got a lot of companies that are going after some of these first projects coming down the pipe. We're being very disciplined because we see that there are so many projects out there, with the quote activity and the order activity that we've got, that we can be selective. And we're being very careful about how we price these projects. We look at it from a total cost of ownership perspective and as you go out and you get the aftermarket and you get some of that business with it also, but we're not chasing price, and we're not going to play that game. But it is competitive out there and you've got a lot of people going after a lot of these projects. But we believe that there's going to be enough projects out there that you don't have to give a lot on price in order for that to happen.

Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC
If I could just ask one more. Just on Motion Tech, so it seems like that Continental deal you talked about last quarter actually started to kick in. I was under the impression that was more of a -- maybe a late '14 into '15 type of benefit. Is that right? I mean, is this kind of contributing more earlier than you thought? And maybe just give us a sense of how much growth it can actually contribute over '14 and '15?
Denise L. Ramos
In the aftermarket, that line did kick in, in the first quarter. Now the first quarter was large, because everybody was building inventory. And so we'll have to see how this plays out as we get throughout the year but it was really a build of inventory. And what we saw is that in terms of that -- the independent aftermarket that we have, which is both the ATE line and this new Galfer line, that we increased 7%, and that was solely due to this new line that we put into place. But we don't expect that kind of growth to continue into the back half of the year because it was building inventory.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones of Stifel.
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division
If I could just go back to ICS for a minute. You had talked about a 10% margin target for 2014. Did 12% in the first quarter and are talking about revenues being relatively flat for the year. I would think you would incur more benefit from the restructuring as we go through the year. So is there any reason why we shouldn't now expect ICS margin for the year to be above 12%?
Denise L. Ramos
Yes. When I mentioned that 10%, what I really was referring to is, as we thought about where margins should be in 2014 for ICS, probably, 6, 8 months ago, we were targeting in excess of 10%. So we're seeing that the benefits from the restructuring that they have underway, we're actually receiving those benefits sooner rather than later, which is why we put up a 12%. So we do expect that we should be around the low teens or so as we go through the rest of the year. But 12% was a good rate for us. We're happy with that. And as I said, we would just expect to just slowly increment up from there as we get into the back half of this year and as we get into 2015.
Thomas M. Scalera
Yes. And Nathan, about 25% of the headcount activity has taken place so far through Q1. So we have a lot of kind of ongoing activities as we're moving product lines from one location to the other, there's a very systematic approach to kind of rolling that out through the year. So we'll see the savings kind of build as the year progresses from the current actions. But it really -- I think we get the benefit more realized when we jump into 2015, but we want to make sure that we continue to process those transitions very effectively as we move through the year with ICS.
Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division
As you've moved through that process in ICS, have you identified further opportunities to reduce cost there?
Thomas M. Scalera
We have -- we're continuing to look at opportunities as we go, Nathan. I think we certainly have a very focused operational philosophy of how to build a truly efficient and effective global footprint. So we'll continue to look at -- to ways to optimize our operations. We'll have some improvements in our system so that the locations that we do have interact with one another more efficiently. We're going to continue to focus in main locations where we have the most leverage and a truly lean operational footprint. So I think the momentum is good, Nathan, but we did close one of our smaller facilities in the U.K. earlier this year as well. So as we've gone through the process -- and we did some of that last year, as well. So I think there are a lot of opportunities for us just to continue to optimize with our core facilities and tying those facilities together with an efficient system design so that we can be a true global player in the connectors business.

Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division
That's helpful. And just to pick on the balance sheet for a minute. We've been in a suboptimal capital structure here for quite some time now. What are your focuses at the moment for the balance sheet? How's the M&A pipeline? And what are your thoughts about getting more aggressive on share repurchase?
Denise L. Ramos
Let me deal with the acquisition front. We continue to look very aggressively at acquisition ideas. As we've always said, acquisitions is going to be a part of our growth out into the future. So we've been investing heavily organically because we saw opportunities, and we've looked at the returns on these opportunities and you can see the benefit that we're getting from the organic investments that we've been making. So we'll continue to make organic investments. We've had some large ones last year and then this year, with some of the facility expansions that we've had underway. But as we go out into the future, acquisitions will be important to us. We continue to look at them. We continue to have aggressive pipelines. We've got some momentum going with it. But as you know, these things take time. They need to be actionable. You've got to find the right ideas that come through. I believe we've got the right focus on it. We've got the right people involved in it. And so it will be something as we go out into the future. We continue to look at balanced capital deployment, so organic is important to us. Acquisitions are important to us. We increased our dividend 10% in February, and so that was a nice return to shareholders. And then with share repurchases, we purchased shares last year, I think it was about $85 million or so we spent on share repurchases last year. And this year it's something that we'll look at, at the right point in time. But for right now, we like the opportunity that we're seeing organically and inorganically. Tom would you like to comment?
Thomas M. Scalera
No, I think that's right, Denise. I mean, you look at the CapEx spending rates that we have this year, between 5% and 6% of revenue, so it's a fairly significant investment in our internal capabilities. And, obviously, we'd expect that level of investment to start to step down when we exit 2014 and get to a more normalized run rate. But this is a period of continuing the focus on these organic investment ideas. And what's nice about the organic investments and the M&A opportunities from this point is they're built on a solid strategic framework. So as we continue to kind of evolve our businesses organically, I think it's giving us better clarity and focus in the M&A pipeline so that we can really make sure that we have close-to-core opportunities to grow our businesses when we look both -- either through M&A or through organic investments.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of John Inch with Deutsche Bank.
John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Let me say, based on where you are in your life cycle, I don't think share repurchase makes a ton of sense. So I agree with your strategy. U.S. and Canada was up 7, right? Was that because of -- are you just lumping Canada in with U.S.? Because Canada has been a source of weakness for, basically, most of the industrials. And, particularly, they site oil sands and so forth. So I'm wondering if you could comment on IP in Canada. I know Bornemann's got big exposure there. Just want more color on that region.
Thomas M. Scalera
Yes, John, it's -- I think it's unique to us in Canada. We have seen some pretty good growth in the upstream markets. A lot of that's coming from Bornemann. So I think our ability to gain opportunities and share using the Bornemann brand capability is also helping us grow our Goulds opportunity set in Canada, as well. It's been a nice market for us but certainly not a call [indiscernible] on the overall economic activity in Canada. But I think it's a reflection of Bornemann share gains and bringing Goulds through that opportunity set, as well.

John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Yes -- no, that's right. But I mean, resource companies have called out Canada as a source of weakness. So you're actually growing in Canada, despite -- I mean, it sounds like you believe you're taking market share, right? Would that be a fair statement?
Thomas M. Scalera
That's right, John. I think it's really about share gains with the technology and then really leveraging the channel opportunities that Bornemann has brought to us to really go after a new wave of opportunities. So I think it's very company-specific share gains but it is largely being built off of the activity the Bornemann has up in the Canadian oil sands.
John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
SPX called -- talked about complicated oil and gas projects and pushouts. Could you maybe just help us understand a little bit what all of this actually means? Meaning, shouldn't we have known a few years ago what the nature of these projects and their more complicated nature would actually mean? This is -- it's not entirely clear because pump's not overtly a complicated product. So maybe a little more color on what exactly is -- what exactly are the bottlenecks in terms of this? And what actually happens if floodgates open, all of a sudden these projects get approved and you have to scramble a lot of stuff? Just how are you thinking about it and how are you planning for it? And just help us -- how does this actually pertain to your own product line?
Denise L. Ramos
When I think about the projects, John, the delays that we're seeing -- I believe, there's really 2 key factors into the delays. I think it does have to do with just slow economic activity and trying to figure out what that's going to look like as you got out into the future. And then I think it's also remembering that these projects are very expensive. And there's concerns from a cost perspective about how much these companies are actually going to have to spend when they put these projects into place. And I think that looking at -- you can talk about the Gulf Coast region, you can talk about some of the labor shortages that they have down there and the cost concerns associated with that. I think that just puts some concerns in peoples' minds that they're being extra careful and extra prudent before they start executing these projects. But the one thing that we are seeing is, say, why would we think that it's any different now than it was 6 months ago is because we are seeing some of these projects now being released to the EPCs. And we're also starting to see some of these EPCs that are now ordering longer lead time equipment, not pumps per se but longer lead time equipment for these facilities, which we believe is going to be a good sign, that the pumps are going to flow and follow from that. And that's really been in the oil and gas and petrochemicals side.
Thomas M. Scalera
Yes, and I think the complexity within our portfolio certainly has increased, as you know, John. And that means the size of the pump, the capability that -- of the pump, the efficiency ratings, the ability to move liquids that are of different viscosities. So our complexity as a company has been increasing, which puts us in this category where projects are larger-sized, they stay -- they take longer to build, the length of our project time is extending out. And that's a little bit unique to our evolution and the investments that we've made moving up the complexity ladder. So it makes these conversations much more important to us because we have a bigger opportunity set here than we had in our past. And we're also coming up the learning curve and making more and more of these large complex pumps. It's an opportunity for future efficiency for us as we leverage the new Korea facility and make improvements in our Seneca Falls operation. So complexity is the name of the game, I think right now, with our growth. The geopolitical factors that we're seeing in places like Russia and Venezuela add to some of this uncertainty and, really, predicting order movements and when those orders convert into revenue. So that's another factor that as we move into these kind of pumps, we tend to see larger orders in those kind of areas. So it does add some additional uncertainty around timing of these activities.

John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Well, that's actually a pretty good segue into my other question. Wall Street loves the sound bite. So, right now, emerging markets are bad, yet Rockwell did a really good job in Brazil and you guys are above 15% in emerging market. So maybe you could just talk a little bit more about sort of your emerging market exposure? You mentioned Venezuela, Tom. Just sort of how you are able to work around macro? And why you think you're getting double-digit growth rates in regions that are obviously economically facing some pressures here?
Denise L. Ramos
In the emerging markets, John, where we put up good growth rates, that's really been focused on oil and gas projects, it's been focused in petrochemical and it's in China and the brake pad business that we have in China. So we think we are gaining share in some of these attractive markets where we play. How we've been focusing in oil and gas and petrochemicals is we've developed a broader portfolio, which allows us to meet more of our customer demands. Remember, we invested in Korea. And we've built out that Korea facility. I think it's 3x or 4x the one that we had in place before. And that's allowing us to be able to go after more of these larger complex projects in oil and gas and petrochemicals. And then we've also been building out some localized sourcing. We've been putting some assembly facilities in place and we've been building out our aftermarket. So we think that, that's how we end up gaining some of this market share that we've been going after over these past couple of years is by building out these capabilities that we have. And then, in China, when you look at China, we grew in China about 57% in Q1. But now that was -- a lot of that was due to our brake pad business, where we built our Wuxi facility and we've been building that out. And so we've been getting a lot of traction associated with the automotive market in China, which has been growing at very healthy growth rates and we've been taking share there. And then the IP business had a nice run in China, also, with the chemical market and some aftermarket capture and even some oil and gas wins. So China is a key part of our emerging markets, along with others. We expect China to be up about 20% or so in -- for the full year and its due to the businesses that I just indicated to you.
Operator
The final question is a follow-up from Matt Summerville of KeyBanc.
Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division
Just a couple of quick follow-ups. What was the mix of project versus aftermarket in IP in the first quarter of this year versus the first quarter of last? And then what do you expect it to be for the full year, please?
Thomas M. Scalera
Yes in Q1, Matt, we had about 8 or 9 points more project revenue this year than we had last year. So a very significant tilt towards projects in Q1. We would expect that to kind of balance out a little bit over the course of the year. Now that is kind of dependent on one critical factor, which is we do expect the aftermarket and the baseline pump demand to improve as the year progresses. So if we're able to see that kind of improvement, that will bring the kind of rebalancing more in line. But at the end of the year, we still expect pumps -- large project pumps to be anywhere from 2% to 4% higher than where they were last year as a percent of our total mix.
Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division
And then with respect to Venezuela, can you just run through what your exposure is there, in terms of balance sheet, cash that's held locally and revenue?
Thomas M. Scalera
Yes. So, Matt, we have about -- if we extrapolate a potential devaluation -- so just to give the perspective on the balance sheet and our assets in Venezuela, 100% deval right now would be about a $3 million or about a $0.02 EPS impact to us. Given the nature of what we do in Venezuela, obviously we're using the applicable rate but there's a lot of uncertainty as to the rate evolution over time. So at this point, we're using the appropriate and approved rate given the industries we're in. But we did a hypothetical 100% deval and that was about $0.02, as I mentioned. So that gives you an indication of the balance sheet. That comes from the fact that we've had a service and a local capability in Venezuela for years. So we've been operating in the environment for many, many years and we do understand and appreciate this volatility. What has been changing for us, what's new, is going back to that complexity comment. With Bornemann, they have the ability to go after larger projects in regions like Venezuela, where there's a different kind of crude oil mixture, and our Bornemann pumps -- multiphase pumps operate extremely well in those conditions. We mentioned last year, I think in Q3, that we had a $28 million project win in Venezuela. So that's one that's kind of a little bit different that than our typical run rate. And it has nice economic attributes to it that you would expect given the risk profile of doing business in a country like Venezuela. So it's a project that we watch as the year progresses to make sure that all the factors are in line for us to kind of move ahead with that particular project. But before we really transact additional business, we want to make sure that we're seeing good flows of payment and that can, at times, be a challenge. And the payments flows out of country can actually be something that cause us to delay shipments. So it's something we manage but it is a little bit bigger for us now than it was based on some of these Bornemann contracts that are coming through.

Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division
And then just one last one, on ICS. With respect to the product line repositioning into low-cost facilities, what do you anticipate the permanent structural cost savings you will get in that segment from this new wave of actions?
Thomas M. Scalera
That's a great question, Matt, but it's hard to really put a clear line on right now because it's the multiple moves that we're making in rebalancing, even just beyond what we're doing with this set of activities. I think, as Denise mentioned, we've reached that 10% plateau. That was kind of a critical point. We have a nice 12% margin in Q1. I think it's really hard for us to kind of extrapolate how each individual piece will contribute. This is an important move, though. We do have a high cost structure in North America and we have a facility in Mexico that is a very efficient, well-run operation that we can continue to move production into. So we're going to pick up some very nice gains from that move. But there are many other moves that we are taking and actions that really improve the operational effectiveness of this business. So I'm hesitant to kind of pin it to a specific action but I think when you add it up, we have a nice momentum here that we're going to build throughout the course of the year. And I think, really, one of the questions will be -- maybe as we exit 2014, where do we then recast the entitlement for ICS, once we've really put all these pieces in motion.
Operator
At this time, there are no further questions. I will now return the call to Denise Ramos for any additional or closing remarks.
Denise L. Ramos
Well, let me just thank everyone for joining us on the call today. As you've heard this morning, we are very pleased with our Q1 performance and how we have been able to once again deliver on our commitments and move our strategy forward. This is the result of focus and strong execution and we'll continue to create ongoing long-term value for all of our stakeholders. So I look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter. Until then, thanks very much.

Welcome to ITT's 2012 Fourth Quarter and Full Year Results and 2013 Outlook Conference Call. Starting the call today from ITT is Melissa Trombetta, Director of Investor Relations. She is joined by Denise Ramos, Chief Executive Officer and President; and Tom Scalera, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay beginning at 12 p.m. Eastern Standard Time. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Melissa Trombetta. You may begin.
Melissa Trombetta 
Thank you, Christy. Good morning, and welcome to ITT's Fourth Quarter 2012 Investor Review. Presenting this morning are ITT's Chief Executive Officer and President, Denise Ramos; and ITT's Chief Financial Officer, Tom Scalera. I'd like to highlight that this morning's presentation, press release and reconciliations of GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures can be found on our website at itt.com/ir.
Please note that any remarks we make about future expectations, plans, prospects and other circumstances set out in our Safe Harbor constitute forward-looking statements for purposes of the Safe Harbor provision. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in ITT's Form 10-K, as well as other public SEC filings.
Let's now turn to Slide #3, where Denise will discuss our results.
Denise L. Ramos
Good morning. Thank you for joining us as we announce our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2012 and provide our 2013 guidance.
I'm very pleased with the performance delivered by our nearly 9,000 ITT employees all around this world, in this, our first full year as a stand-alone company. In 2012, we collectively delivered premier organic revenue growth of 8% for a third consecutive year. We also delivered our adjusted EPS commitment, and we delivered a very strong adjusted free cash flow conversion of 172%.
In addition to these impressive results, we also continued to execute our post-spin transformation activities while we advanced our strategic growth drivers and intensified our focus on our valued customers. In 2012, we delivered against our key market expansion initiatives by growing 13% in North America, 12% in emerging markets and 7% in a profitable aftermarket for pumps and aerospace components.
We also continued our laser focus on the customer, which was evidenced by our investments in R&D at approximately 3% of revenue and by our improved on-time delivery metrics at 3 of the 4 segments. Our progress was noted in numerous recent customer awards that recognized our technology and expanded service capabilities.
Another 2012 highlight for me was the commencement of the ITT lean transformation initiative. This commitment facilitated achieving some of the $110 million in gross productivity savings generated in 2012, and we're only in the initial stages of our entity-wide lean transformation. The company's continued focus on lean, combined with the proactive restructuring initiated in 2012, will drive further productivity benefits in 2013, representing the real driving force behind our guidance.
In 2012, we also continuously demonstrated strategic, balanced and disciplined capital deployment. We made organic investments of $40 million in 2 long-term growth platforms with very attractive return profiles.

First, we started production in our state-of-the-art Wuxi, China automotive research and development and production facility. This investment drove Motion Technologies' 2012 growth rate in China of 78%. So as a result, China now represents 6% of Motion's total revenue, an improvement of 3 percentage points from last year. And we now have a strong foundation in China that we will leverage for even further growth.
Second, we invested in a new Korean oil and gas production facility with advanced lean capabilities, which will come online in the second half of 2013. This facility will play a central role in advancing our energy strategy by becoming our eastern hemisphere energy center of excellence.
We also executed 2 significant fourth quarter portfolio actions, representing a net deployment of $154 million. In late November, we completed the Bornemann Pumps acquisition, which will play a key role in advancing our global energy strategy by adding Bornemann's leadership in differentiated oil and gas pumping technologies to our existing portfolio of highly engineered solutions. I want to once again welcome the Bornemann team to ITT and let you all know how energized we are by the magnitude of our combined future growth potential. And in December, we divested nonstrategic shape-cutting product lines at Control Technologies. This divestiture refocused our key end-market strategies and generated a nice gain of $9 million.
And finally, we returned $147 million to our valued shareholders through meaningful share repurchases and our solid annual dividends. And I'm pleased to announce today that we will continue to return cash to shareholders in 2013 through an additional $75 million of share repurchases and a 10% increase in our quarterly dividend to an even $0.10 per share.
So in summary, I'm very pleased that in our first full year, we were able to deliver on our commitment to all ITT stakeholders. Our people advanced our strategic agenda, delivered our financial commitments, and enabled the deployment of capital in a meaningful, balanced and value-creating way.
So now let's turn to Slide 4 and let's discuss our 2012 adjusted EPS performance. So let me start by pointing out that our 2012 adjusted EPS nicely exceeded our expectations due to very strong operational performance of $0.28 and strong cost controls. I also want to point out that our November guidance still included the earnings from our discontinued shape-cutting business, and it did not reflect the impact from the Bornemann operations. So keep in mind that both of these transactions took place later in the fourth quarter.
In total, these portfolio actions represented a $0.03 to $0.04 impact compared to our November guidance. After giving effect to these actions, our adjusted EPS grew 4% to $1.68. But when I step back and I look at our underlying operational performance, excluding the spin dis-synergy costs of $0.15, our adjusted EPS was up an impressive 13%.
Now thankfully, this is the last time we need to discuss spin dis-synergies. But I do think that in this post-spin transformational period, it is important to assess the underlying financial performance. So in conclusion, we delivered on our adjusted EPS commitment through solid productivity, and we did that while absorbing the impacts of our strategic portfolio actions.
Let's turn to Slide 5 and discuss the fourth quarter results. In the fourth quarter, revenue was up 7% on an organic basis. This was driven by strong growth in chemical and oil and gas pumps, as well as market share gains in automotive and strong emerging market growth. These strengths more than offset the weakness and market share losses in connectors, which was down 7% organically.
Organic orders were flat in the fourth quarter. Strong aerospace component order growth of 44% and solid automotive growth of 8%, driven by share gains in North America and China, were offset by industrial pump project order delays and continued weakness in European connectors.

Adjusted segment operating income was up 7% to $64 million, driven by solid net operating productivity, which added $22 million of incremental benefit. Before the impact of Bornemann, segment operating income actually increased 11% despite the negative impacts from connectors, spin dis-synergies and the $2 million negative impact of foreign exchange.
Fourth quarter adjusted EPS of $0.37 would've been $0.39 before the $0.02 Bornemann impact. We also saw a higher effective tax rate of 35% in Q4 due to the stronger mix of highly taxed U.S. income, which negatively impacted EPS by $0.03 relative to our expectations.
So I'm very pleased with the magnitude of our fourth quarter operational strength, which nicely exceeded our expectations entering the quarter. The temporary Bornemann impacts were primarily due to some operational disruptions caused by the December timing of the transaction. While we are pleased with how we performed throughout 2012, we recognize that some of the headwinds we saw in the fourth quarter are continuing into 2013, and we are specifically watching the order delays in Industrial Process and the persistent weakness in Europe.
So now let's turn our attention to 2013 on Slide 6, where I will share with you our strategic framework. For 2013, we are providing a balanced revenue outlook in the current economic conditions that reflects solid organic revenue growth of 3% and total revenue growth of 10%. We also expect adjusted EPS at the guidance midpoint to be up 10% due to our intense focus on productivity and other internal actions. And we expect 50 basis points of margin expansion, driven by the impact of the prior year restructuring actions and productivity that more than offset the dilution from the acquisition.
In 2013, we will once again be focused on driving value creation by leveraging our strategic growth drivers. We expect strong performance in North America with growth of 6% to 8%, and we expect emerging markets to grow approximately 15%. We will continue to focus on the customer, with strong investments in technology and innovation, accelerated on-time delivery and improved customer responsiveness.
2013, we're targeting $100 million of gross productivity savings, furthering our lean transformation initiative. And we will take additional restructuring actions totaling $10 million to $20 million, largely at Interconnect Solutions, as we progress the connectors' turnaround led by new -- our new segment President, Neil Yeargin.
Finally, we expect another year of strategic, balanced and effective capital deployment. We expect to make significant investments in the strategic areas of oil and gas, aerospace and aftermarket capture. These targeted investments will drive our growth into the future.
We will also continue to advance our portfolio growth strategy through the successful integration of Bornemann and the building of our M&A pipeline that reflects near-term opportunities in the $15 million to $50 million revenue range.
And as I mentioned, we are going to continue to return capital to shareholders through additional share repurchases of up to $75 million and increasing our already strong dividend by 10% to $0.10 per share quarterly.
So now I'll turn it over to Tom to discuss our 2013 guidance in greater detail.
Thomas M. Scalera
Thank you, Denise. Now let's turn to Slide 7 to discuss our annual 2013 guidance. We expect total revenue growth of 9% to 11% that will be driven by the Bornemann acquisition and 2 to 4 percentage points of organic growth. The 2013 growth will be driven by strength in core markets of oil and gas, chemical and general industrial and share gains in global automotive that will more than offset declines in mining and defense. Also contributing to our revenue growth in 2013 will be another strong year of expansion in emerging markets, where our 15% growth will be driven by oil and gas, chemical and automotive gains. Sequentially, second half revenue will be slightly higher than first half revenue due to the timing of large project shipments out of Bornemann and assumed improvements in key markets. As a result, on a year-over-year basis, first half total revenue is expected to be up in the mid-single digits while the second half is projected to be up in the low double digits.

Once again, we expect strong net operating productivity to fuel a 50-basis-point expansion in adjusted segment operating margin to 12.5%. This expansion is over and above the targeted investments we planned for the year. We also expect quarterly margins to improve as we realize the benefits of restructuring actions and improved volumes.
Our 2013 adjusted EPS range of $1.80 to $1.90 per share represents 10% growth at the midpoint and a growth range of 7% to 13%. As Denise mentioned, this guidance is deeply rooted in operational improvements and productivity gains. It should also be noted that our 2013 guidance reflects a $0.02 EPS headwind caused by the recently announced currency devaluation in Venezuela.
As is our practice, we do not provide quarterly guidance due to the lumpiness and long-cycle nature of our Industrial Process segment, but we are currently expecting around 50% to 55% of our adjusted EPS to be in the second half of 2013. As a result, most of our year-over-year growth will be delivered in the second half. The 2 biggest internal drivers of this performance are the timing of restructuring benefits and the timing of Bornemann backlog shipments.
Next I'd like to point out that our 2013 free cash flow conversion rate will be less than 100% due to significant organic investments in Industrial Process's global capabilities and expansion in China automotive. We are forecasting 2013 capital expenditures in excess of 5% of revenue. However, keep in mind that the largest capital projects will be heavily subsidized through local incentives that will be recovered over time through lower cash taxes.
Before we turn to the next slide, I'd like to point out that we've provided our current projections of the major 2013 special items. Asbestos and restructuring items are expected to be fairly consistent with 2012 level. We are projecting higher repositioning costs in 2013 as we will complete all of the remaining required transition service  agreements with Exelis and Xylem. And lastly, we anticipate $6 million to $8 million of first year nonoperating costs at Bornemann related to integration and inventory step-up amortization.
So now let's turn to the revenue outlook by end market on Slide 8. Our 10% total revenue growth expectation reflects strong contributions from the Bornemann acquisition and solid organic revenue growth in these difficult macroeconomic conditions. Energy, our fastest-growing end market, is being propelled by the 40-percentage-point growth contribution from Bornemann. Energy growth excluding Bornemann would be in the mid- to high single digits, reflecting first half order delays in large projects. Bornemann entered the year with nearly 60% of its revenues in backlog, giving us confidence in our total growth expectations.
The chemical and industrial pump market is also expected to generate growth of 19% in 2013 due to global chemical market demand strength and some additional contributions from Bornemann. In our largest markets of automotive, rail and transportation, we expect low single-digit growth due to automotive market share gains in North America and China that will be partially offset by lower European automotive production rates.
The mining market is facing the largest headwinds in 2013 and is now expected to be down nearly 20% due to lower industry-wide CapEx projections and project timing following a very strong year of 60% growth in 2012. We also expect to face headwinds in high-margin defense markets due to mounting U.S. budget pressures and uncertainty around sequestration.
Lastly, in general industrial markets, we expect steady growth during the year at around 8% to 10%. This growth will be driven by our Control Technologies industrial businesses and some recovery at Interconnect Solutions.

On Slide 9, we provided our 2013 revenue outlook by geography. We expect to deliver total revenue growth in North America in the 6% to 8% range. This includes solid revenue growth in oil and gas and chemical pumps, expanding automotive market share and general industrial growth. These gains are expected to be offset by weak defense conditions and the impact of an end-of-life aerospace program.
We expect Western Europe to be up 8% to 10%, reflecting the Bornemann acquisition. Please note that Bornemann's Western European oil and gas projections include sales that are ultimately destined for global customers outside of Europe, and we currently estimate that 30% to 50% of those sales are exported primarily to emerging markets, including Venezuela. Excluding the benefits from Bornemann, we expect to be flat to down 3% in Western Europe. This reflects weakness in European connectors and pressures from declining production levels in Western European automotive. However, our strong automotive aftermarket and recent OEM share gains are expected to mitigate most of these pressures.
Finally, emerging markets are expected to grow 15%, reflecting oil and gas expansion driven by Bornemann, significant automotive share gains in China and general industrial strength. These gains will be partially offset by recent weakness in large mining project activity in Latin America. Excluding Bornemann and the impacts of foreign exchange, emerging markets are expected to expand 5% following our 12% growth in 2012.
On Slide 10, we will review our adjusted segment operating margin guidance. In 2013, we're expecting segment operating margins to expand 50 basis points to 12.5%. This growth will be fueled by 120 basis points of operational improvement, primarily from productivity. In addition, we are expecting 60 basis points of incremental benefit from the 2012 and 2013 restructuring actions. Prior to the impact of Bornemann, adjusted segment operating margins are expected to expand 110 basis points. We will use these operational strengths to offset inflation and to fund our 80 basis points impact from our organic growth investments.
Now let's wrap up on Slide 11, where we've summarized our 2013 annual guidance in the form of an adjusted EPS walk. We expect 2013 adjusted EPS to grow 10% at the midpoint of our $1.80 to $1.90 per share range. Please note that this range reflects the $0.02 per share impact from the recently announced currency devaluation in Venezuela. As a result of some of the top line uncertainty caused by the current macroeconomic conditions, our 10% adjusted EPS midpoint growth will be driven by strong productivity gains and operational improvements that we can control.
In 2013, we will deliver gross productivity of $100 million or $0.26 per share by leveraging the ITT management system to drive incremental Lean Six Sigma and global sourcing initiatives. This productivity also reflects over $12 million in incremental restructuring savings from the 2012 and 2013 actions that were primarily centered on improving our European operational effectiveness.
As we have effectively done in the past, we will once again reinvest a healthy portion of this year's productivity back into our long-term strategic growth initiative. This year's $0.14 of investments will be focused in 4 areas with very attractive and profitable long-term dynamics: global oil and gas, the ITT lean transformation, aerospace and global aftermarket capture.
Unallocated corporate expenses are expected to be generally in line with 2012 levels. However, certain nonoperating expenses are expected to increase compared to 2012 due to higher prior year insurance recoveries. Our structural effective tax rate is projected to be consistent with 2012 levels at 31%, and we expect the average 2013 diluted share count to be between 92 million and 92.5 million shares, reflecting the benefits of today's announced buyback, which will help to offset increased option exercises and dilution attributable to the recent share price gains.

Finally, I'd like to point out that in 2013, we expect mid-single-digit accretion from the Bornemann acquisition, excluding integration and step-up amortization impacts.
So in summary, we believe our 2013 guidance is reflective of the current environment we face, and is balanced for the potential headwinds and tailwinds. We will focus our efforts on delivering the productivity within our control, executing the Bornemann integration and generating strong returns on our organic investments.
Now let me turn it back to Christy to start the Q&A.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Brian Konigsberg of Vertical Research.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC
So just, first, starting on the Industrial Process and project delays, if you'd give us a little more color on where you're seeing the delays, your confidence that it's just simply a delay, not a cancellation. And if you can, if you would characterize it by OE versus aftermarket? We were hearing from some of your peers that aftermarket actually took a pause in Q4. Did you see similar trends?
Denise L. Ramos
Yes, this is Denise. In terms of IP, where we're seeing most of the project delays are in the oil and gas end market. And what we're seeing and what gives us some confidence in the back half of the year is when you look at some of the activity that's been taking place, the FEED activity, the quote activity, that remains high. So actually we're seeing some acceleration with those quotes and what's happening from that perspective. And so we think and we believe that, that is going to benefit us as we get into the back half of the year, but we need to see some of those projects coming through in around this first quarter in order for us to benefit with some of that into the back half of the year. The other thing, remember, in terms of the back half of the year, the backlog that we have in IP today is -- because they're long lead-time projects, they do -- many of those projects are back-end loaded, and we know that they're going to be delivered in the back half. In terms of aftermarket, we're actually seeing that aftermarket is holding up very nicely for us. So we're not seeing many challenges with that currently. We did see a slowdown in the fourth quarter, and we saw that continue a little bit into January. But what we've seen -- been seeing is we've been seeing some increasing positive signs coming from the aftermarket as we've transitioned into the first quarter.
Thomas M. Scalera
And, Brian, just to follow up on the mining side, that's one of the markets where we are continuing to see more pervasive delays playing through, and that's why we've indicated the down 20% in the mining market. Those projects are in a little bit more of a pronounced delay cycle at this point. But again, we haven't seen cancellations. Some of those projects are just slow to come online from an OE perspective.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC
Got you. And if I could just move over to Interconnect. So the margin in the quarter was actually fairly strong. It's a nice improvement from Q3. Maybe just give us some color, how much of that is from restructuring actions you've taken already versus, I don't know, improvement operationally within the group itself without the benefits of restructuring? And how do we think about the run rate going into '13?
Denise L. Ramos
Let me just give an overview, first, for connectors, and I'll have Tom respond specific to the question. What's happening in connectors right now is we are refocusing that business on some of the key growth markets in the harsh environment sector of these markets. So we've been doing a lot of work from a very holistic perspective around front end and better coordination on the front end, around engineering, marketing and sales. We've also been driving the operation, and we've been driving more productivity. We're doing more kaizens in the facilities, and we're driving considerable operational improvements and productivity into that business. And we took some restructuring in that business that's going to help change that cost structure so that we get a more efficient and effective cost structure.

Thomas M. Scalera
Yes. And, Brian, at this point, there were benefits in Q4 from the restructuring actions we had initiated earlier in 2012. So we're starting to gain momentum there, about -- maybe $1 million to $2 million of restructuring benefits already falling into Q4. And the way to think about this, we've announced some other actions. Those are coming online early in the first half of 2013. So the run rate that we exited 2012 will certainly accelerate -- will generate incremental savings in 2013 from new actions. So on an all-in basis, for the full year 2012, we probably generated anywhere from $4 million to $5 million of benefit on restructuring activities at ICS in 2012, and we would expect a number about twice that size based on the actions we're taking in 2013.
Operator
Your next question comes from Mike Halloran of Robert W. Baird.
Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division
So on the Industrial Process side, I think the slide deck had the Bornemann Pumps acquisition about 110-basis-point headwind in the quarter on the margins there. Could you talk a little bit about how much of that is kind of operational? How much of that is more onetime items associated with the transaction itself? And then also when you think about '13, could you talk a little bit about how you expect those $6 million to $8 million of costs to layer in through the year? And I'll leave it there.
Thomas M. Scalera
Yes, sure. Mike, so that 110-basis-point impact to IP margins in the fourth quarter was attributable to operational disruption in the fourth quarter. So there's about a $0.02 hit that we saw in the Bornemann results, and I think that was really attributable to doing an acquisition late in the year. So we didn't have very much time, including the December holidays, to really go through the required kind of shutdowns, inventory accounting and other activities. So there was a little bit of disruption in the December results that really caused the drag you're seeing in the margins. Again, it was about $0.02 impact. What we've then excluded for 2012 and what we'll exclude for 2013 are the integration costs and the inventory amortization step-up. There was some of those costs that took place in 2012 that were not part of this margin analysis because they were in the special items category, given the size and the nonrecurring nature. So as you look into 2013, it's -- the $6 million to $8 million that we're talking about is probably $4 million to $5 million of inventory step-up amortization and the rest is integration activities. And I would say, given the long-cycle nature of this business, it's going to take us all 4 quarters to run that $6 million to $8 million through the P&L, and it'll be done ratably throughout the year.
Denise L. Ramos
So we've owned Bornemann now for about 2.5 months. And let me tell you, this is an exciting business. Their fundamental business is outstanding. We're very optimistic. In fact, we even like it more now than we did really before we owned them. Their product development pipeline is very exciting. We're really getting into that and getting the team together to align around that. They have a food and pharma business, which is very exciting to us, where we see that we can provide some infrastructure report in North America to help it grow. We also -- the synergies that we've identified, we're excited about. Those synergies tend to be in the aftermarket, which is one of our key growth areas in IP anyway, where we're going to leverage service centers and we're going to look at pricing strategies. We're going to be able to leverage our North America distribution channel and leverage some of the strategic agreements that we have there. And we've had really positive reaction from our customers. So it's all been extremely positive for us with Bornemann. I have visited there twice. The team is excited. We're excited about having them as part of ITT going forward. When you look at what we've seen in the first quarter, so far in the first 2 months, they've had very solid orders and backlog, in fact, ahead of our expectations. So we continue to remain very, very excited and optimistic about this acquisition.

Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division
No, I agree. It makes sense. Last one there, the $6 million to $8 million, Tom, you guys are including or excluding that from the adjusted number?
Thomas M. Scalera
That is an adjustment, so it would be a special item. It would be excluded from our guidance.
Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division
Got it.
Thomas M. Scalera
We put a table in the press release -- I'm sorry, in our slides that highlights the items that are excluded, deemed special items. So there's actually on one of our -- what page it's on? Page 7. You could see the table there with the items that are excluded.
Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division
Yes, sounds good. And then on the European automotive side of things, maybe just talk a little bit about what the production schedules look like. What the customers are saying at this point of how they expect their business to ramp or not ramp, I suppose, through the year at this point.
Thomas M. Scalera
Yes. Mike, the conditions in European automotive are, obviously, challenging, and we're now seeing that across all the different countries in Germany, so -- I'm sorry, in Europe, and including Germany at this point. So it's been evolving throughout the region to the point where all of the producers are facing more pronounced headwinds. So the way we look at the market going in, we expect it to be a down market. It's similar to what we saw in 2012. Despite these production challenges across Europe, which could be anywhere -- for the full year, anywhere from 4% to 5% down from a total production basis, including Eastern Europe, we'll expect to outperform that based on the market share gains that we generated in 2012 and the platform content we see in Europe across our different customer base. We also have a strong aftermarket component within Europe, and that may make us unique relative to some of the other peers. While there are some pressures in the aftermarket, it is a generally stabilizing factor when we look across our revenue for the year. And we have pretty good line of sight at this point through the first quarter production, and I think that's giving us some comfort as we look through the first half of the year. The uncertainty remains around the second half production levels. So our year is fairly balanced, but we do have a front-end weighting towards more aftermarket, where we're seeing some better visibility. And we think we'll be watching more closely the second half production levels across the European producer customer base.
Denise L. Ramos
The business model that we have there and the operating model that we have there is proving to be very effective in this type of a situation that we have in Europe right now. Because while Europe is having some of its challenges in the automotive market, because of the type of operation that we run, where we're able to solve problems quickly, where we've got very good quality in the brake pads, we're able to continue to gain share in Europe to help compensate for that. And then with our brake pad business, what we're doing is taking what's been historically a European business, and we're expanding that into North America and China. And so we're expecting to see very strong growth rates in 2013, with about a 20% growth rate in North America and about 30% growth rate in China. So those platforms continue to do well for us as we become more of a global automotive company and transition away from just a European one.
Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division
Makes sense. Auto aftermarket is still about 2/3 in Europe, give or take?
Thomas M. Scalera
The auto aftermarket is probably a little closer to 50-50, Mike.

Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division
50-50? Okay.
Thomas M. Scalera
And as we've been winning share content, it's probably drifting a little bit north on the OE side of 50. So maybe 55-45 at this moment based on the recent share gains we've had.
Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division
Just last one for me then. You saw a spike in the margins on the Control Tech side. Maybe if you could just talk a little bit about how much of that is just the reconfigured portfolio? How much is mixed? How much is mix from here? And then what's the appropriate level to think about when you look at '13 and beyond?
Thomas M. Scalera
Yes. It's a great question, Mike. We did pick up maybe 20 basis points of margin based on the divestiture of a nonstrategic product line. So that gives us a little bit of margin tailwind. But obviously, you look at those margins for Q4, north of 21%. We have a very strong operating culture at Control Technologies. So we're refocusing the front end of that business, the product line divestiture is an example of that, that we're going to continue to drive a very strong productivity-oriented organization to end markets where we have greater competitive advantages and the ability to really drive value for our customers. And that has been translating to positive mix, positive price, positive volume. So at this point, we'll continue to refine that portfolio and really channel those strengths to drive these kinds of margins. We'll have a little bit of a margin headwind next year when the defense and one of the aerospace programs that they have face some pressures. But the underlying strength of this business is something we're going to continue to leverage and grow on from where we are at this point.
Operator
Your next question comes from Matt Summerville of KeyBanc.
Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division
Couple of questions. You've talked about the anticipated growth rates you're looking for in North America and China in Motion Tech. Can you talk about, specifically, if that growth is predominantly being driven by the historical relationship you've talked about with Ford, or whether or not you are seeing progress in sort of breaking into some of the other 2 large remaining North American OEs?
Thomas M. Scalera
Yes, great question, Matt. So at this point, North America for us is still a Ford conversation. Having said that, we continue to work on expanding platforms with Ford, and we'll obviously benefit from new introductions and new models that they have. But what we're talking about for 2013 at this point is exclusively Ford. But I could tell you that we have a number of ongoing conversations. GM is a global customer of ours that we deal with quite a bit in Europe and also in China. So we'll continue to have ongoing dialogue with all of the producers, quite frankly, anywhere in the world, including the primary U.S. manufacturers. And in China, our customer base is really nicely diversified across our existing global relationships we have and the JVs that they're a part of. And even some of the local producers, we look at from time-to-time. So we have a very good pipeline of opportunities in China. And the fact that we've been up and running -- and you've seen in Q4 that our margins at Motion Tech were impacted by some investments at a much higher rate that you've seen historically. Those investments are really about starting up that facility in Wuxi, China, which is a very well run, heavily automated facility that mirrors the strengths that we have in Europe. So we really replicated the European production strengths and moved those into China. The fact that we're there and that we're up and running is drawing a lot of attention in the marketplace and is giving us a very significant pipeline of opportunities in the China market as well.

Denise L. Ramos
The fact that we have relationships with GM and some of these other more global companies outside of North America is benefiting us, especially as they start going more to global platforms and as they start looking at consolidating their supplier base. So I would expect to see that we'll continue to be able to penetrate into GM, Chrysler and some of these others because we've built relationships with them, not in North America, but elsewhere. And I think that will eventually translate into North America.
Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division
As we think about what you're trying to do from a lean standpoint and these round numbers, $100 million of productivity in '12, looking for $100 million of productivity in '13, how much of that are you seeing get inflated away? How much would you anticipate reinvesting into growth near term, but also just more on a longer-term run rate standpoint? I guess, Denise or Tom, what can we expect to trickle down to the bottom line as you get further along with this productivity push?
Denise L. Ramos
The lean transformation, just from a high-level perspective, is something that's getting a lot of focus here internally at ITT, and we see -- we've laid out a roadmap over the next 3 to 5 years of what we're going to be able to accomplish. So this is something that has gotten a lot of momentum, that everybody is getting aligned around, because we do believe that this is a way that's going to help drive value in this company. And so we've got a roadmap laid out for the next 3 to 4 years that lays out how we achieve the goals that we've established. So with that, Tom, then I'll turn it over to you.
Thomas M. Scalera
Yes. Matt, we typically target about 4% gross productivity using the mix of lean activities, which are, obviously, accelerating our focus on a go-forward basis, as Denise mentioned, global sourcing and then restructuring. So this year in 2013, we will see a heavier weighting towards restructuring benefits driving our gross productivity. So that's around 4%. We net that against the inflationary pressures that we see that range typically 2.5% to 3% inflation, that we want to stay ahead of, and we really want to drive productivity and not be reliant on price. So price for us is something that we strive for, and we have a lot of initiatives where we go out and target. But it's not an area that we want to rely on because there are market dynamics that sometimes are hard to control. So we drive productivity to offset inflation, and then we look at the balance of what drops through and use that to fund our strategic investments, maybe anywhere 50 basis points that would go into strategic investments based on the opportunities that we see. This year, we have a nice set of opportunities. We're talking about $0.14 of investment. But they are, in some cases, refueling the lean transformation because we are putting some of that investment dollar back into re-laying out some of our largest facilities and really improving our lean flow, and we're also looking at some very strong growth markets for us. So that's the way we think about it at a very high level.
Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division
And then I just -- I want to spend a minute talking about Industrial Process. First, can you talk about what the mix of business you saw in the core company for 2012 project versus aftermarket? And based on how you've rolled up the year for '13, how you expect that to evolve?
Thomas M. Scalera
Sure, yes. We're definitely seeing a change in dynamic there, Matt. There's no doubt about it. So we've been growing our portfolio in oil and gas and mining, and our capabilities are much more global than they've been. And we've been talking about this change in the weighting. So if I look at really large project mix, in 2011, it was in the 33% of our total revenue range. By 2012, that number had grown to 39%. So you look of that strong 20% organic growth that we drove in Industrial Process this year, that was heavily weighted towards new projects, that, that increased the weighting. For 2013, especially when you put Bornemann in, that number is going to move all the way up, maybe closer to 45% to 50% for 2013. So the key then is to really -- and Denise mentioned it, the aftermarket cycle for all of these OE platforms is going to start to kick in, in a much more significant way from a growth perspective. So it will take us time to kind of rebalance this percent mix that we see. But 2 to 3 years down the road, this aftermarket cycle should really start to torque up, and that'll give us an even nicer margin profile going forward.

Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division
And then just one last one for me on Bornemann. I think, Tom, in your prepared remarks, you specifically called out Bornemann being much stronger in the second half of '13 versus the first half based on kind of their project shipment schedule. Can you quantify that? Is it 60-40? Is it 80-20? Can you help put some numbers around that so we're able to model this correctly?
Thomas M. Scalera
Yes. It's closer to 60-40, Matt. And the back half being 60%, first half being 40%. And that's been the typical seasonality that we typically notice in Bornemann, and that's what we see in the current order book at this point.
Operator
Your next question comes from Jim Krapfel of KeyBanc -- I'm sorry, Morningstar.
James Krapfel - Morningstar Inc., Research Division
Yes, this is Jim, Morningstar. Can you explain efforts to expand your aftermarket capabilities and overall capture rate? And then what growth rate have you been seeing overall across the business and aftermarket?
Thomas M. Scalera
Yes, sure, Jim. The aftermarket capture strategies are fairly comprehensive. So we've looked at new systems and data to help us track aftermarket opportunities. We're putting new footprint online in key regions where we've been recently selling large projects, and we need to have a local presence to be able to provide the service capabilities. We're also putting new leadership in place that we're very excited about in our Industrial Process aftermarket to help us drive new strategies on a global basis in that business. And even as you go across the platform, there are some very interesting activities we have in both Motion Technologies and in our aerospace business to basically drive additional parts into the aftermarket cycle. And next year, we would expect, on this base, aftermarket growth in the 5% to 10% range, given where we are in 2013. As I mentioned before, we're starting to kind of build into that upward trajectory based on the projects we've been seeding globally over the last 2 to 3 years.
James Krapfel - Morningstar Inc., Research Division
Okay, great. And then second question, I know you have spoken about Interconnect Solutions being all things to all people and focusing more on the harsh environment. So for the 30% of the business that's specialized applications, would you expect -- how much of that would you expect to kind of go away over time and focusing more on the harsh environment?
Thomas M. Scalera
Yes. We're in that process now, Jim. So it -- with -- it's about 60% to 70% harsh environment today. So the remaining product lines, we're going through -- we always do product line EVA analysis. But certainly, when a business is facing the pressure that you're seeing in ICS, we've spent a lot more time really focusing through each product line and building a specific strategy for each one. And it varies across the portfolio based on the age of the product and what we see for the future. But the reality is we're going to keep focusing on our key growth end markets, like aerospace, and oil and gas, in particular medical and a few rail, a few of these harsh environment spaces where we are very strong. We think we have nice growth trajectory from this point, and we'll be very prescriptive in how we kind of manage the other product lines, including, in some cases, exiting small lines, if that makes more sense, to refocus us on the primary areas.
Operator
Your next question comes from John Inch of Deutsche Bank.
You have a follow-up from Brian Konigsberg.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC
Just following up on Industrial Process and really kind of honing in on your strategic alliances. So you guys have aligned yourself with Chevron, with Shell. You announced something fairly recently. I think you have an alliance with ConocoPhillips as well. Just kind of thinking about the upcoming build of petrochemical projects in the United States, kind of really North America, how did those strategic alliances actually position you? Does that give you exclusive rights to sell pumps and valves into the projects that they're building, or is it really going to be -- remain a competitive scenario when those get off the ground?

Denise L. Ramos
No, it remains a competitive scenario. But what happens is you become what I'll call a preferred supplier. So what typically happens is there would be maybe 3 suppliers that would have these strategic agreements, and really what you've done is they've said that you meet their criteria that they have for a person that they want to do business with. And so while it doesn't eliminate the competition that exists there, it does make -- it does narrow it, and so that you're in competition with just a couple of people within that bidding process. And then what they end up doing is because they don't want to align totally with just one supplier, they will tend to spread out the process over a number of different suppliers, and so they don't just rely on one supplier.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC
And just on aftermarket there as well, how would you say -- or how would you characterize the biggest competition? Is it more the customer base that's repairing or working on their own equipment, or is it really -- are you competing against your peers there?
Thomas M. Scalera
Yes. Brian, I would say it kind of -- it varies. So there are certain pumps and projects based on size and complexity, where we could see our customer servicing that equipment, and you'll see that kind of activity. That may be part of the delays that we experienced in Q4 in the cycle. As you start to move up the complexity scale, certainly, we think if we're the OE producer, we have the best opportunity to capture that aftermarket, given the technical specifications and tolerances, which is really where our focus is. There are some areas in between where we do see other players that we'll try to disintermediate and try to grab some parts here and there, and occasionally, the larger players will also look across the spectrum of opportunities. But the key for us is to remain very competitive in how we see these large complex global projects, and then follow that up with a good global aftermarket capture streams so that we can be close to those customers. And we think that combination gives us a high capture rate success.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC
Do you have any idea how penetrated you are today and where that could go?
Thomas M. Scalera
In North America, we're very heavily penetrated from an aftermarket capture strategy. The key for us is the global growth that we've had in oil and gas and mining and, now, even in chemical it's really picking up on a global basis is that we need to continue to put more resources in play outside of North America, and that'll help us capture a higher percent of the activity. We do have a new aftermarket leader in Industrial Process that's helping us really map out where we think we see the best opportunities to make those aftermarket investments. But we do have good capabilities around global parts in the aftermarket. We do have strong service, but there's certainly opportunity for us to make growth investments outside of North America.
Denise L. Ramos
We see this as a very nice growth opportunity for us, and we recognize that when you look at where we are today in the margins that we have in IP being impacted by the fact that we have a lot of these large projects that are there, over time, that is going to change as we get more aftermarket business. And as Tom indicated, we just hired a new aftermarket leader in Industrial Process that we're very excited about, that's going to be looking at our aftermarket strategy globally. And so our focus is to be able to drive that to create incremental value for us.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC
Great. And just one last question, just on seals. So that's, obviously, a very important component of the pump and, I guess, the biggest source of aftermarket service. Is that something you'd be strategically interested in bringing in-house, or does it make more sense to source it externally?

Denise L. Ramos
We -- it's -- we look at a lot of different opportunities when we think about the pipeline for IP. We have to think about whether or not that is a core competency that we really think that we have internally to be able to do that and couple it with the pumps that we have. So I'd say it's an ongoing discussion point that we have internally and -- but we've made really no conclusion on that.
Operator
Your next question comes from John Inch of Deutsche Bank.
John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Sorry about the technology issues. So and I apologize, I got on the call late. But does your '13 guide, Denise and Tom, include aftermarket benefit from all of these sort of Class 3, Class 4 pumps that you've been installing over the years? Do you think that, that aftermarket from a -- the install kicks in this year, or is it more of an event for next year?
Denise L. Ramos
I don't think it's a significant impact in 2013 for us. I'd say it's been a gradual incline around those -- around that aftermarket. But I wouldn't hold that out as something that's significantly changing and impacting our trajectory for 2013. We will see that continue to build as we go out into 2014 and '15.
Thomas M. Scalera
And certainly, as Bornemann's mix right now is more heavily weighted towards OE, so you'll -- we'll continue to add -- they have about 25% of their revenue in the aftermarket. So this gradual build, I think, is from our recent project activity, and that's going to start to pick up. If you go back 2 or 3 years ago, those projects are starting to kind of begin to ramp through in 2013. What we want to do, as Denise mentioned, is build up the aftermarkets we can capture, the greater content on Bornemann, their aftermarket as we're building up our own aftermarket base. But I do think it's a gradual slope in '13 and start to pick up more noticeably in '14.
John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
But you are seeing some of this already, are you not?
Thomas M. Scalera
Yes, yes.
Denise L. Ramos
We are. We are, John.
Thomas M. Scalera
Yes. We're seeing -- the first cycle that's churning through, we're seeing capital spares start to come through at this point, from projects we sold 2 to 3 years ago.
John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Right, okay. No, that make sense. On Bornemann, my understanding was that they licensed away their aftermarket, and that ITT, on a relatively short period basis, would be able to sort of realign contracts and begin to do that stuff yourself. Is that -- and I apologize if you went over this. But is that a significant part of your '13 guide, or does that kick in more proportionately as you unwind some of those third-party agreements and do more of the stuff yourself? Is that more proportionately an impact for '14?
Denise L. Ramos
It's going to impact in 2014, because we've got some things to work through there. And remember, this is a long-cycle business. So what you've got in the pipeline today and in the backlog today, you're really not going to be able to impact much until you get out into 2014 based on the initiatives that you put in place today.
Thomas M. Scalera
But I could tell you, John, we're actively working all the issues right now. It's one of our top priorities. It's just the contract timing and the market timing issues that we just have to work through this year.
John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
If I can switch gears to automotive in Europe, where was your auto business in Europe in '12? Like it -- was it roughly flat? Because the builds were down about 10%. Where I'm going with this...
Denise L. Ramos
Yes, it was flat to plus one, John. And that's Europe in total. That would be Western and Eastern Europe.
John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Right. So builds are going to be down. I realize it's still difficult, but down much less. Are you expecting the business to be up?
Thomas M. Scalera
We're kind of targeting more in the flattish, John. I think the reason why it's hard to bring over exactly last year's formula is we were able to win platforms in 2012 based on the responsiveness of our R&D, the responsiveness of our manufacturing, where we basically captured some of these opportunities midyear. And that's a little different dynamic. I think that was a reflection of some of the instability in the marketplace. Some of our customers were consolidating their supply chains, and I think we happened to be very well positioned to grab that share. We're positioned well to do that in 2013. It's just a little harder to project whether or not some of those opportunities may fall our way. But right now, we'll continue to assume a reasonable aftermarket and the benefits of what we've been able to capture and win, from a European platform perspective. And if we're able to be more successful in some opportunities that pop up during 2013, that'll be a tailwind for us.
John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
That's fine. It just sounds like with 50% of the business aftermarket, that's -- your assumption is pretty conservative for '13. I wanted to ask you, too, about these plants in Korea and Wuxi. How much -- if you were to kind of look at them in a collective, how much are they dragging results, perhaps because of start-up costs and other things in '13? And what could that lead to in terms of, say, benefit in the other years?
Thomas M. Scalera
Yes, so the P&L drag right now has been more pronounced in the Motion Technologies build-up of Wuxi. We literally brought that whole facility online, putting new staff, new training, a complete reset of that facility to really something that, at this point, looks to be fairly state-of-the-art in how it's operating. So we had a bigger set of start-up costs in 2012 for Wuxi. And those were a drag of anywhere $6 million to $7 million just to get that kind of up and running. It takes a long time in that industry to have your technology and capability certified by your customer. So there's a long kind of process where you just have to get everything in line before you can start to produce. We're glad, in Q4, we really hit our stride from a production perspective. But we see a lot of additional opportunities going forward. So we will probably see some additional costs in '13 as we take the China volumes even up to the next level. In Korea, we've had minimal P&L impact. It's been more of a capital buildout of that facility, and we have a strong operation in Korea today that's well capitalized with good engineering and infrastructure talent. So we'll probably have $1 million or $2 million of a start-up in '13, but we'll hit the ground running once that facility is up.
John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
So it's also fair to say, I'm assuming, that '14 should be a more significant contributing year, right, for both of those plants in terms of their efficiency and cash utilization and so forth?
Denise L. Ramos
Yes. Because they will both be up and running and would have gone through the initial stages of operations. The other thing that we're doing is in the IP business, we are expanding our Seneca Falls facility also. So we're -- because of the tremendous growth that we've had there as part of leaning up that facility and the growth that we've had, we're also expanding that along with building the Korea facility. So we feel really good about this business and where it's headed.
John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Just lastly. I know you did that small divestiture of that somewhat unrelated business in the Control Technologies segment. How are you guys feeling about the portfolio? Do you see any other little divestiture pruning to occur, or are we mostly set?

Denise L. Ramos
We're mostly set with Control Technologies. We may see a little here or there, but nothing significant. We're aligned around 2 main platforms in Control Technologies, one being aerospace components and the other being energy absorption. And now what we're doing is we're looking at ways to expand and grow those 2 platforms that we have, really looking at global growth and going, at times, direct to customers with those 2 platforms. So we have been able to nicely focus and reposition that portfolio around those 2 key categories.
John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
So for ITT as a whole, Denise, we should not really be expecting any further divestitures, even small ones, in the coming years. Is that a fair statement?
Denise L. Ramos
You shouldn't be expecting anything really, John. We may be, as Tom mentioned, in connectors, exiting some product lines. But that probably would not be through a sale, even though it could be. But it would be something very, very small.
Operator
I would now like to turn the floor back over to management for any closing remarks.
Denise L. Ramos
Well, I just want to thank you all for joining us on our call today. We feel very good about our first year in 2012 and what we were able to accomplish, and we're excited about the initiatives that we've laid out for 2013 and what we're going to be able to achieve in 2013. So we look forward to talking to you during the next quarter. Thank you.
