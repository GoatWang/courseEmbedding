New and Improved ENERGY STAR Guide for Restaurants
  ENERGY STAR, together with the Pacific Gas & Electric Company (PG&E) Food Service Technology Center (FSTC) and the National Restaurant Association’s Conserve initiative,  recently finalized the revised ENERGY STAR Guide for Restaurants.

  The updated guide includes an extensive list of tips and best practices for restaurateurs to save energy, save money, and promote sustainability in both full service and quick service restaurants. The guide outlines low- or no-cost savings tips for a wide range of kitchen equipment, as well as potential savings calculations for upgrading to ENERGY STAR qualified equipment. 
  

The ENERGY STAR Guide for Restaurants is a useful starting point for restauranteurs looking to implement energy saving measures and also for individuals looking to fine tune their existing sustainability programs to enhance savings.

  The updated ENERGY STAR Guide for Restaurants is now available on the ENERGY STAR Web site at: www.energystar.gov/cfs (under “Other Links”).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
ENERGY STAR CFS Product Development Update 
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently opened two ENERGY STAR CFS specifications for revision (commercial fryers and hot food holding cabinets) and fully transitioned to the new Version 2.0 refrigeration specification. 

  A status update of the revision process can be found below and all associated documentation is available on the ENERGY STAR Product Development Web site: www.energystar.gov/productdevelopment (click on “Revisions to Existing Product Specifications”).
For questions or comments about any of the CFS specification development efforts, please contact Bijit Kundu, ICF International, at bkundu@icfi.com or Chris Kent, EPA, at (202) 343-9046 or kent.christopher@epa.gov. 
Commercial Fryers
On December 2, 2009, EPA launched the revision of the Version 1.0 ENERGY STAR specification for commercial fryers. EPA is interested in expanding the scope of the existing fryer specification to include larger size fryers (greater than 15 inches) and welcomes stakeholder participation in the specification development process. 
Manufacturers and other stakeholders are encouraged to provide EPA with performance data for non-qualified fryers, especially commercial fryers larger and smaller than 15 inches, using the data submission form available here.
Manufacturers are encouraged to send completed data forms to Bijit Kundu, ICF International, at bkundu@icfi.com by February 19, 2010. EPA intends to distribute a first draft of the revised specification sometime in February 2010 based on submitted data and will schedule a Web-based meeting in March 2010 to gather stakeholder feedback.
Commercial Hot Food Holding Cabinets
On November 16, 2009, EPA launched the revision of the Version 1.0 ENERGY STAR specification for commercial hot food holding cabinets. EPA expects to focus this revision on the maximum idle energy rate and potentially expand the specification's scope. 
EPA has been collecting performance data on hot food holding cabinets from stakeholders to ensure that ENERGY STAR sets the new energy efficiency requirements at appropriate levels that are reflective of the overall market. In addition, EPA held a Web-based stakeholder meeting on December 9, 2009, to gather stakeholder feedback and address stakeholder comments and questions. EPA intends to complete the specification revision process by May 2010, and encourages continued stakeholder participation.
Commercial Refrigerators and Freezers
On January 1, 2010, the Version 2.0 ENERGY STAR specification for commercial refrigerators and freezers took effect and all solid door models qualified under the previous specification were removed from the qualified product list posted to the Web site. EPA posted the new list of solid door models (in addition to the currently qualified glass and mixed door models) that meet the new specification on January 1, 2010. Additional solid door models will be added to this list as product submissions are reviewed and approved. (Glass and mixed door models have been able to qualify under the Version 2.0 specification as of April 1, 2009.) 
All partners should please note that commercial refrigeration products manufactured on or after January 1, 2010, that do not meet the current Version 2.0 specification requirements must not be labeled with the ENERGY STAR. 

  For questions or concerns, please e-mail: 
commercialrefrigeration@energstar.gov.

Hobart Center for Foodservice Sustainability Grant
The Hobart Center for Foodservice Sustainability is now accepting applications for a $5,000 grant that will honor the most innovative and best-executed food service sustainability project of the year. The winner will be announced at the 2010 Greenbuild Expo held November 16 to 19, 2010, in Chicago, Illinois and will be awarded a $5,000 cash prize to invest in additional sustainability measures. 
Submissions must include project photography, an outline of sustainability measures, and a financial analysis of the sustainability program. Hobart encourages applicants to describe the specific food service equipment types used to achieve sustainability goals, including ENERGY STAR qualified equipment. 
The deadline for submissions is August 31, 2010. For further information about the grant and the submission process, visit: www.hobartcorp.com/sustainabledesign.

 EPA's Climate Leaders Program 

Periodically, the ENERGY STAR CFS newsletter will highlight additional EPA programs that can help ENERGY STAR partners reduce their environmental impact. 

  Climate Leaders is an EPA sponsored voluntary partnership that assists companies to develop comprehensive climate change strategies. Partners commit to decreasing their environmental footprint by undertaking a corporate-wide inventory of their greenhouse gas emissions, setting reduction targets, and reporting progress to EPA on an annual basis. The program offers national recognition to partners that establish and reach reduction goals. 

  Companies that join Climate Leaders often receive numerous benefits, such as: reducing the company’s environmental impact; capturing cost savings through energy efficiency; and networking with other dedicated partner companies that demonstrate climate leadership. 

  EPA estimates that by achieving greenhouse gas reduction goals, the program will prevent the emission of more than 13 million metric tons of carbon equivalents per year, which is equal to the annual emissions of nine million cars! 

  For more information on the Climate Leaders program,  visit: www.epa.gov/climateleaders.

Partner Spotlight: FoodServiceWarehouse.com, LLC 
FoodServiceWarehouse.com, LLC (FSW), an online commercial food service dealer specializing in environmentally sustainable equipment and small wares, joined ENERGY STAR as a retail partner in April 2008. Through the sale of ENERGY STAR equipment during 2009 alone, FSW estimates that they have saved their customers more than $300,000 and at least five million kilowatt-hours of energy. FSW has also become an ENERGY STAR partner as a manufacturer of commercial refrigerators and freezers. Currently, FoodServiceWarehouse.com is developing their own FSW brand of energy-efficient commercial refrigerators and freezers, which will be designed to earn the ENERGY STAR. Moving forward, FSW intends to extend its brand to countertop cooking equipment. This manufacturing endeavor will go hand-in-hand with FSW’s ongoing efforts to promote sustainability to commercial kitchen operators.
In addition to selling and manufacturing equipment, FSW also maintains one of the largest free online education centers for sustainability in the food service industry, proactively educating commercial kitchen operators about environmentally friendly measures for both the front and back of the house. To further support the food service industry’s incorporation of sustainable practices, FSW developed an environmental achievement recognition initiative called the Certified Green Commercial Kitchen (CGCK) Program. The CGCK Program is a point-based system comprised of four major focus areas: energy conservation; water conservation; waste reduction; and green cleaning. Commercial kitchen operators that purchase ENERGY STAR qualified CFS equipment, for example, will accrue points towards obtaining their CGCK certification. The program is free to participants and no purchase from FSW is necessary. 
The CGCK Program relies upon specifications set by third-party organizations such as ENERGY STAR and the Consortium for Energy Efficiency (CEE) to develop checklists to guide commercial kitchen operators toward more sustainable choices. Those operators that achieve a certain number of points per category earn recognition from the program. In creating the program, FSW convened a council of independent experts from Edison Electric Institute, Eco-Logo, the PG&E Food Service Technology Center, and ENERGY STAR to help advise them in the program's development. “We firmly believe that a group of individuals going 20 percent of the way to make a change to promote sustainable practices is better than just a few individuals making 100 percent effort. Change can be made on a small level, but can have a very powerful impact if done in aggregate,” says Steve Kurtz, Vice President at FSW; “ENERGY STAR’s guidance has been integral to the development of the CGCK Program to promote this type of collective effort.” 
For more information on FSW's products and environmental efforts, visit: www.foodservicewarehouse.com and www.cgck.org.

ENERGY STAR Partners Awarded 2009 Best in Class from FE&S
 In November 2009, Foodservice Equipment & Supplies (FE&S) announced the results from its 2009 Best in Class study.

		      A number of ENERGY STAR CFS partners won the prestigious award for Overall Best in Class for Heavy Equipment, which is broken down by equipment type (e.g., dishwashers, steamers, convection ovens) allowing a company to win in more than one category. 

		      The following ENERGY STAR partners, listed in alphabetical order, received 2009 Best in Class awards: 

		      - Blodgett Oven Company (2 awards)

 ENERGY STAR Marketing 
		    Assistance 
EPA would like to remind all ENERGY STAR partners about the importance of protecting the ENERGY STAR brand as a valuable marketing tool. All stakeholders and program participants have committed to follow the program's identity guidelines and should request clarification whenever necessary. 
CFS product offerings are developed to meet the complex demands of commercial kitchen operations. Consequently, many CFS manufacturers develop a variety of models under a single product family, but do not always qualify the entire family of models (e.g., a 3’ griddle but not the 2’ version, a standard depth convection oven but not the bakery depth equivalent). In this situation, clearly differentiated marketing is essential. When a single specification sheet is used for a series of models (where not all of the models have been ENERGY STAR qualified) partners must provide a clear, easy-to-find statement to specify which model variations are or are not ENERGY STAR qualified. 
The full ENERGY STAR Brand Book document, along with the Brief Guidelines to Using the ENERGY STAR Marks Correctly document, can be accessed at: www.energystar.gov/logouse. 
            One of the most important guidelines is the difference between the ENERGY STAR Partner, Promotional, and Certification Marks. Please carefully review the different uses of these marks. 
Both new and existing partners are welcome to request assistance in reviewing your Web site or marketing materials. For questions or concerns, please contact Jeffrey Clark or Natalie Chadwick, ICF International, at: commercialfoodservice@energystar.gov.

	Nick Sun, CFS®	


 Portfolio Strategist




Nick Sun is a graduate of Kutztown University with a BSBA in Business Management.  Prior to completing his undergraduate studies, he worked as an intern at Ellis Investment Partners, LLC (EIP LLC) during summer and winter breaks.  He quickly learned various aspects of the portfolio management process while providing support to overall operations.  Upon graduating in 2013, Nick continued in a part-time capacity at EIP, LLC and started positions at two other organizations for additional experience in retail and food services.  His time at Abercrombie & Fitch and Wegman’s exposed him to two very different corporate cultures which formed a strong basis in understanding how corporations perform beyond financial statements.
Nick assumed a full-time role as Portfolio Strategist in April of 2016 during the expansion of operations to support the firm’s commitment to clients as EIP, LLC continued to grow at a rapid pace.  With over 3 years of experience in the financial services industry and the completion of the CFS designation, he is an integral part of the Portfolio Management Operations Team (PMOT).   As a member of the PMOT, Nick works closely with our consultants in the construction & monitoring of portfolios.  He is also actively involved in research & analysis where his focus is in the area of individual equity securities.  He constantly screens ongoing lists of companies seeking possible “buy” candidates that meet our fundamental parameters and updates necessary data to determine future actions on companies that are on our “Action List.”
On a personal note, Nick and his fiancé, Kelsey, enjoy travel, dining, movies, music and cooking.  They plan on residing in the Philadelphia area with their dog, Koa, upon getting married.  Growing up as an athlete has evolved into a love for all sports ranging from Baseball to Formula 1 Racing.
