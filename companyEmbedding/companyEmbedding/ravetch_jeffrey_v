Background and training[edit]
Ravetch earned his B.S. degree at Yale University in 1973 in molecular biophysics and biochemistry working with Donald Crothers on the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of synthetic oligoribonucleotides. He received a Ph.D from The Rockefeller University in 1978 in bacterial genetics working in the laboratory of Norton Zinder and Peter Model in the Laboratory of Genetics at Rockefeller and an M.D. from Cornell University Medical School in 1979. He completed postdoctoral studies at the National Institutes of Health with Philip Leder, where he identified and characterized the genes for human antibodies and the DNA elements involved in switch recombination. From 1982 to 1996 Dr. Ravetch was a member of the faculty of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and Cornell Medical College. Currently, Ravetch is the Theresa and Eugene M. Lang Professor in the Leonard Wagner Laboratory of Molecular Genetics and Immunology at The Rockefeller University.[1][2][3][4][5][6]
Summary of research achievements[edit]
Ravetch revealed the mechanisms by which antibodies mediate and regulate their diverse in vivo effector functions through the characterization of the structural and functional diversity of the Fc region and their interactions with the family of Fc receptors he defined. His studies have focused on the redesign of antibodies to enhance their therapeutic capacity for the treatment of infectious, neoplastic and inflammatory diseases.

Background and training[edit]
Ravetch earned his B.S. degree at Yale University in 1973 in molecular biophysics and biochemistry working with Donald Crothers on the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of synthetic oligoribonucleotides. He received a Ph.D from The Rockefeller University in 1978 in bacterial genetics working in the laboratory of Norton Zinder and Peter Model in the Laboratory of Genetics at Rockefeller and an M.D. from Cornell University Medical School in 1979. He completed postdoctoral studies at the National Institutes of Health with Philip Leder, where he identified and characterized the genes for human antibodies and the DNA elements involved in switch recombination. From 1982 to 1996 Dr. Ravetch was a member of the faculty of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and Cornell Medical College. Currently, Ravetch is the Theresa and Eugene M. Lang Professor in the Leonard Wagner Laboratory of Molecular Genetics and Immunology at The Rockefeller University.[1][2][3][4][5][6]
Summary of research achievements[edit]
Ravetch revealed the mechanisms by which antibodies mediate and regulate their diverse in vivo effector functions through the characterization of the structural and functional diversity of the Fc region and their interactions with the family of Fc receptors he defined. His studies have focused on the redesign of antibodies to enhance their therapeutic capacity for the treatment of infectious, neoplastic and inflammatory diseases.

Jeffrey V. Ravetch receives 2017 Ross Prize in Molecular Medicine



                    February 21, 2017
                  












Jeffrey V. Ravetch, Theresa and Eugene M. Lang Professor and head of the Leonard Wagner Laboratory of Molecular Genetics and Immunology, has won the 2017 Ross Prize in Molecular Medicine. The award, given by The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research and its journal Molecular Medicine, honors scientists who have made a significant impact on the understanding of human disease pathogenesis and the development of innovative treatments. Ravetch will receive a $50,000 honorarium and present a lecture at The New York Academy of Sciences on June 5.


Dr. Jeffrey V. Ravetch

Recent work in the Ravetch lab has shed light on why some people are more vulnerable than others to developing life-threatening secondary infections from the dengue virus.Ravetch studies how a functioning immune system protects against invaders, and how a dysfunctional immune system attacks the body’s own tissues in autoimmune disease. He is widely known for his work on Fc receptors, proteins on the surface of immune cells that interact with antibodies. By binding to Fc receptors, antibodies are able to change immune cells’ protective activity. This interaction is critical to the immune systems’ ability to defend against toxins, bacteria, and viruses. Ravetch’s work on the Fc receptor pathway—an essential part of the immune response—has led to new approaches to treating autoimmune disease as well as cancer and infectious disease.
Ravetch received his Ph.D. in 1978 from Rockefeller and his M.D. from Cornell University Medical College in 1979. In 1982, he joined the faculty of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and in 1984 also became a guest investigator in Rockefeller’s Laboratory of Cellular Physiology and Immunology. He was appointed professor at Rockefeller in 1996. Among his many honors are the 2007 Coley Award from the Cancer Research Institute; the Canada Gairdner International Award and the Sanofi–Institut Pasteur Award, both in 2012; and the 2015 Wolf Prize in Medicine. Ravetch is a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Medicine.
The Feinstein Institute was established in 1995 as the research arm of Northwell Health, the largest healthcare provider in New York. Now in its fifth year, the Ross Prize is awarded through the institute’s journal Molecular Medicine, which addresses disease pathogenesis at the cellular and molecular levels. The Ross Prize aims to cultivate promising careers in the fields of science and research.

          Dr. Ravetch dissects the cellular and molecular mechanisms that govern the generation of antibody specificity and the translation of that specificity into cellular responses. By identifying the genetic components that cause immune system cells to respond to specific antibodies, Dr. Ravetch hopes to gain a better understanding of how a functioning immune system protects organisms from invaders, and how a dysfunctional immune system attacks the body’s own tissues.
        
The Ravetch laboratory analyzes systemic autoimmunity in mouse models of certain diseases by investigating the genesis and fate of the pathological antigen-antibody complexes that trigger tissue damage. They simplify this problem by examining the mechanisms through which immune complexes influence both the afferent and efferent immune responses by interacting with a family of low-affinity surface receptors, the Fc receptors. These receptors are expressed as pairs of activation and inhibitory molecules, and play a central role in appropriate immune responses.
Dr. Ravetch has shown that inhibitory Fc receptors for immunoglobulin G (IgG) are responsible for maintaining peripheral tolerance; animals without inhibitory Fc receptors develop spontaneous autoimmunity and autoimmune disease. Conversely, mice susceptible to autoimmune disease fail to develop it if they have deficient activation of Fc receptors. But loss of activation receptors does not alter the development of autoantibody and immune complex deposition. Rather, Dr. Ravetch has found that these potentially pathogenic complexes are unable to trigger effector cell responses and are therefore benign. His lab is now investigating the precise cellular pathways engaged by activation receptors. Recent work from the Ravetch lab showed that a sugar attached to IgG antibodies confers their protective ability; they are now working on a synthetic therapy rich in these sugar-linked antibodies.
Another focus in the Ravetch lab is the regulation of shifts from inhibition to activation. He has demonstrated that removing the inhibitory pathway in vivo, for example, can dramatically increase the potency of a cytotoxic antitumor antibody. This was the first demonstration of antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity in vivo. Current studies aim at manipulating the inhibitory response to enhance or limit the cytotoxicity of antibodies in vivo to better understand the role of these pathways and their therapeutic potential.
The lab is also working to determine the pathways through which the coupling of innate and adaptive mechanisms are coordinated. Two such pathways are currently under investigation: the feedback by immune complexes on antigen presentation and the targeting of selected antigens to restricted follicular locations to initiate T cell independent responses. Using a series of mice deficient in specific Fc receptors and immune complexes designed to selectively engage these pathways, they are determining the role of each in activating or tolerizing presenting cells in vivo.
Work by Dr. Ravetch led to the cloning and mapping of the first malarial parasite chromosome and more recently to the cloning of the first Fc receptor genes. He discovered how immunoglobulin receptors mediate antibody-triggered inflammation and determined the mechanism by which intravenous immunoglobulin causes immunosuppression. He also played a key role in establishing Fc receptor pathways as an essential part of the immune response and in describing the mechanisms of antibody-mediated effector responses.

Profile of Jeffrey Ravetch


Philip Downey, Freelance Science Writer


Jeffrey Ravetch's career path began with a focus on the smallest scale—individual molecules—then ramped up to studies in microbes,
                           mice, and finally humans. For his work in immunological research, including contributions to unraveling the key mechanisms
                           by which receptors for the invariant stem (Fc) region of antibodies operate, Ravetch was elected to the National Academy of
                           Sciences in 2006.
                        
In his inaugural article, Ravetch and colleagues identified a receptor for sialylated Fc that stimulates anti-inflammatory
                           pathways (1). The receptor could potentially be a useful therapeutic for many autoimmune diseases, according to the study.
                        
Ravetch, 57, is currently the Theresa and Eugene M. Lang professor and head of the Leonard Wagner Laboratory of Molecular
                           Genetics and Immunology at the Rockefeller University (New York, NY). He grew up in nearby Brooklyn, excited by scientific
                           breakthroughs like the launch of Sputnik in the late 1950s and the subsequent space race. Books such as Paul de Kruif's Microbe Hunters (2) and biographies of Louis Pasteur and Albert Einstein fueled his imagination. “My heroes were scientists, not sports figures,”
                           he says.

Clouds of Chlorine
Ravetch's parents were teachers in New York City public schools, and although neither taught science, they were able to provide
                              their son with books, enrichment programs, and leftover lab equipment. “They let me do what I chose to in the basement. I
                              had a little makeshift laboratory where I would dabble,” he says. “You'd get books at the library that would tell you about
                              doing certain experiments and I'd make quite a mess, as you might imagine. I recall clouds of chlorine gas very distinctly
                              when I discovered the power of laundry bleach.”
                           
This self-directed learning foreshadowed Ravetch's academic career. From his initial basement work through high school, which
                              offered little in terms of science education, Ravetch conducted his own experiments and pursued his own projects.
                           
“[My high school] was a parochial school and didn't have any [science] facilities or teachers, so my education was basically
                              things I could do on my own,” he says. He would go on to spend summer camps at Carnegie Mellon University (Pittsburgh, PA),
                              work in a research lab on Long Island, and spend time in a marine research lab in Brooklyn in lieu of formal classwork during
                              his youth.

Jeffrey Ravetch



After high school, Ravetch was admitted to Yale University (New Haven, CT) in the late 1960s. “When I went to Yale I was finally
                              exposed to true science,” he says. “I was fortunate in being able to work in Don Crothers' lab as an undergraduate and that
                              was how I became a scientist. I really owe Don for having the patience to let a complete neophyte into the lab and break things.”
                              The Crothers group studied the physical biochemistry of nucleic acids, in particular, synthetic RNA duplexes.
                           
“I got there in my freshman year and I just stayed. Nights, weekends, summers, it was really my first scientific home. I published
                              my first paper when I was an undergraduate with Don” (3).

The Great Names
Sure that research was his destiny, Ravetch enrolled in Rockefeller's new M.D./Ph.D. program administered in tandem with Weill
                              Cornell Medical College (New York, NY). As a molecular biophysics and biochemistry and English major, he thought the combined
                              program was a good way to get grounded in biology, and its novelty attracted him.
                           
“In those days Rockefeller had a curriculum with no courses, no exams—it reminded me of my early years being self-educated.
                              You chose a laboratory, you chose a mentor, you decided what it was you wanted to study and designed a curriculum for yourself.
                              The qualifier was, you had to find 3 faculty members who signed off to say you fulfilled their sense of requirements in their
                              discipline,” he recalls. “I thought it was a great idea. I loved the idea that to qualify in genetics you sat in Norton Zinder's
                              office for an hour and talked genetics. If he thought you knew enough, you were qualified. It was more of the same with Günter
                              Blobel in cell biology. You had the opportunity—and you were required—to spend time with some of the great names in the field.”
                           
Ravetch worked in Zinder and Peter Model's joint lab at Rockefeller, focusing on bacterial and phage genetics. DNA sequencing
                              was a brand-new technique. “Through the rumor mill we heard it was a technique Wally Gilbert had developed,” he says. “I was
                              sent up to Wally's lab to learn DNA sequencing—there was no other way to do it. I remember sitting in Allan Maxam's little
                              cubicle and he showed me all of the reagents and gave me the protocols on hand-written pages that I Xeroxed. Then I brought
                              the gels and DNA sequencing to Rockefeller and started teaching people how to do it here.”
                           
One problem in the early days of sequencing was getting hold of restriction enzymes to manipulate DNA. “There were no companies
                              selling these back then, and you had to make each enzyme yourself, so there was a black market in restriction enzymes,” he
                              says. “You would make a few and then swap a few with a laboratory that had other ones,” Ravetch says.
                           
After finishing his Ph.D. (in 1978) and M.D. (in 1979), Ravetch joined Phil Leder's lab at the National Institutes of Health
                              (Bethesda, MD). Leder had just finished a remarkable series of studies on the genes that encode the light chain of Ig proteins
                              and the rearrangements that generate antibody diversity. Ravetch arrived in time to study the heavy chains of immunoglobulins.
                           
“There was a whole new world to figure out and we knew nothing about how the constant region could undergo this class switch
                              recombination,” he says. “There were various postdoctoral researchers in all these labs around the world competing with each
                              other. Each week we'd read each other's work in papers and Phil would go to a meeting and call us back and say, ‘Well, there's
                              a lot of new information,’ which was the bad news, but we were still in the game and I think we did some interesting work
                              from 1979 to 1982. It was an intense period of investigating this marvelously complex system of genes” (4, 5).

Into Fc Receptors
In 1982, Phil Leder accepted the chairmanship of the Department of Genetics at Harvard University (Cambridge, MA). “He dropped
                              me off in New York on his way there,” Ravetch says. “I took my freezer box full of the genes I had cloned and reagents I had
                              made, and started my own research group at the Sloan-Kettering Institute, across the street from Rockefeller. So I was close,
                              but not quite home yet.”
                           
Ravetch began research in two areas: the genetics of the malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, and the constant, or Fc, portion of antibody molecules. The malaria research took off quickly and he was able to clone some
                              of the first genes for P. falciparum, which revealed a genome that had undergone unique selection pressures, resulting in unusual chromosomes (6, 7).
                           
At the same time Ravetch pursued the genes for an Fc receptor, a formidable cloning project due to the rarity of the mRNA
                              for these proteins and a lack of enthusiasm from colleagues. “No one had any idea why there were Fc receptors,” he says. “The
                              prevailing idea was that the Fc region stabilized the molecule and determined the half-life of the antibody, and all of the
                              effector function was attributed to the complement cascade, so why would there even be Fc receptors? It made no biological
                              sense. There wasn't much interest. Basically I had it to myself” (8).
                           
Through the late 1980s and into the 1990s, Ravetch showed that some Fc receptors had important biological functions, and that
                              our understanding of the interactions between antibodies, the complement system, and inflammation was not just incomplete,
                              but flawed. With a few Fc receptors cloned, his next step was to use the new technology of transgenic mice to create Fc receptor
                              knockout mice. The step from cells to animals changed Ravetch from a molecular biologist to a full-fledged immunologist.
                           
The first knockout mice his group made were deficient in activating Fc receptors, which promote inflammation. To Ravetch's
                              surprise, the mice could not respond to immune complexes of antibodies (9). The result meant that antibodies and complement were not interacting as previously thought, and that Fc receptors were
                              essential to initiate the inflammatory response. Many people considered the results heretical, Ravetch says.
                           
The next mouse line that they made had no inhibitory Fc receptor to calm inflammation (10). “When we made a mouse lacking the inhibitory receptor, we saw enhanced inflammation in a variety of inflammatory models,
                              as you might expect,” he says. “But what we didn't expect was a spontaneous phenotype—meaning do nothing to the mice and they
                              develop lupus (11). That really shocked us. ”
                           
Ravetch's research led to a new paradigm in immunology. “It was one of the first examples of a balanced signaling system in
                              an immunological system, where it had both activating and inhibitory properties,” he says. “It's kind of a common theme now
                              in immunology. Many systems show this paradigm, but when we first came across it in the mid to late 1990s, it was somewhat
                              unusual.”

The Significance of Sialylation
The next phase of Ravetch's career began when he came across intravenous Ig (IVIG), a therapy for autoimmune diseases. IVIG
                              is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for a small number of diseases but is also used for ≈85 autoimmune diseases.
                              The drug consists of concentrated i.v. doses of IgG antibodies nearly a thousand times stronger than a normal treatment. This
                              apparent overdose suppresses the immune system instead of activating it.
                           

“No one had any idea why there were Fc receptors.”

To Ravetch, the body's immune response to the medication indicated that a small fraction of the IgGs were somehow different.
                              Eventually, he found that, although all IgGs are glycosylated, a small fraction contain a sialic acid group added to the glycan
                              sugars. He was able to isolate this fraction and found that the sialic acid converts the IgG Fc region from a proinflammatory
                              molecule to an anti-inflammatory one (12). Such converted IgGs bind to a lectin on a regulatory cell population that subsequently stimulates an increase in expression
                              of an inhibitory Fc receptor on effector cells, thus shutting down the inflammatory response (13).
                           
In his inaugural article (1), Ravetch and colleagues identify the receptor for these sialylated Fc fragments, which is called SIGN-R1 in mice and DC-SIGN
                              in humans. The receptor is unrelated to previously identified Fc receptors, and instead is a C-type lectin expressed on the
                              surface of macrophages in the spleen of mice and on dendritic cells in humans. Without it, sialylated Fc fragments cannot
                              suppress inflammation.
                           
His results show that there is an unrecognized pathway that Fc molecules stimulate to suppress inflammation. The researchers
                              suggest that regulatory cells release soluble factors that travel throughout the body, which up-regulate inhibitory Fc receptors
                              on effector macrophages, calming inflammation.
                           
Ravetch's studies have had practical results for monoclonal antibodies like herceptin and rituximab, which treat breast cancer
                              and lymphoma, respectively. His work suggested that the Fc receptor seems to be key to their ability to shrink tumors (14).
                           
“When I gave my first talk at an antibody therapeutic meeting in 2000 and showed data that a mouse deficient in activating
                              Fc receptors could not modulate a tumor being treated with rituximab because it didn't have Fc receptors, the response was,
                              ‘That's completely impossible. Rituximab works because it's modifying how this CD20 molecule is signaling.’ And none of that
                              is true,” he says. “That's not how it works at all.”
                           
Because of his work, scientists designing the next generation of antibody therapeutics now take into account Fc receptors
                              and their glycosylation patterns, as well as binding epitopes of the Fab.
                           
Ravetch is now developing a sialylated Fc portion to augment the efficacy of IVIG. He has a sample of a readily made experimental
                              molecule, and has found clinical researchers willing to test it (15). The current stumbling block is the financing required to make significant quantities of the drug that meet the FDA's standards.
                              Instead of working with a drug company, Ravetch and Rockefeller have teamed up with venture capitalists to raise the necessary
                              funds.

Orchids in the Lab
Despite having begun his career in molecular biology, Ravetch has also tried his hand at genetics, immunology, and glycobiology,
                              and he may venture into clinical trials with humans. “Our system has taken us through a lot of different areas,” he says,
                              “and right now the push is to try understand what regulates glycosylation in vivo, what the structural implications are on
                              the binding specificity, and what the signaling pathways are. If this is in fact what is going on, it should lead to an experiment
                              in humans. I would very much like to take IVIG and make it 10 times more potent or make it as a recombinant. It's already
                              worked in animal systems.”
                           
Ravetch has won several awards for his research, including a National Institutes of Health MERIT Award, the Lee C. Howley,
                              Sr. Award and the William B. Coley Award from the Cancer Research Institute. He is a member of the Institute of Medicine,
                              and is a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
                           
But Ravetch's life isn't totally consumed by science. Besides his love of poetry, which began when he was an undergraduate
                              at Yale, he has devoted one corner of his lab to orchids, which he, his staff, and students grow for fun, relaxation, and
                              competition. “The orchidarium is one of the places where people can sit and chat and have coffee,” he says. “It provides a
                              welcome distraction. It's part of my philosophy—you should want to spend all your time in the lab, it should be the best place
                              you know. It's all about having an envi-ronment where you look forward to coming to work and just enjoy sticking around.”

A New Paradigm in Immunology Leading to Improved Therapies for Autoimmune Diseases
Ravetch, Jeffrey
For decades, intravenous therapy with immunoglobulin G (IgG)-a preparation of antibodies purified from the blood of thousands of donors-has been used to treat lupus, arthritis, and other autoimmune diseases. But this presents a paradox: autoimmune diseases are triggered when IgG attacks a person's own tissues, so how can administering it as a therapy reduce inflammation? Rockefeller immunologist Jeffrey V. Ravetch (1951- ) has spent the last ten years unraveling IgG's anti-inflammatory effects at the molecular level, and his results have provided the basis for designing new, more potent, antibodies for use as therapies against autoimmune diseases.
These advances in medicine are the result of Ravetch's fundamental discoveries on the nature of the immune response. In the early 1980s, he set out to discover the function of a region called Fc on antibody, or immunoglobulin, molecules. In 1986 Ravetch and colleagues were the first to clone genes for Fc receptors, which are found on immune cells such as macrophages. In detailing the pathways by which immunoglobulins and Fc receptors interact, Ravetch overturned conventional wisdom about how IgG initiates an immune response. Previously, scientists thought that IgG worked through biochemical pathways known as the complement system to eliminate pathogens. Ravetch's research established the centrality of Fc receptors in regulating both inflammation and immunosuppression triggered by antibodies. He discovered that some Fc receptors activate immune signaling whereas others inhibit it. The inhibitory pathway is crucial for so-called immunological tolerance-for preventing the immune system from attacking its own tissues. Ravetch's genetic studies in mice have shown that animals without inhibitory Fc receptors develop autoimmune disease, and that restoring Fc receptor levels prevents autoimmunity in a mouse model of lupus. Other researchers have implicated faulty Fc receptors in several human autoimmune diseases. 
Ravetch's studies on Fc receptors provided the basis for solving the paradox of intravenous IgG therapy. He discovered that IgG's ability to either promote or suppress inflammation depends on whether its Fc region contains a sugar molecule called sialic acid at its tip. When present, the sugar molecule confers anti-inflammatory properties on IgG. When absent, the IgG molecules lose their immunosuppressive abilities and trigger inflammation, an essential role for eliminating pathogens. Using this knowledge, Ravetch and colleagues produced an engineered, sialylated IgG molecule that was 30 times more effective than intravenous IgG in mouse models of autoimmune diseases, including arthritis. These results have provided a route for developing alternative therapies to intravenous IgG for people with autoimmune diseases. In addition, the new understanding of Fc receptors revealed by Ravetch and colleagues is aiding the development of antibodies for treating certain cancers.
Beyond his pathbreaking discoveries on the mechanisms of antibody mediated inflammation and modulation, Ravetch discovered the first chemokine molecule, IP-10, opening the field of a new family of regulatory molecules in the immune response. He also has contributed to the understanding of genetic variation in the human malaria parasite, P. falciparum. He was the first to clone and map a chromosome of this parasite and he uncovered the ability of the parasite's chromosomes to generate genetic diversification by undergoing breakage and healing.

Jeffrey V. Ravetch received the BS from Yale (1973), the PhD from The Rockefeller University (1978), and the MD from Cornell University Medical School (1979). After postdoctoral research with Philip Leder at the National Institutes of Health (1979-1982), Ravetch joined the faculty of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and Cornell Medical College in 1982. He moved to Rockefeller in 1996 and was named Theresa and Eugene Lang Professor in 1997. Ravetch has received numerous awards for his research, including the Burroughs-Wellcome Scholar Award, the Pew Scholar Award, the Boyer Award, the NIH Merit Award, the Lee C. Howley, Sr. Prize for Arthritis Research, the AAI-Huang Foundation Meritorious Career Award, and the William B. Coley Award. He is an elected member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences (2006) and its Institute of Medicine (2007).  Ravetch also has been elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (2008).
