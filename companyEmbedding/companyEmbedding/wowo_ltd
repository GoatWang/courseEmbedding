Business WOWO's goal is to make direct interaction possible between local lifestyle merchants and their target customers through unique offerings. WOWO helps local customers discover food, shops, activities and events near the places where they live and work, while supporting local merchants to grow their businesses exponentially and raise awareness of their brands.
 WOWO operates one of China's leading third-party e-commerce platforms, focusing on local entertainment and lifestyle services such as restaurants, movie theaters and beauty salons. WOWO does not compete with its merchant clients by offering its own goods and services nor does WOWO keep inventory of any merchandise. WOWO's unique platform allows local merchants to customize and arrange their online stores, make direct sales to their target customers and process a large volume of online sales for consumption at their brick and mortar stores. According to iResearch, WOWO's platform represents the largest e-commerce platform for local lifestyle services in terms of number of merchants and registered users as of June 30, 2014. As of September 30, 2014, WOWO has also established a nationwide network of merchant service centers to support local businesses in 150 major cities and population centers across China. WOWO's platform consists of an e-commerce website, "WoWo Mall", a mobile commerce infrastructure, "WoWo Mobile", and an electronic management system, "WoWo EMS". The three components of WOWO's platform are designed to create an integrated network that enhances the interaction between businesses and consumers that reinforces brand awareness and fosters repeat customers for its merchant clients. WOWO's "WoWo Mall" website located at 55.com is used to promote and market its company's brand eminence and complete e-service platform by exhibiting its merchant client's online stores and introduce certain selected services and products. Potential customers may then be directed to 55tuan.com to obtain information on the latest attractive offerings available through such merchants. WOWO began its business as a group buying website under the brand "WoWo Buy" located at 55tuan.com in March 2010. WOWO quickly found that the group buying business model did not fully meet the needs of local service providers. While the group buying business model often helps merchants increase their sales by selling extra capacity, WOWO believes it does not, as a stand-alone offering, significantly promote brand awareness for the merchants or create customer loyalty to the merchants.
 Merchants also face additional margin pressure from the fees charged by these group buying sites that could further erode their margins. For example, flash sales conducted by third-party group buying websites often promote the brands of the websites over the brands of the merchants. At the same time, local merchants continue to have limited branding power or control over the marketing direction. By June 2012, WOWO augmented its WoWo Buy model with its promotional portal at 55.com to complete its WoWo Mall. WoWo Mall not only permits merchants to establish their own online stores, it also allows the merchants to increase their branding power by providing them with customizable features to establish the look and feel they want to be associated with their brands. In the third quarter of 2014, WOWO hosted and provided operating services to over 100,000 local entertainment and lifestyle merchants on its websites. Intellectual property As of September 30, 2014, WOWO has 18 trademarks registered with the Trademark Office of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, and WOWO had registered 90 domain names, including 55.com and 55tuan.com. These websites are not a part of this prospectus. Competition The e-commerce service providers in China can be categorized into two sectors. One sector consists of self-operated vendors modeled after Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN), including jd.com, meituan.com and the group buy channel of dianping.com. Another sector consists of third-party platform operators such tmall.com, which focuses on the sales of goods, and us, focusing on sales of local services. 5% shareholders pre-IPO Maodong Xu 36.30% Xiaoyi Niu 16.45% Yongming Zhang 9.69% Jianguang Wu 7.79% CDH Barley Limited 16.45% Tianyou Investment Limited 9.69% Dividends No dividends are planned.

WOWO Becoming China's First O2O IPO Following Its Successful Initial Public Offering on NASDAQ
 


 

 




 





 


BEIJING, April 10, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- China's leading local services e-commerce platform www.55.com (hereafter referred to as "WOWO" or "the company") (the former 55tuan.com), April 8 US time, listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the ticker symbol "WOWO" at a price of $10 per share.  The initial public offering reached 4 million American depository shares, with each share equal to 18 shares of the company's common stock, raising $40 million in financing. At the same time, the company chose a new name: WOWO. 


WOWO is the first Chinese company to be listed on a US stock exchange this year. It is also the first China-based Internet firm to be successfully listed in the US since the Chinese Ministry of Commerce issued the PRC Foreign Investment Law (Draft for Comments). As the company is described as an online to offline (O2O) business, it is as already being described in the media as "China's first O2O IPO".  
WOWO first submitted a prospectus to the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) on January 10, 2015, in which WOWO stated its commitment to providing an online sales platform for local service businesses across China. Through the website www.55.com and the mobile app, the company provides local service providers with a platform where they can open online stores and sell their services or products directly to the end-consumer. In that the company has assisted many local service businesses in launching stores online, WOWO is frequently compared to Tmall by industry insiders. The only difference between the two platforms is that Tmall serves sellers of tangible goods whereas WOWO works for the local services sector. 
The Chinese Ministry of Commerce issued the PRC Foreign Investment Law (Draft for Comments) on January 19, 2015, seeking feedback from the general public in an open forum. As WOWO is the first IPO application from a Chinese Internet firm, US regulators paid it particularly close attention. After several rounds of talks between WOWO and the SEC, WOWO was finally given approval. The experience could provide a blueprint for other Internet firms seeking to launch an IPO in the US. 
WOWO's precursor 55tuan was founded in March 2010 and was once ranked among the top three portals in China's group buying sector. 55tuan rolled out an online shopping mall in early 2012, aimed at assisting businesses in setting up online stores and enabling businesses to sell services or products directly to the end-consumer. It upgraded the platform in July 2014 to allow businesses to create mobile versions of their online stores. By aligning with third-party mobile platforms including WeChat, zhida.baidu.com and Alipay service window, it enabled local businesses to manage their own marketing and sales activities directly on their mobile devices, including the management of both pricing and customer databases. By promoting the direct interaction between businesses and consumers, 55tuan succeeded in raising the brand visibility of the businesses and building the loyalty of their customers. The services offered by WOWO are transforming China's local service providers including restaurants, hair cutters and beauty salons, wedding planners and various providers of entertainment into true e-commerce businesses. 
Up to the third quarter of 2014, more than 100,000 businesses on WOWO's e-commerce platform had provided over 43,000 online products and services. WOWO has local teams on the ground in 150 cities across the country and 34.1 million registered users. One highlight is the high percentage of mobile users across WOWO's entire business range, with 17.3 million installations of the mobile client as of September, 2014 and 64 percent of the platform's turnover coming from the mobile segment. 
According to Mo Daiqing, senior analyst at China E-business Research Center and head of its Online Retail Department, the successful initial public offering of WOWO will boost the development of mobile e-commerce. It is also drive the growth of the local services e-commerce, as overseas capital markets take notice of the market potential and the room for growth. In addition, the success of the IPO will stimulate the entire industry and shift the focus of overseas capital from comprehensive e-businesses such as alibaba and Jingdong over to the exploration of opportunities in these more defined segments across the e-business spectrum. 
China's Internet industry is now facing unprecedented development opportunities. At this year's high level NPC and CPPCC sessions, the State Council put forward the "Internet Plus" initiative. Traditional industries are beginning to actively embrace the Internet and looking to integrate their online and offline activities with mobile, which, in turn, contributes to the increase of users and to the attraction of the O2O sector to capital markets. As "the first O2O IPO", WOWO is likely to succeed in obtaining more financing as well as the visibility of the brand, both of which will serve to fuel further rapid advancement. WOWO is on track to become one of the most influential O2O players in China. More Chinese companies, especially Internet firms, are likely to seek a listing in the US this year on the heels of WOWO's success.

“Living in Dubai we get extreme weather, most of the time it’s blazing hot. I look after my Ferrari F430 with the whole Wowo’s range and I couldn’t be happier. Even here where people tend not to wash their own cars I love doing mine with these products, especially the Hot Wax. Even in this environment it’s so easy to apply and remove, even when it’s so hot.”


Johnathan Neil, Dubai, F430 CS

“I look after my Ferrari F430 with the whole Wowo’s range and I couldn’t be happier”






“I popped into the Wowo’s factory to replace some of my existing products. The staff knew more about the car care than I thought was possible. I left there with a selection of products and I can say my car has never looked so good. The beading off the Wax Shampoo alone is just crazy!”


Kevin Gray, Focus ST

“The beading off the Wax Shampoo alone is just crazy!”






“I won one of Wowo’s competitions on social media to win a tub of their Signature Wax. I then bought a bottle of the Awesome Foam at the same time and I can easily say the foam is crazy thick with great cleaning and the wax is one of the easiest waxes I have ever used and the finish and smoothness of the surface is second to none. Highly recommended.”


Mark Kelly, Competition Winner

“…the wax is one of the easiest waxes I have ever used and the finish and smoothness of the surface is second to none…”






“It’s not often I get excited about car care products as owning a bodyshop I have been using good products every day for years, but the Wowo’s range is so easy to use with great results that I can get excited about cleaning my own car again.”


Robert MacDonald, RM Bodywork

“…the Wowo’s range is so easy to use with great results…”






“I have used a lot of products both professionally with Angelic Car Care and personally, and I can assure you that the Wowo’s range is one of the most complete ranges available and all really easy to use to get great results.”


Daniel Glasgow, Angelic Car Care

“…one of the most complete ranges available and all really easy to use to get great results.”
