Numbering about 4,000, the medical school's faculty roster includes some of the best minds and hearts in medicine and biomedical research. Many have gained national and international prominence.New FacultyMaryam K Pezhouh, MD, MScAssistant Professor of PathologyMy primary research interests are in the field of Gastrointestinal Pathology, with particular interest in Inflammatory bowel disease and infection.Rimas V Lukas, MDAssociate Professor of Neurology (Neuro-oncology)Dr. Lukas, sub-specializing in neuro-oncology, is interested in the care of patients with primary brain tumors and spinal cord tumors as well as central nervous system (CNS) metastases.  Dr. Lukas's research centers on clinical trials in neuro-oncology.  Additionally, he has a strong interest in medical education in the U.S. and internationally and conducts research in neuroscience medical education.Jinny O Tavee, MDAssociate Professor of Neurology (Neuromuscular Disease)Dr. Tavee is a neuromuscular physician with a special interest in neuropathy, neurosarcoidosis and integrative holistic medicine. In addition to her neuromuscular and sarcoidosis research, she has been involved with clinical studies on the effects of meditation in neurological disorders, and has led meditation retreats for patients, physicians, and U.S. Marines returning from the Gulf War through the Wounded Warriors program.Jeffrey A Linder, MD, MPHProfessor of Medicine (General Internal Medicine and Geriatrics)Jeffrey A. Linder, MD, MPH, FACP is a general internist and primary care clinician-investigator. Dr. Linder is the Michael A. Gertz Professor of Medicine and the Chief of the Division of General Internal Medicine and Geriatrics at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. 

Dr. Linder received his medical degree from Northwestern University School of Medicine, did a Fellowship in General Medicine and Primary Care at Massachusetts General Hospital, and has a Masters of Public Health degree from the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health. Dr. Linder was on faculty at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School from 2002 to 2017.Marina  Arvanitis, MDAssistant Professor of Medicine (General Internal Medicine and Geriatrics)I am a primary care pediatrician and internist, and a health services researcher. My research focuses on health literacy and patient engagement, including the development of health literacy-related quality measures and primary care-based interventions aimed at improving health outcomes. As a primary care physician for patients of all ages, I am particularly interested in how children develop health literacy skills within their families and larger communities, and interventions that can enhance family health literacy.Gemma L Carvill, PhDAssistant Professor of Neurology - Ken and Ruth Davee Department and PharmacologyThe primary aim of our research is to identify the genetic factors and biological mechanisms that cause epilepsy. We use a variety of sequencing technologies to identify new genetic causes in both the DNA regions that code for proteins (genes) and those that control the expression of these genes (regulatory regions). 

The second mission of our lab is to capitalize on the advances in gene discovery in epilepsy to create neuronal models of this disorder. Many of these 'epilepsy' genes are involved in the control of expression of other genes. In other words, they are responsible for switching certain genes 'on' or 'off' during the development and/or functioning of the brain. This switching is dependent on the 3D structure of DNA - called the epigenome. We use stem cell biology to create models of these 'epigenetic' genes to study how mutations affect the structure of the epigenome and the pathways affected. Identifying these pathways are the first step in finding new targets for therapeutics.Christina E Boots, MDAssistant Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology (Reproductive Endo and Infertility)Infertility, assisted reproductive technology, polycystic ovary syndrome, effects of nutrition and metabolism on reproductive outcomes, recurrent pregnancy loss, fertility preservation, and diminished ovarian reserve.J. Chad Duncan, PhDAssociate Professor of Physical Medicine and RehabilitationMy current research interests include psychosocial aspects of disability, prosthetics/orthotics and the world of work, and outcome measures. For the past few years I have been investigating how to determine appropriate  protocols for prosthetic and orthotic patients based on informed decision making.Monica M Laronda, PhDAssistant Professor of Pediatrics (Endocrinology)The Laronda Lab investigates fundamental regenerative medicine problems using stem cells and supportive biomimetic environments. Our main objective is to develop a patient-specific ovarian follicle niche that will support systemic endocrine function and fertility in women and girls with disorders of sex development or premature ovarian failure.
http://www.pediatrics.northwestern.edu/research/labs/laronda/index.htmlHuiping  Liu, MD, PhDAssociate Professor of Pharmacology and Medicine (Hematology and Oncology)The Liu lab studies the molecular mechanisms underlying cancer stem cells (CSCs) and metastasis through four ongoing interactive basic and translational research projects: (1) to understand CSCs in metastasis using cutting-edge single cell sequencing and CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technologies; (2) to image CSC behavior and interactions with immune cells during metastasis using bioluminescence imaging and intravital imaging systems; (3) to target CSCs with novel therapeutics delivered by exosomes and nanoparticles; (4) to develop circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and circulating exosome-based biomarkers for cancer diagnosis, treatment monitoring, and prognosis.Information ForFor FacultyYour faculty profile is a tool for documenting your career accomplishments and publicizing your work.

Abstract
The talapoin monkey is distinct from its close relatives in the genus Cercopithecus in a variety of morphological and ecological features, inclining some to place it in its own genus, Miopithecus. It is also the smallest of the extant catarrhines, and in this investigation the extent to which the morphological distinctions of the talapoin monkey are the result of allometric factors is analysed. A series of cranial and postcranial measurements were taken on the skeletons of young and adult talapoin monkeys (C. talapoin) and moustached monkeys (C. cephus). Ontogenetic scaling (i.e., allometric extrapolation) was utilized as a criterion of substraction in both bivariate and multivariate comparative allometric analysis. Adult cranial and postcranial proportions do differ significantly between C. talapoin and C. cephus, but in almost all cases these adult shape differences result from the sharing of common underlying patterns of ontogenetic allometry. Use of additional data from Verheyen's (1962) monograph suggests that the marked differences in skull form within the Cercopithecus group (from talapoin to patas monkeys) may also be primarily a product of ontogenetic scaling. The specific postcranial proportions seen in adult talapoins do not accord with expectations derived from several recent biomechanical models for primates which engage in frequent leaping and climbing behaviors, though the comparative growth allometric perspective utilized here does clarify these adult shape differences. The predominantly paedomorphic morphology of the talapoin monkey appears to be a direct and correlated allometric consequence of a decrease in overall growth rates and terminal body size, which may be related to increased propensities for leaping behavior and a more insectivorous diet.
