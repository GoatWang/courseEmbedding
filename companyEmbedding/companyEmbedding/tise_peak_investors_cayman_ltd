Guernsey: TISE Gets Backing For German Funds Investment 
Last Updated: 9 May 2017
Article by Fiona  Le PoidevinGuernseyFinance
Your LinkedIn Connections at FirmMost Read Contributor in Guernsey, June 2017The International Stock Exchange (TISE), which is headquartered
in Guernsey, has received recognition from the German Federal
Financial Supervisory Authority BaFin (Bundesanstalt für
Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht).
The recognition means that German funds established under the
European Union's Undertakings for Collective Investment in
Transferable Securities (UCITS) Directive can now invest into
securities listed on TISE.
Fiona Le Poidevin, Chief Executive of TISE, was delighted that
TISE's application to BaFin for recognition had been
successful.
"It is highly significant that the financial services
regulator of German has approved the application at this
time," Mrs Le Poidevin said. "The fact that BaFin is
happy to allow German UCITS funds, which themselves will have
ordinary retail investors, to invest in products listed on TISE is
a huge endorsement of our regulatory standards and adds significant
weight to the credibility of the Exchange.
"It also demonstrates that the financial services
authorities in Germany recognise the role that the British Crown
Dependencies play in the flow of global capital."
The application to BaFin was supported by the German Investment
Funds Association, BVI (Bundesverband Investment und Asset
Management).
Mrs Le Poidevin said the BVI's assistance and support for
the application demonstrated the demand within the German fund
community to have a wider set of potential investment
opportunities, including securities listed on TISE.
"At the same time, this recognition also means that issuers
seeking to list securities on TISE now have an even wider set of
investors who can invest into their products," she added.
"The German mutual fund market offers a significant pool of
potential capital which could be deployed and so this recognition
adds markedly to the attraction of a TISE listing."
TISE has been added to the list of markets approved by BaFin
under section 193 of the Capital Investment Act, KAGB
(Kapitalanlagegesetzbuch). It details the conditions under which a
German UCITS fund management company me acquire securities for the
account of a domestic UCITS fund.
There were 502 new listing on TISE in 2016, a rise of 18.7% on
2015. The market capitalisation of all listed securities on TISE
last year increased by Ł36 billion (10%) to reach Ł393
billion by the end of the year.

Registration
Mondaq Ltd requires you to register and provide information that personally 
identifies you, including what sort of information you are interested in, for 
three primary purposes: 

To allow you to personalize the Mondaq websites you are visiting. 
  To enable features such as password reminder, newsletter alerts, email a 
  colleague, and linking from Mondaq (and its affiliate sites) to your website. 
  To produce demographic feedback for our information providers who provide 
  information free for your use. 
Mondaq (and its affiliate sites) do not sell or provide your details to third 
parties other than information providers. The reason we provide our information 
providers with this information is so that they can measure the response their 
articles are receiving and provide you with information about their products and 
services.
If you do not want us to provide your name and email address you may opt out 
by clicking here .
If you do not wish to receive any future announcements of products and 
services offered by Mondaq by clicking here . 
Information Collection and Use
We require site users to register with Mondaq (and its affiliate sites) to 
view the free information on the site. We also collect information from our 
users at several different points on the websites: this is so that we can 
customise the sites according to individual usage, provide 'session-aware' 
functionality, and ensure that content is acquired and developed appropriately. 
This gives us an overall picture of our user profiles, which in turn shows to 
our Editorial Contributors the type of person they are reaching by posting 
articles on Mondaq (and its affiliate sites)  meaning more free content for 
registered users. 
We are only able to provide the material on the Mondaq (and its affiliate 
sites) site free to site visitors because we can pass on information about the 
pages that users are viewing and the personal information users provide to us 
(e.g. email addresses) to reputable contributing firms such as law firms who 
author those pages. We do not sell or rent information to anyone else other than 
the authors of those pages, who may change from time to time. Should you wish us 
not to disclose your details to any of these parties, please tick the box above 
or tick the box marked "Opt out of Registration Information Disclosure" on the 
Your Profile page. We and our author organisations may only contact you via 
email or other means if you allow us to do so. Users can opt out of contact when 
they register on the site, or send an email to unsubscribe@mondaq.com with no 
disclosure in the subject heading 
Mondaq News Alerts
In order to receive Mondaq News Alerts, users have to complete a separate 
registration form. This is a personalised service where users choose regions and 
topics of interest and we send it only to those users who have requested it. 
Users can stop receiving these Alerts by going to the Mondaq News Alerts page 
and deselecting all interest areas. In the same way users can amend their 
personal preferences to add or remove subject areas. 
Cookies
A cookie is a small text file written to a users hard drive that contains an 
identifying user number. The cookies do not contain any personal information 
about users. We use the cookie so users do not have to log in every time they 
use the service and the cookie will automatically expire if you do not visit the 
Mondaq website (or its affiliate sites) for 12 months. We also use the cookie to 
personalise a user's experience of the site (for example to show information 
specific to a user's region). As the Mondaq sites are fully personalised and 
cookies are essential to its core technology the site will function 
unpredictably with browsers that do not support cookies - or where cookies are 
disabled (in these circumstances we advise you to attempt to locate the 
information you require elsewhere on the web). However if you are concerned 
about the presence of a Mondaq cookie on your machine you can also choose to 
expire the cookie immediately (remove it) by selecting the 'Log Off' menu option 
as the last thing you do when you use the site. 
Some of our business partners may use cookies on our site (for example, 
advertisers). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies and we 
are not aware of any at present that do so. 
Log Files
We use IP addresses to analyse trends, administer the site, track movement, 
and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not 
linked to personally identifiable information. 
Links
This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that Mondaq (or 
its affiliate sites) are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other 
sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read 
the privacy statements of these third party sites. This privacy statement 
applies solely to information collected by this Web site. 
Surveys & Contests
From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or 
contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and 
the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose any information 
requested. Information requested may include contact information (such as name 
and delivery address), and demographic information (such as postcode, age 
level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. 
Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the 
functionality of the site. 
Mail-A-Friend
If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our 
site, we ask them for the friends name and email address. Mondaq stores this 
information and may contact the friend to invite them to register with Mondaq, 
but they will not be contacted more than once. The friend may contact Mondaq to 
request the removal of this information from our database. 
Security
This website takes every reasonable precaution to protect our users 
information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your 
information is protected using firewalls and other security technology. If you 
have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to 
webmaster@mondaq.com. 
Correcting/Updating Personal Information
If a users personally identifiable information changes (such as postcode), 
or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavour to provide a way 
to correct, update or remove that users personal data provided to us. This can 
usually be done at the Your Profile page or by sending an email to EditorialAdvisor@mondaq.com.
Notification of Changes
If we decide to change our Terms & Conditions or Privacy Policy, we will 
post those changes on our site so our users are always aware of what information 
we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. 
If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner 
different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by 
way of an email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their 
information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with 
the privacy policy under which the information was collected. 
How to contact Mondaq
You can contact us with comments or queries at enquiries@mondaq.com.
If for some reason you believe Mondaq Ltd. has not adhered to these 
principles, please notify us by e-mail at problems@mondaq.com and we will use 
commercially reasonable efforts to determine and correct the problem promptly.
