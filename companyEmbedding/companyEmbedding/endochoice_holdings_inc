Fuse®. Full Spectrum Endoscopy®.
Advancing Your GI Practice.
Colonoscopy is widely accepted as the gold standard for screening, surveillance, and diagnosis of lower GI diseases. However, endoscopy technology has not changed significantly in decades and interval cancers still occur1.  In a tandem study using traditional, forward-viewing (TFV) endoscopes, Rex et al. found they missed 24% of the adenomas in the first colonoscopy. Since that landmark study, other technologies have shown the miss rate for TFV to be 31%2.
In another multi-center tandem trial, the Fuse® endoscope system demonstrated the miss rate on adenomas with TFV was 41%. Out of 88 patients, a total of 48 adenomas were observed. TFV identified 28 adenomas. Fuse observed an additional 20 adenomas. This means an additional 69% more adenomas were detected by Fuse that traditional, forward-viewing endoscopes missed3.  Conversely, when the patient received a colonoscopy with Fuse first, followed by TFV, the researchers had an adenoma miss rate of only 7%3.
How was this achieved? Traditional endoscopes provide no more than a 170° field of view. Fuse Full Spectrum Endoscopy provides a panoramic 330° field of view, allowing the endoscopist to see nearly twice as much anatomy as traditional endoscopes.









See The Difference.
Fuse® projects the expanded view onto a 4K Ultra HD display, giving you previously unseen views, such as behind colonic and pyloric folds, and other difficult anatomy. The revolutionary Fuse endoscope system allows clinicians to see more of the GI tract than ever before.  While traditional endoscopes offer a limited field of view (no more than 170° for colonoscope or up to 150° for gastroscope), the Fuse endoscope system provides a significantly expanded field of view (330° for colonoscope; 245° for gastroscope).  
Multiple imagers make the panoramic view possible. LEDs illuminate the field like never before, adding longevity and durability beyond fiber optic illumination. Using a technique similar to the ancient art of origami, EndoChoice® engineers arranged all these components comfortably into the Fuse endoscope's distal tip.

We estimate that we will receive net proceeds from this offering of
approximately $85.1 million (or $94.9 million if the underwriters exercise their
option to purchase additional shares in full), after deducting estimated
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us.

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital to
support our operations, create a public market for our common stock and to
facilitate future access to the public equity markets. We currently expect to
use the net proceeds of this offering primarily to fund the commercialization
and continued development of our Fuse® system as follows:

• approximately $29 million for the expansion of our sales and marketing    
  activities, including hiring new direct sales representatives;            

• approximately $27 million for increases in working capital requirements   
  related to accounts receivable and inventory;                             

• approximately $17 million for capital expenditures for new product 
  demonstration equipment, including colon models and other simulation      
  equipment, used by our sales representatives and other personnel for Fuse®
  product demonstrations to GI specialists;                                 

• approximately $4 million for investments to expand our manufacturing      
  capacity as sales of our Fuse® system and other products increase in the  
  future, which will include the acquisition of equipment and other fixed   
  assets related primarily to the manufacturing of our Fuse® system and our 
  other products; and                                                       

• the remainder for other general corporate purposes.

In addition, we may also use a portion of our net proceeds to acquire and invest
in complementary products, technologies, services or businesses; however, we
currently have no agreements or commitments to complete any such transaction nor
are we involved in negotiations to do so.

Our expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our current
intentions based upon our plans and business condition. As of the date of this
prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses for the
net proceeds to be received upon the completion of this offering or the amounts
that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. The amounts and timing
of our actual use of the net proceeds will vary depending on numerous factors.
As a result, management will have broad discretion in its application of the
net proceeds, and investors will be relying on our judgment in such application.

Pending use of the net proceeds from this offering, we may invest in short- and
intermediate-term interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade instruments,
certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the U.S.
government.

Although it is difficult to predict future liquidity requirements, we believe
that the net proceeds from this offering, together with our existing cash and
cash equivalents, will be sufficient to fund our operations into 2019. This
estimate assumes that we will enter into definitive documentation for the $58.0
million Proposed New Credit Facility to replace our existing credit facilities
and increase our borrowing availability. We entered into a commitment letter for
the Proposed New Credit Facility in May 2015. The closing and funding of the
Proposed New Credit Facility is conditioned upon, among other things, our
completion of an initial public offering raising at least $85 million of net
proceeds, however this offering is not conditioned on the availability of the
Proposed New Credit Facility. We cannot be certain that we will enter into the
Proposed New Credit Facility or that the terms and conditions described herein
will be the final terms and conditions if we enter into the Proposed New
Credit Facility. If we fail to finalize and execute definitive documentation for
the Proposed New Credit Facility, our liquidity may be adversely impacted and we
expect that our cash after the completion of this offering and borrowing
availability will only be sufficient to fund our operations until the middle of
2017.

In the event the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional
shares of our common stock in the offering, we will not receive any of the
proceeds from any shares of common stock sold by the selling stockholders.


We believe the market for endoscopy products and services is fragmented and
underserved by our competitors. As such, we believe that we are in a unique
position as the only company exclusively focused on servicing the entire GI
procedure cycle through our broad and innovative product platform. Many of our
competitors are either large, multinational companies for which GI represents
only a portion of a larger business, or niche players focused on a small portion
of the market. Accordingly, our competitors are generally varied as to product
and service lines, as categorized below.

Imaging systems. In the imaging market, our significant competitors include
flexible endoscope manufacturers, such as Olympus, Fujifilm and Pentax, which
together represent a significant portion of the GI endoscopy market. In
particular, each of these significant competitors have products that directly
compete with our Fuse® system, including EVIS EXERA III from Olympus, EXPX-2500
from Fujifilm and Pentax’s RetroView Colonoscope. There is also the potential
for new entrants to the market, particularly those based in China, as
manufacturing capabilities grow.

Therapeutic devices. In the device market, our significant competitors include
Boston Scientific, Cook Medical, Olympus, Medivators/Cantel, and Steris/US
Endoscopy, all of which sell GI endoscopy devices. At any time, these and other
potential market entrants may develop new devices or treatment alternatives that
may compete directly with our GI products.

Infection control products. In the infection control market, our significant
competitors include Medivators/Cantel, Ruhof, Medline, Cardinal Health and
Steris/US Endoscopy, all of which sell infection control products that directly
compete with our product offerings, including procedure kits, personal
protection products, enzymatics and high-level disinfectants.

Diagnostics. The diagnostics market, including pathology services, is highly
fragmented. Our primary competitors include GI groups with in-office pathology
labs, independent pathology labs, hospital-based pathology labs and large
diagnostic companies, including LabCorp and Quest Diagnostics.

Even with our broad platform of products and services, our ability to compete
effectively will depend on the acceptance and use of our products by GI
specialists.

In addition, in the future we may compete with alternative GI disease screening
methods, including the non-invasive testing methods described below.

Stool tests. Some western European countries have introduced a preliminary step
before colonoscopy into their prescribed screening programs. In these countries
the patient is first asked to perform an “at home” stool test referred to as
either a fecal occult blood test, or FOBT, or fecal immunochemical test, or FIT.
A physician interprets the results and, if positive, the patient is instructed
to proceed to a colonoscopy. In the United States, FOBT and FIT are sometimes
used as adjuncts to colonoscopy, but insurance companies generally do not
require their use prior to screening colonoscopy. FDA recently approved a
non-invasive, DNA-based stool test for use in the United States as an
alternative option to screen for colorectal cancer. The newly approved product
detects hemoglobin, a protein molecule that is a component of blood as well as
certain mutations associated with colorectal cancer, in the DNA of cells shed by
advanced adenomas as stool moves through the large intestine and rectum. If a
polyp or colon cancer is detected through a stool test, the patient is
instructed to proceed to a colonoscopy procedure.

Pill camera. Other competitors have introduced pill camera technologies as
another alternative method of screening the GI tract for polyps. In this
screening method, the patient swallows a pill that houses a battery, light and
lenses, which travels through the GI tract while wirelessly transmitting images
to a specialist. The patient must limit physical activity during the approximate
10 hours that it takes the pill to travel through the GI tract. If any colon
abnormalities are detected through pill camera screening, the patient is
instructed to proceed to a colonoscopy procedure.

Radiology scans. Another alternative procedure to screen for pre-cancerous
polyps is use of scans, including computed tomography, or CT, or magnetic
resonance imaging, or MRI, scans. In both cases, a specialist takes a scan of
the patient’s GI tract and analyzes the results for the presence of any colon
abnormalities. If any colon abnormalities are detected, the patient is
instructed to proceed to a colonoscopy procedure.

We do not believe that these alternative methods will replace endoscopy as the
primary screening method for GI disease. Yet, if they are adopted by a greater
number of specialists and physicians, our business may be negatively impacted.
While the advent of these types of non-invasive tests is potentially
competitive, we also believe that these types of tests could drive further
awareness of GI diseases and possibly lead to an increase in colonoscopies as
the National Colorectal Cancer Roundtable seeks to achieve its goal of
increasing colorectal cancer screening rates from approximately 60% to 80% by
2018.


Company Description
We are a medical device company focused exclusively on designing and
commercializing a platform of innovative products for gastrointestinal, or GI,
caregivers. We currently serve over 2,500 GI departments that perform endoscopic
procedures, which represent approximately one-third of the U.S.


 market. We offer
a comprehensive range of products and services that span single-use devices and
infection control products, pathology and imaging systems. In December 2013, we
began limited commercialization of our Fuse® full spectrum endoscopy system, or
Fuse®. Our Fuse® system enables GI specialists to see more than twice the
anatomy at any one time compared to standard, forward-viewing colonoscopes and
has been clinically demonstrated to detect 69% more pre-cancerous polyps than
standard colonoscopes. We believe our commitment to continuing innovation and
focus on GI specialists provides us with the unique capability to meet their
evolving needs. We intend to leverage our broad product platform, established
customer relationships, commercial infrastructure and Fuse® technology to set a
new standard of care for the global GI market.

We estimate that the addressable worldwide market for our GI endoscopy products
and services is over $6 billion, with more than 70 million GI endoscopies
performed each year in the United States, Japan and Europe combined. We estimate
that the addressable market for our GI endoscopy products and services is
growing at 7% annually driven by increased governmental and payor focus on
screening, prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer and other GI
conditions, an aging global population and changing dietary habits. GI
endoscopies involve inserting a thin tube containing a camera or cameras into a
natural orifice of the patient to examine the upper or lower GI tract in order
to screen for, diagnose and treat various GI conditions, including colorectal
cancer. GI endoscopies require a large number of steps, including setup,
imaging, therapy, specimen retrieval, pathology and endoscope disinfection and
repair, which we refer to collectively as the GI procedure cycle. The GI
endoscopy market is highly fragmented and served by numerous companies, many of
which focus on only one or two areas of the GI procedure cycle. We believe the
needs of GI specialists are currently underserved due to the lack of a
comprehensive provider solely focused on innovation in the GI endoscopy market.

We founded our company to serve the evolving needs of GI specialists by
continually bringing to market a broad suite of innovative products across the
GI procedure cycle. Since we began our commercial operations in 2008, we have
developed an extensive line of devices and infection control products and have
added pathology and scope repair services capabilities. Our products and
services are designed to improve clinical outcomes and GI specialist
productivity. For example, our CinchPad® product improved the transport process
of endoscopes after use and eliminated the need to clean contaminated transport
trays. In 2013, we acquired Peer Medical Ltd., which was developing a new
endoscope system that we now call Fuse®. Our focus on product innovation and
services that span the GI endoscopy procedure cycle has enabled our direct
salesforce to penetrate approximately one-third of the GI departments in the
United States in just six years while increasing our sales per customer over
that time.

Our products are used in colonoscopy and esophagogastroduodenoscopy, or EGD, and
other procedures of the upper GI tract, which represent approximately 15 million
and 8 million annual procedures in the United States, respectively, and together
account for 96% of all GI endoscopic procedures. Colonoscopy is used for the
screening, surveillance and diagnosis of GI diseases including colorectal
cancer, inflammatory bowel disease and GI bleeding. Colorectal cancer is one of
the most common forms of cancer, and is the second leading cause of cancer
related deaths in the United States with approximately 130,000 new patients
diagnosed and over 50,000 deaths in the United States each year. However,
colorectal cancer is considered one of the most preventable cancers, as
pre-cancerous polyps typically take approximately 10 years to progress into
cancer. Colonoscopy enables pre-cancerous polyps to be identified and removed
early in their progression. As a result, colonoscopy is considered the gold
standard in colorectal cancer screening and has well-established reimbursement
in most developed countries. Furthermore, the National Colorectal Cancer
Roundtable has set a goal to increase colorectal cancer screening rates for
specified demographics from approximately 60% currently to 80% by 2018. Although
colonoscopy is the most accurate and comprehensive method for colorectal cancer
screening, multiple clinical studies have found that GI specialists using
standard, forward-viewing endoscopes fail to identify up to 41% of pre-cancerous
polyps.

Our Fuse® system, which is intended for visualization of the GI tract and
related therapeutic interventions, enables a wider field of view for upper and
lower endoscopy procedures. Specifically, the Fuse® colonoscope offers a 330°
view of the colon during colonoscopy instead of the 140° to 170° view offered by
standard colonoscopes. This enables the GI specialist to visualize more than
twice the anatomy at any one time as compared to a standard colonoscope and
improves the ability to more thoroughly examine the colon without prolonging the
time to complete the colonoscopy. According to the results of a company
sponsored and funded tandem clinical trial published in The Lancet Oncology, GI
specialists using Fuse® during colonoscopy identified 69% more pre-cancerous
polyps than when using standard endoscopes. The improved detection is clinically
important not only because the pre-cancerous polyp is removed during the
procedure, but also because clinical guidelines recommend more frequent
colonoscopies following initial detection of pre-cancerous polyps. Further, we
believe that increased adoption of Fuse® for colorectal cancer screening could
result in significant savings to healthcare payors given the high cost of
colorectal cancer related surgical intervention and subsequent treatment. The
costs of surgeries and related care can be significant, with total costs to the
U.S. healthcare system estimated to exceed $8 billion per year.

Since the company’s founding in 2008, we have grown our number of GI department
customers in the United States from nearly 500 in 2009 to over 2,500 today. In
addition to our direct salesforces in the United States and Germany, our
products are sold by distributors in 25 countries. Our revenues have increased
at a compound annual growth rate of 90% since 2008, with net revenues in fiscal
years 2012, 2013 and 2014 of $34.2 million, $50.9 million and $61.4 million,
respectively, and net revenues during the three months ended March 31, 2014 and
2015 of $13.8 million and $16.7 million, respectively. Our net losses in fiscal
years 2012, 2013 and 2014 were $(1.2) million, $(23.9) million and
$(53.6) million, respectively, and our net losses during the three months ended
March 31, 2014 and 2015 were $(10.9) million and $(15.3) million, respectively.
Our accumulated deficit as of March 31, 2015 was $(112.4) million. We are
headquartered in Alpharetta, Georgia and maintain manufacturing and development
centers in Halstenbek, Germany and Caesarea, Israel.
