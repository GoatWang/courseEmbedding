Company Description


Cross River Management manages a long/short domestic private equity hedge fund. The fund's primary objective is to achieve superior long-term absolute returns through investments in micro-cap companies that are undervalued in relation to their cash flows or asset value. Cross River Management tends to invest in the stocks of US small-cap companies in the transportation, finance and consumer services sectors. The firm is known to engage in shareholder activist investment strategies.In managing the fund, Cross River Management employs rigorous, bottom-up research to identify investment opportunities. Positions are initiated with a long-term investment horizon following extensive analysis of company fundamentals, capital structure, industry trends and managements' expertise. The funds main risk control is the concentrated nature of its long portfolio, which is invested only in Cross River Management's best ideas. Each investment is carefully screened for downside exposure along with upside potential. The small size of the companies in the fund's long portfolio often result in little or negative market correlation. To further mitigate risk and to hedge specific factors in long positions, the fund holds a diversified short portfolio that includes both stocks and options. The fund's key performance metrics are annualized returns and realized gain by position.
