Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
 To the Partners and Board of Directors of  SEI Structured Credit Fund, L.P.  We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and
liabilities of SEI Structured Credit Fund, L.P. (the Fund), including the schedule of investments, as of December 31, 2011, and the related statements of operations and cash flows for the year then ended and the statements of
changes in limited partners capital for each of the two years in the period then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Funds management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements
based on our audits.  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Funds internal control
over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Funds internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation of securities owned as of December 31, 2011, by
correspondence with the custodian and management of the underlying investment fund. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of SEI Structured Credit Fund, L.P. at December 31, 2011, the results of
its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended and the changes in its limited partners capital for each of the two years in the period then ended, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

SEI Structured Credit Fund, L.P. 
Notes to Financial Statements 
December 31, 2011 
1. Organization 
SEI Structured Credit Fund, LP (the Fund) is a Delaware limited partnership established on June 26, 2007 and commenced
operations on August 1, 2007. The Fund is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act) as a closed-end, non-diversified, management investment company. The Fund offers limited partnership interests
(Interests) solely through private placement transactions to investors (Limited Partners) that have signed an investment management agreement with SEI Investments Management Corporation (SIMC or the
Adviser), the investment adviser to the Fund. As of December 31, 2011, the SEI Structured Credit Segregated Portfolio owned approximately 68.1% of the Fund, while the only other remaining Limited Partner owned approximately 31.9% of
the Fund.  The Funds objective is to seek to generate high total returns. There can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve its
objective. The Fund pursues its investment objective by investing in a portfolio comprised of collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and other structured credit investments. CDOs involve special purpose investment vehicles formed to
acquire and manage a pool of loans, bonds and/or other fixed income assets of various types. CDOs fund their investments by issuing several classes of securities, the repayment of which is linked to the performance of the underlying assets, which
serve as collateral for certain securities issued by the CDO. In addition to CDOs, the Funds investments may include fixed income securities, loan participations, credit-linked notes, medium-term notes, registered and unregistered investment
companies or pooled investment vehicles, and derivative instruments, such as credit default swaps and total return swaps (collectively with CDOs, Structured Credit Investments).  SEI Investment Strategies, LLC (the General Partner), a Delaware limited liability company, serves as the General Partner to the Fund and has no investment in the Fund as of December 31,
2011. The General Partner has delegated the management and control of the business and affairs of the Fund to the Board of Directors (the Board). A majority of the Board is and will be persons who are not interested persons
(as defined in the 1940 Act) with respect to the Fund. 
2. Significant Accounting Policies 
The following is a summary of significant accounting and reporting policies followed by the Fund in preparing the financial statements:

  11 


Table of Contents
SEI Structured Credit Fund, L.P. 
Notes to Financial Statements (continued)  December 31, 2011   
2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 
 
Use of Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts
reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Management believes that the estimates utilized in preparing the Funds financial statements are reasonable and prudent; however, actual results could differ from these estimates and
it is reasonably possible that differences could be material.  Valuation of Investments 
CDOs and other Structured Credit Investments are priced based upon valuations provided by independent, third party pricing agents using their proprietary
valuation methodology. The third-party pricing agents may value Structured Credit Investments at an evaluated bid price by employing methodologies that utilize actual market transactions, broker-supplied valuations, or other methodologies designed
to identify the market value for such securities. Such methodologies generally consider such factors as security prices, yields, maturities, call features, ratings and developments relating to specific securities in arriving at valuations.
 If a price for a CDO or other Structured Credit Investment cannot be obtained from an independent, third-party pricing agent, the Fund shall
seek to obtain a bid price from at least one dealer, who is independent of the Fund. In such cases, the independent dealer providing the price on the CDO or Structured Credit Investment may also be a market maker, and in many cases the only market
maker, with respect to that security. As of December 31, 2011, all asset-backed securities are valued by an independent dealer who is also a market maker.  A dealers valuation reflects its judgment of the price of an asset, assuming an arms length transaction at the valuation date between knowledgeable, willing market participants and sufficient
time in advance of the valuation date to market the instrument. It generally assumes a round lot institutional transaction, without consideration for whether the client is long or short the instrument, and without adjustment for the size of the
clients position. The valuation pertains to an assumed transaction, does not necessarily reflect actual quoted or other prices, and does not indicate that an active market exists for the financial instrument.

SEI Structured Credit Fund, L.P. 
Notes to Financial Statements (continued)  December 31, 2011   
2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 
 
Valuation of Investments (continued) 
A dealers valuation may be formulated using inputs such as a combination of observable market transactions of the exact security or a similar
security and internal models. Bids-Wanted-In Competition, or BWICs, are widely distributed auctions of securities whose results are the primary input used by dealers to establish valuations for structured credit securities. Dealers supplement BWIC
results with private transactions and model-driven valuations. Model-driven valuations require assumptions regarding default, recovery, and prepayment rates that are consistent with current market conditions. 
In situations where market inputs are not available or do not provide a sufficient basis under current market conditions for pricing the instrument, the
valuation may reflect the dealers view of the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the instrument. Since market participants may have materially different views as to future supply, demand, credit quality and other factors
relevant to pricing financial instruments, as well as bid and ask prices, valuations may differ materially among dealers. The actual level at which these instruments trade (if trades occur) could be materially different from the dealers
valuation.  Debt obligations with remaining maturities of sixty days or less may be valued at their amortized cost, which approximates fair
value. Investments in open-ended investment companies are valued based on reported NAV of the investment company.  Securities for which market
prices are not readily available or may be unreliable are valued in accordance with Fair Value Procedures established by the Board. The Funds Fair Value Procedures are implemented through a Fair Value Committee (the
Committee) designated by the Board. When a security is valued in accordance with the Fair Value Procedures, the Committee will determine the value after taking into consideration relevant information reasonably available to the
Committee.  Examples of factors the Committee may consider are: the last trade price, the performance of the market or of the issuers
industry, the liquidity of the security, the size of the holding in the Fund, or any other appropriate information. The determination of a securitys fair value price often involves the consideration of a number of subjective factors, and is
therefore subject to the unavoidable risk that the value assigned to a security may be higher or lower than the securitys value would be if a reliable market quotation for the security was readily available. At December 31, 2011, there
were no securities that were fair valued by the Committee.

Notes to Financial Statements (continued)  December 31, 2011   
2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 
 
Valuation of Investments (concluded) 
Certain Structured Credit Investments may be structured as private investment partnerships. Traditionally, a trading market for holdings of this type does
not exist. The fair value of the Funds Interest in such a private investment fund will represent the amount that the Fund could reasonably expect to receive from the private investment fund if the Funds Interest were sold at the time of
valuation, determined based on information reasonably available at the time the valuation is made and that the Fund believes to be reliable. Unless determined otherwise in accordance with the Funds Fair Value Procedures, the fair value of the
Funds Interest in a private investment fund will usually be the value attributed to such interest, as of that time of valuation, as reported to the Fund by the private investment funds manager, administrator, or other designed agent. As
a practical matter, the Adviser and the Board have little or no means of independently verifying the valuations provided by such private investment funds. In the unlikely event that a private investment fund does not report a value to the Fund on a
timely basis and such fund is not priced by independent pricing agents of the Fund, the Fund Committee would determine the fair value of the private investment fund based on the most recent value reported by the private investment fund, as
well as any other relevant information available at the time the Fund values its portfolio. As of December 31, 2011, there were no securities fair valued in accordance with the Funds Fair Value Procedures. 
The Board will periodically review the Funds valuation policies and will update them as necessary to reflect changes in the types of securities in
which the Fund invests.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments  In accordance with the authoritative guidance on fair value measurements and disclosure under GAAP, the Fund discloses the fair value of its investments in a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to
valuation techniques used to measure the fair value. The objective of a fair value measurement is to determine the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at
the measurement date (an exit price).

Notes to Financial Statements (continued)  December 31, 2011

Fair Value of Financial Instruments (continued) 
Accordingly, the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
(Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:  Level 1
 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities that the Fund has the ability to access at the measurement date;  Level 2  Observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data, which includes financial instruments that are valued using models or other valuation
methodologies. These models are primarily industry standard models that consider various assumptions, including time value, yield curve, volatility factors, prepayment speeds, default rates, loss severity, current market and contractual prices for
the underlying financial instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures. Substantially all of these assumptions are observable in the marketplace, can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which
transactions are executed in the marketplace;  Level 3  Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data (supported by
little or no market activity), which is comprised of financial instruments whose fair value is estimated based on internally developed models or methodologies utilizing significant inputs that are generally less readily observable. 
Investments are classified within the level of the lowest significant input considered in determining fair value. Investments classified within Level 3
whose fair value measurement considers several inputs may include Level 1 or Level 2 inputs as components of the overall fair value measurement.  For the year ended December 31, 2011, there have been no significant changes to the Funds fair valuation methodologies.

Income Recognition and Security Transactions 
Security transactions are recorded on the trade date for financial reporting purposes. Costs used in determining net realized capital gains and losses on
the sale of securities are on the basis of specific identification. Dividend income is recognized on the ex-dividend date, and interest income is recognized using the accrual basis of accounting except for certain heavily subordinated collateralized
loan obligations (CLOs) for which the Fund cannot reasonably estimate performance. Amortization and accretion is calculated using the scientific interest method, which approximates the effective interest method over the estimated life of
the security. Amortization of premiums and discounts are included in interest income.  Collateralized Debt Obligations
 The Fund invests in CDOs which include CLOs and other similarly structured securities. CLOs are a type of asset-backed security. A CLO is a
trust typically collateralized by a pool of loans, which may include, among others, domestic and foreign senior secured loans, senior unsecured loans, and subordinate corporate loans, including loans that may be rated below investment grade or
equivalent unrated loans. CDOs may charge management fees and administrative expenses. For CDOs, the cashflows from the trust are split into two or more portions, called tranches, varying in risk and yield. The riskiest portion is the
equity tranche which bears the bulk of defaults from the bonds or loans in the trust and serves to protect the other, more senior tranches from default in all but the most severe circumstances. Since it is partially protected from
defaults, a senior tranche from a CDO trust typically has a higher rating and lower yield than their underlying securities, and can be rated investment grade. Despite the protection from the equity tranche, CDO tranches can experience substantial
losses due to actual defaults, increased sensitivity to defaults due to collateral default and disappearance of protecting tranches, market anticipation of defaults, as well as aversion to CDO securities as a class. 
The risks of an investment in a CDO depend largely on the type of the collateral securities and the class of the CDO in which the Fund invests. Normally,
CLOs and other CDOs are privately offered and sold, and thus, are not registered under the securities laws. As a result, investments in CDOs may be characterized by the Fund as illiquid securities; however, an active dealer market may exist for
CDOs, allowing a CDO to qualify for Rule 144A transactions.

2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 
 
Collateralized Debt Obligations (continued) 
In addition to the normal risks associated with fixed income securities (e.g., interest rate risk and default risk), CDOs carry additional risks
including, but not limited to: (i) the possibility that distributions from collateral securities will not be adequate to make interest or other payments; (ii) the quality of the collateral may decline in value or default; (iii) the
Fund may invest in CDOs that are subordinate to other classes; and (iv) the complex structure of the security may not be fully understood at the time of investment and may produce disputes with the issuer or unexpected investment results.
 Federal Taxes  The
Fund intends to be treated as a partnership for federal, state, and local income tax purposes. The Limited Partners are responsible for the tax liability or benefit relating to its distributive share of taxable income or loss. Accordingly, no
provision for federal, state, or local income taxes is reflected in the accompanying financial statements.  For the period ended
December 31, 2011, in accordance with the accounting guidance provided in the AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide, Audits of Investment Companies, the Fund reclassified $25,393,121 and $25,779,543 from accumulated net investment income
and accumulated net realized gain, respectively, to net Limited Partners capital. The reclassification was to reflect, as an adjustment to net Limited Partners capital, the amount of taxable income that has been allocated to the Limited
Partners and has no effect on net assets.  The Fund evaluates tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing the
Funds tax returns to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not (i.e., greater than 50-percent) that each tax position will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority based on the technical merits of the position. Tax
positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. The Fund did not record any tax provisions in the current period. However, managements conclusions regarding tax
positions taken may be subject to review and adjustment at a later date based on factors including, but not limited to, examination by tax authorities (i.e., the last 3 tax year ends, as applicable), on-going analysis of and changes to tax laws,
regulations and interpretations thereof.

2. Significant Accounting Policies (concluded) 
 
Restricted Securities  As of December 31, 2011, the Fund owned private placement investments that were purchased through private offerings or acquired through initial public offerings and cannot be sold without prior
registration under the Securities Act of 1933 or pursuant to an exemption therefrom. In addition, the Fund has generally agreed to further restrictions on the disposition of certain holdings as set forth in various agreements entered into in
connection with the purchase of these investments. These investments are valued at fair value as determined in accordance with the procedures approved by the Board. For the acquisition dates, cost and fair value of these investments, along with
their liquidity terms at December 31, 2011, see the Schedule of Investments.  Cash and Cash Equivalents 
The Fund treats all highly liquid financial instruments that mature within three months of acquisition as cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are valued at
cost plus accrued interest, which approximates fair value. At December 31, 2011, the Fund did not hold any cash and held $12,696,413 in an affiliated money market fund which is classified as part of the Funds investment portfolio in the
Schedule of Investments. 
3. Adviser, Administrator and Other Transactions 
The Adviser does not charge a management fee to the Fund. Limited Partners are responsible for paying the fees of the Adviser directly
under their individual investment management agreement with the Adviser. Each agreement sets forth the fees to be paid to the Adviser, which are ordinarily expressed as a percentage of the Limited Partners assets managed by the Adviser. This
fee, which is negotiated between the Limited Partner and the Adviser, may include a performance-based fee and/or a fixed-dollar fee for certain specified services.  The Adviser has voluntarily agreed that certain expenses of the Fund, including custody fees and administrative fees, calculated monthly, shall not in the aggregate exceed 0.50% per annum of the
Funds monthly average net asset value, and the Adviser or its affiliates will waive Fund fees or reimburse Fund expenses to the extent necessary so that such 0.50% limit is not exceeded. The following expenses of the Fund are specifically
excluded from the expense limit: organizational expenses; extraordinary, non-recurring and certain other unusual expenses; taxes and fees; and expenses incurred indirectly by the Fund through its investments in Structured Credit Investments. The
Adviser may discontinue all or part of this waiver at any time.

Notes to Financial Statements (continued)  December 31, 2011   
3. Adviser, Administrator and Other Transactions (continued) 
 
SEI Global Services, Inc. (the Administrator), serves as the Funds administrator. The
Administrator is a wholly-owned subsidiary of SEI Investments Company. The Administrator provides certain administrative, accounting, and transfer agency services to the Fund. The services performed by the Administrator may be completed by one or
more of its affiliated companies. The Fund pays the Administrator a fee equal to 0.10% (on an annualized basis) of the Funds Net Asset Value which is accrued monthly based on month-end net assets and is paid monthly, and reimburses the
Administrator for certain out-of-pocket expenses.  SEI Investments Distribution Co. (the Placement Agent) serves as the
Funds placement agent pursuant to an agreement with the Fund. The Placement Agent is a wholly owned subsidiary of SEI Investments Company. The Placement Agent is not compensated by the Fund for its services rendered under the agreement.

4. Allocation of Profits and Losses 
The Fund maintains a separate capital account for each of its Limited Partners. As of the last day of each month, the Fund shall
allocate net profits or losses for that month to the capital accounts of all Limited Partners, in proportion to their respective opening capital account balances for such month (after taking into account any capital contributions deemed to be made
as of the first day of such month). 
5. Partners Capital 
The Fund, in the discretion of the Board, may sell interests to new Limited Partners and may allow existing Limited Partners to
purchase additional Interests in the Fund on such days as are determined by the Board in its sole discretion. It is the Funds intention to allow limited purchases of Interests only during designated subscription periods as may be established
by the Board or its designees (currently, the Adviser) and communicated to Limited Partners. The Board or its designee will determine the amount of Interests offered to Limited Partners during a subscription period at its discretion. During the
established subscription periods, Interests may be purchased on a business day, or at such other times as the Board may determine, at the offering price (which is net asset value). The Fund may discontinue its offering at any time. 
The Fund is a closed-end investment company, and therefore no Limited Partner will have the right to require the Fund to redeem its Interests. The Fund
from time to time may offer to repurchase outstanding Interests pursuant to written tenders by Limited 
  19 


Table of Contents
SEI Structured Credit Fund, L.P. 
Notes to Financial Statements (continued)  December 31, 2011   
5. Partners Capital (continued)   
Partners. Repurchase offers will be made at such times and on such terms as may be determined by the
Board in its sole discretion. In determining whether the Fund should repurchase Interests from Limited Partners pursuant to written tenders, the Board will consider the recommendations of the Adviser. 
The Adviser expects that it will recommend to the Board that the Fund offer to repurchase Interests four times each year, as of the last business day of
March, June, September, and December. However, Limited Partners will not be permitted to tender for repurchase Interests that were acquired less than two years prior to the effective date of the proposed repurchase. 
Even after the initial two year period, it is possible that there will be extended periods during which illiquidity in the underlying investments held by
the Fund or other factors will cause the Board to elect not to conduct repurchase offers. Such periods may coincide with periods of negative performance. In addition, even in the event of a repurchase offer, it is possible that there will be an
oversubscription to the repurchase offer, in which case an Investor may not be able to redeem the full amount that the Investor wishes to redeem.  During the year ended December 31, 2011, the Fund offered to repurchase Interests resulting in capital withdrawals of $27,336,751. 
6. Investment Transactions 
The cost of security purchases and proceeds from the sale and maturity of securities, other than temporary cash investments, during the
year ended December 31, 2011 were $313,723,370 and $267,056,093, respectively.  As of December 31, 2011, the estimated cost of
investments for tax purposes is $375,533,659 Net unrealized appreciation on investments for tax purposes was $30,835,056 consisting of $41,714,612 of gross unrealized appreciation and $10,879,556 of gross unrealized depreciation. 
7. Concentrations of Risk 
In the normal course of business, the Fund may trade various financial instruments and may enter into various investment activities
with off-balance sheet risk. The Funds satisfaction of the obligations may exceed the amount recognized in the statement of assets and liabilities. 
  20 


Table of Contents
SEI Structured Credit Fund, L.P. 
Notes to Financial Statements (continued)  December 31, 2011   
7. Concentrations of Risk (continued)   
(a) Market risk  Market risk encompasses the potential for both losses and gains and includes price risk, interest rate risk, prepayment risk and collateral performance risk. The Funds market risk management
strategy is driven by the Funds investment objective. The Adviser oversees each of the risks in accordance with policies and procedures. 
(i) Price risk  Price risk is the risk the
value of the instrument will fluctuate as a result of changes in market prices, whether caused by factors specific to an individual investment, its issuer or any factor affecting financial instruments traded in the market. As all of the Funds
financial instruments are carried at fair value with fair value changes recognized in the Statement of Operations, all changes in market conditions directly affect net assets.  (ii) Interest rate risk  The fair value of the Funds investments will change in response to
interest rate changes and other factors. During periods of falling interest rates, the values of fixed income securities generally rise. Conversely, during periods of rising interest rates, the values of such securities generally decline. Changes by
recognized rating agencies in the ratings of any fixed income security and in the ability of an issuer to make payments of interest and principal may also affect the value of these investments. 
(iii) Prepayment risk  Prepayment risk is the
risk associated with the early unscheduled return of principal on a fixed-income security. Some fixed-income securities, such as CDOs, have embedded call options which may be exercised by the issuer, or in the case of a CDO, the borrower. The
yield-to-maturity of such securities cannot be known for certain at the time of purchase since the cash flows are not known. When principal is returned early, future interest payments will not be paid on that part of the principal. If the security
was purchased at a premium (a price greater than 100) the securitys yield will be less than what was estimated at the time of purchase. 
(iv) Collateral performance risk  Collateral
performance risk is the risk that defaults or underperformance of the CDOs underlying collateral negatively impacts scheduled payments to a tranche based on relative seniority in the overall capital structure of each deal.

7. Concentrations of Risk (continued)   
(b) Counterparty credit risk  Counterparty credit risk is the risk a counterparty to a financial instrument could fail on a commitment that it has entered into with the Fund. The Fund minimizes counterparty credit risk by undertaking
transactions with large well-capitalized counterparties or brokers and by monitoring the creditworthiness of these counterparties. 
8. Indemnifications 
The Fund enters into contracts that contain a variety of indemnifications. The Funds maximum exposure under these arrangements is
unknown. However, since inception the Fund has not had claims or losses pursuant to these contracts and expects the risk of loss to be remote.

10. Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update 2011-04 Amendments to Achieve Common
Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs (ASU 2011-04). ASU 2011-04 includes common requirements for measurement of and disclosure about fair value between U.S. GAAP and International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS). ASU 2011-04 will require reporting entities to disclose quantitative information about the unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurements categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. In
addition, ASU 2011-04 will require reporting entities to make disclosures about amounts and reasons for all transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements. The new and revised disclosures are effective for interim and annual
reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2011. At this time, management is evaluating the implications of ASU 2011-04 and its impact on the financial statements has not been determined. 
11. Subsequent Events 
The Fund has evaluated the need for additional disclosures and/or adjustments resulting from subsequent events through the date the
financial statements were issued. Based on this evaluation, no disclosures and/or adjustments were required to the financial statements.

SEI Structured Credit Fund, L.P. 
Approval of the Advisory Agreements with the Adviser (Unaudited) 
SEI Structured Credit Fund, L.P. (the Fund) has entered into an investment advisory agreement with SEI Investments Management Corporation
(SIMC or the Adviser) dated July 20, 2007 (the Advisory Agreement). Pursuant to the Advisory Agreement, SIMC is responsible for the day-to-day investment management of the Funds assets. 
The Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act), requires that the initial approval of, as well as the continuation of, the
Funds Advisory Agreement must be specifically approved by: (i) the vote of the Board of Directors of the Fund (the Board) or by a vote of the shareholders of the Fund; and (ii) the vote of a majority of the directors who
are not parties to the Advisory Agreement or interested persons (as defined under the 1940 Act) of any party to the Advisory Agreement (the Independent Directors), cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting
on such approval. In connection with their consideration of such approvals, the Board must request and evaluate, and SIMC is required to furnish, such information as may be reasonably necessary to evaluate the terms of the Advisory Agreement. In
addition, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) takes the position that, as part of their fiduciary duties with respect to a funds fees, fund boards are required to evaluate the material factors applicable to a decision to
approve an advisory agreement.  The discussion immediately below summarizes the materials and information presented to the Board in connection
with the Boards Annual Review of the Advisory Agreement and the conclusions made by the Directors when determining to continue the Advisory Agreement for an additional one-year period.  Consistent with the responsibilities referenced above, the Board called and held a meeting on March 22, 2011 to consider whether to renew the Advisory Agreement. In preparation for the meeting, the
Board provided SIMC with a written request for information and received and reviewed extensive written materials in response to that request, including information as to the performance of the Fund versus benchmarks, the levels of fees for various
categories of services provided by SIMC and its affiliates and the overall expense ratio of the Fund, comparisons of such fees and expenses with such fees and expenses incurred by other funds, the costs to SIMC and its affiliates of providing such
services, including a profitability analysis, SIMCs compliance program, and various other matters. The information provided in connection with the Board meeting was in addition to the detailed information about the Fund that the Board reviews
during the course of each year, including information that relates to the operations and performance of the Fund.

SEI Structured Credit Fund, L.P. 
Approval of the Advisory Agreements with the Adviser (Unaudited)  (continued)   
The Directors also received a memorandum from Fund counsel regarding the responsibilities of directors
in connection with their consideration of an investment advisory agreement. In addition, prior to voting, the Independent Directors received advice from Fund counsel regarding the contents of the Advisers written materials. 
As noted above, the Board requested and received written materials from SIMC. Specifically, this requested information and written response included:
(a) the quality of SIMCs investment management and other services; (b) SIMCs investment management personnel; (c) SIMCs operations and financial condition; (d) SIMCs investment strategies; (e) the
level of the advisory fees that SIMC charges the Fund compared with the advisory fees charged to comparable funds; (f) the overall fees and operating expenses of the Fund compared with similar funds; (g) the level of SIMCs
profitability from its Fund-related operations; (h) SIMCs compliance systems; (i) SIMCs policies on and compliance procedures for personal securities transactions; (j) SIMCs reputation, expertise and resources in
domestic and/or international financial markets; and (k) the Funds performance compared with benchmark indices.  The Independent
Directors met in executive session, outside the presence of Fund management, and the full Board met in executive session to consider and evaluate a variety of factors relating to the approval of the continuation of the Advisory Agreement. The
Independent Directors also participated in question and answer sessions with representatives of the Adviser. At the conclusion of the Boards deliberations, the Board including the Independent Directors unanimously approved the continuation of
the Advisory Agreement for an additional one-year period. The approval was based on the Boards (including the Independent Directors) consideration and evaluation of a variety of specific factors discussed at the March 22, 2011 Board
meeting and other Board meetings held throughout the year, including:  -    the nature, extent and quality of the services
provided to the Fund under the Advisory Agreement, including the resources of SIMC and its affiliates dedicated to the Fund; 
-    the Funds investment performance and how it compared to that of appropriate benchmarks; 
-    the expenses of the Fund under the Advisory Agreement and how those expenses compared to those of other comparable funds;
 -    the profitability of SIMC and its affiliates with respect to the Fund, including both direct and indirect benefits
accruing to SIMC and its affiliates; and

Approval of the Advisory Agreements with the Adviser (Unaudited)  (concluded)   
-    the extent to which economies of scale would be realized as the Fund grows and
whether fee levels in the Advisory Agreement reflect those economies of scale for the benefit of Fund investors.  Nature, Extent and
Quality of Services. The Board concluded that, within the context of its full deliberations, the nature, extent and quality of services provided by SIMC to the Fund and the resources of SIMC and its affiliates dedicated to the Fund supported
renewal of the Advisory Agreement.  Fund Performance. The Board concluded that, within the context of its full deliberations,
the performance of the Fund supported renewal of the Advisory Agreement.  Fund Expenses. The Board concluded that, within the
context of its full deliberations, the expenses of the Fund are reasonable and supported renewal of the Advisory Agreement. 
Profitability. The Board concluded that, within the context of its full deliberations, the profitability of SIMC is reasonable and
supported renewal of the Advisory Agreement.  Economies of Scale. The Board concluded that, within the context of its full
deliberations, the Fund obtains reasonable benefit from economies of scale.  Based on its evaluation of the information and the conclusions
with respect thereto at its meeting on March 22, 2011, the Board, including all of the Independent Directors, unanimously approved the Advisory Agreement and concluded that the compensation under the Advisory Agreement is fair and reasonable in
light of such services and expenses and such other matters as the Independent Directors and the Board considered to be relevant in the exercise of their reasonable judgment. In the course of their deliberations, the Board, including the Independent
Directors, did not identify any one particular factor or specific piece of information that determined whether to approve the Advisory Agreement .

(2)
Other fees and services not requiring pre-approval include amounts billed in fiscal year 2011 and 2010 related to services provided in connection with internal control
reports issued pursuant to SAS No. 70.  (e)(1) The Funds Audit Committee has adopted and the Board of Directors has
ratified an Audit and Non-Audit Services Pre-Approval Policy (the Policy), which sets forth the procedures and the conditions pursuant to which services proposed to be performed by the independent auditor of the Fund may be pre-approved.
 The Policy provides that all requests or applications for proposed services to be provided by the independent auditor must be
submitted to the Registrants Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and must include a detailed description of the services proposed to be rendered. The CFO will determine whether such services: 
 


 
(1)
require specific pre-approval;   


 
(2)
are included within the list of services that have received the general pre-approval of the Audit Committee pursuant to the Policy; or 
 


 
(3)
have been previously pre-approved in connection with the independent auditors annual engagement letter for the applicable year or otherwise. In any instance where
services require pre-approval, the Audit Committee will consider whether such services are consistent with SECs rules and whether the provision of such services would impair the auditors independence. 
Requests or applications to provide services that require specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee will be submitted to the Audit
Committee by the CFO. The Audit Committee will be informed by the CFO on a quarterly basis of all services rendered by the independent auditor. The Audit Committee has delegated specific pre-approval authority to either the Audit Committee Chair or
financial expert, provided that the estimated fee for any such proposed pre-approved service does not exceed $100,000 and any pre-approval decisions are reported to the Audit Committee at its next regularly scheduled meeting. 
Services that have received the general pre-approval of the Audit Committee are identified and described in the Policy. In addition, the
Policy sets forth a maximum fee per engagement with respect to each identified service that has received general pre-approval. 
All services to be provided by the independent auditor shall be provided pursuant to a signed written engagement letter with the
Registrant, the investment advisor or applicable control affiliate (except that matters as to which an engagement letter would be impractical because of timing issues or because the matter is small may not be the subject of an engagement letter)
that sets forth both the services to be provided by the independent auditor and the total fees to be paid to the independent auditor for those services.  In addition, the Audit Committee has determined to take additional measures on an annual basis to meet its responsibility to oversee the work of the independent auditor and to assure the auditors
independence from the Registrant, such as reviewing a formal written statement from the independent auditor delineating all relationships between the independent auditor and the Registrant, and discussing with the independent auditor its methods and
procedures for ensuring independence.

During the past fiscal year, Registrants principal accountant provided certain non-audit services to the Registrants investment adviser or to entities
controlling, controlled by, or under common control with Registrants investment adviser that provide ongoing services to Registrant that were not subject to pre-approval pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X. The
audit committee of Registrants board of directors reviewed and considered these non-audit services provided by Registrants principal accountant to Registrants affiliates, including whether the provision of these non-audit services
is compatible with maintaining the principal accountants independence.

Disclosure of Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures for Closed-End Management Investment Companies. 
Proxy Voting (Rule 206(4)-6)  POLICY
STATEMENT  A public companys shareholders typically have the right to vote on various corporate issues. Clients typically delegate to
SIMC the authority to vote proxies for shares they own. Under the Advisers Act, SIMC has a duty of care and loyalty with respect to all services undertaken for clients, including proxy voting. 
Rule 206(4)-6 under the Advisers Act requires that SIMC must vote proxies in a manner consistent with clients best interest and must not place its
interests above those of its clients when doing so. It requires SIMC to: (i) adopt and implement written policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to ensure that SIMC votes proxies in the best interest of its clients, and
(ii) to disclose to the clients how they may obtain information on how SIMC voted proxies. In addition, Rule 204-2 requires SIMC to keep records of proxy voting and client requests for information. 
As a registered investment adviser, SIMC has an obligation to vote proxies with respect to securities held in its client portfolios in the best economic
interests of the clients for which it has proxy voting authority. PROCEDURES  SIMC has adopted the following procedures to implement the firms policy and to monitor compliance with the firms policy:  1. Third Party Proxy Voting ServiceSIMC has elected to retain a third party proxy voting service (the Service) to vote proxies with respect to those clients. The
Service shall vote proxies in accordance with guidelines approved by SIMCs Proxy Voting Committee (the Guidelines). The Guidelines set forth the manner in which SIMC shall vote, or the manner in which SIMC shall determine how to
vote, with respect to various matters that may come up for shareholder vote. So long as the Service votes proxies in accordance with the Guidelines, SIMC believes that there is an appropriate presumption that the manner in



Table of Contents

which SIMC voted was not influenced by, and did not result from, a conflict of interest. SIMC Compliance shall conduct periodic reviews of the Service to ensure compliance with SIMCs proxy
voting guidelines and the appropriateness of the Service.  2. Establishment of Proxy Voting CommitteeSIMC shall establish
a Proxy Voting Committee (the Committee), comprised of representatives of SIMCs Investment Management Unit and Legal and/or Compliance personnel. Currently, the members of the Committee are as follows: 
Brad Mook  Greg
McIntire  Aimei Zhong  Noreen Procaccini  Stephanie Cavanagh
Tom Williams  The membership of
the Committee may be changed at any time upon approval of the existing members of the Committee or by the President of SIMC. The Committee shall meet as necessary to perform any of the activities set forth below. Any action requiring approval of the
Committee shall be deemed approved upon an affirmative vote by a majority of the Committee present or represented. The submission of votes electronically (i.e., via email) by the Committee members shall be considered acceptable. The Committee shall
consult with counsel or other experts as it deems appropriate to carry out its responsibilities.  3. Approval of Proxy Voting
GuidelinesThe Committee shall approve Guidelines that set forth the manner in which SIMC shall vote, or the manner in which SIMC shall determine how to vote, with respect to various matters that may come up for shareholder vote with
respect to securities held in client accounts and for which SIMC has proxy voting responsibility. In the event that any employee of SIMC recommends a change to SIMCs Guidelines, the Committee shall meet to consider the proposed change and
consider all relevant factors. If approved by the Committee, the change shall be accepted, and the Guidelines revised accordingly.  4.
Certain Proxy Votes May Not Be CastIn some cases, the Committee may determine that it is in the best interests of SIMCs clients to abstain from voting certain proxies. SIMC will abstain from voting in the event any of the
following conditions {listed below} are met with regard to a proxy proposal:   


 

 
 Neither the Proxy Voting Guidelines nor specific client instructions cover an issue; 
 


 

 
 The Service does not make a recommendation on the issue; 
 


 

 
 In circumstances where, in SIMCs judgment, the costs of voting the proxy exceed the expected benefits to clients; or
  


 

 
 The Committee cannot convene on the proxy proposal at issue to make a determination as to what would be in the clients best interest. This could
happen, for example, if the Committee found that there was a material conflict or if despite all best efforts the Committee is unable to meet the requirements necessary to make a determination. 
In addition, it is SIMCs policy not to vote proxies for accounts that engage in securities lending, SIMC believes that the additional income
derived by clients from such activities generally outweighs the potential economic benefit of recalling securities for the purpose of voting. Therefore, SIMC generally will not recall securities on loan for the sole purpose of voting proxies.
Further, in accordance with local law or business practices, many foreign companies prevent the sales of shares that have been voted for a certain period beginning prior to the shareholder meeting and ending on the day following the meeting
(share blocking). Depending on the country in which a company is domiciled, the blocking period may begin a stated number of days prior to the meeting (e.g., one, three or five days) or on a date established by the company. While
practices vary, in many countries the block period can be continued for a longer period if the shareholder meeting is adjourned and postponed to a later date. Similarly, practices vary widely as to the ability of a shareholder to have the
block restriction lifted early (e.g., in some countries shares generally can be unblocked up to two days prior to the meeting whereas in other countries the removal of the block appears to be discretionary with the
issuers transfer agent). SIMC believes that the disadvantage 


Table of Contents

of being unable to sell the stock regardless of changing conditions generally outweighs the advantages of voting at the shareholder meeting for routine items. Accordingly, SIMC generally will not
vote those proxies subject to share blocking.  5. Proxies of Investment CompaniesWith respect to proxies of an
affiliated investment company or series thereof, such as the SEI Funds, the Committee will vote such proxies in the same proportion as the vote of all other shareholders of the investment company or series thereof (i.e., echo vote
or mirror vote). When required by law, the Committee will also echo vote proxies of an unaffiliated investment company. When not required to echo vote, the Committee will delegate to the Service responsibility for
voting proxies of an unaffiliated investment company in accordance with Guidelines approved by the Committee; provided that, if such proxy presents a material conflict of interest for SIMC, such proxy shall be voted in accordance with Section 6
below.  6. Conflicts of InterestThe Service makes available to SIMC, prior to voting on a proxy, its recommendation on how
to vote with respect to such proxy in light of SIMCs Guidelines. SIMC retains the authority to overrule the Services recommendation, and instruct the Service to vote in a manner at variance with the Services recommendation. The
exercise of such right could implicate a conflict of interest. As a result, SIMC may not overrule the Services recommendation with respect to a proxy unless the following steps are taken: 
 


 
a.
The Committee shall meet to consider the proposal to overrule the Services recommendation. 
 


 
b.
The Committee must determine whether SIMC has a conflict of interest with respect to the issuer that is the subject of the proxy. The Committee will use the following
standards to identify issuers with which it may have a conflict of interest.   


 
1.
Significant Business Relationships  The Committee will determine whether SIMC or its affiliates may have a significant business relationship with the
issuer, such as, for example, where SIMC (or an affiliate) manages a pension plan, administers employee benefit plans, or provide brokerage, underwriting, insurance, or banking services to the issuer. For this purpose, a significant business
relationship is one that: (1) represents 1% or $1,000,000 of SIMCs or an affiliates revenues for the most recent fiscal year, whichever is less, or is reasonably expected to represent this amount for the current fiscal year;
or (2) may not directly involve revenue to SIMC or its affiliates but is otherwise determined by the Committee to be significant to SIMC or its affiliates, such as, for example, the following: 
 


 

 
 SIMC or its affiliates lease significant office space from the company or have some other real estate-related relationship with the issuer;
  


 

 
 SIMC or an affiliate otherwise has a significant relationship with the company such that it might create an incentive for SIMC to vote in favor of
management.   


 
2.
Significant Personal/Family Relationships  The Committee will determine whether any employees who are involved in the proxy voting process may have a
significant personal/family relationship with the issuer. For this purpose, a significant personal/family relationship is one that would be reasonably likely to influence how SIMC votes proxies. To identify any such relationships, the
Committee shall obtain information about any significant personal/family relationship between any employee of SIMC who is involved in the proxy voting process (e.g., IMU analysts, members of the Committee, senior management, as applicable) and
senior employees of issuers for which SIMC may vote proxies.   


 
3.
 Duties of the Proxy CommitteeThe Committee has a duty to make reasonable investigation of information relating to conflicts of interest.
For purposes of 


Table of Contents


 

identifying conflicts, the Committee shall rely on publicly available information about SIMC and its affiliates, information about SIMC and its affiliates that is generally known by employees of
SIMC,1 and other information actually known by a member of
the Committee. Absent actual knowledge, the Committee is not required to investigate possible conflicts involving SIMC where the information is (i) non-public, (ii) subject to information blocking procedures, or (iii) otherwise not
readily available to the Committee. In connection with the consideration of any proxy voting matters under this policy, each member of the Committee has a duty to disclose to the Committee any material conflicts of interest of which the member has
actual knowledge but which have not been identified by the Committee pursuant to these Procedures, and, if appropriate, recuse himself/herself from the matter at issue. 
 


 
c.
If SIMC determines that it has a conflict of interest, the Committee shall determine whether the conflict is material to any specific proposal included
within the proxy. If not, then SIMC can vote the proxy as determined by the Committee. The Committee shall determine whether a proposal is material as follows: 
 


 
1.
 Routine Proxy Proposals  Proxy proposals that are routine shall be presumed not to involve a material conflict of interest for
SIMC, unless the Committee has actual knowledge that a routine proposal should be treated as material. For this purpose, routine proposals would typically include matters such as the selection of an accountant, uncontested election of
directors, meeting formalities, and approval of an annual report/financial statements. 2   


 
2.
Non-Routine Proxy Proposals  Proxy proposals that are non-routine shall be presumed to involve a material conflict of interest for SIMC, unless
the Committee determines that SIMCs conflict is unrelated to the proposal in question (see 3. below). For this purpose, non-routine proposals would typically include any contested matter, including a contested election of
directors, a merger or sale of substantial assets, a change in the articles of incorporation that materially affects the rights of shareholders, and compensation matters for management (e.g., stock option plans, retirement plans, profit sharing or
other special remuneration plans).   


 
3.
Determining that a Non-Routine Proposal is Not Material  As discussed above, although non-routine proposals are presumed to involve a material conflict of
interest, the Committee may determine on a case-by-case basis that particular non-routine proposals do not involve a material conflict of interest. To make this determination, the Committee must conclude that a proposal is not directly related to
SIMCs conflict with the issuer or that it otherwise would not be considered important by a reasonable investor. The Committee shall record in writing the basis for any such determination. 
 


 
d.
For any proposal where the Committee determines that SIMC has a material conflict of interest, SIMC may vote a proxy regarding that proposal in any of the following
manners:   


 
1.
Obtain Client Consent or Direction  If the Committee approves the proposal to overrule the recommendation of the Service, SIMC shall fully disclose to each
client holding the security at issue the nature of the conflict, and obtain the clients consent   


1 
 The procedures provide that the Committee should be aware of information about SIMC or its affiliates that is generally known by employees of SIMC, but
it does not extend this knowledge to information about SIMCs affiliates that is generally known by employees of SIMCs affiliates (unless such information also is generally known by SIMCs employees). 


2 
 For guidance on defining routine and non-routine matters, SIMC shall use the standards set forth in NYSE Rule 452 and Special
Instruction 12b.viii. of Form 13F. 


Table of Contents

to how SIMC will vote on the proposal (or otherwise obtain instructions from the client as to how the proxy on the proposal should be voted). 
 


 
2.
Use Recommendation of the Service  Vote in accordance with the Services recommendation. 
 


 
e.
For any proposal where the Committee determines that SIMC does not have a material conflict of interest, the Committee may overrule the Services recommendation if
the Committee reasonably determines that doing so is in the best interests of SIMCs clients. If the Committee decides to overrule the Services recommendation, the Committee shall maintain a written record setting forth the basis of the
Committees decision.   


 
f.
This Section 6 does not apply to voting proxies of an investment company except as specifically stated in Section 5 above. 
 


Item 8.
Portfolio Managers of Closed-End Management Investment Companies  Compensation. The Adviser compensates each portfolio manager for his management of the Fund. Each portfolio managers compensation consists of a fixed annual salary, plus a

 Conflicts of Interests. Each portfolio managers management of other accounts
may give rise to potential conflicts of interest in connection with his management of the Funds investments, on the one 


Table of Contents

hand, and the investments of the other accounts, on the other. The other accounts include portions of two U.S. registered high yield mutual funds and an Irish registered high yield fund
(collectively, the Other Accounts). The Other Accounts might have similar investment objectives as the Fund or hold, purchase, or sell securities that are eligible to be held, purchased, or sold by the Fund. While the portfolio
managers management of the Other Accounts may give rise to the following potential conflicts of interest, the Adviser does not believe that the conflicts, if any, are material or, to the extent any such conflicts are material, the Adviser
believes that it has designed policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to manage those conflicts in an appropriate way. 
Knowledge of the Timing and Size of Fund Trades. A potential conflict of interest may arise as a result of the portfolio managers
day-to-day management of the Fund. Because of their position with the Fund, the portfolio managers know the size, timing, and possible market impact of Fund trades. It is theoretically possible that the portfolio managers could use this
information to the advantage of the Other Accounts and to the possible detriment of the Fund. However, the Adviser has adopted policies and procedures reasonably designed to allocate investment opportunities on a fair and equitable basis over
time.   Investment Opportunities. A potential conflict of interest may arise as a result of the portfolio
managers management of the Fund and the Other Accounts which, in theory, may allow them to allocate investment opportunities in a way that favors the Other Accounts over the Fund. This conflict of interest may be exacerbated to the extent that
the Adviser or the portfolio managers receive, or expect to receive, greater compensation from their management of the Other Accounts than the Fund. Notwithstanding this theoretical conflict of interest, it is the Advisers policy to
manage each account based on its investment objectives and related restrictions and, as discussed above, the Adviser has adopted policies and procedures reasonably designed to allocate investment opportunities on a fair and equitable basis over time
and in a manner consistent with each accounts investment objectives and related restrictions. For example, while the portfolio managers may buy for an Other Account securities that differ in identity or quantity from securities bought for the
Fund, such an approach might not be suitable for the Fund given its investment objectives and related restrictions.  The Adviser may enter
into incentive fee arrangements with one or more investors in the SEI Structured Credit Segregated Portfolio (the Offshore Feeder Fund), a segregated portfolio of SEI Offshore Advanced Strategies Series SPC, a segregated portfolio
company established in the Cayman Islands, that acts as a feeder fund for the Fund, whereby a portion of the increase in the net asset value of such investors investment in the Offshore Feeder Fund over a given period shall be payable to the
Adviser. This arrangement may create an incentive for the Adviser to make investments for the Fund that are riskier or more speculative than if the Adviser had no such interest because the Adviser will not bear an analogous portion of
depreciation in the value of the Offshore Feeder Funds assets if the value of its investment in the Fund declines. Notwithstanding this theoretical conflict of interest, it is the Advisers policy to manage each account based on its
investment objectives and related restrictions and the Adviser believes that it has designed policies and procedures that are designed to manage such conflict in an appropriate way.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm



To the Partners and Board of Directors of
SEI Structured Credit Fund, LP


We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of SEI
Structured Credit Fund, L.P. (the "Fund"), including the schedule of
investments, as of December 31, 2007, and the related statements of operations,
changes in partners' capital and cash flows for the period from August 1, 2007
(commencement of operations) to December 31, 2007. These financial statements
are the responsibility of the Fund's management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.


We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an
audit of the Partnership's internal control over financial reporting. Our audit
included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis
for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but
not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such
opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures included
confirmation of securities owned as of December 31, 2007, by correspondence with
the custodian and management of the underlying investment funds. We believe that
our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.


In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of SEI Structured Credit Fund,
L.P. at December 31, 2007, the results of its operations, the changes in its
partners' capital and its cash flows for the period from August 1, 2007
(commencement of operations) to December 31, 2007, in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles.

Notes to Financial Statements



December 31, 2007


1.   ORGANIZATION


SEI Structured  Credit Fund, LP (the "Fund") is a Delaware  limited  partnership
established  on June 26,  2007.  The Fund is  registered  under  the  Investment
Company  Act  of  1940,   as  amended   (the  "1940   Act")  as  a   closed-end,
non-diversified,   management   investment  company.  The  Fund  offers  limited
partnership interest  ("Interests") of the Fund solely through private placement
transactions  to investors  ("limited  partners") that have signed an investment
management agreement with SEI Investments  Management Corporation ("SIMC" or the
"Adviser"),  the  investment  adviser to the Fund. As of December 31, 2007,  SEI
Structured Credit Segregated Portfolio owned 100% of the Fund.


The Fund's objective is to seek to generate high total returns.  There can be no
assurance  that the Fund  will  achieve  its  objective.  The Fund  pursues  its
investment  objective by investing  in a portfolio  comprised of  collateralized
debt obligations ("CDOs") and other structured credit investments.  CDOs involve
special  purpose  investment  vehicles  formed to  acquire  and manage a pool of
loans,  bonds and/or other fixed income assets of various  types.  The CDO funds
its investments by issuing several classes of securities, the repayment of which
is linked to the performance of the underlying assets, which serve as collateral
for  certain  securities  issued by the CDO.  In  addition  to CDOs,  the Fund's
investments   may  include  fixed  income   securities,   loan   participations,
credit-linked notes, medium term notes,  registered and unregistered  investment
companies or pooled investment  vehicles,  and derivative  instruments,  such as
credit default swaps and total return swaps (collectively with CDOs, "Structured
Credit Investments").


SEI  Investment  Strategies,  LLC (the "General  Partner"),  a Delaware  limited
liability  company,  serves  as the  General  Partner  to the  Fund  and  has no
investment  in the  Fund as of  December  31,  2007.  The  General  Partner  has
delegated the  management and control of the business and affairs of the Fund to
the Board of  Directors  (the  "Board").  A majority of the Board is and will be
persons  who are not  "interested  persons"  (as  defined  in the 1940 Act) with
respect to the Fund.

2.   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)


The following is a summary of significant  accounting  policies  followed by the
Fund:



USE OF ESTIMATES



The  preparation  of financial  statements  in  conformity  with U.S.  generally
accepted  accounting  principles  requires  management  to  make  estimates  and
assumptions  that affect the amounts  reported in the financial  statements  and
accompanying notes. Management believes that the estimates utilized in preparing
the Fund's  financial  statements are reasonable  and prudent;  however,  actual
results could differ from these estimates.



VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS



CDOs and other  Structured  Credit  Investments are priced based upon valuations
provided by independent,  third-party pricing agents, if available.  Such values
generally  reflect the last  reported  sales  price if the  security is actively
traded.  The  third-party  pricing  agents  may  also  value  structured  credit
investments  at an evaluated bid price by employing  methodologies  that utilize
actual market transactions,  broker-supplied  valuations, or other methodologies
designed to identify the market value for such  securities.  Such  methodologies
generally  consider such factors as security prices,  yields,  maturities,  call
features,  ratings and developments  relating to specific securities in arriving
at valuations.


If a price for a CDO or other structured  credit  investment  cannot be obtained
from an independent,  third-party pricing agent, the Fund shall seek to obtain a
bid price from at least one  independent  broker.  In such cases, it is possible
that the independent  broker providing the price on the CDO or structured credit
investment is also a market maker, and in many cases the only market maker, with
respect to that security.


Securities listed on a securities exchange, market or automated quotation system
for which  quotations are readily  available  (except for  securities  traded on
NASDAQ)  are valued at the last  quoted  sale price on the  primary  exchange or
market  (foreign or domestic) on which they are traded,  or, if there is no such
reported  sale, at the most recent quoted bid price.  For  securities  traded on
NASDAQ,  the NASDAQ  Official  Closing Price will be used. The prices of foreign
securities  are reported in local  currency and converted to U.S.  dollars using
currency  exchange rates.  Debt obligations  with remaining  maturities of sixty
days or less may be valued at their amortized cost,  which  approximates  market
value.

2.   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)



VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS (CONTINUED)



Securities  for  which  market  prices  are not  "readily  available"  or may be
unreliable are valued in accordance  with Fair Value  Procedures  established by
the Board. The Fund's Fair Value Procedures are implemented through a Fair Value
Committee (the  "Committee")  designated by the Board. When a security is valued
in accordance with the Fair Value  Procedures,  the Committee will determine the
value after taking into consideration  relevant information reasonably available
to the Committee.  Examples of factors the Committee may consider are: the facts
giving rise to the need to fair value,  the last trade price, the performance of
the market or of the issuer's industry,  the liquidity of the security, the size
of  the  holding  in  the  Fund,  or  any  other  appropriate  information.  The
determination of a security's fair value price often involves the  consideration
of a number of subjective  factors,  and is therefore subject to the unavoidable
risk that the  value  assigned  to a  security  may be higher or lower  than the
security's  value would be if a reliable  market  quotation for the security was
readily available.


Certain  Structured Credit  Investments may be structured as private  investment
partnerships. Traditionally, a trading market for holdings of this type does not
exist.  As a general  matter,  the fair value of the Fund's  interest  in such a
private investment fund will represent the amount that the Fund could reasonable
expect to receive from the private  investment  fund if the Fund's interest were
redeemed at the time of valuation,  determined  based on information  reasonably
available  at the time the  valuation  is made and that the Fund  believes to be
reliable.  Unless determined otherwise in accordance with the Fund's procedures,
the fair value of the Fund's interest in a private  investment fund shall be the
value attributed to such interest, as of that time of valuation,  as reported to
the Fund by the  private  investment  fund's  manager,  administrator,  or other
designed agent. Such a valuation may be a preliminary  valuation and, therefore,
may be later revised or adjusted by the private investment fund. Such adjustment
or  revision  will have no affect on the Fund's net asset  value as of any prior
valuation time. As a practical matter,  the Adviser and the Board have little or
no means of  independently  verifying  the  valuations  provided by such private
investment funds. As a result,  information available to the Fund concerning the
value of such  investments  may not reflect  market prices or quotations for the
underlying assets. In the unlikely event that a private investment fund does not
report a value to the Fund on a timely  basis  and such  fund is not  priced  by
independent  pricing agents of the Fund, the Fund would determine the fair value
of the private  investment  fund based on the most recent value  reported by the
private

investment fund, as well as any other relevant information available at the time
the Fund values its portfolio.


The Board will periodically review the Fund's valuation policies and will update
them as necessary  to reflect  changes in the types of  securities  in which the
Fund invests.



FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS



The fair value of the Fund's assets and liabilities,  which qualify as financial
instruments  under  Statement  of  Financial   Accounting   Standards  No.  107,
Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial Instruments, approximates the carrying
amounts presented on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.  Management of the
Partnership deems these estimates reasonable.



INCOME RECOGNITION AND SECURITY TRANSACTIONS



Security  transactions are recorded on the trade date. Costs used in determining
net realized capital gains and losses on the sale of securities are on the basis
of specific  identification.  Dividend  income is recognized on the  ex-dividend
date, and interest  income is recognized  using the accrual basis of accounting.
Amortization and accretion is calculated  using the scientific  interest method,
which  approximates the effective interest method over the holding period of the
security. Amortization of premiums and discounts is included in interest income.



COLLATERALIZED DEBT OBLIGATIONS



The Fund invests in CDOs which include  collateralized loan obligations ("CLOs")
and  other  similarly  structured  securities.  CLOs are a type of  asset-backed
securities.  A CLO is a trust typically collateralized by a pool of loans, which
may include,  among others,  domestic and foreign senior  secured loans,  senior
unsecured  loans, and subordinate  corporate loans,  including loans that may be
rated below investment grade or equivalent

unrated loans. CDOs may charge management fees and administrative  expenses. For
CDOs, the cashflows  from the trust are split into two or more portions,  called
tranches,  varying  in risk and yield.  The  riskiest  portion  is the  "equity"
tranche  which bears the bulk of  defaults  from the bonds or loans in the trust
and serves to protect the other,  more senior  tranches  from default in all but
the most severe circumstances.  Since it is partially protected from defaults, a
senior  tranche from a CDO trust  typically  has a higher rating and lower yield
than their underlying securities, and can be rated investment grade. Despite the
protection  from the equity  tranche,  CDO tranches can  experience  substantial
losses  due  to  actual  defaults,  increased  sensitivity  to  defaults  due to
collateral default and disappearance of protecting tranches, market anticipation
of defaults, as well as aversion to CDO securities as a class.


The risks of an investment in a CDO depend largely on the type of the collateral
securities  and the class of the CDO in which the Fund invests.  Normally,  CLOs
and other CDOs are  privately  offered and sold,  and thus,  are not  registered
under the securities laws. As a result, investments in CDOs may be characterized
by the Fund as illiquid  securities;  however, an active dealer market may exist
for CDOs,  allowing a CDO to qualify for Rule 144A transactions.  In addition to
the normal risks associated with fixed income  securities  (e.g.,  interest rate
risk and default  risk),  CDOs carry  additional  risks  including,  but are not
limited to: (i) the possibility that  distributions  from collateral  securities
will not be adequate to make interest or other payments; (ii) the quality of the
collateral  may decline in value or default;  (iii) the Funds may invest in CDOs
that are  subordinate  to other classes;  and (iv) the complex  structure of the
security may not be fully  understood at the time of investment  and may produce
disputes with the issuer or unexpected investment results.



FEDERAL TAXES



The  Fund's  taxable  income  or  loss  is  reported  by  the  limited  partners
individually.  The  liability for payment of federal and state income tax on the
Fund's earnings is the  responsibility of its partners,  rather than that of the
Fund.  Accordingly,  no provision on liability for U.S. federal income taxes has
been recorded in the financial statements.

2.   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONCLUDED)



FEDERAL TAXES (CONTINUED)



The Fund adopted  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board (FASB)  released  FASB
INTERPRETATION  NO. 48,  "ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES" ("FIN 48")
upon  commencement  of  operations  on August 1,  2007.  Based on its  analysis,
management has  determined  that the adoption of FIN 48 does not have a material
impact to the Funds' financial  statements upon adoption.  However,  managements
conclusions  regarding FIN 48 may be subject to review and adjustment at a later
date based on factors including,  but not limited to, further implementation and
guidance  expected  from the FASB,  and on-going  analyses of and changes to tax
laws, regulations and interpretations thereof.



ORGANIZATION AND OFFERING COSTS



Costs incurred in connection with the  organization of the Fund were expensed as
incurred. Initial offering costs have been deferred and are being amortized on a
straight-line  basis  over the first  twelve  months of the  Fund's  operations.
Unamortized offering costs at December 31, 2007, were $39,682.



INDEMNIFICATIONS



The Fund enters into contracts that contain a variety of  indemnifications.  The
Fund's maximum  exposure under these  arrangements  is unknown.  However,  since
inception the Fund has not had claims or losses  pursuant to these contracts and
expects the risk of loss to be remote.



RESTRICTED SECURITIES



At December 31,  2007,  the Fund owned  private  placement  investment  that was
purchased through private offerings or acquired through initial public offerings
and cannot be sold without prior  registration  under the Securities Act of 1933
or pursuant to an  exemption  therefrom.  In  addition,  the Fund has  generally
agreed to further  restrictions  on the  disposition of certain  holdings as set
forth in various agreements entered into in connection with the purchase of this
investment.  This investment is valued at fair value as determined in accordance
with the procedures approved by the Board of Trustees. For the acquisition dates
of this investment,  the enforceable right to acquire this security,  along with
the cost and value at December 31, 2007, please see the Schedule of Investments.

3.   ADVISER, ADMINISTRATOR AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS


The Adviser does not charge a management fee to the Fund.  Limited  partners are
responsible for paying the fees of the Adviser  directly under their  individual
investment  management agreement with the Adviser. Each agreement sets forth the
fees to be paid to the Adviser,  which are ordinarily  expressed as a percentage
of the  limited  partners  assets  managed by the  Adviser.  This fee,  which is
negotiated  between  the  limited  partner  and  the  Adviser,   may  include  a
performance-based fee and/or a fixed-dollar fee for certain specified services.


The Adviser has voluntarily agreed that certain expenses of the Fund,  including
custody fees and administrative fees shall not in the aggregate exceed 0.50% per
annum of the Fund's net asset  value,  and the  Adviser or its  affiliates  will
waive Fund fees or reimburse Fund expenses to the extent  necessary so that such
0.50% limit is not exceeded. The following expenses of the Fund are specifically
excluded  from  the  expense  limit:  organizational  expenses;   extraordinary,
non-recurring and certain other unusual  expenses;  taxes and fees; and expenses
incurred  indirectly by the Fund through its  investments  in Structured  Credit
Investments.  The  Adviser  may  discountinue  all or part of this waiver at any
time.


SEI  Global  Services,   Inc.  (the  "Administrator"),   serves  as  the  Fund's
administrator. The Administrator is a wholly-owned subsidiary of SEI Investments
Company.  The Administrator  provides certain  administrative,  accounting,  and
transfer  agency  services  to the Fund.  The  services to be  performed  by the
Administrator may be completed by one or more of its affiliated  companies.  The
Fund pays the Administrator a fee equal to 0.10% (on an annualized basis) of the
Fund's Net Asset Value which is accrued  monthly  based on month-end  net assets
and is paid monthly, and reimburses the Administrator for certain  out-of-pocket
expenses.


SEI Investments  Distribution  Co. (the "Placement  Agent") serves as the Fund's
placement agent pursuant to an agreement with the Fund. The Placement Agent is a
wholly owned  subsidiary  of SEI  Investments.  It is not  anticipated  that the
Placement Agent will be compensated by the Fund for its services  rendered under
the agreement.

4.   ALLOCATION OF PROFITS AND LOSSES


The Fund maintains a separate capital account for each of its limited  partners.
As of the last day of each fiscal period, the Fund shall allocate net profits or
losses for that fiscal period to the capital  accounts of all limited  partners,
in proportion to their  respective  opening  capital  account  balances for such
fiscal period (after taking into account any capital  contributions deemed to be
made as of the first day of such fiscal period).


5.   PARTNERS' CAPITAL


The Fund,  in the  discretion  of the Board,  may sell  Interests,  at net asset
value,  to new  limited  partners  and may allow  existing  limited  partners to
purchase additional  Interests in the Fund on such days as are determined by the
Board  in its sole  discretion.  It is the  Fund's  intention  to allow  limited
purchases of Interests only during  designated  subscriptions  periods as may be
established  by  the  Board  or  its  designees  (currently,  the  Adviser)  and
communicated to limited  partners.  The Board or its designee will determine the
amount of Interests offered to limited partners during a subscription  period at
its discretion.  During the established  subscription periods,  Interests may be
purchased on a business day, or at such other times as the Board may  determine,
at the offering price (which is net asset value).  The Fund may  discontinue its
offering at any time.


The Fund is a closed-end  investment  company,  and therefore no limited partner
will have the right to require the Fund to redeem its Interests.


The  Fund  from  time to time  may  offer to  repurchase  outstanding  Interests
pursuant to written tenders by limited partners.  Repurchase offers will be made
at such  times and on such terms as may be  determined  by the Board in its sole
discretion.  In determining  whether the Fund should  repurchase  Interests from
limited  partners  pursuant  to written  tenders,  the Board will  consider  the
recommendations  of the  Adviser.  The  Fund  does not  intend  to  conduct  any
repurchase  offers  until  two  years  after  the  commencement  of  the  Fund's
operation.  After the initial two year period,  the Adviser expects that it will
recommend to the Board that the Fund offer to  repurchase  Interests  four times
each year, as of the last business day of March, June, September,  and December.
However,  limited  partners  will not be  permitted  to  tender  for  repurchase
Interests  that were acquired less than two years prior to the effective date of
the proposed repurchase.

5.   PARTNERS' CAPITAL (CONTINUED)


Capital  contributions  received in advance are comprised of cash received prior
December 31, 2007, for which member interests of the Fund were issued on January
1, 2008.  Capital  contributions  received in advance do not  participate in the
earnings of the Fund until the related member interests are issued.


6.   INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS


The cost of  security  purchases  and  proceeds  from the sale and  maturity  of
securities, other than temporary cash investments, during the period from August
1, 2007 (commencement of operations)  through December 31, 2007 were $28,405,931
and $3,982,034, respectively.


As of December 31, 2007, the aggregate cost of investments  for tax purposes was
expected to be similar to book cost of $25,654,798.  Net unrealized appreciation
on  investments  for tax purposes was $200,792  consisting  of $538,069 of gross
unrealized appreciation and $337,277 of gross unrealized depreciation.


7.   CONCENTRATIONS OF RISK


In the normal course of business,  the Fund trades various financial instruments
and enters into various  investment  activities with off-balance sheet risk. The
Fund's  satisfaction of the obligations may exceed the amount  recognized in the
statement of assets and liabilities.


The market value of the Fund's  investments  will change in response to interest
rate changes and other factors.  During periods of falling  interest rates,  the
values of fixed income securities generally rise. Conversely,  during periods of
rising interest rates, the values of such securities generally decline.  Changes
by recognized rating agencies in the ratings of any fixed income security and in
the ability of an issuer to make  payments of interest  and  principal  may also
affect the value of these investments.

8.   FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS


The following represents the ratios to average net assets and other supplemental
information for the period August 1, 2007  (commencement of operations)  through
Decemeber 31, 2007:






TOTAL RETURN (1)








Total return (3)                                            5.82%

Partners' capital, end of period (000's)                   $25,034

RATIOS TO AVERAGE PARTNERS' CAPITAL
NET INVESTMENT INCOME RATIO
Net investment income, net of waivers (2)                   9.13%

EXPENSE RATIO
Operating expenses, before waivers (2) (4)                  1.54%
Operating expenses, net of waivers (2) (4)                  0.37%

Portfolio turnover rate (3)                                21.85%








(1)  Total return is calculated for all the limited partners taken as a whole. A
limited partner's return may vary from these returns based on the timing of
capital transactions.

(2)  Annualized.

(3)  Not annualized.

(4)  Expense ratios include  offering costs.  Which are not annualized.  Had the
offering costs been annualized,  the ratio for "Operating expenses,  before
waivers" and "Operating expenses, net of waivers" would have been 1.67% and
0.50%, respectively.

9.   RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS


In September  2006,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board (FASB)  issued
Statement  on  Financial  Accounting  Standards  (SFAS)  NO.  157,  "Fair  Value
Measurements." This standard  establishes a single  authoritative  definition of
fair  value,  sets  out a  framework  for  measuring  fair  value  and  requires
additional  disclosures about fair value  measurements.  SFAS No. 157 applies to
fair value  measurements  already  required or permitted by existing  standards.
SFAS No. 157 is  effective  for  financial  statements  issued for fiscal  years
beginning after November 15, 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years.
The  changes  to  current  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  from the
application of this Statement relate to the definition of fair vlue, the methods
used to  measure  fair  value,  and the  expanded  disclosures  about fair value
measurements. As of December 31, 2007, the Fund does not believe the adoption of
SFAS No. 157 will  impact the  amounts  reported  in the  financial  statements,
however,  additional  disclosures  will be  required  about the  inputs  used to
develop the measurements and the effect of certain of the measurements  reported
in the financial statements for a fiscal period.


10.  SUBSEQUENT EVENTS


Subsequent to year end through February 29, 2008 the Fund recorded subscriptions
of  $5,800,000,  which were received by the Fund prior to December 31, 2007. The
Fund paid no redemptions.

Board of Trustees Considerations in Approving the Advisory Agreement


(Unaudited)


December 31, 2007


SEI  Structured  Credit  Fund,  LP (the "Fund") and SEI  Investments  Management
Corporation  ("SIMC") have entered into an investment  advisory  agreement  (the
"Advisory  Agreement").  Pursuant  to the  Advisory  Agreement,  and  under  the
supervision  of the Fund's  Board of  Directors  (the  "Board"),  SIMC  provides
investment advisory services to the Fund,  including managing the investment and
reinvestment of the Fund's assets.


The  Investment  Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act")  requires that
the initial  approval of, as well as the  continuation  of, the Fund's  Advisory
Agreement  must  be  specifically  approved:  (i) by the  vote of the  Board  of
Directors or by a vote of the  shareholders of the Fund; and (ii) by the vote of
a majority of the  Directors  who are not parties to the  Advisory  Agreement or
"interested persons" of any party (the "Independent Directors"),  cast in person
at a meeting  called for the purpose of voting on such  approval.  In connection
with their  consideration  of such approvals,  the Fund's Directors must request
and  evaluate,  and SIMC is  required  to furnish,  such  information  as may be
reasonably  necessary  to  evaluate  the  terms of the  Advisory  Agreement.  In
addition,  the  Securities  and Exchange  Commission  ("SEC") takes the position
that,  as part of their  fiduciary  duties with respect to a fund's  fees,  fund
boards are required to evaluate the material factors applicable to a decision to
approve an Advisory Agreement.


Consistent with these responsibilities,  the Fund's Board of Directors will call
and hold  meetings  each year that will be dedicated to  considering  whether to
renew the Advisory Agreement between the Fund and SIMC. In preparation for these
meetings, the Board will request and review a wide variety of materials provided
by  SIMC,   including   information  about  SIMC's  affiliates,   personnel  and
operations.  The Board  will  also  receive  extensive  data  provided  by third
parties.  This information is in addition to the detailed  information about the
Fund that the Board  will  review  during  the  course of each  year,  including
information that relates to Fund operations and Fund performance.  The Directors
will also receive a memorandum from Fund counsel and independent  counsel to the
Independent  Directors regarding the responsibilities of Directors in connection
with their  consideration  of whether  to renew the Fund's  Advisory  Agreement.
Finally, the Independent  Directors will receive advice from independent counsel
to the Independent Directors,  meet in executive session outside the presence of
Fund   management  and   participate  in  question  and  answer   sessions  with
representatives of SIMC.

regarding:  (a) the quality of SIMC's investment  management and other services;

(b) SIMC's investment management personnel;  (c) SIMC's operations and financial
condition;   (d)  SIMC's   brokerage   practices   (including  any  soft  dollar
arrangements)  and  investment  strategies;  (e) the  Fund's  overall  fees  and
operating  expenses  compared  with  similar  funds;  (f) the  level  of  SIMC's
profitability from its Fund-related  operations;  (g) SIMC's compliance systems;

(h)  SIMC's  policies  on and  compliance  procedures  for  personal  securities
transactions; (i) SIMC's reputation,  expertise and resources in domestic and/or
international  financial markets;  and (j) the performance of the Fund, compared
with the performance of similar funds.


At the June 27, 2007 meeting of the Board of Directors, the Directors, including
a  majority  of the  Independent  Directors,  initially  approved  the  Advisory
Agreement  and approved the selection of SIMC to act as the  investment  adviser
for the Fund. The Board's approval was based on its consideration and evaluation
of a variety of specific factors discussed at the meeting, including:


o  the nature,  extent and  quality of  the  services to be provided to the Fund
under the  Advisory  Agreement,  including  the  resources  of  SIMC and  its
affiliates dedicated to the Fund;


o  the  investment  performance  of other  funds  managed by SIMC in  a  similar
style and how  the  performance  of those other funds  compared with similar
funds in other fund families;


o  the fact that the Fund  will  not  pay an  advisory  fee  under the  Advisory
Agreement;


o  the  expected  profitability  of SIMC  and its affiliates with respect to the
Fund,  including  both direct and indirect  benefits accruing to SIMC and its
affiliates; and


o  the extent to which economies of scale would be realized as the Fund grows.

Board of Trustees Considerations in Approving the Advisory Agreement


(Unaudited) (continued)


December 31, 2007


NATURE,  EXTENT AND QUALITY OF SERVICES.  The Board of Directors  considered the
nature,  extent and  quality of the  services to be provided by SIMC to the Fund
and the  resources of SIMC and its  affiliates  dedicated  to the Fund.  In this
regard,  the  Directors  evaluated,   among  other  things,   SIMC's  personnel,
experience,  track record and compliance  program.  Specifically,  the Directors
considered  SIMC's experience in manager selection since that would be the focus
of SIMC's CDO selection.  Following evaluation, the Board concluded that, within
the  context  of its full  deliberations,  the  nature,  extent  and  quality of
services  provided  by  SIMC  to the  Fund  and the  resources  of SIMC  and its
affiliates dedicated to the Fund supported approval of the Advisory Agreement.


FUND PERFORMANCE.  The Board of Directors considered the investment  performance
of  other  funds  managed  by SIMC in a style  similar  to that  which  had been
proposed for the Fund under the Advisory  Agreement (the "Other SIMC Funds") and
how the performance of the Other SIMC Funds compared with similar funds in other
fund  families.  Specifically,  the  Board  considered  that  SIMC  has  managed
structured credit  investments on a separate account basis within the Other SIMC
Funds since May 2005. The Directors considered the performance of the Other SIMC
Funds relative to their peer groups and appropriate indices/benchmarks, in light
of total return,  yield and market trends. As part of this review, the Directors
considered  the  composition  of each peer  group  and  selection  criteria.  In
evaluating   performance,   the  Directors   considered  both  market  risk  and
shareholder risk expectations for the Other SIMC Funds. The Board concluded that
performance  of the Other SIMC Funds was  satisfactory  and therefore  concluded
that, within the context of its full deliberations, the performance of the Other
SIMC Funds supported approval of the Advisory Agreement.


FUND EXPENSES. With respect to the Fund's expenses under the Advisory Agreement,
the  Directors  considered  the fact that the Fund will not pay an advisory  fee
under the Advisory  Agreement.  Instead,  Fund investors (the "Fund  Investors")
will be  responsible  for paying  SIMC's  advisory  fees  pursuant to individual
investment  management   agreements  with  SIMC.  In  addition,   the  Directors
considered  the Fund's net  operating  expense  ratio in  comparison to those of
other comparable funds. The Directors also considered  information about average
expense  ratios  of  comparable  funds  in  the  Fund's  peer  group.  Following
evaluation,   the  Board  concluded  that,   within  the  context  of  its  full
deliberations,  the  expenses  of the Fund  would be  reasonable  and  supported
approval of the Advisory Agreement.

Board of Trustees Considerations in Approving the Advisory Agreement


(Unaudited) (continued)


December 31, 2007


EXPECTED  PROFITABILITY.  With regard to expected  profitability,  the Directors
considered all compensation that would flow to SIMC and its affiliates, directly
or  indirectly.   The  Directors   considered   whether  the  varied  levels  of
compensation and  profitability  under the Advisory  Agreement and other service
agreements were reasonable and justified in light of the quality of all services
to be  rendered to the Fund by SIMC and its  affiliates.  When  considering  the
expected  profitability  of SIMC,  the Board took into account the fact that the
SIMC is compensated  by the Fund  Investors,  and not by the Fund directly,  and
such  compensation  with  respect to SIMC  reflects an  arms-length  negotiation
between the SIMC and the Fund  Investors.  Based on this  evaluation,  the Board
concluded that, within the context of its full deliberations,  the profitability
of SIMC would be reasonable and supported approval of the Advisory Agreement.


ECONOMIES OF SCALE.  The Directors  considered the existence of any economies of
scale and whether those would be passed along to the Fund's shareholders through
a graduated  investment advisory fee schedule or other means,  including any fee
waivers  by SIMC  and  its  affiliates.  Based  on this  evaluation,  the  Board
concluded  that,  within the context of its full  deliberations,  the Fund would
obtain reasonable benefit from economies of scale.


Based on the Directors'  deliberation  and their  evaluation of the  information
described  above,  the  Board,  including  all  of  the  Independent  Directors,
unanimously  approved the Advisory  Agreement  and  concluded  that the Advisory
Agreement is fair and reasonable in light of such services and expenses and such
other  matters as the  Directors  considered  to be relevant in the  exercise of
their reasonable judgment.  In the course of their deliberations,  the Directors
did  not  identify  any  particular   information  that  was   all-important  or
controlling.

provision of these non-audit services is compatible with maintaining
the principal accountant's independence.

The Fund will be adopting Proxy Policies and Procedures at its upcoming March,

ITEM 8.  PORTFOLIO MANAGERS OF CLOSED-END MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES



COMPENSATION. The Adviser compensates each portfolio manager for his management
of the Fund. Each portfolio manager's compensation consists of a fixed annual
salary, plus a discretionary annual bonus determined generally as follows.


Thirty percent of each portfolio manager's compensation is tied to the corporate
performance of SEI, as measured by the earnings per share earned for a
particular year. This is set at the discretion of SEI and not the Adviser.
Seventy percent of each portfolio manager's compensation is based upon various
performance factors, including the portfolio manager's performance versus a risk
free rate proxy, such as the Merrill Lynch 3 Month US LIBOR Index, over the past
one, two and three years (50% weighted to one year; 25% to each of the others).
The performance factor is based upon a target outperformance of the Merrill
Lynch 3 Month US LIBOR Index. Another key factor is the portfolio managers' team
objectives, which relate to key measurements of execution efficiency (i.e.,
equitization efficiency, hedging efficiency, trading efficiency, etc.). A final
factor is a discretionary component, which is based upon a qualitative review of
the portfolio managers and their team.





OWNERSHIP OF FUND SHARES. As of the date of this Registration Statement, the
portfolio managers did not beneficially own any shares of the Fund.


OTHER ACCOUNTS. As of December 31, 2007, in addition to the Fund, the portfolio
managers were responsible for the day-to-day management of certain other
accounts, as listed below: The accounts below do not pay performance-based
advisory fees.

CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS. Each portfolio manager's management of "other accounts"
may give rise to potential conflicts of interest in connection with his
management of the Fund's investments, on the one hand, and the investments of
the other accounts, on the other. The other accounts include portions of two
U.S. registered high yield mutual funds and an Irish registered high yield fund
(collectively, the "Other Accounts"). The Other Accounts might have similar
investment objectives as the Fund or hold, purchase, or sell securities that are
eligible to be held, purchased, or sold by the Fund. While the portfolio
managers' management of the Other Accounts may give rise to the following
potential conflicts of interest, the Adviser does not believe that the
conflicts, if any, are material or, to the extent any such conflicts are
material, the Adviser believes that it has designed policies and procedures that
are reasonably designed to manage those conflicts in an appropriate way.


KNOWLEDGE OF THE TIMING AND SIZE OF FUND TRADES. A potential conflict of
interest may arise as a result of the portfolio managers' day-to-day management
of the Fund. Because of their position with the Fund, the portfolio managers
know the size, timing, and possible market impact of Fund trades. It is
theoretically possible that the portfolio managers could use this information to
the advantage of the Other Accounts and to the possible detriment of the Fund.
However, the Adviser has adopted policies and procedures reasonably designed to
allocate investment opportunities on a fair and equitable basis over time.


INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES. A potential conflict of interest may arise as a result
of the portfolio managers' management of the Fund and the Other Accounts which,
in theory, may allow them to allocate investment opportunities in a way that
favors the Other Accounts over the Fund. This conflict of interest may be
exacerbated to the extent that the Adviser or the portfolio managers receive, or
expect to receive, greater compensation from their management of the Other
Accounts than the Fund. Notwithstanding this theoretical conflict of interest,
it is the Adviser's policy to manage each account based on its investment
objectives and related restrictions and, as discussed above, the Adviser has
adopted policies and procedures reasonably designed to allocate investment
opportunities on a fair and equitable basis over time and in a manner consistent
with each account's investment objectives and related restrictions. For example,
while the portfolio managers may buy for an Other Account securities that differ
in identity or quantity from securities bought for the Fund, such an approach
might not be suitable for the Fund given its investment objectives and related
restrictions.


The Adviser may enter into incentive fee arrangements with one or more investors
in the SEI Structured Credit Segregated Portfolio (the "Offshore Feeder Fund"),
a segregated portfolio of SEI Offshore Advanced Strategies Series SPC, a
segregated portfolio company established in the Cayman Islands, that acts as a
feeder fund for the Fund, whereby a portion of the increase in the net asset
value of such investor's investment in the Offshore Feeder Fund over a given
period shall be payable to the Adviser. This arrangement may create an incentive
for the Adviser to make investments for the Fund that are riskier or





more speculative than if the Adviser had no such interest because the Adviser
will not bear an analogous portion of depreciation in the value of the Offshore
Feeder Fund's assets if the value of its investment in the Fund declines.
Notwithstanding this theoretical conflict of interest, it is the Adviser's
policy to manage each account based on its investment objectives and related
restrictions and the Adviser believes that it has designed policies and
procedures that are designed to manage such conflict in an appropriate way.

CODE OF ETHICS




Adopted Under Rule 17j-l



While  affirming  its  confidence  in the integrity and good faith of all of its
officers  and  directors,  each  of  SEI  Opportunity  Master  Fund,  L.P.,  SEI
Opportunity  Fund, L.P., and SEI Structured  Credit Fund, L.P. (each a "Company"
collectively,  the  "Companies"),  recognize  that the  knowledge  of present or
future portfolio transactions and, in certain instances,  the power to influence
portfolio transactions which may be possessed by certain officers, employees and
directors could place such individuals,  if they engage in personal transactions
in securities  which are eligible for investment by each Company,  in a position
where their personal interest may conflict with that of each Company.


In view of the foregoing and of the  provisions  of Rule  17j-l(b)(I)  under the
Investment  Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act"), each Company has determined to
adopt this Code of Ethics to specify and prohibit  certain types of transactions
deemed to create  conflicts  of interest (or at least the  potential  for or the
appearance  of such a conflict),  and to establish  reporting  requirements  and
enforcement procedures.





A.   STATEMENT OF GENERAL PRINCIPLES


In recognition of the trust and confidence placed in each Company by its
shareholders, and to give effect to each Company's belief that its operations
should be directed to the benefit of its shareholders, each Company hereby
adopts the following general principles to guide the actions of its directors,
officers and employees:


(l)  The interests of each Company's shareholders are paramount, and all of
each Company's personnel must conduct themselves and their operations to
give maximum effect to this tenet by assiduously placing the interests of
the shareholders before their own.


(2)  All personal transactions in securities by each Company's personnel
must be accomplished so as to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of
interest on the part of such personnel with the interests of each Company
and its shareholders.


(3)  Each Company's personnel must avoid actions or activities that allow
(or appear to allow) a person to profit or benefit from his or her position
with respect to each Company, or that otherwise bring into question the
person's independence or judgment.


B.   DEFINITIONS


(1)  "Access Person" shall mean


(i)    each director or officer of a Company,


(ii)   each employee of each Company (or of any company in a control
relationship to the Company) who, in connection with his or her
regular functions or duties, makes, participates in, or obtains
information regarding the purchase or sale of a security by each
Company, or whose functions relate to the making of any
recommendations with respect to such purchases or sales, and


(iii)  any natural person in a control relationship to each Company
who obtains information concerning recommendations made to or by the
Company with respect to the purchase or sale of a security by any
Company, or whose functions relate to the making of any
recommendations with respect to such purchases or sales;


(iv)   each director, officer or general partner of any principal
underwriter for a Company, but only where such person in the ordinary
course either makes, participates in, or obtains information regarding
the purchase or sale of securities by a Company, or whose functions
relate to the makingof recommendations regarding securities to a
Company; and


(v)    any natural person in a control relationship with a Company or
any of the Company's advisers or subadvisers who obtains information
concerning





recommendations made to the Company with regard to the purchase or
sale of a security.


(2)  "Beneficial ownership" of a security is to be determined in the same
manner as it is for purposes of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934. This means that a person should generally consider himself the
beneficial owner of any securities in which he has a direct or indirect
pecuniary interest. In addition, a person should consider himself the
beneficial owner of securities held by his spouse, his minor children, a
relative who shares his home, or other persons by reason of any contract,
arrangement, understanding or relationship that provides him with sole or
shared voting or investment power.


(3)  "Control" shall have the same meaning as that set forth in Section
2(a)(9) of the 1940 Act. Section 2(a)(9) provides that "control" means the
power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies
of a company, unless such power is solely the result of an official
position with such company. Ownership of 25% or more of a company's
outstanding voting security is presumed to give the holder thereof control
over the company. Such presumption may be countered by the facts and

his or her own personal securities transactions to an officer designated to
receive his or her reports ("Alternate Review Officer"), who shall act in
all respects in the manner prescribed herein for the Review Officer.


(2)  Every report shall be made not later than 10 days after the end of the
calendar quarter in which the transaction to which the report relates was
effected, and shall contain the following information:


(A)    The date of the transaction, the title and the number of shares
or the principal amount of each security involved;


(B)    The nature of the transaction (i.e., purchase, sale or any
other type of acquisition or disposition);


(C)    The price at which the transaction was effected;


(D)    The name of the broker, dealer or bank with or through whom the
transaction was effected; and

to this





Section V where such person is required to file reports pursuant to a code

(5)  An Independent Director shall report transactions in Securities only

course of fulfilling his or her official duties as a director, should have
known, that during the IS-day period immediately preceding or following the
date of the transaction, such security was purchased or sold, or was being
considered for purchase or sale, by a Company. (The "should have known"
standard implies no duty of inquiry, does not presume there should have
been any deduction or extrapolation from discussions or memoranda dealing
with tactics to be employed meeting a Company's investment objectives, or
that any knowledge is to be imputed because of prior knowledge of the
Company's portfolio holdings, market considerations, or the Company's
investment policies, objectives and restrictions.)


(6)  Any such report may contain a statement that the report shall not be
construed as an admission by the person making such report that he has any

relates.


(7)  Each Independent Director shall report the name of any publicly-owned
company (or any company anticipating a public offering of its equity

her if such total ownership is more than 1/2 of 1% of the company's
outstanding shares. Such report shall be made promptly after the date on
which the Director's ownership interest equaled or exceeded 1/2 of 1%.


F.   Review and Enforcement


(l)  The Review Officer shall compare all reported personal securities
transactions with completed portfolio transactions of a Company and a list
of securities being considered for purchase or sale by the Company's
adviser(s) and subadviser(s) to determine whether a violation of this Code
may have occurred. Before making any determination that a violation has
been committed by any person, the Review Officer shall give such person an
opportunity to supply additional explanatory material.


(2)  If the Review Officer determines that a violation of this Code may
have occurred, he shall submit his written determination, together with the
confidential monthly report and any additional explanatory material
provided by the individual, to the President of such Company and outside
counsel, who shall make an independent determination as to whether a
violation has occurred.


(3)  If the President and outside counsel find that a violation has
occurred, the President shall impose upon the individual such sanctions as
he or she deems appropriate and shall report the violation and the sanction
imposed to the Board of Directors of such Company.





(4)  No person shall participate in a determination of whether he has
committed a violation of the Code or of the imposition of any sanction
against himself. If a securities transaction of the President is under
consideration, any Vice President shall act in all respects in the manner
prescribed herein for the President.

Ethics

(4)  Shall immediately furnish to such Company, without request, all
material information regarding any violation of such Code by any person who
is an Access Person as to the Company.


H.   Annual Written Report to the Board


At least once a year, the Review Officer for each Company will provide the Board
of Directors a WRITTEN report that includes:


(1)  Issues Arising Under the Code -The Report will describe any issue(s)
that arose during the previous year under the Code, including any material
Code violations, and any resulting sanction(s).


(2)  Certification -The Report will certify to the Board of Directors that
the each Company has adopted measures reasonably necessary to prevent its
personnel from violating the Code currently and in the future.

confidential.

(1)  The Fund will not pay a
management fee.  The Fund offers Shares only to Eligible Investors (as defined herein)
that have signed an investment management agreement with SEI Investments
Management Corporation (“SIMC” or the “Adviser”), the investment adviser to the
Fund. 
Investors will be responsible for paying the fees of the Adviser
directly under their individual investment management agreement with the
Adviser. Each agreement sets forth the fees to be paid to the Adviser, which
are ordinarily expressed as a percentage of the Investor’s assets managed by
the Adviser.  This fee, which is negotiated between the Investor and the
Adviser, may include a performance-based fee and/or a fixed-dollar fee for
certain specified services.
4 

(2)  “Other Expenses” are estimated based on anticipated Fund net assets and expenses for the Fund’s current fiscal year, and include professional fees and other expenses, including, without limitation, offering costs, administration fees and custody fees.
(3)  The Adviser has voluntarily
agreed that certain expenses of the Fund, including custody fees and
administrative fees, shall not in the aggregate exceed 0.50% per annum of the
Fund’s net asset value, and the Adviser or its affiliates will waive Fund fees
or reimburse Fund expenses to the extent necessary so that such 0.50% limit is
not exceeded.  The following expenses of
the Fund are specifically excluded from the expense limit: organizational
expenses; extraordinary, non-recurring and certain other unusual expenses;
taxes and fees; and expenses incurred indirectly by the Fund through its
investments in Structured Credit Investments (as defined herein).  Organizational expenses are those associated
with the organization of the Fund,
including, but not limited to, costs in connection with the preparation and
execution of the material contracts referred to herein; the preparation of the
Fund’s organizational documents, the private placement memorandum of the Fund
and other regulatory documents; and all initial legal and printing costs.  The Adviser may discontinue all or
part of this waiver at any time.
The purpose of this table is to assist an investor in understanding the
various costs and expenses that an investor in the Fund will bear directly or
indirectly.  The table assumes the
reinvestment of all dividends and distributions at net asset value, although
the Fund does not anticipate making regular dividends or distributions.  For a more complete description of the various
fees and expenses of the Fund, see the discussion in Item 9, “Management.”
The Example is based on the expenses set forth in the table above and
should not be considered a representation of the Fund’s future expenses.  Actual expenses of the Fund may be higher or
lower than those shown.  Moreover, the
annual return may be greater or less than the hypothetical 5% return in the
table above; if the annual return were greater, the amount of fees and expenses
would increase.

the Registrant
  Item 8.1
Description of the Registrant
The Fund, a Delaware limited partnership, is registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”), as a closed-end,
non-diversified, management investment company. 
The Fund was organized under Delaware law on June 26, 2007.  Common units of limited partnership interest
(“Shares”) of the Fund are being issued solely in private placement
transactions that do not involve any “public offering” within the meaning of
Section 4(2) of, and/or Regulation D under, the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the “Securities Act”). 
Investments in the Fund may be made only by “accredited investors,” as
defined in Regulation D under the Securities Act, and “qualified clients,” as
defined in Rule 205-3 under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended
(the “Advisers Act”).  This Registration
Statement does not constitute an offer to sell, or the solicitation of an offer
to buy, any “security” within the meaning of the Securities Act.  The Fund may also, from time to time, issue a
class of an unlimited number of preferred Shares of the Fund, no par value.
  Item 8.2
Investment Objective and Policies
The
Fund’s objective is to seek to generate high total returns.  There can be no assurance that the Fund will
achieve its objective.
Except
as expressly noted otherwise herein, the Fund’s investment objective, policies
and strategies may be changed without Investor approval.
The
Fund pursues its investment objective by investing in a portfolio comprised of
collateralized debt obligations (“CDOs”) and other structured credit
investments. CDOs involve special purpose investment vehicles formed to acquire
and manage a pool of loans, bonds and/or other fixed income assets of various
types. The CDO funds its investments by issuing several classes of securities,
the repayment of which is linked to the performance of the underlying assets,
which serve as collateral for certain securities issued by the CDO.  In addition to CDOs, the Fund’s investments
may include fixed income securities, loan participations, credit-linked notes,
medium term notes, registered and unregistered investment companies or pooled
investment vehicles, and derivative instruments, such as credit default swaps
and total return swaps (collectively with CDOs, “Structured Credit Investments”).  Structured Credit Investments that are 
6 

themselves
pooled investment vehicles are managed by third party managers (“Structured
Credit Managers”).  Issuers of Structured
Credit Investments may by both domestic and foreign.
The
Fund offers investors the following potential advantages:
·                  Diversification through the spreading of risk
across a number of Structured Credit Investments, collateral types underlying
the Structured Credit Investments, and Structured Credit Managers;
·                  Professional selection and evaluation of
Structured Credit Investments and the Structured Credit Managers;
·                  Economies of scale in the form of optimal
price execution and investment sourcing since Structured Credit Investments
generally require a minimum investment size that is higher than most individual
investors would be willing or able to commit;
·                  Limited liability; and
·                  Administrative convenience.
The Fund primarily invests
in equity and mezzanine debt securities of CDOs, which may be rated as
investment grade or below investment grade (“high yield”).  The securities issued by a CDO are tranched
into rated and unrated classes. The rating of each class is determined by,
among other things, the priority of the claim on the cash flows generated by
the underlying collateral of the CDO. The senior notes issued by a CDO are
typically rated “AAA” to “AA,” and have the highest priority claim on cash
flows.  The mezzanine debt classes issued
by a CDO are typically rated “A” to “B” and have a claim on the cash flows
subordinate to that of the senior notes. 
Since most of a CDO’s debt is highly rated, it can raise the majority of
its capital at a low cost in the debt markets relative to the yield earned on
the underlying collateral purchased.  The
most junior tranche of a CDO, called CDO equity, is generally unrated.  CDO equity investors receive payment from any
residual interest proceeds or principal proceeds generated by the underlying
collateral after payments of expenses and debt service with respect to the more
senior tranches in the CDO’s structure. 
CDO equity can be considered a levered investment in the underlying
collateral because the amount of the investment is significantly below the
principal value of the CDO equity’s pro rata portion of the underlying
collateral.  However, due to its
subordinated nature, CDO equity is the first tranche to absorb trading losses
and defaults in the underlying collateral. 
Therefore, while the levered nature of CDO equity increases the cash
flow that may be available for distribution, it also increases the exposure to
trading losses and defaults, and accordingly, causes returns to be more
volatile.  Payments on CDO equity may be
deferred or eliminated depending on the amount of cash flow generated by the
collateral.
CDOs
may focus on different types of underlying collateral, depending upon, among
other things, market conditions and the relative attractiveness of the
opportunities they present for arbitrage, (i.e., the
difference between the yield on the collateral owned by a CDO and the funding
cost of the debt issued by that CDO to help fund the purchase of the underlying
collateral, at any point in time). 
Collateral held by a CDO may include loans to U.S. or foreign-domiciled companies,
high yield bonds, investment grade bonds, mezzanine securities, CDO debt, hedge
funds, asset-backed securities, commercial real estate, trust preferred
securities, synthetic securities, distressed debt, convertible debt, emerging
markets securities or other fixed income assets.
Except
as otherwise stated in this Prospectus or in the Partnership Agreement, the
investment objectives, policies and restrictions of the Fund are not
fundamental and may be changed by the Fund’s Board of Directors (the “Board”).  The Fund generally intends to provide prompt
notice to Investors of any material change to the investment objectives,
policies and restrictions of the Fund. 
However, the Fund reserves the right not to do so where the Board
determines that doing so would not be in the best interests of the Fund, for
instance due to 
7 

unusual
or rapidly changing market conditions. 
In any event, it is possible that Investors will not be able to exit the
Fund before changes take effect.
The
Fund is an appropriate investment only for those investors who can tolerate a
high degree of risk and do not require a liquid investment.
Investment Process
A description of certain aspects of the
current investment process can be found below; however, the investment process is
flexible and will evolve on an ongoing basis and may diverge from this
description in the future.
The investment process can be divided into
five parts: Investment Sourcing, Manager Selection, Deal Analysis, Portfolio
Construction, and Monitoring.
Investment Sourcing 
Structured Credit Investments are sourced
from both sell-side underwriters and the Structured Credit Managers or other
parties associated with Structured Credit Investments.  The Adviser has well-established relationships
with the largest underwriters of structured finance securities, who, either
verbally or electronically, provide the Adviser with a pipeline of upcoming
offerings.  Underwriters are useful for
introducing the Adviser to first-time or less well known Structured Credit
Managers.  The Adviser also has
established relationships with a broad universe of Structured Credit Managers
either through past investments in structured finance investments or through
the Adviser’s other asset management activities.  These managers have in the past notified the
Adviser of upcoming offerings prior to the offering appearing on the
underwriter’s pipelines.  A number of the
more established managers will only allow access to their offerings to a select
group of investors and these offerings, therefore, are not broadly offered to
most investors.  The Fund’s investments
will be sourced through both underwriters and Structured Credit Managers to
ensure access to the widest opportunity set of available investments.
Structured Credit Manager Selection 
The Adviser believes that a
key factor in analyzing most Structured Credit Investments is an analysis of
the Structured Credit Manager.  The
skills required to manage or select a portfolio of collateral within a structured
framework are critical to the performance of an investment.  Structured Credit Managers must understand
and be able to evaluate opportunities in the underlying collateral.  In addition, the manager must be able to
understand, monitor and manage within the constraints imposed by the structure.  The following are examples of the types of
factors the Adviser may consider in assessing Structured Credit Managers:
·                   A proven track record of managing or
selecting the underlying collateral asset classes.
·                   An understanding of managing assets within
the constraints and limitations of a Structured Credit Investment.
·                   Proven ability to receive favorable
collateral allocations in the new issue market.
·                   Co-investment by the Structured Credit
Manager in the Structured Credit Investment, when appropriate.
·                   A strong culture of disciplined, fundamental
credit analysis.
·                   Investment professionals with broad depth and
experience.
·                   Low turnover of key investment personnel.
·                   Experienced workout personnel.
·                   Robust administrative and support staff and
systems.
8 

·                   A direct relationship between the
compensation of the portfolio management team and the performance of the
Structured Credit Investment.
The Adviser will perform due
diligence on all Structured Credit Managers considered for inclusion in the
portfolio and will use its network of industry contacts to perform additional
reference checks on the management teams of each manager.
Structural Analysis
There are significant
structural nuances in Structured Credit Investments that need to be understood
and evaluated.  These nuances can have a
significant impact on the return performance of the various tranches.  In evaluating a proposed portfolio
investment, the Adviser will:
·                   Analyze the performance of the investment
across a wide variety of scenarios.
·                   Analyze the structure of the cash flows.
·                   Understand all of the uses of cash
(structuring and placement fees, legal fees, rating agency fees) at the time of
deal closing.
·                   Evaluate rating agency requirements and
credit rating methodologies.
·                   Analyze the collateral in terms of position
level concentration, credit quality distribution, industry diversification, and
purchase price.
·                   Gain an understanding of the legal and tax
implications of the transaction.
·                   Compare various collateral limitations,
minimum over-collateralization levels, minimum interest coverage levels and
reinvestment criteria with market conventions.
·                   Make recommendations concerning transaction
structure to the underwriter in order to optimize the risk and return profile
of each investment.
Portfolio Construction
The portfolio construction process is
designed to structure the Fund’s portfolio in an attempt to meet its investment
objective while staying in compliance with the Fund’s investment
limitations.  The Fund’s portfolio
managers will assess market opportunities and conditions to form projections of
expected risk and return for each available strategy.  These projections are used to set target
allocations.  The efficiency at which
target allocations are satisfied is a function of the availability of new
investments in the primary market as well as liquidity in the secondary market.
Monitoring
Portfolio monitoring occurs on an ongoing basis and includes routine
contact with Structured Credit Managers and portfolio-level and security-level
risk analysis.  Calls and visits to
existing Structured Credit Managers occur on a frequent basis to review their
investment strategies, their implementation of the investment strategies, and
their valuation methodologies.
  Item 8.3
Risk Factors
The purchase of Shares in the Fund involves a number of significant
risks relating to investments in Structured Credit Investments generally and to
the structure and investment objective of the Fund in particular.  The value of an investment in the Fund will
change with the values of the Fund’s investments.  Many factors can affect those values.  In addition to the risk factors described
below, which are the 
9 

principal risk factors relating to the Fund, prospective investors
should also consider the risks described elsewhere in this registration
statement and the Fund’s Limited Partnership Agreement (“Partnership Agreement”).
General Considerations
Lack of Operating History
The Fund has no operating history upon which investors can evaluate its
past performance.  There can be no
assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective.  Although the Adviser and its affiliates have
managed other funds and are experienced in selecting Structured Credit
Investments and Structured Credit Managers, the past performance of other
investment funds managed by the Adviser or its affiliates should not be
construed as an indication of the future performance of an investment in the
Fund.
No Market for Shares; Illiquidity
Pursuant to the Partnership Agreement, Shares are not transferable
without the prior written consent of the Board, which the Board may withhold in
its sole discretion.  The Fund does not
intend to list Shares for trading on any national securities exchange.  There is no secondary market for Shares, and
none is expected to develop.
By subscribing for Shares, an Investor agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless the Fund, the Board, the Administrator (as defined herein), the
Adviser and each other Investor or any director, officer, partner, member,
employee, agent, representative or affiliate of any of the foregoing from and
against any and all loss, damage or liability due to or arising out of a
transfer made by the Investor of such Investor’s Shares in violation of the
Partnership Agreement or a misrepresentation made by such Investor in
connection with any such transfer.
No Investor will have the right to require the Fund to redeem the
Shares or to exchange the Investor’s Shares for interests in any other
fund.  Liquidity will be provided only
through repurchase offers made from time to time by the Fund in the complete
discretion of the Board.  The first such
repurchase offer is not expected to take place until at least two years after
the Fund commences operation.  Further,
Investors whose initial investment in the Fund was made less than two years
prior to a repurchase offer must agree not to respond to such offer.  Even after the initial two year period, it is
possible that there will be extended periods during which illiquidity in the
underlying investments held by the Fund or other factors will cause the Board
to elect not to conduct repurchase offers. 
Such periods may coincide with periods of negative performance.  In addition, even in the event of a
repurchase offer, it is possible that there will be an oversubscription to the
repurchase offer, in which case an Investor may not be able to redeem the full
amount that the Investor wishes to redeem. 
An investment in the Fund is therefore suitable only for Investors who
can bear the risks associated with the very limited liquidity of Shares and
should be viewed as a long-term investment.
Limited Right to Vote and No
Right to Participate in Management of the Fund
Investors will have no right or power to take part in the management or
control of the Fund and will have extremely limited rights to vote on matters
in respect of the Fund.  Investors will
not receive the detailed financial information that is available to the
Adviser.  Accordingly, no person should
purchase Shares in the Fund unless such person is willing to entrust all
aspects of the Fund’s management to the Board and the Adviser.
10 

Reliance on Management
The Fund invests substantially all of its assets in a broad universe of
Structured Credit Investments. 
Investment decisions will be made for the Fund by the Adviser under the
supervision of the Board.  The success of
the Fund will depend on the ability of the Adviser to identify suitable
investments.  There can be no assurance
that the current personnel of the Adviser will continue to be associated with
the Adviser for any length of time.  The
loss of the services of one or more employees of the Adviser could have an
adverse impact on the Fund’s ability to realize its investment objective.
Changes to Investment Objectives, Policies, and Restrictions
The
investment objectives of the Fund are non-fundamental and may be changed by the
Board.  Except as otherwise stated in
this registration statement or in the Partnership Agreement, the investment
policies and restrictions of the Fund are not fundamental and may be changed by
the Board.  The Fund generally intends to
provide prompt notice to Investors of any material change to the investment
objectives, policies and restrictions of the Fund.  However, the Fund reserves the right not to do
so where the Board determines that doing so would not be in the best interests
of the Fund, for instance due to unusual or rapidly changing market
conditions.  In any event, it is possible
that Investors will not be able to exit the Fund before changes take effect.
Borrowings
The Fund may borrow on a short-term basis to facilitate cash management
or to cover operating expenses.  If the
Fund borrows to finance repurchases of its Shares, interest on that borrowing
will negatively affect Investors who do not have all of their Shares
repurchased by the Fund, by increasing the Fund’s expenses and reducing any net
investment income.  In addition, to the
extent that the Fund borrows funds, the rates at which it can borrow may affect
the operating results of the Fund.
The Fund may leverage its investments in Structured Credit
Investments.  Although leverage presents
opportunities for increasing total investment return, it has the effect of
potentially increasing losses as well. 
Any event that adversely affects the value of the Fund’s investments,
either directly or indirectly, would be magnified to the extent that leverage
is employed.  The cumulative effect of
the use of leverage, directly or indirectly, in a market that moves adversely
to the investments of the entity employing the leverage would result in a loss
that would be greater than if leverage were not employed.
Borrowings by the Fund are subject to a 300% asset coverage requirement
under the 1940 Act.  Borrowings by
certain Structured Credit Investments will not be subject to this
requirement.  See “Risk
Factors—Investment Risks—Special Investment Instruments and
Techniques—Leverage; Interest Rates; Margin.”
Investment Risks
Failure to Achieve Investment Objective
There can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment
objective.  The Adviser’s assessment of
the short-term or long-term prospects of various Structured Credit Investments
may not prove accurate.  No assurance can
be given that any investment or trading strategy implemented by those
Structured Credit Investments in which the Fund invests will be
successful.  Furthermore, because of the
speculative nature of the investments and trading strategies of certain of the
Structured Credit Investments, there is a risk that the Fund may suffer a
significant or complete loss of its invested capital in one or more 
11 

Structured Credit Investments, and that consequently Investors may
suffer a significant or complete loss of their invested capital in the Fund.
General Economic and Market Conditions
The success of the Fund’s investment program may be
affected by general economic and market conditions, such as interest rates,
availability of credit, inflation rates, economic uncertainty, changes in laws,
and national and international political circumstances.  These factors may affect the level and
volatility of securities prices and the liquidity of investments held by the
Fund and the Structured Credit Investments. 
Unexpected volatility or illiquidity could impair the Fund’s
profitability or result in losses.
Highly Volatile Markets
The prices of derivative instruments, including
swaps, futures and options, can be highly volatile.  Price movements of swaps, forward, futures
and other derivative contracts in which the Fund’s assets may be invested are influenced
by, among other things, interest rates, changing supply and demand
relationships, trade, fiscal, monetary and exchange control programs and
policies of governments, and national and international political and economic
events and policies.  In addition,
governments from time to time intervene, directly and by regulation, in certain
markets, particularly those in currencies, financial instruments, futures and
options.  Such intervention often is
intended directly to influence prices and may, together with other factors,
cause all of such markets to move rapidly in the same direction because of,
among other things, interest rate fluctuations. 
Securities or commodities exchanges typically have the right to suspend
or limit trading in any instrument traded on the exchanges.  A suspension could render it impossible for
the Adviser or the Structured Credit Manager to liquidate positions and could
thereby expose the Fund to losses.
Strategy Risk
The Fund is subject to strategy risk.  Strategy risk is associated with the failure
or deterioration of an entire strategy (such that most or all Structured Credit
Managers in the strategy suffer significant losses).  Strategy specific losses can result from
excessive concentration by Structured Credit Managers in the same investment or
broad events that adversely affect particular strategies (e.g., illiquidity
within a given market).  Many of the
strategies employed by the Structured Credit Managers are speculative and involve
substantial risk of loss.
Risks of Securities Activities
All securities investing and trading activities involve the risk of
loss of capital.  While the Adviser will
attempt to manage these risks, there can be no assurance that the Fund’s
investment activities will be successful or that Investors will not suffer
losses.  The following discussion sets
forth some of the more significant risks associated with the styles of
investing of the Fund and the underlying Structured Credit Investments:
Investments in
Collateralized Debt Obligations.  The CDO investments purchased
by the Fund will generally represent the most junior part (and in some cases,
may also represent one or more higher ranking tranches) of the capital
structure of the CDO and will not be rated by any rating agency, or if rated, will
be rated below investment grade. Consequently, the CDO investments will be
subject to the greatest risk of loss, will be the first part of the capital
structure of the CDO to incur losses and will be directly affected by any
losses or delays in payment on the related collateral. The Fund will invest in
CDOs that are managed by various managers, and in some CDOs with underlying
collateral consisting of static pools selected by the related manager. The 
12 

performance of any
particular CDO will depend, among other things, on the level of defaults
experienced on the related collateral, as well as the timing of such defaults
and the timing and amount of any recoveries on such defaulted collateral and
(except in the case of static pool CDOs) the impact of any trading of the
related collateral.  There can be no
assurances that any level of investment return will be achieved by
Investors.  It is possible that the Fund’s
investments in the CDOs will result in a loss on an aggregate basis (even if
some investments do not suffer a loss) and therefore Investors could incur a
loss on their investment.  Because the
payments on the Fund’s CDO investments are subordinated to payments on the
senior obligations of the respective CDO, the investments represent
subordinated, leveraged investments in the underlying collateral.  Therefore, changes in the value of the Fund’s
CDO investments are anticipated to be greater than the change in the market
value of the underlying collateral, which themselves are subject to, among
other things, credit, liquidity and interest rate risk.  Moreover, the Fund’s CDO investments will
have different degrees of leverage based on the capital structure of the CDO.
Investors should consider with particular care the risks of the leverage
present in Fund’s investments because, although the use of leverage by a CDO
creates an opportunity for substantial returns on the related investment, the
subordination of such investment to the senior debt securities issued by that
CDO increases substantially the likelihood that the Fund could lose its entire
investment in such investment if the underlying collateral is adversely
affected by, among other things, the occurrence of defaults.
Illiquid Investments.  The Fund and Structured Credit Managers may invest in securities that
are subject to legal or other restrictions on transfer or for which no liquid
market exists.  The market prices, if
any, for such securities tend to be volatile and the Fund and collateral
managers may not be able to sell them when it desires to do so or to realize
what it perceives to be their fair value in the event of a sale.  The sale of restricted and illiquid
securities often requires more time and results in higher brokerage charges or
dealer discounts and other selling expenses than does the sale of securities
eligible for trading on national securities exchanges or in the
over-the-counter markets.  Restricted
securities may sell at prices that are lower than similar securities that are
not subject to restrictions on resale.
Loan Participations and
Assignments.  The Fund and Structured Credit Managers may
purchase loan participations and assignments. Loan participations are interests
in loans to corporations or governments which are administered by the lending
bank or agent for a syndicate of lending banks, and sold by the lending bank,
financial institution or syndicate member (“intermediary bank”).  In a loan participation, the borrower will be
deemed to be the issuer of the participation interest, except to the extent the
Fund or the Structured Credit Investment derives its rights from the
intermediary bank.  Because the
intermediary bank does not guarantee a loan participation in any way, a loan
participation is subject to the credit risks generally associated with the
underlying borrower.  In the event of the
bankruptcy or insolvency of the borrower, a loan participation may be subject
to certain defenses that can be asserted by such borrower as a result of
improper conduct by the intermediary bank. 
In addition, in the event the underlying borrower fails to pay principal
and interest when due, the Fund or the Structured Credit Investment may be
subject to delays, expenses and risks that are greater than those that would
have been involved if the Fund or the Structured Credit Investment had
purchased a direct obligation of such borrower. 
Under the terms of a loan participation, the Fund and the Structured
Credit Investment may be regarded as a creditor of the intermediary bank,
(rather than of the underlying borrower), so that the Fund and the Structured
Credit Investment may also be subject to the risk that the intermediary bank
may become insolvent.
Loan assignments are investments in assignments of
all or a portion of certain loans from third parties.  When the Fund or the Structured Credit
Investment purchases assignments from lenders, 
13 

it will acquire direct rights against the borrower
on the loan.  Since assignments are
arranged through private negotiations between potential assignees and
assignors, however, the rights and obligations acquired by the Fund and the
Structured Credit Investment may differ from, and be more limited than, those
held by the assigning lender.  Loan
participations and assignments may be illiquid investments, which are subject
to the risk described above.
Fixed-Income
Securities.  The Fund and Structured Credit Managers may
invest in fixed-income securities, which are obligations of the issuer to make
payments of principal and/or interest on future dates, and include, among other
securities:  bonds, notes, and debentures
issued by corporations; debt securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S.
Government or one of its agencies or instrumentalities or by a foreign
government; municipal securities; and mortgage-backed and asset-backed
securities.  These securities may pay
fixed, variable, or floating rates of interest, and may include zero coupon
obligations.  Fixed-income securities are
subject to the risk of the issuer’s inability to meet principal and interest
payments on its obligations (i.e., credit risk) and are subject to price
volatility due to such factors as interest rate sensitivity, market perception
of the creditworthiness of the issuer, and general market liquidity (i.e.,
market risk).
The Fund and Structured
Credit Managers may invest in both investment grade and non-investment grade
debt securities.  Investment grade debt
securities are securities that have received a rating from at least one
nationally recognized statistical rating organization (“NRSRO”) in one of the
four highest rating categories or, if not rated by any NRSRO, have been
determined to be of comparable quality. 
Non-investment grade debt securities (commonly referred to as “junk
bonds”) are securities that have received a rating from a NRSRO of below
investment grade or have been given no rating, and are considered by the NRSRO
to be predominantly speculative with respect to the issuer’s capacity to pay
interest and repay principal. 
Non-investment grade debt securities in the lowest rating categories may
involve a substantial risk of default or may be in default.  Non-investment grade debt securities
generally offer a higher yield than available from investment grade issues, but
involve greater risk.  The returns of
non-investment grade debt securities are also subject to:  (i) adverse changes in general economic
conditions; (ii) changes in the financial condition of their issuers; (iii)
changes in interest rates; and (iv) changes in market liquidity.  During periods of economic downturns or
rising interest rates, issuers of securities rated below investment grade or
comparable unrated securities may experience financial stress that could
adversely affect their ability to make payments of principal and interest and
increase the possibility of default.  In
addition, the market for lower grade debt securities may be thinner and less
active than for higher grade debt securities. 
Non-investment grade debt securities have historically experienced
greater default rates than investment grade securities.
Non-U.S. Investments.  It is expected that the Fund and the Structured Credit Investments may
invest in securities of non-U.S. companies and foreign countries.  Investing in these securities involves
certain considerations not usually associated with investing in securities of
U.S. companies or the U.S. Government, including political and economic
considerations, such as greater risks of expropriation and nationalization,
confiscatory taxation, the potential difficulty of repatriating funds, general
social, political and economic instability and adverse diplomatic developments;
the possibility of imposition of withholding or other taxes on dividends,
interest, capital gain or other income (see Item 10.4); the small size of the
securities markets in such countries and the low volume of trading, resulting
in potential lack of liquidity and in price volatility; fluctuations in the
rate of exchange between currencies and costs associated with currency
conversion; and certain government policies that may restrict the Fund’s and
the Structured Credit Investments’ investment opportunities.  In addition, accounting and financial
reporting standards that prevail in foreign countries generally are not
equivalent to United States 
14 

standards and, consequently,
less information is available to investors in companies located in such
countries than is available to investors in companies located in the United
States.  Moreover, an issuer of
securities may be domiciled or may operate in a country other than the country in
whose currency the instrument is denominated, thereby increasing the
possibility of an adverse impact from currency changes.  The values and relative yields of investments
in the securities markets of different countries, and their associated risks,
are expected to change independently of each other.  There is also less regulation, generally, of
the securities markets in foreign countries than there is in the United
States.  In addition, unfavorable changes
in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect the U.S. dollar values
of securities denominated in foreign currencies or traded in non-U.S.
markets.  The Adviser and the Structured
Credit Investment collateral managers may, but are not required to, hedge
against such risk, and there is no assurance that any attempted hedge will be successful.
Special Investment Instruments
and Techniques
The Fund and the Structured Credit Investments may utilize a variety of
special investment instruments and techniques to hedge the portfolios of the
Fund and the Structured Credit Investments against various risks (such as
changes in interest rates or other factors that affect security values) or for
non-hedging purposes to pursue the Fund’s and the Structured Credit Investments’
respective investment objective.  Certain
of the special investment instruments and techniques that the Fund and the
Structured Credit Investments may use are speculative and involve a high degree
of risk, particularly in the context of non-hedging transactions.  Consistent with CFTC regulations, the Fund
has claimed an exclusion from the definition of the term “commodity pool
operator” under the Commodity Exchange Act and, therefore, is not subject to
registration or regulation as a pool operator under the Commodity Exchange Act.
Derivatives.  Derivatives are securities and other instruments the value or return of
which is based on the performance of an underlying asset, index, interest rate
or other investment.  Derivatives may be
volatile and involve various risks, depending upon the derivative and its
function in a portfolio.  Special risks
may apply to instruments that are invested in by the Fund and the Structured
Credit Investments in the future that cannot be determined at this time or
until such instruments are developed or invested in by the Fund and the
Structured Credit Investments.  Certain
swaps, options and other derivative instruments may be subject to various types
of risks, including market risk, the risk of lack of correlation, liquidity
risk, the risk of non-performance by the counterparty, including risks relating
to the financial soundness and creditworthiness of the counterparty, legal risk
and operations risk.
Hedging Transactions.  The Adviser and Structured Credit Managers may, but are not obligated
to, utilize a variety of financial instruments, such as derivatives, options,
credit default swaps, interest rate swaps, caps and floors, futures and forward
contracts to seek to hedge against declines in the values of their portfolio
positions as a result of changes in currency exchange rates, certain changes in
the relevant markets and market interest rates and other events.  Hedging transactions may also limit the
opportunity for gain if the value of the hedged portfolio positions should
increase.  It may not be possible for the
Adviser and Structured Credit Managers to hedge against a change or event at a
price sufficient to protect the Fund’s or a Structured Credit Investment’s
assets from the decline in value of the portfolio positions anticipated as a
result of such change.  In addition, it
may not be possible to hedge against certain changes or events at all.  While the Adviser and Structured Credit
Managers may enter into such transactions to seek to reduce particular risks,
unintended or unexpected events may result in a poorer overall performance for
the Fund than if the Adviser or the Structured Credit Managers had not engaged
in any such hedging transaction.  In
addition, the degree of correlation between price movements of the instruments
used in a hedging strategy and price movements in the portfolio position being 
15 

hedged may vary.  Moreover, for a variety of reasons, the
Adviser and the Structured Credit Managers may not seek to establish a perfect
correlation between such hedging instruments and the portfolio holdings being hedged.  Such imperfect correlation may prevent the
Adviser and the Structured Credit Managers from achieving the intended hedge or
expose the Fund or the Structured Credit Investments to additional risk of
loss.  Although the Adviser and the
Structured Credit Managers may have the flexibility to engage in these
transactions, they may choose not to do so.
Options and Futures.  The
Fund or a Structured Credit Manager may utilize options contracts, futures
contracts, and options on futures contracts. 
It also may use so-called “synthetic” options or other derivative
instruments written by broker-dealers or other financial intermediaries.  Options transactions may be effected on
securities exchanges or in the over-the-counter market.  When options are purchased over-the-counter,
the Fund’s or Structured Credit Investment’s portfolio bears the risk that the
counterparty that wrote the option will be unable or unwilling to perform its
obligations under the option contract. 
Such options may also be illiquid and, in such cases, the Fund or
Structured Credit Investment may have difficulty closing out its position.  Over-the-counter options purchased and sold
by the Fund or Structured Credit Investments also may include options on
baskets of specific securities.
The Fund or a Structured
Credit Investment may purchase call and put options on specific securities, and
may write and sell covered or uncovered call and put options for hedging
purposes and non-hedging purposes to pursue its investment objective.  A put option gives the purchaser of the
option the right to sell, and obligates the writer to buy, the underlying
security at a stated exercise price at any time prior to the expiration of the
option.  Similarly, a call option gives
the purchaser of the option the right to buy, and obligates the writer to sell,
the underlying security at a stated exercise price at any time prior to the
expiration of the option.  A covered call
option is a call option with respect to which the Fund or a Structured Credit
Investment owns the underlying security. 
The sale of such an option exposes the Fund or Structured Credit
Investment, during the term of the option, to possible loss of opportunity to
realize appreciation in the market price of the underlying security or to
possible continued holding of a security that might otherwise have been sold to
protect against depreciation in the market price of the security.  A covered put option is a put option with
respect to which cash or liquid securities have been placed in a segregated
account on the Fund’s or a Structured Credit Investment’s books or with the
Fund’s or Structured Credit Investment’s custodian or prime broker (or similar
arrangement) to fulfill the obligation undertaken.  The sale of such an option exposes the Fund
or a Structured Credit Investment during the term of the option to a decline in
price of the underlying security while depriving the Fund or Structured Credit
Investment of the opportunity to invest the segregated assets.
The Fund or a Structured
Credit Investment may close out a position when writing options by purchasing
an option on the same security with the same exercise price and expiration date
as the option that it has previously written on the security.  The Fund or a Structured Credit Investment
will realize a profit or loss if the amount paid to purchase an option is less
or more, as the case may be, than the amount received from the sale
thereof.  To close out a position as a
purchaser of an option, the Fund or a Structured Credit Investment would
ordinarily make a similar “closing sale transaction,” which involves
liquidating its position by selling the option previously purchased, although
the Fund or Structured Credit Investment would be entitled to exercise the
option should it deem it advantageous to do so.
The Fund or a Structured
Credit Investment may enter into stock futures contracts, interest rate futures
contracts, and currency futures contracts in U.S. domestic markets or on
exchanges located outside the United States. 
Foreign markets may offer advantages such as trading 
16 

opportunities or arbitrage
possibilities not available in the United States.  Foreign markets, however, may have greater
risk potential than domestic markets. 
For example, some foreign exchanges are principal markets so that no
common clearing facility exists and an investor may look only to the broker for
performance of the contract.  In
addition, any profits the Fund or a Structured Credit Investment might realize
in trading could be eliminated by adverse changes in the exchange rate, or the
Fund or a Structured Credit Investment could incur losses as a result of those
changes.  Transactions on foreign
exchanges may include both commodities which are traded on domestic exchanges
and those which are not.  Unlike trading
on domestic commodity exchanges, trading on foreign commodity exchanges is not
regulated by the CFTC.
Engaging in these
transactions involves risk of loss to the Fund or a Structured Credit
Investment that could adversely affect the value of the Fund’s net assets.  No assurance can be given that a liquid
market will exist for any particular futures contract at any particular
time.  Many futures exchanges and boards
of trade limit the amount of fluctuation permitted in futures contract prices
during a single trading day.  Once the
daily limit has been reached in a particular contract, no trades may be made
that day at a price beyond that limit or trading may be suspended for specified
periods during the trading day.  Futures
contract prices could move to the limit for several consecutive trading days
with little or no trading, thereby preventing prompt liquidation of futures
positions and potentially subjecting the Fund or a Structured Credit Investment
to substantial losses, which may result in losses to the Fund.
Successful use of futures
also is subject to the ability to predict correctly movements in the direction
of the relevant market, and, to the extent the transaction is entered into for
hedging purposes, to ascertain the appropriate correlation between the
transaction being hedged and the price movements of the futures contract.
The prices of commodities
contracts and all derivative instruments, including futures and options prices,
are highly volatile.  Price movements of
forward contracts, futures contracts, and other derivative contracts in which
the Fund or a Structured Credit Investment may invest are influenced by, among
other things: interest rates; changing supply and demand relationships; trade,
fiscal, monetary, and exchange control programs and policies of governments; and
national and international political and economic events and policies.  In addition, governments from time to time
intervene, directly and by regulation, in certain markets, particularly those
for currencies and interest rate related futures and options.  Such intervention often is intended directly
to influence prices and may, together with other factors, cause all of such
markets to move rapidly in the same direction because of, among other things,
interest rate fluctuations.  The Fund or
a Structured Credit Investment also is subject to the risk of the failure of
any of the exchanges on which their positions trade or of their clearinghouses.
An interest rate future
obligates the Fund or a Structured Credit Investment to purchase or sell an
amount of a specific debt security at a future date at a specific price.  A currency future obligates the Fund or a
Structured Credit Investment to purchase or sell an amount of a specific
currency at a future date at a specific price.
Swaps.  The
Fund or a Structured Credit Investment may enter into interest rate, index,
currency rate, credit default and total return swap agreements.  These transactions are entered into in an
attempt to obtain a particular return when it is considered desirable to do so,
possibly at a lower cost than if the Fund or a Structured Credit Investment had
invested directly in the asset that yielded the desired return.  Swap agreements are two-party contracts
entered into primarily by institutional investors for periods ranging from a
few weeks to more than a year.  In a
standard swap transaction, two parties agree to exchange the returns (or
differentials in rates of return) 
17 

earned or realized on
particular predetermined investments or instruments, which may be adjusted for
an interest factor.  The gross returns to
be exchanged or “swapped” between the parties are generally calculated with
respect to a “notional amount” (i.e., the return on or increase in value of a
particular dollar amount invested at a particular interest rate, in a particular
foreign currency, or in a “basket” of securities representing a particular
index).
Interest Rate Swaps.  The
Fund or a Structured Credit Investment may enter into interest rate swaps.  Forms of swap agreements include interest
rate caps, under which, in return for a premium, one party agrees to make
payments to the other to the extent interest rates exceed a specified rate or “cap”;
interest rate floors, under which, in return for a premium, one party agrees to
make payments to the other to the extent interest rates fall below a specified
level or “floor”; and interest rate collars, under which a party sells a cap
and purchases a floor or vice versa in an attempt to protect itself against
interest rate movements exceeding given minimum or maximum levels.
Currency Swaps.  The
Fund or a Structured Credit Investment may enter into currency swaps for both
hedging and non-hedging purposes. 
Currency swaps involve the exchange of rights to make or receive
payments in specified foreign currencies. 
Since currency swaps are individually negotiated, the Fund or a
Structured Credit Investment would expect to achieve an acceptable degree of
correlation between its portfolio investments and their currency swap
positions.  Currency swaps usually
involve the delivery of the entire principal value of one designated currency
in exchange for another designated currency. 
Therefore, the entire principal value of a currency swap is subject to
the risk that the other party to the swap will default on its contractual
delivery obligations.  The use of
currency swaps is a highly specialized activity which involves special
investment techniques and risks.  If the
Adviser or a Structured Credit Manager is incorrect in its forecasts of market
values and currency exchange rates, the Fund’s or the Structured Credit
Investment’s performance will be adversely affected.  If there is a default by the other party to
such a transaction, the Fund or a Structured Credit Investment will have
contractual remedies pursuant to the agreements related to the transaction.
Total Return Swaps.  The
Fund or a Structured Credit Investment may invest in total return swaps with
appropriate counterparties.  In a total
return swap, one party pays a rate of interest in exchange for the total rate
of return on another investment.  For
example, if the Fund or a Structured Credit Investment wished to invest in a
senior loan, it could instead enter into a total return swap and receive the
total return of the senior loan, less the “funding cost,” which would be a floating
interest rate payment to the counterparty.
Certain swap agreements into
which the Fund or a Structured Credit Investment enters may require the
calculation of the obligations of the parties to the agreements on a “net
basis.”  Consequently, the Fund’s or a
Structured Credit Investment’s current obligations (or rights) under such swap
agreements generally will be equal only to the net amount to be paid or
received under the agreement based on the relative values of the positions held
by each party to the agreement (the “net amount”).  The risk of loss with respect to swaps is
limited to the net amount of interest payments that the Fund or a Structured
Credit Investment is contractually obligated to make.  If the other party to a swap defaults, the
Fund’s or the Structured Credit Investment’s risk of loss consists of the net
amount of payments that the Fund or the Structured Credit Investment
contractually is entitled to receive.
Credit Default Swaps.  The
Fund or a Structured Credit Investment may enter into credit default swaps, as
a buyer or a seller. A credit default
swap is designed to transfer the credit exposure of a fixed income
security between parties.  The buyer in a
credit default contract is obligated to pay 
18 

the seller a periodic stream
of payments over the term of the contract provided no event of default with
respect to the referenced instrument has occurred. If an event of default
occurs with respect to the referenced instrument, the seller must pay the buyer
the full notional value (“par value”) of the referenced instrument in exchange
for the referenced instrument.  If the
Fund or a Structured Credit Investment is a buyer and no event of default
occurs, the Fund or the Structured Credit Investment will have made a stream of
payments to the seller without having benefited from the default protection it
purchased.  However, if an event of
default occurs, the Fund or a Structured Credit Investment, as buyer, will
receive the full notional value of the referenced instrument that may have
little or no value following default.  As
a seller, the Fund or a Structured Credit Investment receives a fixed rate of
income throughout the term of the contract, provided there is no default.  If an event of default occurs, the Fund or a
Structured Credit Investment would be obligated to pay the notional value of
the referenced instrument in return for the receipt of the referenced
instrument.  The value of the referenced
instrument received by the Fund or a Structured Credit Investment, coupled with
the periodic payments previously received may be less than the full notional
value it pays to the buyer, resulting in a loss of value to the Fund or a
Structured Credit Investment.  Credit
default swaps involve different risks than if the Fund or a Structured Credit
Investment invests in the referenced instrument directly.
Counterparty Credit
Risk.  Many of the markets in which the Fund and the
Structured Credit Investments effect their transactions are “over-the-counter”
or “inter-dealer” markets.  The
participants in these markets are typically not subject to credit evaluation
and regulatory oversight as are members of “exchange based” markets.  To the extent the Fund or a Structured Credit
Investment invests in swaps, derivative or synthetic instruments, or other over-the-counter
transactions, it is assuming a credit risk with regard to parties with whom it
trades and may also bear the risk of settlement default.  These risks may differ materially from those
associated with transactions effected on an exchange, which generally are
backed by clearing organization guarantees, daily marking-to-market and
settlement, and segregation and minimum capital requirements applicable to
intermediaries.  Transactions entered
into directly between two counterparties generally do not benefit from such
protections.  This exposes the Fund and
the Structured Credit Investments to the risk that a counterparty will not
settle a transaction in accordance with its terms and conditions because of a dispute
over the terms of the contract (whether or not bona fide) or because of a
credit or liquidity problem, thus causing the Fund and the Structured Credit
Investments to suffer a loss.  Such
counterparty risk is accentuated in the case of contracts with longer
maturities where events may intervene to prevent settlement, or where the Fund
or the Structured Credit Investment has concentrated its transactions with a
single or small group of counterparties. 
Some Structured Credit Investments are not restricted from dealing with
any particular counterparty or from concentrating any or all of their
transactions with one counterparty.  The
ability of the Fund and the Structured Credit Investments to transact business
with any one or number of counterparties, the lack of any independent
evaluation of such counterparties’ financial capabilities and the absence of a
regulated market to facilitate settlement may increase the potential for losses
by the Fund.
Leverage; Interest Rates;
Margin.  The Fund and certain Structured Credit
Investments are permitted to borrow money and otherwise leverage their
portfolios.  The Fund and certain
Structured Credit Investments may also “leverage” by using options, swaps,
forwards and other derivative instruments. 
Although leverage presents opportunities for increasing total investment
return, it has the effect of potentially increasing losses as well.  Any event that adversely affects the value of
an investment, either directly or indirectly, by the Fund or a Structured
Credit Investment would be magnified to the extent that leverage is
employed.  The cumulative effect of the
use of leverage, directly or indirectly, in a market that moves adversely to
the investments of the entity employing the leverage would result in a loss
that would be greater than if leverage 
19 

were not employed.  Because of the relatively small intrinsic
profits in “hedge” positions or in “arbitrage” positions, the Fund and some
Structured Credit Managers may use leverage to acquire extremely large
positions in an effort to meet their rate of return objectives.  Consequently, they will be subject to major
losses in the event that market disruptions destroy the hedged nature of such
positions.  In addition, to the extent
that the Fund and the Structured Credit Investments borrow funds, the rates at
which they can borrow may affect the operating results of the Fund.  Borrowings by the Fund will be subject in
aggregate to a 300% asset coverage requirement under the 1940 Act; however,
borrowings by some Structured Credit Investments are not subject to this
requirement.
In general, the anticipated
use of short-term margin borrowings by some Structured Credit Investments
results in certain additional risks.  For
example, should the securities that are pledged to brokers to secure margin
accounts decline in value, or should brokers from which the Fund or the
Structured Credit Investments have borrowed increase their maintenance margin
requirements (i.e., reduce the percentage of a
position that can be financed), then the Structured Credit Investment could be
subject to a “margin call,” pursuant to which they must either deposit
additional funds with the broker or suffer mandatory liquidation of the pledged
securities to compensate for the decline in value.  In the event of a precipitous drop in the
value of the assets of a Structured Credit Investment, it might not be able to
liquidate assets quickly enough to pay off the margin debt and might suffer
mandatory liquidation of positions in a declining market at relatively low
prices, thereby incurring substantial losses. 
For these reasons, the use of borrowings for investment purposes is
considered a speculative investment practice. 
See “Risk Factors—General Considerations—Borrowings” for information
concerning borrowing by the Fund and the Structured Credit Investments.
Money Market Instruments.  The
Fund may invest during periods of adverse market or economic conditions for
defensive purposes some or all of their assets in high quality money market
instruments and other short-term obligations, money market mutual funds or
repurchase agreements with banks or broker-dealers or may hold cash or cash
equivalents in such amounts as the Fund’s Adviser deems appropriate under the
circumstances.  The Fund also may invest
in these instruments for liquidity purposes pending allocation of their
respective offering proceeds and other circumstances.  Money market instruments are high quality,
short-term fixed-income obligations, which generally have remaining maturities
of one year or less, and may include U.S. Government securities, commercial
paper, certificates of deposit and bankers’ acceptances issued by domestic
branches of United States banks that are members of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation, and repurchase agreements.
Repurchase Agreements. 
Repurchase agreements are agreements under which the Fund purchases
securities from a bank that is a member of the Federal Reserve System, a
foreign bank or a securities dealer that agrees to repurchase the securities
from the Fund at a higher price on a designated future date.  If the seller under a repurchase agreement
becomes insolvent or otherwise fails to repurchase the securities, the Fund
would have the right to sell the securities. 
This right, however, may be restricted, or the value of the securities
may decline before the securities can be liquidated.  In the event of the commencement of
bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings with respect to the seller of the
securities before the repurchase of the securities under a repurchase agreement
is accomplished, the Fund might encounter a delay and incur costs, including a
decline in the value of the securities, before being able to sell the
securities.  Repurchase agreements that
are subject to foreign law may not enjoy protections comparable to those
provided to certain repurchase agreements under U.S. bankruptcy law, and they
therefore may involve greater risks.
20 

Distressed Credits.  A
Structured Credit Manager may invest in securities of domestic and foreign
issuers in weak financial condition, experiencing poor operating results,
having substantial capital needs or negative net worth, facing special
competitive or product obsolescence problems, or that are involved in
bankruptcy or reorganization proceedings. 
Investments of this type may involve substantial financial and business
risks that can result in substantial or at times even total losses.  Among the risks inherent in investments in
troubled entities is the fact that it frequently may be difficult to obtain
information as to the true condition of such issuers.  Such investments also may be adversely
affected by state and federal laws relating to, among other things, fraudulent
transfers and other voidable transfers or payments, lender liability, and the
power of the Bankruptcy Court to disallow, reduce, subordinate, or
disenfranchise particular claims.  The
market prices of such securities are also subject to abrupt and erratic market
movements and above-average price volatility, and the spread between the bid
and asked prices of such securities may be greater than those prevailing in
other securities markets.  It may take a
number of years for the market price of such securities to reflect their
intrinsic value.  In liquidation (both in
and out of bankruptcy) and other forms of corporate reorganization, there
exists the risk that the reorganization either will be unsuccessful (due to,
for example, failure to obtain requisite approvals), will be delayed (for
example, until various liabilities, actual or contingent, have been satisfied),
or will result in a distribution of cash or a new security the value of which
will be less than the purchase price to the Structured Credit Investment of the
security in respect to which such distribution was made.
Lack of Operating History of Certain Structured Credit Investments
Certain Structured Credit Investments in which the Fund invests may be
newly formed entities that have no operating histories.  Therefore, the Adviser will not be able to
evaluate the past performance of such investment.
Limitations of Prior Performance
Whenever possible, the Adviser will evaluate the past investment
performance of Structured Credit Managers and their personnel.  However, this past investment performance may
not be indicative of the future results of an investment in the Structured
Credit Investment managed by such manager. 
Furthermore, Structured Credit Managers trading methods are dynamic and
change over time, thus a manager will not always use the same trading method in
the future that was used to compile past performance histories.
Reliance on the Adviser
The Fund’s investment program should be evaluated on the basis that
there can be no assurance that the Adviser’s assessments of Structured Credit
Investments and Structured Credit Managers, and, in turn, its assessments of
the short-term or long-term prospects of investments, will prove accurate.  Thus, the Fund may not achieve its investment
objective and the Fund’s net asset value may decrease.
21



Concentration of Investments
The Fund invests substantially all of its assets in Structured Credit
Investments.  However, various factors,
including prevailing market conditions, available investment opportunities, the
amount of investable assets, and the timing of investments, may prevent the
Adviser from investing the Fund’s assets in as many Structured Credit
Investments as the Adviser might otherwise prefer.
Also, the Adviser cannot guarantee that the Structured Credit
Investments will not be concentrated. 
Structured Credit Investments may target or concentrate their
investments in particular markets, sectors, or industries.  As a result of any such concentration of
investments, the portfolios of such Structured Credit Investments are subject
to greater volatility than if they had non-concentrated portfolios.  Those Structured Credit Investments that
concentrate in a specific industry or target a specific sector will also be
subject to the risks of that industry or sector, which may include, but not be
limited to, rapid obsolescence of technology, sensitivity to regulatory
changes, minimal barriers to entry, and sensitivity to overall market swings.
The Fund may also be subject to the risk of concentration from
individual investment decisions made by the Adviser and the various Structured
Credit Managers to invest in the same security, industry or sector, thereby
increasing the Fund’s exposure to such security, industry or sector.
For these and other reasons, the Fund could potentially be concentrated
in relatively few Structured Credit Investments, and thus the benefits of
diversification may not be realized.  One
risk of having a limited number of investments is that the aggregate returns
realized by the Investors may be substantially adversely affected by the
unfavorable performance of a small number of such investments.  The portfolio of the Fund may therefore be
subject to greater risk than the portfolio of a similar fund that does not
concentrate its investments to the same extent.
Lack of Control Over Structured Credit Investments
The Fund may have no right or power to take part in the management or
control of Structured Credit Investments and only limited rights, if any, to
vote on matters in respect of Structured Credit Investments.  To the extent the Fund’s holdings in a
Structured Credit Investment afford it no ability to vote on matters relating
to the Structured Credit Investment, the Fund will have no say in matters that
could adversely affect the Fund’s investment in the Structured Credit Investment.  Structured Credit Investments may be
permitted to distribute securities in kind to investors, including the Fund,
and any such securities may be illiquid or difficult to value.  In such circumstances, the Adviser may seek
to dispose of these securities in a manner that is in the best interests of the
Fund; however, Investors may receive in-kind distributions of such securities
in connection with the repurchase of Shares by the Fund or the liquidation of
the Fund or otherwise.
Financing Arrangements
As a general matter, the banks and dealers that provide financing to
some Structured Credit Investments have considerable discretion in setting and
changing their margin, haircut, financing, and collateral valuation policies.  Changes by banks and dealers in any of the
foregoing policies may result in large margin calls, loss of financing and
forced liquidations of positions at disadvantageous prices.  There can be no assurance that any particular
Structured Credit Investment will be able to secure or maintain adequate
financing, without which an investment in such Structured Credit Investment may
not be a viable investment.
22 

Special Risks of Multi-Tiered Investments
Structured Credit Investments in which the Fund invests generally will
not be registered as investment companies under the 1940 Act, and, therefore,
the Fund will not have the benefit of various protections afforded by the 1940
Act with respect to its investments in Structured Credit Investments.  For example, registered investment companies
are subject to various custody and safekeeping provisions designed to protect
the companies’ assets.  Structured Credit
Investments are not subject to these provisions and may be subject to a greater
risk of loss associated with a failed custody relationship, including as a
result of misconduct by a Structured Credit Manager.  When the Adviser invests the Fund’s assets
with a Structured Credit Investment, the Fund does not have custody of the
assets or control over their investment. 
Therefore, there is a risk that the Structured Credit Manager could
divert or abscond with the assets, fail to follow agreed upon investment
strategies, provide false reports of operations, or engage in other
misconduct.  The Structured Credit Managers
with whom the Adviser invests the Fund’s assets may be private and have not
registered their securities or investment advisory operations under federal or
state securities laws.  This lack of
registration, with the attendant lack of regulatory oversight, may enhance the
risk of misconduct by the Structured Credit Managers.
Although the Adviser expects to receive detailed information from each
Structured Credit Manager regarding its investment performance and investment
strategy on a regular basis, the Adviser may have limited access to the
specific underlying holdings of the Structured Credit Investment and little
ability to independently verify the information that is provided by the
Structured Credit Manager.  A Structured
Credit Manager may use proprietary investment strategies that are not fully
disclosed to the Adviser, which may involve risks under some market conditions
that are not anticipated by the Adviser. 
At any given time, the Adviser may not know the composition of a
Structured Credit Investment’s portfolio with respect to the degree of hedged
or directional positions, the extent of concentration risk or exposure to
specific markets or collateral types.  In
addition, the Adviser may not learn of significant structural changes, such as
personnel, manager withdrawals or capital growth, until after the fact.
By investing in Structured Credit Investments indirectly through the
Fund, Investors bear fees at both the Fund level and the Structured Credit
Investment level.  Performance-based fees
at the Structured Credit Investment level may create an incentive for a
Structured Credit Manager to make investments that are riskier or more
speculative than if the Structured Credit Manager had no such interest, because
the Structured Credit Manager will not bear an analogous portion of depreciation
in the value of the relevant Structured Credit Investment’s assets if the value
of the Structured Credit Investment declines.
Investors also bear a proportionate share of the other operating
expenses of the Fund (including administrative expenses) and, indirectly,
similar expenses of the Structured Credit Investments.  An Investor who meets the conditions imposed
by the Structured Credit Investments, including investment minimums that may be
considerably higher than the minimum imposed by the Fund, could invest directly
with the Structured Credit Investments and avoid paying Fund expenses.
Investment decisions of Structured Credit Managers are made
independently of each other.  As a
result, at any particular time, one Structured Credit Manager may be purchasing
securities of an issuer for a Structured Credit Investment whose securities are
being sold by another Structured Credit Manager for another Structured Credit
Investment.  In any such situations, the
Fund could indirectly incur certain transaction costs without accomplishing any
net investment result.
Since the Fund may be able to make investments in or effect withdrawals
from Structured Credit Investments only at certain times, the Fund from time to
time may have to invest a greater portion of its assets temporarily in money
market or other more liquid securities than it otherwise might wish to invest,
the Fund may not be able to withdraw its investment in a Structured Credit
Investment promptly after it 
23 

has made a decision to do so, and the Fund may have to borrow money to
enable the Fund to tender for Shares. 
This may adversely affect the Fund’s investment return.
Structured Credit Investments may be permitted to redeem their
interests in-kind.  Thus, upon the Fund’s
withdrawal of all or a portion of its interest in a Structured Credit
Investment, the Fund may receive securities that are illiquid or difficult to
value.  In these circumstances, the Fund
may seek to dispose of these securities in an appropriate manner.
The Fund may agree to indemnify certain of the Structured Credit
Investments and Structured Credit Managers from liability, damage, cost or
expense arising out of, among other things, certain acts or omissions.
The Structured Credit Investments may, at any time and without notice to
the Fund, change their investment objectives, policies or strategies.  This may adversely affect the Fund’s
allocation among investment strategies and may adversely affect the Fund’s
overall risk.
Valuations by Structured Credit Investment Managers
With
respect to certain Structured Credit Investments, in particular private
investment partnerships for which there is no trading market, the value of the
Fund’s investment may be determined in accordance with valuation information
provided by the Structured Credit Manager. 
In such cases, Structured Credit Managers typically have discretion to
determine whether market prices or quotations fairly represent the value of
particular assets held by the Structured Credit Investment, and authorization
to assign a value to such assets which differs from the market prices or
quotations for such assets.  As a result,
pricing information available to the Fund from such Structured Credit
Investments and used by the Fund for valuation purposes may not reflect market
prices or quotations for the underlying assets held by such Structured Credit
Investment.  Certain securities in which
such Structured Credit Investments invest may not have readily ascertainable
market prices.  These securities may
nevertheless generally be valued by Structured Credit Managers, even though
they will generally face a conflict of interest in valuing such securities
because the values given to the securities will affect the compensation of the
managers.
Neither
the Adviser nor the Board will be able to confirm independently the accuracy of
the valuations provided by certain of the Structured Credit Managers.  Furthermore, these valuations will typically
be estimates only, subject to revision based on the Structured Credit
Investment’s annual audit.  Such
revisions, whether increasing or decreasing the net asset value of the Fund at
the time they occur, because they relate to information available only at the
time of the revision, will not affect the amount received from the Fund by
Investors who tendered their Shares and received all of their redemption
proceeds prior to such adjustments.  As a
result, to the extent that such subsequently adjusted valuations from the
Structured Credit Managers or revisions to net asset value of a Structured
Credit Investment adversely affect the net asset value of the Fund, the
outstanding Shares will be adversely affected by prior tenders to the benefit
of Investors who tendered their Shares at a net asset value higher than the
adjusted amount.  Conversely, any increases
in the net asset value resulting from such subsequently adjusted valuations
will be entirely for the benefit of the outstanding Shares and to the detriment
of Investors who previously tendered their Shares at a net asset value lower
than the adjusted amount.  The same
principles apply to the purchase of Shares. 
New investors may be affected in a similar way.  Revisions to the gain and loss calculations
of the Fund will be an ongoing process, and no appreciation or depreciation
figure can be considered final until the annual audits of the Fund are
completed.
24 

Short-Term
and Defensive Investments
The
Fund will invest its cash reserves in high quality short-term investments.  These investments may include money market
instruments and other short-term debt obligations, money market mutual funds,
and repurchase agreements with banks and broker-dealers.  During periods of adverse market or economic
conditions, the Fund may temporarily invest all or a significant portion of its
assets in these securities or hold cash. 
This could prevent the Fund from achieving its investment objective.
Certain Tax Risks
There
are a number of tax considerations with respect to an investment in the
Fund.  Investors should be aware that
they will be taxed annually on their allocable shares of Fund income and
realized gains, if any, whether or not they receive any cash distributions.
Under
current law, for taxable years beginning on or before December 31, 2010, the
highest long-term capital gains rate applicable to individuals will be
15%.  However, the Fund and certain of
the Structured Credit Investments may engage in investment strategies that
generate substantial amounts of short-term capital gain and ordinary income
that, for individual taxpayers, will be taxable at rates that are up to twenty
percentage points higher than the more favorable long-term capital gains rate.
In
addition, an Investor’s share of certain losses and expenses of the Fund may be
subject to limitations.  In particular,
U.S. tax regulations prohibit the deduction through partnerships of amounts
which would not be deductible if paid by an individual.  These limitations may apply to certain fees
and expenses of the Fund.  Such fees and
expenses will be separately reported to Investors and, in the case of individuals
and certain trusts and estates, generally will be deductible only to the extent
that such Investor’s aggregate miscellaneous itemized deductions for the year
exceed 2% of their adjusted gross income. 
See Item 10.4.
Conflicts
of Interest
Other Activities of the
Adviser.  There may be numerous potential conflicts of
interest between the Adviser or its affiliates (referred to collectively in
this section as the “Management Parties”) on the one hand, and the Fund on the
other hand, and between the Fund and other investment pools and clients managed
by the Management Parties, including but not limited to their own accounts and
the accounts of family members (“Other Accounts”).  Certain investment opportunities may be
appropriate for the Fund and the Management Parties and for such Other
Accounts.  The Management Parties are not
obligated to share any investment opportunity with the Fund, although it and
those Other Accounts may invest in the opportunity.  There may be circumstances under which the
Management Parties will cause one or more Other Accounts to commit a larger
percentage of their assets to an investment opportunity than the percentage of
the Fund’s assets they commit to such investment.  Under some circumstances, if the Management
Parties or Other Accounts have significant investments in an investment
opportunity, regulation may restrict the Fund’s ability to participate in the
investment opportunity.  There also may
be circumstances under which the Management Parties purchase or sell an
investment for their Other Accounts and do not purchase or sell the same
investment for the Fund, or purchase or sell an investment for the Fund and do
not purchase or sell the same investment for one or more Other Accounts.  The Management Parties may have interests in
Other Accounts they manage which differ from their interests in the Fund and
may manage such Other Accounts on terms that are more favorable to them than
the terms on which they manage the Fund. 
In addition, the Management Parties may charge fees to Other Accounts
and be entitled to receive performance-based incentive allocations from Other
Accounts that are more favorable to the Management 
25 

Parties than the fees
charged to the Investors, thereby creating a financial incentive to favor such
Other Accounts.
Further, the Adviser may
enter into incentive fee arrangements with one or more investors in the SEI
Structured Credit Segregated Portfolio (the “Offshore Feeder Fund”), a
segregated portfolio of SEI Offshore Advanced Strategies Series SPC, a segregated
portfolio company established in the Cayman Islands, that acts as a feeder fund
for the Fund, whereby a portion of the increase in the net asset value of such
investor’s investment in the Offshore Feeder Fund over a given period shall be
payable to the Adviser.  This arrangement
may create an incentive for the Adviser to make investments for the Fund that
are riskier or more speculative than if the Adviser had no such interest
because the Adviser will not bear an analogous portion of depreciation in the
value of the Offshore Feeder Fund’s assets if the value of its investment in
the Fund declines.
Subject to applicable
regulatory limitations, the Fund may sell any of its investments to the
Management Parties or a client of the Management Parties, and the Fund may
purchase an investment made by the Management Parties or any such client.  In addition, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, the Management Parties, in their sole discretion, may from time
to time take an active management role in one or more companies in which the
Fund invests, directly or indirectly through the Structured Credit Investments,
which may give rise to additional conflicts of interest.  The Fund may invest in companies
or other entities in which the Management Parties (including other clients of
the Management Parties) have an investment, and the Management Parties and
other clients of the Management Parties may invest in companies or other
entities in which the Fund has made an investment.
In certain instances the
conflicts described in this section (or the resolution thereof) may have an
adverse impact on the Fund and its ability to achieve its investment
objective.  Investors will have no right
to be informed of such conflicts as they arise or to participate in the
resolution of such conflicts.
Other
Activities of Structured Credit Managers. 
Conflicts of
interest may arise from the fact that the Structured Credit Managers and their
affiliates generally will be carrying on substantial investment activities for
other clients, including other investment funds, in which the Fund will have no
interest.  The Structured Credit Managers
may have financial incentives to favor certain of such accounts over the
Structured Credit Investment.  Any of
their proprietary accounts and other customer accounts may compete with the
Structured Credit Investment for specific trades, or may hold positions
opposite to positions maintained on behalf of the Structured Credit
Investment.  The Structured Credit Manager
may give advice and recommend securities to, or buy or sell securities for, a
Structured Credit Investment in which the Fund has invested, which advice or
securities may differ from advice given to, or securities recommended or bought
or sold for, other accounts and customers even though their investment
objectives may be the same as, or similar to, those of the Fund.  Structured Credit Managers and their
principals, officers, employees, and affiliates may buy and sell securities or
other investments for their own accounts and as a result may have actual or
potential conflicts of interest with respect to investments made on behalf of
the relevant Structured Credit Investment. 
Positions may be taken by principals, officers, employees, and
affiliates of a Structured Credit Manager that are the same, different, or made
at a different time than positions taken for the relevant Structured Credit
Investment.  Structured Credit Managers
may invest, directly or indirectly, in the securities of companies affiliated
with the Management Parties or in which the Management Parties have an equity
or participation interest.  The purchase,
holding, and sale of such investments by a Structured Credit Manager may
enhance the profitability of the Management Parties’ own investments in such
companies.
26 

Conflict
in Valuation of Investments.  While pricing information generally is
available for certain securities in which the Fund or a Structured Credit
Investment may invest, pricing information for other securities in which the
Fund or the Structured Credit Investments may invest may not be available, and
reliable pricing information may at times not be available from any
source.  For purposes of calculating the
Fund’s net capital appreciation or depreciation (which includes unrealized
appreciation and depreciation), valuation decisions will be made by the Adviser
in accordance with procedures approved by the Board based upon such information
as is available to them, including information provided by Structured Credit
Managers and other sources.
Conflicting Interests of
Investors
The
Fund is likely to have a diverse range of Investors that may have conflicting
interests that stem from differences in investment preferences, tax status and
regulatory status.  The Adviser will
consider the objectives of the Fund when making decisions with respect to the
selection, structuring and sale of securities, including Structured Credit
Investments.  It is inevitable, however,
that such decisions may be more beneficial for one investor than for another
investor.
As stated above, the Adviser may enter into incentive fee arrangements
with one or more investors in the Offshore Feeder Fund. This arrangement may
create an incentive for the Adviser to make investments for the Fund that are
riskier or more speculative than if the Adviser had no such interest because
the Adviser will not bear an analogous portion of depreciation in the value of
the Offshore Feeder Fund’s assets if the value of its investment in the Fund
declines. Notwithstanding this theoretical conflict of interest, it is the
Adviser’s policy to manage each of its accounts based on such account’s
investment objectives and related restrictions and the Adviser believes that it
has designed policies and procedures that are designed to manage such conflict
in an appropriate way.
These activities and conflicts of interest are explicitly acknowledged
and consented to by each investor as a necessary condition to such investor’s
admission to the Fund.
Limits of Risk Disclosures
The above discussion covers key risks associated with an investment in
the Fund, but is not, nor is it intended to be, a complete enumeration or
explanation of all risks involved in such an investment.  Prospective investors should read this entire
registration statement and the Partnership Agreement and consult with their own
advisers before deciding whether to invest in the Fund.  An investment in the Fund should only be made
by investors who understand the nature of the investment, do not require
liquidity in the investment and can bear the economic risk of the investment.

Board of Directors
The Fund has a board of directors, currently consisting of Nina
Lesavoy, Robert A. Nesher, George Sullivan, and James M. Williams,
which supervises the conduct of the Fund’s affairs.  A majority of the Board is comprised of
persons who are not “interested persons” (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the
Fund.  Each of the directors has
substantial experience in issues relating to investment companies such as the
Fund.  The Fund’s directors and officers
are subject to removal or replacement in accordance with Delaware law and the
Fund’s Partnership Agreement.
The Adviser
SEI Investments Management Corporation, an investment adviser
registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, located at
One Freedom Valley Drive, Oaks, Pennsylvania 19456, serves as the Adviser to
the Fund.  The Adviser is responsible for
the day-to-day investment management of all of the Fund’s assets.
The
Adviser, a Delaware corporation, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of SEI
Investments Company, a financial services company (“SEI Investments”).  SEI Investments was founded in 1968, and is a
leading provider of investment solutions to banks, institutional investors,
investment advisers and insurance companies. 
The Adviser and its affiliates serve as an adviser to more than 8
investment companies, including more than 75 funds. As of April 30, 2007, the
Adviser had approximately $87.2 billion in assets under management.
The Fund will not pay the Adviser an advisory fee.  The Fund
offers shares only to Eligible Investors that have signed an investment
management agreement with the Adviser.  Investors will be responsible for
paying the fees of the Adviser directly under their individual investment
management agreement with the Adviser. Each agreement sets forth the fees to be
paid to the Adviser, which are ordinarily expressed as a percentage of the
Investor’s assets managed by the Adviser.  This fee, which is negotiated
between the investor and the Adviser, may include a performance-based fee
and/or a fixed-dollar fee for certain specified services.   A discussion regarding the basis for
the Board’s approval of the Investment Advisory Agreement between the Adviser
and the Fund will be available in the Fund’s December 31, 2007 annual report,
which will cover the period from the Fund’s commencement of operations through
December 31, 2007.
The Investment Advisory Agreement between the Adviser and the Fund
provides that the Adviser shall not be liable for any loss arising out of any
investment or for any act or omission in carrying out its duties as adviser in
the absence of willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the
performance of its duties, or reckless disregard of its obligations and
duties.  The Investment Advisory
Agreement will remain in effect for two years from its execution, and for
periods of one year thereafter, so long as the continuance is approved by the
vote of a majority of the directors who are not “interested persons” of the
Fund and by the directors or a vote of a “majority of the outstanding voting
securities” of the Fund, as such phrase is defined in the 1940 Act (a “Majority
Vote”).  A Majority Vote of Investors
means the vote, at the annual or a special meeting of Investors duly called, of
the lesser of: (i) 67% or more, measured by 
28 

capital account balances, of the Investors present, provided that the
Investors present represent more than 50% of the aggregate capital account
balances in the Fund; and (ii) more than 50%, measured by capital account
balances, of the Investors.  The
Investment Advisory Agreement may be terminated at any time, with 30 to 60 days
written notice to the Adviser, by a vote of a majority of the directors or by a
Majority Vote.  The Adviser may terminate
the Investment Advisory Agreement on 90 days written notice.  The Investment Advisory Agreement
automatically terminates in the event of an assignment.

subsidiary of SEI 
29 

Investments. 
The Administrator provides certain administrative, accounting and
investor services to the Fund.  Pursuant
to the terms of an Administration Agreement between the Fund and the
Administrator (the “Administration Agreement”), the Administrator is
responsible, under the ultimate supervision of the Board, for providing all
administrative services required in connection with the Fund’s operations,
including: (a) computing and publishing the net asset value of the Fund

SUBSCRIPTION
FOR SHARES
The
Offering
The
Fund, in the discretion of the Board, may sell Shares, at net asset value, to
new investors and may allow existing investors to purchase additional Shares in
the Fund on such days as are determined by the Board in its sole
discretion.  It is currently the Fund’s
intention to have an initial offering period for Shares and, thereafter, to
allow limited purchases of Shares only during designated subscription periods
as may be established by the Board or its designee (currently, the Adviser) and
communicated to investors.  The Board or
its designee (currently, the Adviser) will determine the amount of Shares
offered to investors during a subscription period at its discretion.  During the established subscription periods,
Shares may be purchased on a Business Day, or at such other times as the Board
may determine, at the offering price (which is net asset value).  The Fund may discontinue its offering at any
time.  The Board or its designee
(currently, the Adviser) will have the sole right to accept orders to purchase
Shares and reserves the right to reject any order in whole or in part. The Fund
will determine the maximum aggregate dollar value of subscriptions that will be
accepted from investors during a subscription period at its discretion.  In the event that the Fund receives
subscriptions in excess of the specified maximum, the Board or its designee
(currently, the Adviser) may determine in its discretion which subscriptions to
accept.  The Fund may, but will not be
obligated to, allocate subscriptions pro rata among the prospective investors.

an investor is $1,000,000.  Subsequent
investments must be at least $250,000. 
These minimums may be waived or modified by the Board from time to time
for certain investors, including officers and employees of the Adviser and its
affiliates.
Prospective
investors who have an SEI client account may authorize the Adviser to transfer
the intended subscription amount from such prospective investor’s SEI client
account to the Fund upon the admission of such investors to the Fund.  For all other prospective investors, pending investment in the Fund, intended subscription
amounts will be deposited in an escrow account maintained by the Custodian, as
escrow agent for the benefit of Investors. 
Funds held in the escrow account may be invested in high-quality,
short-term investments, and any interest earned on the funds will be paid to
Investors on the date Shares are issued. 
The full subscription amount is payable in federal funds, which must be
received by the Placement Agent not later than the third Business Day preceding
the date as of which the Shares are to be issued.
Each prospective investor is required to complete and
return the subscription documents, in which the investor must certify, among
other things, that he or she is an “Eligible Person” and meets other
requirements for investment.  In order
for a subscription to be accepted, the Placement Agent generally must receive
the executed subscription documents at least 10 Business Days prior to the date Shares are to be issued.
The Fund does not expect to commence investment
operations until the Fund has received a minimum aggregate subscription amount
for Shares, such amount to be determined in the Adviser’s sole discretion.
During the initial
offering period, Shares will be issued
at $100 per Share.  Thereafter, Shares
may be purchased in such amount and at such times as determined in the sole
discretion of the Board or its designee (currently, the Adviser).  After the initial offering period, Shares
will be issued at the Fund’s net
asset value per Share (rounded to the nearest hundredth of a Share).
Investors who subscribe
for additional Shares will be required to qualify as Eligible Persons at the
time of each additional subscription. 
Accordingly, each additional purchase of Shares by an Investor shall
constitute a (a) reaffirmation of all of the representations,
warranties, understandings, acknowledgements and agreements in such
Investor’s subscription agreement as if such subscription agreement was
re-executed on the date of the additional purchase of Shares of the Fund, and
(b) certification that all of the information in such Investor’s investor
suitability questionnaire and subscription agreement remains accurate and
complete as of the date of the additional purchase of Shares of the Fund.
Investor
Eligibility
Shares
in the Fund will be sold only to persons who qualify as: (i) “accredited
investors,” as defined in Regulation D under the Securities Act; and (ii)
“qualified clients,” as defined in Rule 205-3 under the Advisers Act.  In addition, in order to qualify, an investor
must have entered into an investment management agreement with the Adviser.
Such persons are referred to in this Registration Statement as “Eligible
Persons.”  Qualifications that must be
met in becoming an Investor are set out in the subscription agreement that must
be completed by each prospective investor. 
Any transferee of Shares must qualify as an Eligible Investor at the
time of transfer.
Suitability of Investment
An
investment in the Fund involves a considerable amount of risk.  It is possible that an Investor may lose some
or all of his or her investment.  Before
making an investment decision, a prospective investor should 
32 

consider,
among other things:  (i) the suitability
of the investment with respect to such investor’s investment objectives and
personal situation; and (ii) other factors, including such investor’s personal
net worth, income, age, risk tolerance, tax situation and liquidity needs.  Prospective investors should be aware of how
the Fund’s investment objective and strategies fit into their overall
investment portfolio, as the Fund is not designed to be, by itself, a
well-balanced investment for any particular investor.
Distribution Arrangements
The
Fund is sold only to clients of the Adviser that have an investment management
agreement with the Adviser, and which pay the Adviser investment management
fees pursuant to that agreement.  The
Placement Agent acts as the distributor of Shares on a best efforts basis,
subject to various conditions, pursuant to the terms of the Placement Agent Agreement.  Shares may be purchased through the Placement
Agent during designated subscription periods established by the Fund.
Neither
the Placement Agent nor any other broker-dealer is obligated to buy from the
Fund any of the Shares.  The Placement
Agent does not intend to make a market in the Shares.  To the extent consistent with applicable law,
the Fund has agreed to indemnify the Placement Agent against certain
liabilities under the Securities Act.
REPURCHASES AND TRANSFERS OF SHARES
No
Right of Redemption
The Fund is a closed-end investment company, and therefore no Investor
will have the right to require the Fund to redeem its Shares.  No public market for Shares exists, and none
is expected to develop in the future. 
Consequently, Investors generally will not be able to liquidate their
investment other than as a result of repurchases of their Shares by the Fund.
Repurchase Procedures
The Fund from time to time
may offer to repurchase outstanding Shares pursuant to written tenders by
Investors.  Repurchase offers will be
made at such times and on such terms as may be determined by the Board in its
sole discretion.  In determining whether
the Fund should repurchase Shares from Investors pursuant to written tenders,
the Board will consider the recommendations of the Adviser.  The Fund does not intend to conduct any
repurchase offers until two years after the commencement of the Fund’s
operation.  After the initial two year
period, the Adviser expects that it will recommend to the Board that the Fund
offer to repurchase Shares four times each year, as of the last Business Day of
March, June, September and December. 
However, Investors will not be permitted to tender for repurchase Shares
that were acquired less than two years prior to the effective date of the
proposed repurchase.
The Board will consider the
following factors, among others, in making its determination to repurchase
Shares:
·                  whether
any Investors have requested to tender Shares to the Fund;
·                  the
liquidity of the Fund’s assets;
·                  the
investment plans and working capital requirements of the Fund;
·                  the
relative economies of scale with respect to the size of the Fund;
33 

·                  the
history of the Fund in repurchasing Shares; and
·                  the
economic condition of the securities markets.
The Board will determine
that the Fund repurchase Shares from Investors pursuant to written tenders only
on terms the Board determines to be fair to the Fund and its Investors.  When the Board determines that the Fund will
make a repurchase offer, notice of that offer will be provided to each Investor
describing the terms of the offer and containing information that Investors
should consider in deciding whether to tender Shares for repurchase.  Investors who are deciding whether to tender
their Shares or portions thereof during the period that a repurchase offer is
open may ascertain the estimated net asset value of their Shares (which is
typically calculated once a month at the close of business on the last Business
Day of each month) from the
Administrator during the period the offer remains open.
Repurchases of Shares from
Investors by the Fund may be paid in cash or by the distribution of securities
in-kind, or partly in cash and partly in-kind. 
However, the Fund does not expect to distribute securities in-kind
except in the unlikely event that making a cash payment would result in a
material adverse effect to the Fund, or Investors not tendering Shares for
repurchase.  Any in-kind distribution of
securities may consist of unmarketable securities (valued pursuant to
procedures approved by the Board), which will be distributed to all tendering
Investors on an equal basis to the extent practicable.  Investors may be unable to liquidate such
securities in a timely manner, may incur brokerage or other transaction costs
in liquidating such securities, and may receive a lower price upon liquidation
of such securities than the value assigned to them by the Fund at the time of
distribution. The Fund does not presently intend to impose any charges in
connection with repurchases of Shares. 
However, the Fund may, at the sole discretion of the Board, impose charges
on Investors whose Shares are repurchased.
If a repurchase offer is
oversubscribed by Investors who tender Shares, the Fund will repurchase only a
pro rata portion of the Shares tendered by each Investor.
Shares will be valued for purposes of determining their repurchase
price generally 90 days after the date by which Investors must submit a
repurchase request (although the Fund may establish a shorter period from time
to time) (the “Valuation Date”).  An
Investor will thus continue to bear investment risk after such Investor’s
Shares (or a portion of its Shares) are tendered for repurchase and until the
Valuation Date.  Payment for Shares (or
portions thereof) tendered and accepted for purchase by the Fund may consist of
a non-interest-bearing, non-transferable promissory note entitling an Investor
to the payment described below.
If an Investor tenders its entire Shares in the Fund and the Fund
purchases those Shares, the Investor will be entitled to:
i) an initial payment equal to 90% of the unaudited net asset value of the Shares tendered and purchased, determined as of the Valuation Date (the “Initial Payment”), which will be paid to the Investor, unless the existence of changes in tax or other laws or regulations or unusual market conditions result in a delay, within thirty-five (35) days after the Valuation Date; andii) a contingent payment (the “Contingent Payment”) equal to the excess, if any, of (a) the net asset value of the Shares tendered and purchased as of the Valuation Date (as may or may not be adjusted based upon subsequent revisions to the net asset values of the Structured Credit Investments, if applicable) over (b) the Initial Payment, which will be payable promptly after completion of the Fund’s next annual audit (together with interest on the Contingent
Payment at a money market instrument or similar rate to be determined by the Board or the Adviser or the Board’s other designee, in each case, in such person’s absolute discretion).
34 

An Investor whose partial tender of its Shares is accepted for purchase
by the Fund will be entitled to payment of the unaudited net asset value of
such Shares determined as of the Valuation Date thirty-five (35) days after the
Valuation Date.
The Fund may make multiple
audit adjustments to repurchase payment amounts in the event that additional
relevant information becomes available following the Fund’s annual audit.  The Fund may, but is not obligated to,
provide Investors all or a portion of whose Shares are being repurchased with
evidence of the Fund’s obligation to pay for such Shares prior to the date or
dates on which payment is made.  Although
the Fund has the option to pay all or a portion of the amount owed to tendering
Investors by distributing securities, such amounts are expected to be paid
entirely in cash.
Under these procedures,
Investors will have to decide whether to tender their Shares for repurchase
without the benefit of having current information regarding the value of Shares
as of a date proximate to the Valuation Date. 
Repurchases will be effective after receipt and acceptance by the Fund
of all eligible written tenders of Shares from Investors.
An Investor who tenders for
repurchase only a portion of the Investor’s Shares will be required to maintain
a minimum account balance in the Fund as of the Valuation Date, the precise
amount of which will be established from time to time by the Board and is
currently $250,000.  The requirement to
maintain a minimum account balance when tendering a portion of an Investor’s
Shares may be waived from time to time in the sole discretion of the Board.  If an Investor tenders a portion of such
Investor’s Shares and the repurchase of that portion would cause the value of
the Investor’s remaining Shares to fall below the required minimum, the Fund
reserves the right to reduce the portion of the Shares to be purchased from the
Investor so that the required minimum is maintained.
Forced
Repurchase
The Board may: (i) cause the Fund to repurchase Shares (or portion
thereof) of an Investor or any person acquiring Shares (or portion thereof)
from or through an Investor, such repurchase being offered without the consent
of or other action by the Investor or other person; or (ii) cause an Investor
to sell all or a portion of its Shares to another Investor or person, such sale
to take place without the consent of or other action by the Investor, in each
case at the most recently calculated net asset value of such Investor’s capital
account, and for any reason deemed advisable by the Board, including but not
limited to situations in which:
·                   Shares (or a portion of the Shares) have been
transferred without the Adviser’s or the Board’s approval or the Shares (or a
portion of the Shares) has vested in any person other than by operation of law
as the result of the death, disability, dissolution, bankruptcy or incompetence
of an Investor;
·                   ownership of Shares (or a portion of the
Shares) by an Investor or other person is likely to cause the Fund to be in
violation of, or subject the Fund to additional registration or regulation
under, the securities, commodities or other laws of the United States or any
other relevant jurisdiction, or may subject the Fund or any Investor to an
undue risk of adverse tax consequence (such as the Fund no longer being taxed
as a partnership, but rather as an association taxable as a corporation) or
other fiscal or regulatory consequences;
·                   continued ownership of Shares (or a portion
of the Shares) by the Investor or other person may be harmful or injurious to
the business of the Fund, the Board or the Adviser, or prevent the Adviser from
receiving any fees in respect of the Fund or such Investor;
35 

·                   any of the representations and warranties
made by an Investor in connection with the acquisition of Shares (or a portion
of the Shares) was not true when made or has ceased to be true;
·                   the value of an Investor’s Shares is less
than an amount that the Board determines to be a minimum investment in the
Fund, or more than an amount that the Board determines to be a maximum investment
in the Fund;
·                   the investment management agreement between
the Adviser and the Investor has terminated; or
·                   it would be in the best interests of the
Fund, as determined by the Board in its sole discretion, for the Fund to
repurchase such Shares or portion thereof or to have such Shares transferred.
Transfer
of Shares
Shares are not, and will not be, traded on any securities exchange or
other market.  Shares may not be
assigned, transferred, pledged, mortgaged, hypothecated, sold or otherwise
disposed of, encumbered or conveyed (each a “Transfer”), except: (i) by
operation of law resulting from an Investor’s death, disability, dissolution,
bankruptcy or incompetence; or (ii) with the written consent of the Board or
the Adviser, which consent may be withheld in each such party’s sole discretion
and shall not be subject to challenge by any potential assignor or assignee.
Unless the Board or the Adviser consults with counsel and counsel
confirms that the Transfer will not cause the Fund to be treated as a publicly
traded partnership taxable as a corporation (which confirmation shall be
obtained at the expense of the transferor), the Board or the Adviser generally
may not consent to a Transfer of Shares unless the following conditions are
met:  (i) the transferring Investor has
been an Investor of the Fund for at least two years; (ii) the proposed Transfer
is to be made on the effective date of an offer by the Fund to repurchase
Shares; and (iii) the Transfer is (a) (1) one in which the tax basis of the Shares
in the hands of the transferee is expected to be determined, in whole or in
part, by reference to its tax basis in the hands of the transferring Investor
(e.g., gifts and contributions to family entities) and (2) to members of the
transferring Investor’s immediate family (siblings, spouse, parents or
children), or (b) a distribution from a qualified retirement plan or an
individual retirement account.
Unless otherwise waived by the Board or the Adviser in each such
party’s sole discretion, any Transfer shall be made only upon the receipt by
the Fund of an opinion of counsel (which opinion shall be obtained at the
expense of the transferor and by counsel satisfactory to the Adviser) that the
Transfer will be made pursuant to an available exemption from registration
under the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws and of an
executed, complete and satisfactory subscription agreement.  An Investor who Transfers all or any portion
of his Shares in any manner may be charged reasonable expenses, including
attorneys’ and accountants’ fees, incurred by the Fund in connection with the
Transfer.
Any transferee acquiring Shares by operation of law as a result of the
death, disability, dissolution, bankruptcy or incompetence of an Investor or
otherwise will be entitled to: (i) the allocations and distributions allocable
to the Shares so acquired; (ii) to Transfer all or any portion of the Shares in
accordance with the terms of the Partnership Agreement; and (iii) to tender all
or any portion of the Shares for repurchase by the Fund.  However, the transferee will not be entitled
to the other rights of an Investor unless and until the transferee becomes a
substituted Investor as specified in the Partnership Agreement.  If an Investor Transfers its Shares with the
approval of the Board or the Adviser, the Fund 
36 

will take all necessary actions so that each transferee or successor to
whom the Shares are transferred is admitted to the Fund as a limited partner.
In subscribing for Shares, an Investor agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless the Fund, the Board, the Adviser, each other Investor and their
affiliates against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses
(including legal or other expenses incurred in investigating or defending
against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses or any
judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement), joint or several, to which
those persons may become subject by reason of or arising from any Transfer made
by that Investor in violation of these provisions or any misrepresentation made
by that Investor in connection with any Transfer.
VOTING
The Investors shall have power to vote only:  (i) for the election of Directors, including
the filling of any vacancies in the Board of Directors, if required by the 1940
Act; (ii) for the removal of Directors to the extent and as provided in the
Partnership Agreement; (iii) with respect to any investment adviser if required
by the 1940 Act, including any exemptions therefrom; (iv) with respect to the
amendment of the Partnership Agreement, as provided in the Partnership
Agreement; and (v) with respect to such additional matters relating to the Fund
as may be required by the Partnership Agreement, the Fund’s By-Laws, the 1940
Act and on such other matters as the Board may consider necessary or desirable.
With respect to any matter, the Investors shall vote in proportion to
their capital account balances as of the record date applicable to the
consideration of such matter.  There
shall be no cumulative voting in the election of directors.  The Investors may vote in person or by proxy.
The Partnership Agreement provides that on any matter submitted to a
vote of all Investors, all Investors entitled to vote shall vote together.  There will normally be no meetings of Fund
Investors for the purpose of electing members of the Board except that, in
accordance with the 1940 Act:  (i) the
Fund will hold an Investors’ meeting for the election of members of the Board at
such time as less than a majority of the members of the Board holding office
have been elected by Investors of the Fund; and (ii) if, as a result of a
vacancy on the Board, less than two-thirds of the members of the Board holding
office have been elected by the Investors, that vacancy may be filled only by a
vote of the Investors.
CAPITAL
ACCOUNTS AND ALLOCATIONS
The Fund’s Partnership Agreement currently permits the Board to admit
Investors as members of the Fund from time to time, provided they meet certain
qualifications under federal and state securities laws.  The Fund will maintain a separate capital
account for each of its Investors.  The
opening balance of each Investor’s capital account will be such Investor’s
initial investment in (also referred to as a capital contribution to) the Fund.  Each Investor’s capital account will be
increased by additional capital contributions made by such Investor and by
allocations of net profits to such capital account, and will be decreased by
repurchases by the Fund of such Investor’s Shares (or portions thereof), by
distributions to such Investor that are not reinvested, and by allocations of
net losses to such capital account.  Each
Investor’s capital account will be subject to further adjustment as described
below.
Allocation of Net Profits and Net Losses
As of the last day of each fiscal period, the Fund shall allocate net
profits or losses for that fiscal period to the capital accounts of all
Investors, in proportion to their respective opening capital account balances
for such fiscal period (after taking into account any capital contributions
deemed to be made as of the first day of such fiscal period).
37 

Net profits or net losses for a given fiscal period are measured by the
net change in the value of the net assets of the Fund, including any net change
in unrealized appreciation or depreciation of investments and realized income
and gains or losses and accrued expenses over such fiscal period, after giving
effect to any contributions made as of the first day of the fiscal period and
before giving effect to any distributions and repurchases of Shares (or
portions thereof) by the Fund as of the end of such fiscal period.
Allocation
of Organizational Expenses
The Fund will pay all organizational expenses of the Fund.  Organizational expenses are not currently
deductible, but may be amortized for tax purposes by the Fund over a period of
not less than 15 years.  Syndication
expenses are neither deductible nor amortizable.
Tax
Obligations
Withholding taxes or other tax obligations incurred by the Fund that
are attributable to any Investor will be debited against the capital account of
that Investor as of the close of the fiscal period during which the Fund paid
those obligations, thereby reducing the amount distributable  to the Investor.  If the amount of those taxes is greater than
the distributable amounts, then the Investor or its successor will be required
to pay upon demand to the Fund, as a contribution to the capital of the Fund,
the amount of the excess.
Distributions
The Board, in its sole discretion, may authorize the Fund to make
distributions in cash or in kind at any time to all Investors on a pro rata
basis in accordance with each Investor’s capital account balance.  It is expected, however, that the Fund will
not regularly make any distributions to Investors.
Reserves
Appropriate reserves may be created, accrued, and charged against net
assets and proportionately against the capital accounts of the Investors for
contingent liabilities as of the date the contingent liabilities become known
to the Fund.  Reserves will be in such
amounts (subject to increase or reduction) that the Fund may deem necessary or
appropriate.
GENERAL
INFORMATION
The Fund’s fiscal year ends on December 31.  The Fund anticipates sending to Investors an
unaudited semi-annual and an audited annual report within 60 days after the
close of the period for which the report is being made, or as otherwise
required by the 1940 Act.  Any Investor
may request from the Adviser an estimate, based on unaudited data, of the net
asset value of the Fund as of the end of any calendar month.  The Fund may also prepare and distribute
periodic unaudited reports of the Fund’s performance, as deemed appropriate by
the Adviser.
The
Fund’s tax year ends on December 31. 
After the end of each tax year of the Fund, each Investor will receive a
partnership Schedule K-1, reporting the taxable items of income, gain, loss and
deduction for the prior tax year. 
Because Schedules K-1 for Investors cannot be completed until the
Fund receives Schedules K-1 from all the Structured Credit Investments
that are structured as partnerships, if any, in which the Fund invests, the
Fund does not expect that Investors will receive a Schedule K-1
prior to April 15.  Consequently,
Investors should expect to request extensions of filing deadlines for their tax
returns.
The
Board has selected Ernst & Young LLP as the independent registered public
accounting firm of the Fund. Ernst & Young LLP’s principal business address
is 2001 Market Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19103.  Ernst & Young LLP conducts an annual
audit of the Fund’s financial statements.
The
law firm of Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP, 1701 Market Street, Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania 19103, serves as legal counsel to the Fund and the Adviser.
38



DETERMINATION
OF NET ASSET VALUE
The Fund typically computes its net asset value as of the last Business
Day of each month.  Generally, the net
asset value will be determined on such day as of the close of regular trading
on the New York Stock Exchange (the “Exchange”), although foreign exchange
rates and the value of certain securities the trading of which is substantially
completed prior to the closing of the Exchange may be computed as of an earlier
time of day.  The net asset value of the
Fund equals the value of the assets of the Fund, less all of its liabilities,
including accrued fees and expenses.
If available, CDOs and other Structured Credit Investments will be
priced based upon valuations provided by independent, third-party pricing
agents.  Such values generally reflect
the last reported sales price if the security is actively traded.  The third-party pricing agents may also value
Structured Credit Investments at an evaluated bid price by employing methodologies
that utilize actual market transactions, broker-supplied valuations, or other
methodologies designed to identify the market value for such securities.  Such methodologies generally consider such
factors as security prices, yields, maturities, call features, ratings and
developments relating to specific securities in arriving at valuations.
If a price for a CDO or other Structured Credit Investment cannot be
obtained from an independent, third-party pricing agent, the Fund shall seek to
obtain a bid price from at least one independent broker.  In such cases, it is possible that the
independent broker providing the price on the CDO or Structured Credit
Investment is also a market maker, and in many cases the only market maker,
with respect to that security.
Securities listed on a securities exchange, market or automated
quotation system for which quotations are readily available (other than
securities traded on NASDAQ) are valued at the last quoted sale price on the
primary exchange or market (foreign or domestic) on which the securities are traded,
or, if there is no such reported sale, at the most recent quoted bid
price.  The Fund values securities traded
on NASDAQ at the NASDAQ Official Closing Price. 
The prices of foreign securities are reported in local currency and
converted to U.S. dollars using currency exchange rates.  Debt obligations with remaining maturities of
sixty days or less may be valued at their amortized cost, which approximates
market value.
Securities for which market prices are not “readily available” or may
be unreliable are valued in accordance with Fair Value Procedures established
by the Board. The Fund’s Fair Value Procedures are implemented through a Fair
Value Committee (the Committee) designated by the Board.  When a security is valued in accordance with
the Fair Value Procedures, the Committee will determine the value after taking
into consideration relevant information reasonably available to the Committee.
Examples of factors the Committee may consider are: the facts giving rise to
the need to fair value, the last trade price, the performance of the market or
the issuer’s industry, the liquidity of the security, the size of the holding
in the Fund, or any other appropriate information.  The determination of a security’s fair value
price often involves the consideration of a number of subjective factors, and
is therefore subject to the unavoidable risk that the value assigned to a
security may be higher or lower than the security’s value would be if a
reliable market quotation for the security was readily available.
Certain Structured Credit Investments may be structured as private
investment partnerships.  Traditionally,
a trading market for holdings of this type does not exist.  As a general matter, the fair value of the
Fund’s interest in such a private investment fund will represent the amount
that the Fund could reasonably expect to receive from the private investment
fund if the Fund’s interest were redeemed at the time of valuation, determined
based on information reasonably available at the time the valuation is made and
that the Fund believes to be reliable. 
Unless determined otherwise in accordance with the Fund’s procedures,
the fair value of the Fund’s interest in a private investment fund shall be the
value attributed 
39 

to such interest, as of that time of valuation, as reported to the Fund
by the private investment fund’s manager, administrator or other designated
agent.  Such a valuation may be a
preliminary valuation and, therefore, may be later revised or adjusted by the
private investment fund.  Such adjustment
or revision will have no affect on the Fund’s net asset value as of any prior
valuation time.  As a practical matter,
the Adviser and the Board have little or no means of independently verifying
the valuations provided by such private investment funds.  As a result, information available to the
Fund concerning the value of such investments may not reflect market prices or
quotations for the underlying assets.  In
the unlikely event that a private investment fund does not report a value to
the Fund on a timely basis and such fund is not priced by independent pricing
agents of the Fund, the Fund would determine the fair value of the private
investment fund based on the most recent value reported by the private
investment fund, as well as any other relevant information available at the
time the Fund values its portfolio.
The Board will periodically review its valuation policies and will
update them as necessary to reflect changes in the types of securities in which
the Fund invests.
The Adviser acts as investment adviser to other clients that may invest
in securities for which no public market price exists.  The Adviser may use other acceptable methods
of valuation in these contexts that may result in differences in the value
ascribed to the same security owned by the Fund and other clients.  Consequently, the fees charged to the Fund
and other clients may be different, since the method of calculating the fees
takes the value of all assets, including assets carried at different
valuations, into consideration.
Prospective
investors should be aware that situations involving uncertainties as to the
value of portfolio positions could have an adverse effect on the net assets of
the Fund if the judgments of the Board, the Adviser or Structured Credit
Managers should prove incorrect.  Also,
Structured Credit Managers will only provide determinations of the net asset
value of Structured Credit Investments on a weekly or monthly basis, and it
will not be possible to determine the net asset value of the Fund more
frequently.
PORTFOLIO
TRANSACTIONS
It is the policy of the Fund to obtain the best results in connection
with effecting its portfolio transactions taking into account certain factors
as set forth below.  In most instances,
the Fund purchases securities of Structured Credit Investments, and such
purchases by the Fund may be, but are generally not, subject to transaction
expenses.  Nevertheless, the Fund
anticipates that its other portfolio transactions will be subject to expenses.
The Fund bears any commissions or spreads in connection with its
portfolio transactions.  In placing
orders, it is the policy of the Fund to obtain the best results taking into
account the broker-dealer’s general execution and operational facilities, the
type of transaction involved, and other factors such as the broker-dealer’s
risk in positioning the securities involved. 
While the Adviser generally seeks reasonably competitive spreads or
commissions, the Fund will not necessarily be paying the lowest spread or
commission available.  In executing
portfolio transactions and selecting brokers or dealers, the Adviser seeks to
obtain the best overall terms available for the Fund.  In assessing the best overall terms available
for any transaction, the Adviser considers factors deemed relevant, including
the breadth of the market in the security, the price of the security, the
financial condition and execution capability of the broker or dealer, and the
reasonableness of the commission, if any, both for the specific transaction and
on a continuing basis.  In evaluating the
best overall terms available, and in selecting the broker-dealer to execute a
particular transaction, the Adviser may also consider the brokerage and
research services provided (as those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)).  Consistent with any guidelines established by
the Board and Section 28(e) of the Exchange Act, the Adviser is authorized to
pay to a broker or dealer who provides such brokerage and 
40 

research services a commission for executing a portfolio transaction
for the Fund which is in excess of the amount of commission another broker or
dealer would have charged for effecting that transaction if, but only if, the
Adviser determines in good faith that such commission was reasonable in
relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such
broker or dealer, viewed in terms of that particular transaction or in terms of
the overall responsibilities of the Adviser to its discretionary clients,
including the Fund.  In addition, the
Adviser is authorized to allocate purchase and sale orders for securities to
brokers or dealers that are affiliated with the Adviser or the Fund’s principal
underwriter if the Adviser believes that the quality of the transaction and the
commission are comparable to what they would be with other qualified firms.
Structured Credit Investments
Structured Credit Investments incur
transaction expenses in the management of their portfolios, which may decrease
the value of the Fund’s investment in the Structured Credit Investments.  In view of the fact that the investment
program of certain of the Structured Credit Investments may
include trading as well as investments, short-term market considerations will
frequently be involved, and it is anticipated that the turnover rates of
certain of the Structured Credit Investments may
be substantially greater than the turnover rates of other types of investment
vehicles.  In addition, the order
execution practices of the Structured Credit Investments may
not be transparent to the Fund.  Each
Structured Credit Manager is responsible for placing orders for the execution
of its portfolio transactions and for the allocation of its brokerage.  The Adviser has no direct or indirect control
over the brokerage or portfolio trading policies employed by the Structured
Credit Managers.  Structured Credit
Investments will not necessarily pay the lowest commission available on each
transaction, and may engage in transactions with broker-dealers based on
different criteria than those that the Fund would consider.  Structured Credit Investments may not be subject to the same regulatory restrictions as
the Fund on principal and agency transactions. 
The Fund indirectly bears the commissions or spreads in connection with
the portfolio transactions of the Structured Credit Investments.
No guarantee or assurance can be made that a Structured Credit
Investment’s brokerage transaction practices will be transparent or that the Structured
Credit Investments will
establish, adhere to, or comply with its stated practices.  However, as Structured Credit Investments typically are not investment companies registered under the
1940 Act and their managers may not be registered investment advisers under the
Advisers Act, they may select brokers on a basis other than that outlined above
and may receive benefits other than research or that benefit the Structured
Credit Investments’ managers or their affiliates rather than the Structured
Credit Investments.
SUMMARY OF
THE LIMITED PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT
An Investor will be a
limited partner of the Fund, which was formed under the Delaware Revised
Uniform Limited Partnership Act (6 Del. C. §17-101, et seq.),
as from time to time amended (the “DRULPA”), pursuant to the filing of the
Certificate of Limited Partnership.  An
Investor’s rights in the Fund will be established and governed by an Agreement
of Limited Partnership (the “Partnership Agreement”), and such Investor shall
have all the rights afforded to a shareholder of an investment company under
the 1940 Act.  An Investor and his or her
advisers should carefully review the Partnership Agreement as each Investor
will agree to be bound by its terms and conditions.  The following is a summary description of
additional provisions of the Partnership Agreement that may not be described
elsewhere in this Registration Statement. 
The description of such provisions is not definitive and reference
should be made to the complete text of the Partnership Agreement.
Shares; Investors
The Board (or its designated
agent) may admit Investors to the Fund from time to time upon the completion by
a prospective investor, and the acceptance of the same by the Board (or its
designated agent), of the Fund’s Subscription Agreement.  The Subscription Agreement shall specify the
capital contribution to be made by a prospective investor.
Persons to whom Shares are
transferred in accordance with the Partnership Agreement will be Investors,
subject to such person meeting any transferability requirements.  The Shares are subject to substantial
restrictions on transferability and resale and may not be transferred or resold
except as permitted under the Partnership Agreement.  By subscribing for Shares, each Investor
agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Fund, the General Partner, the Board,
the Adviser, each other Investor and their Affiliates (as defined in the
Partnership Agreement) against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs
and expenses (including legal or other expenses incurred in investigating or
defending against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses
or any judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement), joint or several, to
which those persons may become subject by reason of or arising from any
transfer made by that Investor in violation of the provisions of the
Partnership Agreement or any misrepresentation made by that Investor in
connection with any transfer.
General
Partner and the Board of Directors
SEI Investment Strategies,
LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, is the general partner of the Fund
(the “General Partner”).  Pursuant to
Section 17-403 of the DRULPA and except as provided in the Partnership
Agreement, the General Partner has delegated the management and control of the
business and affairs of the Fund to the Board. 
As a result of the delegation of the General Partner’s duties, subject
to the provisions of the Partnership Agreement, the business and affairs of the
Fund shall be managed by the Board, and such Board shall have all powers
necessary, desirable or convenient to carry out that responsibility, including,
without limitation, the power to engage in securities or other transactions of
all kinds on behalf of the Fund. 
Further, without limiting the authority granted in the Partnership
Agreement, the Board shall have all the powers granted to a board of directors
under the 1940 Act.  The General Partner
may withdraw from the Fund at any time, in its sole discretion, by giving one
year prior written notice to the Fund.
41 

Amendments to Partnership Agreement
In general, the Partnership
Agreement may be restated and/or amended by an instrument in writing signed by
the General Partner and a majority of the Board, and if required by the
Partnership Agreement, a Majority Investor Vote (which shall have the meaning
given to the term “vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities” in
Section 2(a)(42) of the 1940 Act).
The provisions of the
Partnership Agreement (whether or not related to the rights of Investors) may
be amended at any time, so long as such amendment does not adversely affect the
rights of any Investor with respect to which such amendment is or purports to
be applicable, the Board shall have determined that such amendment is
consistent with the fair and equitable treatment of all Investors, Investor
approval is not otherwise required by the 1940 Act or other applicable law, and
so long as such amendment is not in contravention of applicable law, including
the 1940 Act, by an instrument in writing signed by the General Partner, at the
request of the Board, a majority of the then Board (or by an officer of the
Fund pursuant to the vote of a majority of the then Board), without the
approval of the Investors. Any amendment to the Partnership Agreement that
adversely affects the rights of Investors may be adopted at any time by an
instrument signed in writing by the General Partner, at the request of the
Board, by a majority of the then Board (or by any officer of the Fund pursuant
to the vote of a majority of the then Board) when authorized to do so by the
vote of the Investors holding a majority of the Shares entitled to vote.  Any such restatement and/or amendment shall
be effective immediately upon execution and approval or upon such future date
and time as may be stated therein.
Limited
Liability
The Fund is a Delaware
limited partnership pursuant to the DRULPA. 
The DRULPA provides that Investors will have limited liability with
respect to the Fund and third parties, except to the extent otherwise provided
in the Partnership Agreement.  Under the
Partnership Agreement, an Investor will not be personally liable solely by
reason of its being or having been an Investor except to the extent of its
capital account and any additional amounts that may be required to be paid as a
result of the Investor’s breach of the terms of the Partnership Agreement.
As set forth in the Partnership Agreement, to
the fullest extent that limitations on the liability of the General Partner,
the Directors and officers are permitted by the DRULPA, the General Partner,
officers and Directors shall not be responsible or liable in any event for any
act or omission of any agent, employee, Investment Adviser, Sub-Adviser or
Principal Underwriter of the Fund; with respect to the General Partner, the act
or omission of any Director or officer; or with respect to each Director and
officer, the act or omission of any General Partner, other Director or officer,
respectively.
Under the terms of the Partnership Agreement,
the Fund, out of the Fund Property, shall indemnify and hold harmless any
Person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any
proceeding (other than an action by or in the right of the Fund) by reason of
the fact that such Person is or was an agent of the Fund and arising out of or
related to such Person’s performance of his or her duties as an agent, against
expenses, judgments, fines, settlements and other amounts actually and
reasonably incurred in connection with such proceeding if such person acted in good
faith and in a manner that such person reasonably believed to be in the best
interests of the Fund and, in the case of a criminal proceeding, had no
reasonable cause to believe the conduct of such person was unlawful.  Except for the General Partner, the officers
and Directors, the Fund may indemnify any Person who was or is a party or is
threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action by
or in the right of the Fund to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the
fact that the Person is or was an agent of the Fund, against expenses actually
and reasonably incurred by that person in connection with the defense or
settlement of that action
42 

if that person acted in good faith, in a
manner that person believed to be in the best interests of the Fund.  The termination of any proceeding by
judgment, order, settlement, conviction or plea of nolo contendere or its
equivalent shall not of itself create a presumption that the person did not act
in good faith or in a manner that the person reasonably believed to be in the
best interests of the Fund or, with respect to a criminal proceeding, that the
person had reasonable cause to believe that the person’s conduct was
unlawful.  Subject to the terms of the
Partnership Agreement, there shall be no right to indemnification for any
liability to the Fund or the Investors arising by reason of willful
misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence, or the reckless disregard of the
duties involved in the conduct of the agent’s office with the Fund.
The General Partner, an officer or Director
shall be liable for his or her own willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross
negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of its
respective office, and for nothing else, and shall not be liable for errors of
judgment or mistakes of fact or law.  The
General Partner, an officer or Director shall be indemnified and held harmless
from or against any liability to the Fund or the Investors, except when such liability
arises out of his or her willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence, or
the reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person’s
office with the Fund.  The General
Partner, officers and Directors may obtain the advice of counsel or other
experts with respect to the meaning and operation of the Partnership Agreement
and their duties as General Partner, officers or Directors.  No such General Partner, officer or Director
shall be liable for any act or omission in accordance with such advice and no
inference concerning liability shall arise from a failure to follow such
advice.  The General Partner, officers
and Directors shall not be required to give any bond as such, nor any surety if
a bond is required.
The Partnership Agreement
further provides that the Board will not be liable for errors of judgment or
mistakes of fact or law.  However,
nothing in the Partnership Agreement protects a member of the Board against any
liability to which the member would otherwise be subject by reason of willful
misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties
involved in the conduct of his or her office.
Term; Dissolution; Liquidation
The Fund shall have perpetual existence and
shall continue until dissolved as set forth in the Partnership Agreement.  The Fund (or a particular Series) shall be
dissolved upon the happening of:
(i)            With
respect to the Fund, at any time by the vote of a majority of the Shares in the
Fund entitled to vote or by the Board by written notice to the Investors of the
Fund.  With respect to a particular
Series or Class, at any time by the vote of a majority of the Shares in that
Series or Class entitled to vote or by the Board by written notice to the
Investors in that Series or Class;
(ii)           With
respect to the Fund, upon the withdrawal of the General Partner, unless (a) at
such time there remains at least one (1) general partner who elects to continue
the business of the Fund; (b) the Board, by majority vote, elects to continue
the business of the Fund and appoint, effective as of the date of the General
Partner’s withdrawal, one or more additional general partners; or (c) within 90
days after the withdrawal, a majority of the Shares in the Fund entitled to
vote, elect to continue the business of the Fund and appoint, effective as of
the date of the General Partner’s withdrawal, one or more additional general
partners;
(iii)          With
respect to the Fund (or a particular Series or Class), at the time there are no
Investors of the Fund (or the particular Series or Class); provided further that
the personal representative of the last remaining Investor of the Fund (or the
particular Series or Class) or its designee or nominee shall not become an
Investor of the Fund (or such particular Series or Class);
43 

(iv)          With
respect to the Fund (or a particular Series or Class), upon the occurrence of a
dissolution event pursuant to any other provision of this Partnership
Agreement;
(v)           With
respect to any Series, including Classes of such Series, upon an event that
causes the dissolution of the Fund;
(vi)          With
respect to any Preferred Shares, in accordance with the resolutions adopted by
the Board in the establishment of such Preferred Shares; or
(vii)         With
respect to the Fund, upon the entry of a decree of judicial dissolution under
Section 17-802 of the DRULPA.  With
respect to a particular Series, including Classes of such Series, upon the
entry of a decree of judicial dissolution under Section 17-218(l) of the
DRULPA.
On dissolution of the Fund
or of any Series or Class, the Board, as liquidating trustees of the Fund,
shall (subject to Sections 17-803, 17-804 and 17-218 of the DRULPA) have full
power and authority to liquidate and distribute, in cash or in kind, the Net
Assets (as defined in the Partnership Agreement) of the Fund or of any series
or class to the Investors.  Any such
distribution shall be made solely from the assets of the Fund or a particular
Series or Class.  Following the payment
or discharge, or the making of reasonable provision for the payment or
discharge, of liabilities of the Fund or a particular Series or Class
(including contingent liabilities), and the distribution of assets of the Fund
or a particular Series or Class, the Investors shall cease to be such, and a
certificate of cancellation for the Fund or Series or Class shall be filed with
the State of Delaware.
Merger and Consolidation; Conversion
Pursuant to an agreement of
merger or consolidation, the Fund may, by vote of a majority of the Board,
merge or consolidate with or into one or more domestic limited partnerships or
“other business entities” (as that term is defined in Section 17-211 of the
DRULPA) formed or organized or existing under the laws of the State of Delaware
or any other state or the United States or any foreign country or other foreign
jurisdiction.  Any such merger or
consolidation shall not require the vote of the Investors affected thereby,
unless such vote is required by the 1940 Act, or unless such merger or
consolidation would result in an amendment of the Partnership Agreement that
would otherwise require the approval of such affected Investors, in such a
case, only such affected Investors’ approval is required.  Such
agreement of merger or consolidation may, to the extent permitted by Section
17-211(g) of the DRULPA: (i) effect any amendment to the Partnership Agreement;
(ii) effect the adoption of a new partnership agreement for the Fund if it is
the surviving or resulting limited partnership in the merger or consolidation;
or (iii) provide that the partnership agreement of any other constituent limited
partnership to the merger or consolidation (including a limited partnership
formed for the purpose of consummating the merger or consolidation) shall be
the partnership agreement of the surviving or resulting limited partnership.
The Board, by a majority vote, may, without the vote of the Investors, cause:
(i) the Fund to convert to a corporation, statutory trust or association, a
real estate investment trust, a common-law trust, a general partnership
(including a limited liability partnership) or a limited liability company,
organized, formed or created under the laws of the State of Delaware, as
permitted pursuant to Section 17-219 of the DRULPA; and (ii) in connection with
any such conversion, any outstanding Shares to be exchanged or converted into
securities of or interests in the business form into which the Fund is
converted under or pursuant to any state or federal statute to the extent
permitted by law.
Upon completion of the merger or consolidation, if the Fund is the
surviving or resulting entity, the General Partner shall file a certificate of
merger or consolidation in accordance with Section 17-211 of the DRULPA.

TAX CONSIDERATIONS
CIRCULAR
230 NOTICE.  THE FOLLOWING NOTICE IS BASED ON U.S.
TREASURY REGULATIONS GOVERNING PRACTICE BEFORE THE U.S. INTERNAL REVENUE
SERVICE: (1) ANY U.S. FEDERAL TAX ADVICE CONTAINED HEREIN IS NOT INTENDED OR
WRITTEN TO BE USED, AND CANNOT BE USED BY ANY TAXPAYER, FOR THE PURPOSE OF
AVOIDING U.S. FEDERAL TAX PENALTIES THAT MAY BE IMPOSED ON THE TAXPAYER; (2)
ANY SUCH ADVICE IS WRITTEN TO SUPPORT THE PROMOTION OR MARKETING OF THE
TRANSACTIONS DESCRIBED HEREIN; AND (3) EACH 
44 

TAXPAYER
SHOULD SEEK ADVICE BASED ON THE TAXPAYER’S PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES FROM AN
INDEPENDENT TAX ADVISOR.
This
discussion summarizes certain U.S. federal income tax considerations for
Investors who are United States persons. 
The discussion is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the “Code”), and upon judicial decisions, U.S. Treasury Regulations (“Regulations”),
Internal Revenue Service (“Service”) rulings and other administrative materials
interpreting the Code, all of which are subject to change that may or may not
be retroactive.  The discussion does not
purport to deal with all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences applicable
to the Fund, or to all categories of investors, some of whom may be subject to
special rules.  The tax consequences of
an investment in the Fund will depend not only on the nature of the Fund’s
operations and the then applicable federal tax principles, but also on certain
factual determinations which cannot be made at this time, and upon a particular
Investor’s individual circumstances.  The
Fund has not sought a ruling from the Service or any other federal, state or
local agency with respect to any tax issues affecting the Fund, nor has either
fund obtained an opinion of counsel with respect to any tax issues.
Investors
should consult their own tax advisors regarding the tax consequences to them of
an investment in the Fund in light of their particular circumstances, including
under laws of their residence or domicile and any other local, state or federal
laws.
Publicly Traded Partnership Status of the Fund
The Fund believes that it will be classified and
treated as a partnership rather than an association or publicly traded
partnership taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes.  (The Board has the authority to change this
classification, however.)
A partnership that is not an association or a publicly traded
partnership taxable as a corporation will not itself be subject to federal
income tax, but rather each investor therein will be required to take into
account for each taxable year its distributive share of items of partnership
income, gain, loss and deduction, substantially as though such items had been
realized directly by the investor and without regard to whether any
distribution by the partnership has been or will be received.
Under the Code, “publicly traded partnerships” are generally taxable as
corporations for federal income tax purposes. 
A publicly traded partnership is any partnership the interests in which
are traded on an established securities market or which are readily tradable on
a secondary market, or the substantial equivalent thereof.  Shares in the Fund will not be traded on an
established securities market. 
Regulations concerning the classification of partnerships as publicly
traded partnerships provide certain safe harbors under which interests in a
partnership will not be considered readily tradable on a secondary market, or
the substantial equivalent thereof.  It
is expected that the Fund will be eligible for one or more safe harbors set
forth in the Regulations.  It is not
anticipated that the Fund will qualify under the private placement safe harbor
set forth in the Regulations if, as is anticipated, the Fund has more than 100
Investors.
If the Fund does not technically fit within one or more of the safe
harbors, the Regulations specifically provide that the fact that a partnership
does not qualify for the safe harbors is disregarded for purposes of
determining whether interests in a partnership are readily tradable on a
secondary market, or the substantial equivalent thereof.  Rather, in this event the partnership’s
status is examined under a general facts and circumstances test set forth in
the Regulations.  The Fund believes that
under this “facts and circumstances” test, and based on the operations of the
Fund as well as the legislative history to Section 7704 and the text of the
Regulations, Shares in the Fund should not be treated as readily tradable on a 
45 

secondary market, or the substantial equivalent thereof, and,
therefore, the Fund should not be classified as a publicly traded partnership
taxable as a corporation.
If it were determined that the Fund is an association or a publicly
traded partnership taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, as
a result of a changes in the Code, the Regulations or judicial interpretations
thereof, a change in facts, or otherwise, the taxable income of the Fund would
be subject to corporate income tax when recognized by the Fund; distributions
of such income, other than in certain redemptions of Fund interests, would be
treated as dividend income when received by Investors to the extent of the Fund’s
current or accumulated earnings and profits; and Investors would not be
entitled to report profits or losses realized by the Fund.  The balance of this discussion of tax
considerations assumes that the Fund will be classified as a partnership and
not as an association or publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation.
Tax Treatment of the Fund 
Unless otherwise indicated, references in the discussion below to the
tax consequences of Fund investments, activities, income, gain and loss,
include the direct investments, activities, income, gain and loss of the Fund,
and those indirectly attributable to the Fund as a result of it being a member
of an underlying structured credit vehicle.
As an entity treated as a partnership for tax purposes, the Fund will
not itself be subject to federal income tax, but each Investor in the Fund will
be required to take into account in computing its U.S. federal income tax
liability for each taxable year its distributive share of items of Fund income,
gain, loss and deduction, substantially as though such items had been realized
directly by such Investor and without regard to whether any distribution by the
Fund has been or will be received.  The
amount of tax due, if any, with respect to gains and income of the Fund is
determined separately for each Investor. 
Following the close of the Fund’s taxable year and the receipt of
relevant tax information from the structured credit vehicle, the Fund will
provide each Investor with a Schedule K-1 indicating the Investor’s
distributive share of the Fund’s income, gain, loss and deduction.  Each Investor is responsible for keeping his
or her own records for determining such Investor’s tax basis in its Shares and
reporting any gain or loss from the disposition of such Shares.
Investors in the Fund may be subject to state, local and foreign taxes
and filing requirements in jurisdictions in which the Fund acquires interests
in structured credit vehicles and, in the case of structured credit vehicle
that are pass-through entities for these purposes (“Pass-Through Funds”), the
jurisdictions in which such structured credit vehicle directly or indirectly
invest or operate.  Investors should
consult their own tax advisors with respect to the specific federal, state,
local and non-U.S. tax consequences of the purchase and ownership of a Share in
the Fund.
Tax Allocations
Allocations of taxable income, gain, loss, deductions and credits of
the Fund will be made in accordance with the economics of the Fund as
determined in the discretion of the Adviser. 
The Adviser is authorized to interpret and apply and, if necessary, vary
the tax allocation provisions so as to comply with Code Sections 704 and 706
and applicable Regulations.  The Adviser
has the discretion to make special allocations (including allocations of
ordinary income or short-term capital gain or loss) for federal income tax
purposes to a withdrawing Investor, to the extent that there is a difference
between its capital account and its federal income tax basis (determined
without regard to any adjustments made to such “adjusted tax basis” by reason
of any transfer or assignment of such interest, including by reason of death) in
its interests.  There can be no
assurance, however, that the Service will accept the Fund’s allocations.  If the 
46 

allocation methods used by the Fund were not respected for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, an Investor could be required to recognize more or less
taxable income than the Investor was allocated.
Tax
Determinations and Elections
The Adviser is authorized to make, on behalf of the Fund, all tax
determinations and elections in its sole discretion.  Certain of these elections could result in items
of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit being treated differently for tax
and accounting purposes.  The Adviser
will decide how to report the Fund items on the tax returns of the Fund, and
all Investors are required under the Code to treat the items consistently on
their own returns, unless they file a statement with the Service disclosing the
inconsistency.
Under Section 754 of the Code, the Fund has the option to make an
election to adjust the basis of the Fund’s assets in the event of a distribution
of Fund property to an Investor, or a transfer of a Fund interest.  This optional adjustment could either
increase or decrease the value of a Fund interest to the transferee depending
on the relevant facts because the election under Section 754 would increase or
decrease the basis of the Fund’s assets for the purpose of computing the
transferee’s distributive share of Fund income, gains, deductions and
losses.  The Fund must make this
adjustment: (1) on a transfer of a Fund interest if immediately following the
transfer the adjusted tax basis of the Fund’s property exceeds its fair market
value by more than $250,000; or (2) on a distribution of property if the
adjustment results in a basis reduction of the Fund’s remaining assets of more
than $250,000.
There can be no assurance that the Advisor will make the optional
election under Code Section 754 because: (1) once made, the election cannot be
revoked without obtaining the Service’s consent; (2) the election may not be
advantageous to all Investors; and (3) accounting complexities result from
having the election in effect.
In the event the income tax return of the Fund is audited by the
Service, the tax treatment of the Fund’s income and deductions generally is
determined at the Fund level in a single proceeding rather than by individual
audits of the Investors.  The Board shall
designate a “Tax Matters Partner” of the Fund and such Tax Matters Partner
shall have considerable authority to make decisions affecting the tax treatment
and procedural rights of the Investors. 
In addition, the Tax Matters Partner shall have the authority to bind
certain Investors to settlement agreements and the right on behalf of all
Investors of the Fund to extend the statute of limitations relating to the
Investors’ tax liabilities with respect to Fund items.  In determining how to report the Fund’s tax
items on its tax returns, the Adviser will rely on certain tax determinations
made by the underlying structured credit vehicle.
Tax Consequences to a Withdrawing Investor
An Investor receiving cash from the Fund in
connection with the Investor’s complete withdrawal from the Fund will generally
recognize capital gain or loss to the extent of the difference between the
proceeds received by such Investor and such Investor’s adjusted tax basis in
its Shares.  In general, any gain or loss
realized upon a withdrawal will be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if
all of the Interest has been held as a capital asset for more than 12 months.  Otherwise, such capital gain or loss will be
short-term.  However, an Investor will
recognize ordinary income to the extent such Investor’s allocable share of “unrealized
receivables” (including any accrued but untaxed market discount) exceeds the
Investor’s share of the basis in those unrealized receivables.  An Investor receiving a cash non-liquidating
distribution (e.g., in connection with a repurchase of a portion of the
Investor’s Shares) will recognize gain and income in a similar manner but only
to the extent that the amount of the distribution exceeds such Investor’s
adjusted tax basis of its Shares.
47 

If an Investor acquires portions of his or her Shares at different
times (or acquires its entire Interest in a single transaction resulting in
different holding periods under the Code), such Investor’s Shares generally
will have a divided holding period, which could cause such Investor to
recognize more or less short-term and long-term capital gain or loss than it
would have recognized if its Shares had a single holding period.  An Investor generally determines the portion
of its Shares to which a holding period relates based on the fraction, the
numerator of which is equal to the fair market value of the portion of the
Shares received in the transaction to which the holding period relates, and the
denominator of which is the fair market value of its entire Shares (determined
immediately after the transaction).  If
an Investor’s Shares have a divided holding period, any capital gain or loss
that such Investor recognizes as a result of a distribution from the Fund will
be divided between long-term and short-term capital gain or loss in the same
proportion that the holding period is divided between the portion of the Shares
held for more than one year and the portion of the Shares held for one year or
less (as described in the previous sentence).
As indicated above, the Adviser has the discretion to make a special
allocation of income or loss for federal income tax purposes to a withdrawing
Investor to the extent there is a difference between its liquidating
distribution and its federal income tax basis in its interests.  Such an allocation may result in a
withdrawing Investor recognizing more ordinary income and less long-term
capital gain than the Investor would otherwise have recognized.
An Investor’s receipt of a distribution of property from a partnership
is generally not taxable.  However, the
tax law generally requires a partner in a partnership to recognize gain on a
distribution by the partnership of marketable securities, to the extent that the
value of such securities exceeds the partner’s adjusted basis in its
partnership interest.  This requirement
does not apply, however, to distributions to “eligible partners” of an “investment
partnership,” as those terms are defined in the Code.  The Adviser intends to operate the Fund so
that it will qualify as an “investment partnership,” although there can be no
assurance that it will be successful in this regard.  If the Fund qualifies as an investment
partnership, each Investor should qualify as an “eligible partner,” provided
that such Investor contributes only cash and certain other liquid property to
the Fund.  Special rules apply to the
distribution of property to an Investor who contributed other property to the
Fund and to the distribution of such contributed property to another
Investor.  Investors should consult their
own tax advisors regarding the tax treatment of distributions and redemption
proceeds, including the tax treatment of distributions of assets in kind.
Character
and Timing of Income 
The Fund’s income and gains, if any, may consist of ordinary income,
short-term capital gains and/or long-term capital gains.  Accordingly, Investors should not expect that
any portion of any taxable income of the Fund will necessarily consist of
long-term capital gains taxable at reduced rates, although some or all of the
taxable losses (if any) realized by the Fund in a taxable year may consist of
long-term capital losses, the deductibility of which is subject to certain
limitations.  The investment strategies
of the Fund, and Pass-Through Funds, including certain investments and hedging
transactions, may result in the Fund, and the Pass-Through Funds being subject
to special tax rules (including Code Section 988 (relating to non-U.S.
currency transactions), “short sale” rules, “straddle” rules, mixed straddle
rules, Code Section 1256 (relating generally to marking to market of certain
futures and other contracts), conversion transaction rules and Code Section
1259 (constructive sale rules)) that defer taxable losses or accelerate taxable
income, cause investors to be taxed on amounts not representing economic
income, cause adjustments in the holding periods of securities, convert
long-term capital gains into short-term capital gains or ordinary income or
convert short-term capital losses into long-term capital losses.
The Fund may indirectly gain exposure to a structured credit vehicle by
the Fund’s purchase of a structured note, swap or other contract.  As a result, the Fund could bear a greater
tax burden with respect to such instruments than it would bear if it were
investing directly in a structured credit vehicle.
48 

Alternatively, the Fund may be treated as engaging in a constructive
ownership transaction.  If the Fund has
long-term capital gain from a constructive ownership transaction, the amount of
the gain that may be treated as long-term capital gain by the Fund is limited
to the amount that the Fund would have recognized if it had been holding the
financial asset directly, rather than through a constructive ownership
transaction, with any gain in excess of this amount being treated as ordinary
income.  In addition, an interest charge
is imposed with respect to any amount recharacterized as ordinary income on the
underpayment of tax for each year that the constructive ownership was open.
Effect of Straddle Rules and Wash Sales on Investors’ Securities Positions
The Service may treat certain positions in securities held (directly or
indirectly) by an Investor and its indirect interest in similar securities held
by reason of its investment in the Fund as “straddles” for U.S. federal income
tax purposes.  The application of the “straddle”
rules in such a case could affect an Investor’s holding period for the
securities involved and may defer the recognition of losses with respect to
such securities.  Application of the “wash
sales” rules to the transactions of the Fund, or Pass-Through Funds would cause
all or a portion of any loss realized upon a taxable disposition of securities
held (directly or indirectly) by an Investor to be disallowed if substantially
identical securities are purchased within 30 days before or after the
disposition.  In such a case, the basis
of the newly-purchased securities will be adjusted to reflect the loss.
Special Considerations for Tax-Exempt Investors
Under current U.S. federal income tax law, income tax is imposed on the
unrelated business taxable income, as defined in Code Section 512 (“UBTI”) of
tax-exempt investors subject to the tax. 
In addition, a certain portion of income derived from debt-financed
property is required to be included in UBTI. 
It is expected that the Fund may use leverage.  The use of leverage may generate UBTI for
tax-exempt Investors.  Accordingly, any
such Investors are directed to consult with their tax advisors and to consider
an investment in the Fund through SEI Structured Credit Segregated Portfolio, a
segregated portfolio of SEI Offshore Advanced Strategies Series SPC, a
segregated portfolio company established in the Cayman Islands that acts as a
feeder fund for the Fund.  If UBTI is
produced by the Fund, an entity that is exempt from federal tax but is subject
to tax on its UBTI and that is a direct Investor in the Fund would be required
to report as taxable income its pro rata share of any portion of the Fund’s
income that is considered UBTI.  An
investment in the Fund may be especially inappropriate for a charitable
remainder trust because the receipt of UBTI is subject to a 100% excise tax on such trust’s UBTI for
each taxable year beginning after December 31, 2006.
Investors should consult with their own tax advisors concerning the
possible effects of UBTI on their own tax situations as well as the general tax
implications of an investment in the Fund.
Potential
Limitations on the Use of Losses and the Deductibility of Expenses
The Fund is not expected to be engaged in activities to which the “passive
activity loss” provisions of the Code would apply.  As a result, an Investor’s share of any
losses from the Fund is not expected to be subject to disallowance under the
passive activity loss limitations.  On
the other hand, an Investor that is subject to the passive activity loss
provisions is not expected to be able to offset its share of income and gain
from the Fund against any losses that are subject to the passive activity loss
limitations.  Accordingly, an Investor
subject to the passive activity loss provisions should not invest in the Fund
with the expectation of offsetting such Investor’s share of income and gain
from the Fund against losses derived from passive activities.
49 

Certain expenses of the Fund are expected to be treated as
miscellaneous itemized deductions of the Fund for U.S. federal income tax
purposes.  For U.S. federal income tax
purposes, individuals and certain trusts or estates that hold interests
(directly or through a partnership, Subchapter S corporation or grantor trust)
may deduct such expenses in a taxable year only to the extent that their
aggregate miscellaneous itemized deductions for the year exceed 2% of their
adjusted gross incomes for the year.  In
addition, in the case of individuals whose adjusted gross income exceeds a
certain inflation-adjusted threshold, the aggregate itemized deductions
allowable for the year will be reduced by the lesser of: (i) 3% of the excess
of adjusted gross income over the applicable threshold; or (ii) 80% of the
aggregate itemized deductions otherwise allowable for the taxable year
(determined after giving effect to the 2% limitation described above and any
other applicable limitations).  The U.S.
Treasury Department has issued regulations prohibiting the deduction through
partnerships of amounts which would be nondeductible if paid by an individual.  These limitations may apply to certain fees
and expenses of the Fund.  The amounts of
these fees and expenses will be separately reported to the Investors and, as
indicated above, will be deductible by an individual Investor to the extent
that the Investor’s miscellaneous deductions exceed 2% of the Investor’s
adjusted gross income, but only if the Investor itemizes deductions.  The 3% limitation on itemized deductions will
be gradually reduced until December 31, 2009, after which time it will no
longer apply.  The legislation will
expire and this limitation on deductions will return to pre-2006 levels after
December 31, 2010, unless Congress enacts tax legislation providing
otherwise.  In the unlikely event the
Fund is deemed to be a trader in securities, the 2% and 3% limitations will not
apply.
Interest on amounts borrowed to acquire or carry investment assets
(which may include all or part of an Investor’s share of the Fund’s interest
expense and/or interest on debt incurred to make an investment in the Fund) is
expected to be investment interest and therefore is expected to be deductible
only to the extent of the Investor’s investment income.
Withholding
The Fund (directly or indirectly through its
investments in other funds) may make investments in countries outside the
U.S.  It is possible that such investments
could cause some of the income or gains of the Fund to be subject to
withholding or other taxes of non-U.S. jurisdictions, especially if the Fund
were considered to be conducting a trade or business in the applicable country
through a permanent establishment.  Such
foreign taxes may be reduced or eliminated by applicable income tax
treaties.  The Fund will inform Investors
of their proportionate share of the foreign taxes paid or incurred by the Fund
that Investors will be required to include in their income.  Some Investors may not be eligible for
certain or any treaty benefits.  Subject
to certain limitations, for U.S. federal income tax purposes an Investor
(through its investment in the Fund) may be entitled to claim a credit for its
allocable share of any non-U.S. tax incurred by the Fund, including withholding
taxes, so long as such non-U.S. tax qualifies as a creditable income tax under
the applicable Regulations. 
Alternatively, an Investor may elect to deduct its share of such
non-U.S. taxes for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
“Phantom” Income from Certain
Foreign Equity Investments
Certain non-U.S. investments of Pass-Through Funds, including
investments in “controlled foreign corporations” and “passive foreign
investment companies,” may cause an Investor to recognize taxable income prior
to the Fund’s receipt of distributable proceeds, pay an interest charge on
receipts that are deemed as having been deferred or recognize ordinary income
that otherwise would have been treated as capital gain.  In addition, certain of these investments may
require Investors to file special tax forms.
50 

Investments in Passive Foreign Investment Companies
The Fund may make investments into structured credit vehicles that are
not Pass-Through Funds but are instead treated as foreign corporations for U.S.
tax purposes.  Such non-U.S. corporations
may be classified as “passive foreign investment companies” (“PFICs”).  In general, a non-U.S. corporation is
classified as a PFIC if 75% or more of its gross income constitutes “passive
income” – generally, interest, dividends, royalties, rent and similar income,
and gains on the disposition of “passive” assets (generally, those that
generate such income) – or 50% or more of its assets are held for the
production of passive income.  Under the
PFIC rules, gain attributable to a disposition of PFIC stock, as well as income
attributable to certain “excess distributions” with respect to that PFIC stock,
is allocated ratably over the shareholder’s holding period for the stock.  Gain allocated under this rule to (i) the
year in which the shareholder disposes of the PFIC stock and (ii) any year
prior to the time the non-U.S. corporation first satisfied the PFIC earnings or
asset tests, as well as income attributable to any excess distribution on PFIC
stock allocated to those years, is subject to tax (as ordinary income) at the
U.S. federal income tax rate applicable to the shareholder for the year in
which the disposition occurs. 
Disposition gain attributable to years included in the shareholder’s
holding period – other than those described in the preceding clauses (i) and
(ii) – and income attributable to excess distributions allocated to each such
other year is subject to tax (as ordinary income) at the maximum U.S. federal
income tax rate applicable to the shareholder for the year in which the income
is treated as realized, and also to an interest-like charge on the shareholder’s
“deferred” payment of this tax liability that accrues generally from the year
of deemed realization through the due date of the shareholder’s U.S. federal
income tax return for the year of the disposition or distribution.  A U.S. Investor will be treated as a U.S.
shareholder with respect to its proportionate share of any PFIC stock owned by
the Fund.  If, however, that PFIC is also
a “controlled foreign corporation” in which the U.S. Investor is a “United
States Shareholder” (as defined below), the PFIC rules generally are superseded
by the rules discussed below dealing with controlled foreign corporations.
The PFIC rules are highly technical and it is possible that a non-U.S.
corporation in which the Fund makes an investment will be classified as a
PFIC.  If the Fund does invest in a PFIC
and that company agrees to provide certain information, the Fund may elect to
treat that company as a “qualifying electing fund” (“QEF”) (or, if the Fund
does not do so, a U.S. Investor may make such election).  If the Fund makes a QEF election, such
election is applicable to all of its partners. 
A U.S. shareholder that holds stock of a non-U.S. corporation with
respect to which a QEF election has been made for the first taxable year in the
U.S. shareholder’s holding period for which the non-U.S. corporation is a PFIC
will be subject to tax currently on its proportionate share of certain earnings
and net capital gain of the non-U.S. corporation – regardless of whether that
corporation actually distributes cash or other property to the Fund- but
generally will not be subject to the tax regime described above.  Although recent tax legislation has reduced
the rate of tax imposed on certain dividends to 15%, this rate reduction does
not apply to dividends paid or deemed paid by PFICs.  Alternatively, if such PFIC stock is publicly
traded, the U.S. shareholder may treat any resulting gain or loss as ordinary
income or loss to avoid PFIC tax.  A QEF
election generally will not result in current inclusion of the PFIC’s earnings
for any year in which the PFIC has no net ordinary earnings and no net capital
gain.  As noted above, the PFIC rules
(including the rules pertaining to QEF elections) generally should not affect
tax-exempt U.S. Investors.
The Fund cannot predict with any certainty at this time whether any of
its investments may be subject to the PFIC regime, nor can it predict the
effects of any applicable elections made by a U.S. Investor.  It is possible that U.S. Investors may be
subject to tax currently under the PFIC regime on their proportionate shares of
certain earnings of a non-U.S. corporation in which the Fund holds an interest
and/or may incur penalty taxes without receiving from the Fund distributions
sufficient to satisfy any associated tax liability.
51 

Investments in Controlled Foreign Corporations
Special rules apply to United States persons who own, directly or indirectly
and applying certain attribution rules, 10% or more of the total combined
voting power of all classes of stock of a non-U.S. corporation (each, a “United
States Shareholder”) that is a “controlled foreign corporation” (“CFC”).  For this purpose, the Fund, as a U.S.
partnership, may be treated as a United States Shareholder.  Complex indirect ownership and attribution
rules apply in making these determinations. 
A non-U.S. corporation generally will be a CFC if United States
Shareholders collectively own more than 50% of the total combined voting power
or total value of the corporation’s stock on any day during any taxable year.
United States Shareholders of a CFC generally must include in their
gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes their pro rata shares of
certain earnings and profits of the CFC. 
Further, if a U.S. person sells or exchanges stock in a non-U.S.
corporation and that person is or was a United States Shareholder at any time
during the five-year period ending on the date of such sale or exchange during
which that non-U.S. corporation was a CFC, that United States person generally
will be required to treat a portion of the gain recognized upon such sale or
exchange as a dividend to the extent of the earnings and profits of the CFC
attributable to such shares. 
Accordingly, if the Fund is a United States Shareholder in a CFC, the
U.S. Investors in the Fund (1) may be required to report and pay tax currently
on their proportionate shares of the CFC’s earnings and profits attributable to
them through the Fund that are taxable to the United States Shareholders
currently under the CFC rules, and (2) may be subject to the recharacterization
rules described above.  In addition, the
sale by a taxable U.S. Investor of an interest in the Fund, may result in the
recognition by such Investor of income equal to its distributive share of the
same character of income (i.e., ordinary dividend income) that would have been
triggered if the Fund sold its interest in the CFC at fair market value.  Income of a CFC subject to income tax in a
country other than the United States at an effective rate greater than 90% if
the maximum U.S. corporate income tax rate is not taxable to a United States
Shareholder as income taxable under Subpart F of the Code if the United States
Shareholder so elects.
The rules applicable to CFCs and PFICs are complex, and the foregoing
summary of the U.S. federal income taxation of U.S. Investors owning an
indirect interest in a CFC or a FPHC is general in nature. The Fund cannot
provide any assurance that it will not make investments in CFCs or PFICs.  The CFC and PFIC rules, however, generally
should not affect tax-exempt U.S. Investors in the Fund.
U.S. Foreign Tax Credits
Subject to applicable limitations on foreign tax credits, a U.S.
Investor that is subject to U.S federal income taxation may be entitled to
elect to treat withholding and other non-U.S. taxes as foreign income taxes
eligible for credit against such Investor’s U.S. federal income tax
liability.  Similarly, each such U.S.
Investor’s share of any non-U.S. taxes which may be imposed on capital gains or
other income realized by the Fund generally should be treated as creditable
foreign income taxes.  Capital gains
realized by the Fund, however, may be considered to be from sources within the
U.S., which may effectively limit the amount of foreign tax credit allowed to a
U.S. Investor.  Other complex limitations
also may apply which may result in reductions in the amount, or the
elimination, of foreign tax credits otherwise allowable to a U.S. Investor with
respect to its share of income of the Fund. 
Because of these limitations, U.S. Investors may be unable to claim a
credit for the full amount of their proportionate shares of any non-U.S. taxes
paid by the Fund.  U.S. Investors that do
not elect to treat their shares of foreign withholding and gains taxes as
creditable generally may claim a deduction against U.S. taxable income for such
taxes.  However, since the availability
of a credit or deduction depends on the particular circumstances of each U.S.
Investor, such Investors are advised to consult their own tax advisors.
52



Certain Reporting Requirements with Respect to Non-U.S. Investments
An Investor may be subject to certain reporting requirements that may
require such Investor to file information returns with the Service with respect
to certain transfers of cash or property by the Fund to a non-U.S.
partnership.  The Investor will be
relieved of these reporting requirements if the Fund reports the transfer.  The Fund intends to report such transfers.
An Investor also may be required to report certain transfers by the
Fund to a non-U.S. corporation if, in general, such Investor’s proportionate
share of the investment held through the Fund, as well as directly or by
attribution, exceed certain thresholds. 
Under current Regulations, this reporting must be made by the Fund’s Investors
and may not be satisfied by the Fund.  In
addition, an Investor that acquires, directly or indirectly through the Fund,
10% by vote or value of the stock of a non-U.S. corporation must report certain
acquisitions or dispositions of, or proportional changes of, its interest in
the non-U.S. corporation.  It is not
expected that an Investor’s indirect interest in a Fund investment in a
non-U.S. corporation will equal 10% of the voting power of the non-U.S.
corporation by reason of the Fund’s share of such an investment.  The Fund has not committed to provide
information about the Fund’s investments that may be needed to complete any
reporting requirements.  Investors are
urged to consult with their own tax advisors with respect to these reporting
requirements.
U.S. Tax Shelter Rules
The Fund may engage in transactions or make investments that would
subject the Fund, its Investors that are obliged to file U.S. tax returns
and/or its advisers to special rules requiring such transactions or investments
by the Fund or investments in the Fund to be reported and/or otherwise
disclosed to the Service, including to the Service’s Office of Tax Shelter
Analysis (the “Tax Shelter Rules”).  A
transaction may be subject to reporting or disclosure if it is described in any
of several categories of transactions, which include, among others,
transactions that result in the incurrence of a loss or losses exceeding
certain thresholds (including foreign currency losses), that result in large
tax credits from assets held for 45 days or less that are offered under
conditions of confidentiality.  Although
the Fund does not expect to engage in transactions solely or principally for
the purpose of achieving a particular tax consequence, there can be no
assurance that the Fund will not engage in transactions that trigger the Tax
Shelter Rules.  In addition, an Investor
may have disclosure obligations with respect to its interest in the Fund if the
Investor (or the Fund in certain cases) participates in a reportable transaction.  Investors should consult
their own tax advisors about their obligation to report or disclose to the
Service information about their investment in the Fund and participation in the
Fund’s income, gain, loss or deduction with respect to transactions or
investments subject to these rules. 
In addition, pursuant to these rules, the Fund may provide to its
advisers identifying information about the Fund’s investors and their
participation in the Fund and the Fund’s income, gain, loss or deduction from
those transactions or investments, and the Fund or its advisers may disclose
this information to the Service upon its request.  Significant penalties may apply for failure
to comply with these rules.
No Tax Benefits Expected
Because it is expected that an investment in the Fund will not reduce
the cumulative tax liability of an Investor in any year as a result of tax
losses, deductions or credits, prospective Investors should not invest with the
expectation of receiving any such tax benefits.
State and Local Taxes and Filing Requirements
An Investor of the Fund may be subject to tax return filing obligations
and income, franchise and other taxes in jurisdictions in which the Fund
operates, as well as in such Investor’s own state or locality of residence or
domicile.  In addition, the Fund itself
may be subject to tax liability in certain jurisdictions in 
53 

which it operates, and an Investor may be subject to tax treatment in
such Investor’s own state or locality of residence or domicile different from
that described above with respect to its investment in the Fund.
Certain Tax Considerations for Non-U.S. Investors
It is not currently expected that the Fund will be offered to non-U.S.
investors.  An investment in the Fund by
a nonresident alien, foreign corporation, foreign partnership, foreign estate
or foreign trust may subject such non-U.S. investors to U.S. federal, state and
local income taxation on such investment and may require such non-U.S.
investors to file U.S. federal, state and local income tax returns.
Summary;
Laws Subject to Change
The preceding discussion is intended as a summary of certain U.S.
federal income tax consequences of an investment in the Fund.  Because many of these consequences will vary
from one Investor to another, the summary does not address all of the
provisions of the Code that might be applicable to a particular Investor.  Moreover, changes in applicable tax laws
after the date of this Registration Statement may alter anticipated tax consequences.  Neither the Adviser, the Fund nor any of
their counsel or consultants assume any responsibility for the tax consequences
to any Investor of an investment in the Fund.
Prospective Investors are urged to consult their own tax advisors with
specific reference to their own tax situations and potential changes in the tax
laws applicable to an investment in the Fund.
CERTAIN
ERISA CONSIDERATIONS
Persons who are fiduciaries with respect to
an employee benefit plan subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), (“ERISA Plan”) should consider, among other
things, the duties and responsibilities that ERISA imposes on such fiduciaries
before determining whether to invest in the Fund.  Also, fiduciaries of an individual retirement
account (“IRA”), a Keogh plan or other “plan” described in Section 4975(e)(1)
of the Code that is not otherwise subject to Title I of ERISA (“Tax-Qualified
Plan”), should consider, among other things, that a Tax-Qualified Plan may only
make investments that are authorized by the appropriate governing instruments.
ERISA imposes certain general and specific
responsibilities on persons who are fiduciaries with respect to an ERISA Plan,
including prudence, diversification, prohibited transactions, and other
standards.  In determining whether a
particular investment is appropriate for an ERISA Plan, Department of Labor (“DOL”)
regulations provide that a fiduciary of an ERISA Plan must give appropriate
consideration to, among other things, the role that the investment plays in the
ERISA Plan’s portfolio, taking into consideration whether the investment is
designed reasonably to further the ERISA Plan’s purposes, an examination of the
risk and return factors, the portfolio’s composition with regard to
diversification, the liquidity and current return of the total portfolio
relative to the anticipated cash flow needs of the ERISA Plan and the proposed
investment in the Fund, the potential UBTI resulting from the investment (see
Item 10.4 - “Special Considerations for Tax-Exempt Investors”), and the
projected return of the total portfolio relative to the ERISA Plan’s funding
objectives.  Before investing the assets
of an ERISA Plan in the Fund, an ERISA Plan fiduciary should determine whether
such an investment is consistent with its fiduciary responsibilities and the
foregoing regulations.  If a fiduciary
with respect to any such ERISA Plan breaches his or her responsibilities with
regard to selecting an investment or an investment course of action for such
ERISA Plan, the fiduciary may be held personally liable for losses incurred by
the ERISA Plan as a result of such breach.
Accordingly, the Board (or its designee) will
require an ERISA Plan proposing to invest in the Fund to represent that it, and
any fiduciaries responsible for the ERISA Plan’s investments, are aware of and 
54 

understand the Fund’s investment objective,
policies, and strategies, that the decision to invest plan assets in the Fund
was made with appropriate consideration of relevant investment factors with
regard to the ERISA Plan, and that the decision to invest plan assets in the
Fund is consistent with the duties and responsibilities imposed upon
fiduciaries with regard to their investment decisions under ERISA.
Any fiduciary of an ERISA Plan or
Tax-Qualified Plan (or any entity the assets of which constitute assets of any
ERISA Plan or Tax-Qualified Plan) (collectively “Plans”) should also consider
whether the investment is a prohibited transaction under ERISA and/or the
Code.  Generally, prohibited transactions
are certain transactions involving “plan assets” with persons who are “parties
in interest” as defined under ERISA or “disqualified persons” as defined under
the Code with respect to any such plan. 
These prohibited transaction provisions are complex and may prohibit a
Plan’s investment in the Fund.
With respect to the definition of “plan assets”, the DOL in its
regulations, as modified by ERISA, generally provide that when a Plan acquires
an equity interest in an entity that is neither a “publicly-offered security” nor
a security issued by an investment company registered under the 1940 Act, the
assets of such Plan include both the equity interest and an undivided interest
in each of the underlying assets of the entity, unless it is established either
that the entity is an “operating company” or that equity participation in the
entity by “benefit plan investors” is not “significant,” in each case as
defined in such regulations, as modified by section 3(42) of ERISA.
Because the Fund will be registered as an
investment company under the 1940 Act, the underlying assets of the Fund should
not be considered to be “plan assets” of any Plan investing in the Fund for
purposes of ERISA’s fiduciary rules and the prohibited transaction rules under
ERISA and the Code.
Certain prospective Plan investors may
currently maintain relationships with the Adviser or its affiliates.  Each such person may be deemed to be a party
in interest (or disqualified person) with respect to and/or a fiduciary of any
Plan to which it provides investment management, investment advisory, or other
services.  ERISA prohibits (and the Code
penalizes) the use of Plan assets for the benefit of a party in interest (or
disqualified person) and also prohibits (or penalizes) a Plan fiduciary’s use
of its position to cause the Plan to make an investment from which it or
certain third parties in which such fiduciary has an interest would receive a
fee or other consideration.  Plan
investors should consult with legal counsel to determine if participation in
the Fund is a transaction that is prohibited by ERISA and/or the Code.  Plan fiduciaries will be required to
represent that the decision to invest in the Fund was made by a fiduciary
independent of such affiliated persons, that such fiduciaries are duly
authorized to make such investment decisions, and that they have not relied on
any individualized advice or recommendation of such affiliated persons, as a
primary basis for the decision to invest in the Fund.
The provisions of ERISA and the related provisions of the Code are
subject to extensive and continuing administrative and judicial interpretation
and review.  The discussion of ERISA and
the Code contained herein are, of necessity, general and may be affected by
future publication of regulations, rulings and interpretations.  Potential investors should consult with their
legal advisors regarding the consequences under ERISA and the related
provisions of the Code of the acquisition and ownership of Shares.
Item 10.5
As of the date of filing this Registration Statement, there are no
Shares of the Fund outstanding.
Item 10.6
Not Applicable.

Item 11.  Defaults and Arrears on
Senior Securities

Item 12.  Legal Proceedings
Neither
the Fund, the Adviser nor the Placement Agent is a party to any material pending
legal proceeding, nor is any of them subject to any material proceeding
instituted, or any material proceeding known to be contemplated, by a
government authority.

Item
16.  General Information and History
Not Applicable.
Item 17.  Investment Objectives
and Policies
Part A of this Registration Statement contains basic information about
the investment objective, policies and limitations of the Fund.  This Part B supplements the discussion in
Part A of the investment objective, policies, and limitations of the Fund.
The
Fund’s stated fundamental investment policies, listed below, may not be changed
without the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities
of the Fund (the “Shares”).  As defined
by the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”), the vote of
a “majority of the outstanding voting securities” means a vote of the lesser
of:  (i) 67% of the Shares present at a
meeting at which holders of more than 50% of the outstanding Shares are present
in person or by proxy; or (ii) more than 50% of the outstanding Shares.  No other policy, including the Fund’s
investment objective, is a
1 

fundamental
investment policy of the Fund, except as expressly stated.  Within the limits of the Fund’s fundamental
investment policies, the Fund’s management has reserved freedom of action.
Except
to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act, the rules and regulations thereunder,
or interpretations, exemptions, orders, or other guidance provided by the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) or its staff, each as may be
amended, interpreted or issued from time to time, the Fund may not:
(1)                      borrow money;
(2)                      invest 25% or more of the value of its total
assets in the securities of issuers in any single industry, except that U.S.
Government securities may be purchased without limitation;
(3)                      issue senior securities;
(4)                      underwrite securities issued by other
persons;
(5)                      purchase or sell real estate and real estate
mortgage loans;
(6)                      purchase or sell commodities or commodity
contracts including futures contracts; and
(7)                      make loans to other persons.
With respect to these investment restrictions and other policies
described in this Part B or Part A (except the Fund’s fundamental investment
policies on borrowings and the issuance of senior securities), if a percentage
restriction is adhered to at the time of an investment or transaction, a later
change in percentage resulting from a change in the values of investments or
the value of the Fund’s total assets, unless otherwise stated, will not
constitute a violation of such restriction or policy.
Item 18.  Management
The Board of Directors of the Fund (the “Board”)
provides broad oversight over the operations and affairs of the Fund and has
overall responsibility to manage and control the business affairs of the Fund,
including the complete and exclusive authority to establish policies regarding
the management, conduct, and operation of the Fund’s business.  The Board exercises the same powers,
authority and responsibilities on behalf of the Fund as are customarily
exercised by the board of directors of a registered investment company
organized as a corporation.
The Directors are not required to contribute to the
capital of the Fund or to hold Shares of the Fund.  A majority of the Directors of the Board are
persons who are not “interested persons” (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the
Fund (collectively, the “Independent Directors”).  The Independent Directors perform the same
functions for the Fund as are customarily exercised by the non-interested
directors of a registered investment company organized as a corporation.
The identity of the Directors and officers of the
Fund and brief biographical information regarding each Director and officer
during the past five years is set forth below. 
The business address of each officer and Director is c/o SEI Investments
Management Corporation, One Freedom Valley Drive, Oaks, Pennsylvania

Standing Committees
Audit Committee.  The Board has formed an Audit Committee
composed of Nina Lesavoy, George J. Sullivan and James M. Williams, each an
Independent Director.  The duties and
functions of the Audit Committee include: (i) oversight of the Fund’s
accounting and financial reporting policies and practices, the Fund’s internal
controls and, as appropriate, the internal controls of certain service
providers; (ii) oversight of the quality and objectivity of the Fund’s
financial statements and the independent audit
6 

thereof; and (iii) acting as liaison between the Fund’s independent
auditors and the full Board of Directors. 
It is anticipated that the Audit Committee will meet at least once each
fiscal year.
Nominating and Compensation Committee.  The
Board has formed a Nominating and Compensation Committee composed of Nina
Lesavoy, George J. Sullivan and James M. Williams.  The Nominating and Compensation Committee is
responsible for reviewing and recommending qualified candidates to the Board in
the event that a position is vacated or created, and periodically review and
set compensation payable to the Directors of the Fund who are not directors,
officers, partners or employees of the Adviser or any entity controlling, controlled
by or under common control with the Adviser. 
The Nominating and Compensation Committee does not have specific
procedures in place to consider nominees recommended by shareholders, but would
consider such nominees if submitted in accordance with Rule 14a-8 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, in conjunction with a shareholder
meeting to consider the election of Directors. 
The Nominating and Compensation Committee will meet as is deemed necessary
or appropriate by the Committee.
Codes
of Ethics
The Fund, the Adviser and the Placement Agent have
each adopted a Code of Ethics pursuant to the requirements of the 1940
Act.  These Codes of Ethics permit
personnel subject to the Codes to invest in securities, including securities
that may be purchased or held by the Fund, subject to a number of restrictions
and controls.
Each of these Codes of Ethics is included as an
exhibit to the Fund’s Registration Statement filed with the SEC and may be
reviewed and copied at the SEC’s Public Reference Room in Washington, D.C.  You may obtain information on the operation
of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at (202) 551-8090.  These Codes of Ethics are also available on
the EDGAR database on the SEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov, and copies may
be obtained, after paying a duplicating fee, by electronic request at the
following email address: publicinfo@sec.gov, or by writing the SEC’s Public
Reference Section, Washington, D.C. 20549-0102.
Proxy Voting Policies and
Procedures
The Fund has delegated proxy voting responsibilities
to the Adviser, subject to the Board’s general oversight.  The proxy voting policies and procedures of
the Adviser are attached as Appendix B. 
Information regarding how the Fund voted proxies relating to portfolio securities
during the 12-month period ended June 30, 2008 will be available: (1) without
charge, upon request, by calling toll free, 1-800-342-5734; and (2) on the SEC’s
website at http://www.sec.gov.
Item 19.  Control Persons and
Principal Holders of Securities
None.
Item 20.  Investment Advisory and
Other Services
See the discussion contained in Item 9 of Part A of this Registration
Statement.
Item 21.  Portfolio Managers
Compensation.  The Adviser compensates each portfolio manager
for his management of the Fund.  Each
portfolio manager’s compensation consists of a fixed annual salary, plus a
discretionary annual bonus determined generally as follows.
7 

Thirty percent of each portfolio manager’s compensation is tied to the
corporate performance of SEI, as measured by the earnings per share earned for
a particular year.  This is set at the
discretion of SEI and not the Adviser. 
Seventy percent of each portfolio manager’s compensation is based upon
various performance factors, including the portfolio manager’s performance
versus a risk free rate proxy, such as the Merrill Lynch 3 Month US LIBOR Index,
over the past one, two and three years (50% weighted to one year; 25% to each
of the others).  The performance factor
is based upon a target outperformance of the Merrill Lynch 3 Month US LIBOR
Index.  Another key factor is the
portfolio managers’ team objectives, which relate to key measurements of
execution efficiency (i.e.,
equitization efficiency, hedging efficiency, trading efficiency, etc.).  A final factor is a discretionary component,
which is based upon a qualitative review of the portfolio managers and their
team.
Ownership of Fund Shares.  As of the date of this
Registration Statement, the portfolio managers did not beneficially own any
shares of the Fund.
Other Accounts.  As of June 30, 2007, in addition to the Fund,
the portfolio managers were responsible for the day-to-day management of
certain other accounts, as listed below: The accounts below do not pay performance-based advisory fees.

Conflicts
of Interests.  Each portfolio manager’s management of “other
accounts” may give rise to potential conflicts of interest in connection with
his management of the Fund’s investments, on the one hand, and the investments
of the other accounts, on the other.  The
other accounts include portions of two U.S. registered high yield mutual funds
and an Irish registered high yield fund (collectively, the “Other Accounts”).  The Other Accounts might have similar
investment objectives as the Fund or hold, purchase, or sell securities that
are eligible to be held, purchased, or sold by the Fund.  While the portfolio managers’ management of
the Other Accounts may give rise to the following potential conflicts of
interest, the Adviser does not believe that the conflicts, if any, are material
or, to the extent any such conflicts are material, the Adviser believes that it
has designed policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to manage
those conflicts in an appropriate way.
Knowledge
of the Timing and Size of Fund Trades. A potential conflict of interest may arise as a result of the
portfolio managers’ day-to-day management of the Fund.  Because of their position with the Fund, the
portfolio managers know the size, timing, and possible market impact of Fund
trades. It is theoretically possible that the portfolio managers could use this
information to the advantage of the Other Accounts and to the possible
detriment of the Fund.  However, the
Adviser has adopted policies and procedures reasonably designed to allocate
investment opportunities on a fair and equitable basis over time.
8 

Investment
Opportunities. A
potential conflict of interest may arise as a result of the portfolio managers’
management of the Fund and the Other Accounts which, in theory, may allow them
to allocate investment opportunities in a way that favors the Other Accounts
over the Fund. This conflict of interest may be exacerbated to the extent that
the Adviser or the portfolio managers receive, or expect to receive, greater
compensation from their management of the Other Accounts than the Fund.  Notwithstanding this theoretical conflict of
interest, it is the Adviser’s policy to manage each account based on its
investment objectives and related restrictions and, as discussed above, the
Adviser has adopted policies and procedures reasonably designed to allocate
investment opportunities on a fair and equitable basis over time and in a
manner consistent with each account’s investment objectives and related
restrictions. For example, while the portfolio managers may buy for an Other
Account securities that differ in identity or quantity from securities bought
for the Fund, such an approach might not be suitable for the Fund given its
investment objectives and related restrictions.
The Adviser may enter into
incentive fee arrangements with one or more investors in the SEI Structured
Credit Segregated Portfolio (the “Offshore Feeder Fund”), a segregated
portfolio of SEI Offshore Advanced Strategies Series SPC, a segregated
portfolio company established in the Cayman Islands, that acts as a feeder fund
for the Fund, whereby a portion of the increase in the net asset value of such
investor’s investment in the Offshore Feeder Fund over a given period shall be
payable to the Adviser.  This arrangement
may create an incentive for the Adviser to make investments for the Fund that
are riskier or more speculative than if the Adviser had no such interest
because the Adviser will not bear an analogous portion of depreciation in the
value of the Offshore Feeder Fund’s assets if the value of its investment in
the Fund declines.  Notwithstanding this
theoretical conflict of interest, it is the Adviser’s policy to manage each
account based on its investment objectives and related restrictions and the
Adviser believes that it has designed policies and procedures that are designed
to manage such conflict in an appropriate way.
For a further discussion
regarding the potential conflicts of interests that may arise in connection
with the Adviser’s management of the Fund, see Item 8 of Part A of this
Registration Statement.
Item 22.  Brokerage Allocation
and Other Practices
See the discussion entitled “Portfolio Transactions” in Item 10 of Part
A of this Registration Statement.
Item 23.  Tax Status
See the discussion entitled “Tax Considerations” in Item 10 of Part A
of this Registration Statement.
Item 24.  Financial Statements
The Fund will issue a complete set of financial statements on an annual
basis prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Appendix A
Ratings of Corporate Bonds
and Commercial Paper
S&P Corporate Bond
Ratings
AAA - Bonds rated AAA have the highest rating assigned by S&P.  Capacity to pay interest and repay principal
is extremely strong.
AA - Bonds rated AA have a very strong capacity to pay interest and
repay principal and differ from the higher rated issues only in small degree.
A - Bonds rated A have a strong capacity to pay interest and repay
principal, although they are somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects
of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than bonds in higher rated
categories.
BBB - Bonds rated BBB are regarded as having an adequate capacity to
pay principal and interest.  Whereas they
normally exhibit adequate protection parameters, adverse economic conditions or
changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity to pay
principal and interest for bonds in this category than for bonds in higher
rated categories.
BB, B, CCC, CC, C - Bonds rated BB, B, CCC, CC and C are regarded, on
balance, as predominantly speculative with respect to capacity to pay interest
and repay principal in accordance with the terms of the obligation.  BB indicates the lowest degree of speculation
and C the highest degree of speculation. 
While such bonds will likely have some quality and protective
characteristics, these are outweighed by large uncertainties or major risk
exposures to adverse conditions.
D - Bonds rated D are in default, and payment of interest and/or
repayment of principal is in arrears.
PLUS (+) OR MINUS (-) - The ratings above may be modified by the
addition of a plus or minus sign to show relative standing within the major
categories.
Moody’s Corporate Bond
Ratings
Aaa - Bonds rated Aaa are judged to be of the best quality.  They carry the smallest degree of investment
risk and are generally referred to as “gilt edge.”  Interest payments are protected by a large or
an exceptionally stable margin, and principal is secure.  Although the various protective elements are
likely to change, the changes that can be visualized are most unlikely to
impair the fundamentally strong position of the issuer.
Aa - Bonds rated Aa are judged to be of high quality by all
standards.  Together with the Aaa group,
they comprise what are generally known as “high grade bonds.”  They are rated lower than the best bonds
because margins of protection may not be as large as in Aaa-rated securities,
fluctuation of protective elements may be of greater amplitude, or there may be
other elements present that make the long-term risks appear somewhat larger
than in Aaa-rated securities.
A - Bonds rated A possess many favorable investment attributes and are
to be considered as upper medium grade obligations.  Factors giving security to principal and
interest are considered adequate, but elements may be present that suggest a
susceptibility to impairment sometime in the future.
Baa - Bonds which are rated Baa are considered as medium grade
obligations; i.e., they are neither highly protected nor poorly secured.  Interest payments and principal security
appear adequate for the present but certain protective elements may be lacking
or may be characteristically unreliable over any great length of
A-1 

time.  These bonds lack
outstanding investment characteristics and in fact have speculative
characteristics as well.
Ba - Bonds rated Ba are judged to have speculative elements; their
future cannot be considered as well assured. 
Often the protection of interest and principal payments may be very
moderate and thereby not well safeguarded during both good and bad times over
the future.  Uncertainty of position
characterizes bonds in this class.
B - Bonds rated B generally lack characteristics of the desirable
investment.  Assurance of interest and
principal payments or of maintenance of other terms of the contract over any
long period time may be small.
Caa - Bonds rated Caa are of poor standing.  Such issues may be in default or there may be
present elements of danger with respect to principal or interest.
Ca - Bonds rated Ca represent obligations that are speculative in a
high degree.  Such issues are often in
default or have other marked shortcomings.
C - Bonds rated C are the lowest rated class of bonds, and issues so
rated can be regarded as having extremely poor prospects of ever attaining any
real investment standing.
MODIFIERS - Moody’s may apply numerical modifiers 1, 2 and 3 in each
generic rating classification described above. 
The modifier 1 indicates that the security ranks in the higher end of
its generic rating category; the modifier 2 indicates a mid-range ranking; and
the modifier 3 indicates that the issuer ranks in the lower end of its generic
rating category.
S&P Commercial Paper
Ratings
A-1 - This highest category indicates that the degree of safety
regarding timely payment is strong. 
Those issues determined to possess extremely strong safety
characteristics are denoted with a plus sign (+).
Moody’s Commercial Paper
Ratings
Issuers rated PRIME-1 (or related supporting institutions), also known
as P-1, have a superior capacity for repayment of short-term promissory
obligations.  Prime-1 repayment capacity
will normally be evidenced by the following characteristics:
·                  Leading market positions in well-established
industries;
·                  High rates of return on funds employed;
·                  Conservative capitalization structures with
moderate reliance on debt and ample asset protection;
·                  Broad margins in earnings coverage of fixed
financial charges and high internal cash generation; and
·                  Well-established
access to a range of financial markets and assured sources of alternate
liquidity.

Appendix B
SEI
INVESTMENTS MANAGEMENT CORPORATION
Proxy
Voting Procedures
SEI Investments Management Corporation (“SIMC”) serves as investment
adviser to multiple clients, including investment companies, institutions and
individual investors.  As investment
adviser, SIMC has an obligation to vote proxies with respect to securities held
in client portfolios in the best economic interests of SIMC’s clients for which
it has proxy voting authority.  The
following Procedures are intended to ensure that proxies are voted in the best
interests of clients.
A.            Establishment of Proxy Voting
Committee
1.     SIMC shall establish a Proxy Voting Committee (the “Committee”),
comprised of representatives of SIMC’s Investment Management Shares and Legal
and/or Compliance personnel.  Currently,
the members of the Committee are as follows:
Michael Hogan
Gregory Stahl
John Diederich
Kevin McNamera
Noreen Park
Michael
Brophy
2.     The membership of the Committee may be changed at any time upon
approval of the existing members of the Committee or by the President of SIMC.
3.     The Committee shall meet as necessary to perform any of the activities
set forth below.
4.     Any action requiring approval of the Committee shall be deemed approved
upon an affirmative vote by a majority of the Committee present or represented.
5.     The Committee shall consult with counsel or other experts as it deems
appropriate to carry out its responsibilities.
B.            Approval of Proxy Voting
Guidelines
1.     The Committee shall approve Guidelines that set forth the manner in
which SIMC shall vote, or the manner in which SIMC shall determine how to vote,
with respect to various matters that may come up for shareholder vote with
respect to securities held in client accounts and for which SIMC has proxy
voting responsibility.
2.     In the event that any employee of SIMC recommends a change to SIMC’s
Guidelines, the Committee shall meet to consider the proposed change and
consider all relevant factors.  If
approved by the Committee, the change shall be accepted, and the Guidelines revised
accordingly.
B-1 

C.            Circumstances Where SIMC Will Not
Vote Proxies
1.     For accounts that engage in securities lending, SIMC believes that the
additional income derived by clients from such activities generally outweighs
the potential economic benefit of recalling securities for the purpose of
voting.  Therefore, SIMC generally will
not recall securities on loan for the sole purpose of voting proxies.
2.     In accordance with local law or business
practices, many foreign companies prevent the sales of shares that have been
voted for a certain period beginning prior to the shareholder meeting and
ending on the day following the meeting (“share blocking”). Depending on the
country in which a company is domiciled, the blocking period may begin a stated
number of days prior to the meeting (e.g., one, three or five days) or on a
date established by the company. While practices vary, in many countries the
block period can be continued for a longer period if the shareholder meeting is
adjourned and postponed to a later date. Similarly, practices vary widely as to
the ability of a shareholder to have the “block” restriction lifted early
(e.g., in some countries shares generally can be “unblocked” up to two days
prior to the meeting whereas in other countries the removal of the block
appears to be discretionary with the issuer’s transfer agent). SIMC believes
that the disadvantage of being unable to sell the stock regardless of changing
conditions generally outweighs the advantages of voting at the shareholder
meeting for routine items. Accordingly, SIMC generally will not vote those
proxies subject to “share blocking.”
D.            Conflicts of Interest
1.     SIMC has elected to retain a third party proxy voting service (the “Service”)
to vote proxies with respect to accounts for which SIMC serves as investment
adviser (and retains proxy voting authority). 
The Service shall vote proxies in accordance with the Guidelines
approved by the Committee.  SIMC reasonably
believes that the Service’s implementation of the Guidelines will result in
proxies being voted in the best economic interests of clients.  So long as the Service votes proxies in
accordance with the Guidelines, SIMC believes that there is an appropriate
presumption that the manner in which SIMC voted was not influenced by, and did
not result from, a conflict of interest.
2.     The Service makes available to SIMC, prior to voting on a proxy, its
recommendation on how to vote with respect to such proxy in light of SIMC’s
Guidelines.  SIMC retains the authority
to overrule the Service’s recommendation, and instruct the Service to vote in a
manner at variance with the Service’s recommendation.  The exercise of such right could implicate a
conflict of interest.  As a result, SIMC
may not overrule the Service’s recommendation with respect to a proxy unless
the following steps are taken:
a.     The Proxy Voting Committee shall meet to consider the proposal to
overrule the Service’s recommendation.
b.     The Proxy Voting Committee must determine whether SIMC has a conflict
of interest with respect to the issuer that is the subject of the proxy. The
Committee will use the following standards to identify issuers with which it
may have a conflict of interest.
1.     Significant Business Relationships – The Committee will determine whether SIMC or its affiliates may have
a significant business relationship with the issuer, such as, for example,
where SIMC (or an affiliate) manages a pension plan, administers
B-2 

employee benefit plans, or
provides brokerage, underwriting, insurance or banking services to the issue.  For this purpose, a “significant business
relationship” is one that: (1) represents 1% or $1,000,000 of SIMC’s or an
affiliate’s revenues for the most recent fiscal year, whichever is less, or is
reasonably expected to represent this amount for the current fiscal year; or
(2) may not directly involve revenue to SIMC or its affiliates but is otherwise
determined by the Committee to be significant to SIMC or its affiliates, such
as, for example, the following:
·      SIMC or
its affiliates lease significant office space from the company or have some
other real estate-related relationship with the issuer;
·      SIMC or
an affiliate otherwise has a significant relationship with the company such
that it might create an incentive for SIMC to vote in favor of management.
2.     Significant Personal/Family Relationships – The Committee will determine whether any
employees who are involved in the proxy voting process may have a significant
personal/family relationship with the issuer. 
For this purpose, a “significant personal/family relationship” is one
that would be reasonably likely to influence how SIMC votes proxies.  To identify any such relationships, the
Committee shall obtain information about any significant personal/family
relationship between any employee of SIMC who is involved in the proxy voting
process (e.g., IMU analysts, members of the Committee, senior management, as
applicable) and senior employees of issuers for which SIMC may vote proxies.
3.     Duties of the Proxy Committee - The Committee has a duty to make reasonable investigation of
information relating to conflicts of interest. 
For purposes of identifying conflicts, the Committee shall rely on
publicly available information about SIMC and its affiliates, information about
SIMC and its affiliates that is generally known by employees of SIMC,(1) and
other information actually known by a member of the Committee.  Absent actual knowledge, the Committee is not
required to investigate possible conflicts involving SIMC where the information
is (i) non-public, (ii) subject to information blocking procedures, or (iii)
otherwise not readily available to the Committee.  In connection with the consideration of any
proxy voting matters under this policy, each member of the Committee has a duty
to disclose to the Committee any material conflicts of interest of which the
member has actual knowledge but which have not been identified by the Committee
pursuant to these Procedures, and, if appropriate, recuse himself/herself from
the matter at issue.
c.     If SIMC determines that it has a conflict of interest, the Committee
shall determine whether the conflict is “material” to any specific proposal
included within the proxy.  If not, then
SIMC can vote the proxy as determined by the Committee. The Committee shall
determine whether a proposal is material as follows:
1.     Routine Proxy Proposals
– Proxy proposals that are “routine”shall be presumed not to involve a material
conflict of interest for SIMC, unless the Committee has actual

(1)           The
procedures provide that the Committee should be aware of information about SIMC
or its affiliates that is generally known by employees of SIMC, but it does not
extend this knowledge to information about SIMC’s affiliates that is generally
known by employees of SIMC’s affiliates (unless such information also is
generally known by SIMC’s employees).
B-3 

knowledge that a routine proposal should be
treated as material.  For this purpose, “routine”
proposals would typically include matters such as the selection of an
accountant, uncontested election of directors, meeting formalities, and
approval of an annual report/financial statements.(2)
2.     Non-Routine Proxy Proposals – Proxy proposals that are “non-routine” shall be presumed to involve
a material conflict of interest for SIMC, unless the Committee determines that
SIMC’s conflict is unrelated to the proposal in question (see 3. below).  For this purpose, “non-routine” proposals
would typically include any contested matter, including a contested election of
directors, a merger or sale of substantial assets, a change in the articles of
incorporation that materially affects the rights of shareholders, and
compensation matters for management (e.g., stock option plans, retirement
plans, profit sharing or other special remuneration plans).
3.     Determining that a Non-Routine Proposal is Not Material – As discussed above, although non-routine
proposals are presumed to involve a material conflict of interest, the
Committee may determine on a case-by-case basis that particular non-routine
proposals do not involve a material conflict of interest.  To make this determination, the Committee
must conclude that a proposal is not directly related to SIMC’s conflict with
the issuer or that it otherwise would not be considered important by a
reasonable investor.  The Committee shall
record in writing the basis for any such determination.
d.     For any proposal where the Committee determines that SIMC has a
material conflict of interest, SIMC may vote a proxy regarding that proposal in
any of the following manners:
1.     Obtain Client Consent or Direction – If the Committee approves the proposal to
overrule the recommendation of the Service, SIMC shall fully disclose to each
client holding the security at issue the nature of the conflict, and obtain the
client’s consent to how SIMC will vote on the proposal (or otherwise obtain
instructions from the client as to how the proxy on the proposal should be
voted).
2.     Use Recommendation of the Service – Vote in accordance with the Service’s
recommendation.
e.     For any proposal where the Committee determines that SIMC does not have
a material conflict of interest, the Committee may overrule the Service’s
recommendation if the Committee reasonably determines that doing so is in the
best interests of SIMC’s clients.  If the
Committee decides to overrule the Service’s recommendation, the Committee shall
maintain a written record setting forth the basis of the Committee’s decision.
Last Revised:  February, 2006

For guidance on defining “routine” and “non-routine”
  matters, SIMC shall use the standards set forth in NYSE Rule 452 and Special
  Instruction 12b.viii. of Form 13F.

ITEM 29.   NUMBER OF HOLDERS OF SECURITIES. 
At the time of the filing of this Registration
Statement, there are no securities of the Fund outstanding except Shares issued
to SEI Global Services, Inc., as the initial limited partner in the Fund.
ITEM 30.   INDEMNIFICATION. 
As set forth in the Fund’s
Limited Partnership Agreement (see Item 25(2)(a)(2)), to the fullest extent
that limitations on the liability of the General Partner, the Directors and
officers are permitted by the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act
(6 Del. C. §17-101, et seq.), as
from time to time amended (the “DRULPA”), the General Partner, officers and
Directors shall not be responsible or liable in any event for any act or
omission of any agent, employee, Investment Adviser, Sub-Adviser or Principal
Underwriter of the Fund; with respect to the General Partner, the act or
omission of any Director or officer; or with respect to each Director and
officer, the act or omission of any General Partner, other Director or officer,
respectively.
Under the terms of the
Partnership Agreement, the Fund, out of the Fund Property, shall indemnify and
hold harmless any Person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a
party to any proceeding (other than an action by or in the right of the Fund)
by reason of the fact that such Person is or was an agent of the Fund and
arising
2 

out of or related to such
Person’s performance of his or her duties as an agent, against expenses,
judgments, fines, settlements and other amounts actually and reasonably
incurred in connection with such proceeding if such person acted in good faith
and in a manner that such person reasonably believed to be in the best
interests of the Fund and, in the case of a criminal proceeding, had no reasonable
cause to believe the conduct of such person was unlawful.  Except for the General Partner, the officers
and Directors, the Fund may indemnify any Person who was or is a party or is
threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action by
or in the right of the Fund to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the
fact that the Person is or was an agent of the Fund, against expenses actually
and reasonably incurred by that person in connection with the defense or
settlement of that action if that person acted in good faith, in a manner that
person believed to be in the best interests of the Fund.  The termination of any proceeding by
judgment, order, settlement, conviction or plea of nolo contendere or its
equivalent shall not of itself create a presumption that the person did not act
in good faith or in a manner that the person reasonably believed to be in the
best interests of the Fund or, with respect to a criminal proceeding, that the
person had reasonable cause to believe that the person’s conduct was
unlawful.  Subject to the terms of the
Partnership Agreement, there shall be no right to indemnification for any
liability to the Fund or the Investors arising by reason of willful
misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence, or the reckless disregard of the
duties involved in the conduct of the agent’s office with the Fund.
The General Partner, an
officer or Director shall be liable for his or her own willful misfeasance, bad
faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the
conduct of its respective office, and for nothing else, and shall not be liable
for errors of judgment or mistakes of fact or law.  The General Partner, an officer or Director
shall be indemnified and held harmless from or against any liability to the
Fund or the Investors, except when such liability arises out of his or her
willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence, or the reckless disregard of
the duties involved in the conduct of such person’s office with the Fund.  The General Partner, officers and Directors
may obtain the advice of counsel or other experts with respect to the meaning
and operation of the Partnership Agreement and their duties as General Partner,
officers or Directors.  No such General
Partner, officer or Director shall be liable for any act or omission in
accordance with such advice and no inference concerning liability shall arise
from a failure to follow such advice. 
The General Partner, officers and Directors shall not be required to
give any bond as such, nor any surety if a bond is required.
The Partnership Agreement
further provides that the Board will not be liable for errors of judgment or
mistakes of fact or law.  However,
nothing in the Partnership Agreement protects a member of the Board against any
liability to which the member would otherwise be subject by reason of willful
misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties
involved in the conduct of his or her office.
