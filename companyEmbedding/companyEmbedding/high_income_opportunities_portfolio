Portfolio Summary


Initial Date of Deposit
7/3/2017


Initial Public Offering Price
$10.00 per Unit


 Portfolio Ending Date
10/3/2018



Estimated Net Annual Year Distribution per Unit*
$0.6586



Cash CUSIP
30304L186


Reinvestment CUSIP
30304L194

*The estimates are based on annualizing the most recent distributions declared by the issuers of
the securities included in the portfolio. The estimated net annual distribution for the subsequent
year is expected to be less than the amount for the first year because a portion of the securities
included in the portfolio will be sold during the first year to pay for organization costs, the
deferred sales charge and the creation and development fee. There is no guarantee that the
issuers of the securities included in the portfolio will declare distributions in the future or that, if
declared, they will remain at current levels.




Sales Charges (based on a $10 public offering
      price)


Standard Accounts


Transactional Sales Charges:
Initial:
0.00%


 
Deferred:
1.35%


Creation and Development Fee:
 
0.50%


Maximum Sales Charge:
 
1.85%


The deferred sales charge will be deducted in three monthly installments commencing 
  10/20/17. 
When the public offering price is less than or equal to $10.00 per unit, there will be no initial sales charge. If the price exceeds $10.00 per unit, you will pay an initial sales charge.


Fee/Wrap Accounts


Maximum Sales Charge:
0.50%


The maximum sales charge for investors in fee accounts consists of the creation and development fee.
Investors in fee accounts are not assessed any transactional sales charges. Standard accounts sales charges
apply to units purchased as an ineligible asset.
The creation and development fee is a charge of $.050 per unit collected at
  the end of the initial offering period. If the price you pay exceeds $10 per
  unit, the creation and development fee will be less than 0.50%; if the price
  you pay is less than $10 per unit, the creation and development fee will exceed
  0.50%. 
In addition to the sales charges listed, UITs are subject to annual operating expenses and organization costs.
You should consider the portfolio's investment objectives, risks, and
  charges and expenses carefully before investing. Contact your financial advisor
  or call First Trust Portfolios, L.P. at 1.800.621.1675 to request a prospectus,
  which contains this and other information about the portfolio. Read it carefully
  before you invest.
Risk Considerations:
An investment in this unmanaged unit investment trust should be made with an 
  understanding of the risks involved with an investment in a portfolio of common 
stocks and closed-end funds.
Common stocks are subject to certain risks, such as an economic recession and 
  the possible deterioration of either the financial condition of the issuers 
  of the equity securities or the general condition of the stock market.
Closed-end funds are subject to various risks, including management's ability 
  to meet the fund's investment objective, and to manage the fund's portfolio 
  when the underlying securities are redeemed or sold, during periods of market 
  turmoil and as investors' perceptions regarding the funds or their underlying 
  investments change. Unlike open-end funds, which trade at prices based on a 
  current determination of the fund's net asset value, closed-end funds frequently 
  trade at a discount to their net asset value in the secondary market. Certain 
  closed-end funds may employ the use of leverage which increases the volatility 
  of such funds.
Certain of the closed-end funds invest in senior loans. The yield on closed-end funds which invest in senior loans will generally decline in a falling interest rate environment and increase in a rising interest rate environment. Senior loans are generally below investment grade quality ("junk" bonds). An investment in senior loans involves the risk that the borrowers may default on their obligations to pay principal or interest when due.
All of the closed-end funds invest in high-yield securities or
  "junk" bonds. Investing in high-yield securities should be
  viewed as speculative and you should review your ability to
  assume the risks associated with investments that utilize such
  bonds. High-yield securities are subject to numerous risks
  including higher interest rates, economic recession,
  deterioration of the junk bond market, possible downgrades
  and defaults of interest and/or principal. High-yield security
  prices tend to fluctuate more than higher rated bonds and are
  affected by short-term credit developments to a greater degree.
Certain of the closed-end funds in the portfolio invest in floating-rate securities. A floating-rate security is an instrument in which the interest rate payable
  on the obligation fluctuates on a periodic basis based upon changes in an interest rate benchmark. As a result, the yield on such a security will generally
  decline in a falling interest rate environment, causing the trust to experience a reduction in the income it receives from such securities.
Certain of the closed-end funds invest in convertible securities. Convertible securities are bonds, preferred stocks and other securities that pay a fixed rate of interest (or dividends) and will repay principal at a fixed date in the future. However, these securities may be converted into a specific number shares of common stocks at a specified time. As such, an investment in convertible securities entails some of the risks associated with both common stocks and bonds.
Certain of the securities in the portfolio are issued by  (REITs). Companies involved in the real estate industry
  are subject to changes in the real estate market, vacancy rates,
  competition, volatile interest rates and economic recession.
All of the closed-end funds invest in investment grade securities. Investment grade securities are
  subject to numerous risks including higher interest rates, economic recession, deterioration of the
  investment grade security market or investors' perception thereof, possible downgrades and
  defaults of interest and/or principal.
An investment in a portfolio containing small-cap and mid-cap companies
  is subject to additional risks, as the share prices of small-cap companies
  and certain mid-cap companies are often more volatile than those of
  larger companies due to several factors, including limited trading
  volumes, products, financial resources, management inexperience and less
  publicly available information.
An investment in foreign securities should be made with an understanding of the additional risks involved with foreign issuers, such as currency and interest rate fluctuations, nationalization or other adverse political or economic developments, lack of liquidity of certain foreign markets, withholding, the lack of adequate financial information, and exchange control restrictions impacting foreign issuers. Risks associated with investing in foreign securities may be more pronounced in emerging markets where the securities markets are substantially smaller, less liquid, less regulated and more volatile than the U.S. and developed foreign markets.
Although this portfolio terminates in approximately 15 months, the strategy is long-term.
  Investors should consider their ability to pursue investing in successive portfolios, if available.
  There may be tax consequences unless units are purchased in an IRA or other qualified plan.
The value of the securities held by the trust may be subject to steep declines or increased volatility due to changes in performance or perception of the issuers.
It is important to note that an investment can be made in the underlying
  funds directly rather than through the trust. These direct investments can
  be made without paying the trust's sales charge, operating expenses and
  organizational costs.
For a discussion of additional risks of investing in the trust see the "Risk
  Factors" section of the prospectus.

Unit Investment Trusts (UITs) are sold only by prospectus. Investors should read the prospectus carefully before investing which contains a detailed explanation of the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Investors should consult their accounting, legal, or tax advisor.


* Information labeled “Fee-Based Account” provides information pertaining to units purchased through registered investment advisers, certified financial planners or registered broker-dealers who in each case either charge investor accounts periodic fees for brokerage services, financial planning, investment advisory or asset management services, or provide such services in connection with an investment account for which a comprehensive “wrap fee” charge is imposed. You should consult your financial advisor to determine whether you can benefit from these accounts and whether your unit purchases are eligible for this discount. To purchase units in these accounts, your financial advisor must purchase units designated with one of the Fee Account CUSIP numbers, if available. The amounts shown are different from what would be applicable for units purchased in other accounts (i.e. “Commission-Based Accounts”) not eligible for this discount.  See your prospectus and consult your financial advisor for more information about eligibility and applicability of the Fee-Based Account discount.

†Offer Details: Offer expires December 31, 2017.  Valid only for new Bing Ads customers who are first party recipients of the offer email. A new Bing Ads customer is one that has not advertised on Bing Ads before. Enter promotional coupon code and spend $25 (applies to threshold and prepaid accounts) to receive $100 in Bing Ads credits. Limit one promotion code per new Bing Ads customer. Promotional code must be redeemed within thirty (30) days of Bing Ads new customer account creation. Ad campaign costs accrued before receiving a credit, as well as costs accrued after all credits are used, will be charged to the payment method associated with the Bing Ads account. If customer payment fails, the coupon amount will not be applied.  Ads will continue to run and accrue costs after any promotional credit has been used up. Any portion of the credit not used within ninety (90) days of credit redemption will expire and can't be carried over even if the Bing Ads Customer switches their payment method. Offer valid only to residents of the United States. In order for the offer to be valid, a form of payment must be entered into your account prior to redemption of the promotional code and prior to your account going live to take advantage of the credit. This offer may not be combined with any other offer, promotional code coupon or discount, separated, redeemed for cash, transferred, sold, or bartered. Microsoft, in its sole discretion, can close your account for any suspected coupon abuse. Refund of the $25 is not permitted.  See Bing Ads Terms and Conditions for more details at sign-up.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

The Fund
The Fund seeks to exploit investment opportunities in the high-yield market, primarily through diversified exposure to high-yield, high-risk corporate bonds. Investment opportunities that maximize total return are sought through a well-defined investment  process that has been in place for over 20 years.



The Approach
Fundamental bottom-up credit research is the cornerstone of our approach to high-yield investing. We combine our fundamental research with an investment process that emphasizes both risk management and relative-value investing to achieve competitive risk -adjusted returns.



The Features
The Fund’s high-yield bond holdings have historically produced higher income and lower correlation to interest-rate movements than higher-quality corporate bonds. In addition to high current income, the Fund offers the potential for capital appreci ation.

Returns are historical and are calculated by determining the percentage change in net asset value (NAV) with all distributions reinvested.

The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds and exchange-traded funds) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considere d a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding  consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.The Overall Morningstar Rat ing for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns,  60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most  weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. Star ratings do not reflect the effect of any applicable sales load.©2017 Morningstar. All  Rights Reserved.

About Risk: 
An imbalance in supply and demand in the income market may result in valuation uncertainties and greater volatility, less liquidity, widening credit spreads and a lack of price transparency in the market. Investments in income securities may be affected  by changes in the creditworthiness of the issuer and are subject to the risk of nonpayment of principal and interest. The value of income securities also may decline because of real or perceived concerns about the issuer's ability to make principal and i nterest payments. Investments rated below investment grade (typically referred to as "junk") are generally subject to greater price volatility and illiquidity than higher-rated investments. As interest rates rise, the value of certain income investments  is likely to decline. Derivative instruments can be used to take both long and short positions, be highly volatile, result in economic leverage (which can increase both the risk and return potential of the Fund), and involve risks in addition to the risk s of the underlying instrument on which the derivative is based, such as counterparty, correlation and liquidity risk. If a counterparty is unable to honor its commitments, the value of Fund shares may decline and/or the Fund could experience delays in t he return of collateral or other assets held by the counterparty. The Fund will incur a loss as a result of a short sale if the price of the security sold short increases in value between the date of the short sale and the date on which the Fund purchase s the security to replace the borrowed security. No fund is a complete investment program and you may lose money investing in a fund. The Fund may engage in other investment practices that may involve additional risks and you should review the Fund prosp ectus for a complete description.



1. Class A and I Ratings: 3-year: 4 and 5 stars, respectively; 5-year: 4 and 5 stars, respectively; 10-year: 3 and 3 stars, respectively.

5. The Morningstar High Yield Bond Category includes funds that invest in lower-quality bonds with typically 65% or more in bonds not rated or rated BB or below by one of the major ratings agencies.
6. SEC 30-day yield is a standardized measure based on the estimated yield to maturity of a fund's investments over a 30-day period and is based on the maximum offer price at the date specified. The SEC 30-day yield is not based on the distributions made by  the fund, which may differ. Distribution Rate at NAV is calculated by dividing the last distribution paid per share (annualized) by NAV. The Fund's monthly distribution may be comprised of ordinary income, net realized capital gains and returns of capit al.
7. A portion of the Fund's returns may be comprised of return of capital or short term capital gains. The Fund will determine the tax characteristics of all Fund distributions after the end of the calendar year and will provide shareholders such information  at that time. Please consult your tax advisor for further information.

Credit ratings are categorized using S&P. If S&P does not publish a rating, then the Moody's rating is applied. Ratings, which are subject to change, apply to the creditworthiness of the issuers of the underlying securities and not to the Fund or its sha res. Credit ratings measure the quality of a bond based on the issuer's creditworthiness, with ratings ranging from AAA, being the highest, to D, being the lowest based on S&P measures. Ratings of BBB or higher by S&P or Fitch (Baa or higher by Moody's)  are considered to be investment-grade quality. Credit ratings are based largely on the ratings agency's analysis at the time of rating. The rating assigned to any particular security is not necessarily a reflection of the issuer's current financial condi tion and does not necessarily reflect its assessment of the volatility of a security's market value or of the liquidity of an investment in the security. Holdings designated as "Not Rated" are not rated by the national ratings agencies stated above.

About Risk: 
An imbalance in supply and demand in the income market may result in valuation uncertainties and greater volatility, less liquidity, widening credit spreads and a lack of price transparency in the market. Investments in income securities may be affected  by changes in the creditworthiness of the issuer and are subject to the risk of nonpayment of principal and interest. The value of income securities also may decline because of real or perceived concerns about the issuer's ability to make principal and i nterest payments. Investments rated below investment grade (typically referred to as "junk") are generally subject to greater price volatility and illiquidity than higher-rated investments. As interest rates rise, the value of certain income investments  is likely to decline. Derivative instruments can be used to take both long and short positions, be highly volatile, result in economic leverage (which can increase both the risk and return potential of the Fund), and involve risks in addition to the risk s of the underlying instrument on which the derivative is based, such as counterparty, correlation and liquidity risk. If a counterparty is unable to honor its commitments, the value of Fund shares may decline and/or the Fund could experience delays in t he return of collateral or other assets held by the counterparty. The Fund will incur a loss as a result of a short sale if the price of the security sold short increases in value between the date of the short sale and the date on which the Fund purchase s the security to replace the borrowed security. No fund is a complete investment program and you may lose money investing in a fund.

 Insights & Analysis  Commentary
A Word On The Markets as of  Mar 31, 2017
High-yield bonds started the year strong, benefiting from post-election optimism regarding potential tax reform, deregulation and fiscal stimulus. Favorable fourth-quarter earnings reports and improving economic data also helped. Market conditions, howev er, weakened in March. Oil prices started to slide, pressuring returns in energy, the largest sector weighting in the BofA Merrill Lynch U.S. High Yield Index (the Index).2 In addition, concern about an accelerated timetable for interest rate hikes sa pped investors' appetite for risk, undermining demand. Concurrently, new high-yield bond issuance surged as refinancings rose ahead of further interest-rate increases or possible tax changes affecting the deductibility of interest expenses. The Federal R eserve's (Fed's) March 15 decision to inch its key target rate higher had little impact on high yield, but the asset class did see inflows pick up as expectations for the pace of future rate increases eased. This tailwind was somewhat offset by Republica ns' inability to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, raising questions about when and if the new administration would be able to pass much-anticipated tax reform and meaningful fiscal stimulus.
High-yield bond fundamentals continued to improve, as evidenced by better revenue and earnings growth numbers. Corporate leverage modestly decreased for the second consecutive quarter due to improved earnings and interest coverage, a measure of high-yiel d issuers' ability to service their debt obligations. The trailing 12-month default rate declined to 1.90% at quarter end, down from 3.57% at the start of the year, due to the fact that Q1 2016's elevated defaults in the energy and metals/mining sectors  have now rolled off the trailing 12-month period. The default rate ex-energy and metals/mining issuers is currently 0.65%. Average yields on high-yield bonds tightened to 5.88%, and prices modestly improved.
For the three months ended March 31, 2017, the Index returned 2.71%, beating the 0.82% gain of the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index,12 but lagging the 6.07% return of the S&P 500 Index.13 Within the Index, lower-quality and longer-durati on issues posted the strongest gains.


Performance Summary 
Eaton Vance High Income Opportunities Fund (the Fund) posted a modest gain at net asset value for the quarter that was slightly behind the return of the Index.

The Fund's higher-quality, lower-volatility bias, notably in the CCC-rated segment and the energy sector, protected the Fund in March, but hindered performance for the quarter, as lower-quality issues outperformed.
Duration14 positioning hampered performance, largely because of the Fund's overweight in shorter-duration issues, which lagged longer-duration bonds, and credit selection in the two- to five-year duration segment.
By contrast, the Fund benefited from an underweight and credit selection in the weaker-performing BB category.
Credit selection was positive in the services, diversified media, diversified financial services and chemicals segments, that generally benefited from expectations of improved economic growth.

Contributors 
Factors contributing to the Fund's relative performance compared to the Index during the quarter:

A small post-restructuring equity holding benefited performance most.
An underweight and credit selection in the weaker-performing BB segment also had a positive impact.
Credit selection and an overweight in the services segment further benefited performance, led by an overweight in bonds issued by a commercial equipment rental company that returned over 40% for the quarter.
Credit selection in the diversified media, diversified financial services and chemicals categories had a positive effect on Fund performance. Top individual contributors included an off-benchmark position in a gaming company, a marketing firm, and an air craft leasing firm.



Detractors 
Factors detracting from the Fund's relative performance compared to the Index during the quarter:

Credit selection in the CCC- and B-rated segments hurt Fund performance, largely because the Fund favored higher-quality, less volatile bonds that lagged lower-quality issues.
Credit selection among two- to five-year duration bonds also detracted from Fund Performance, along with an overweight in securities with durations of two years or less.
The Fund's quality bias in energy hindered performance. Credit selection and relative weighting in telecommunications and retail further detracted.



Investment Outlook And Fund Positioning 
We think the backdrop for high-yield bonds remains supportive. Going forward, we expect modest economic growth to result in relatively stable bond prices. While short-term interest rates will likely increase, we don't think the economy will overheat to t he point where the Fed becomes overly aggressive. What is less clear is when, or if, proposed pro-growth initiatives will be enacted and what impact that will have on investment markets.
Some of the government's proposed initiatives, if approved, could have a positive effect on high-yield bonds. For example, if the tax deductibility of corporate interest expense is no longer allowed, that could, on the margin, lead to less new issuance i n high-yield. At the same time, a lower tax rate on interest income earned by high-income filers could boost demand for high yield. The implementation of tax reform or infrastructure spending plans could also help extend the duration of the U.S. economic  recovery, in turn aiding high-yield fundamentals and driving down default rates.
We recognize, however, that there are also potential headwinds for the asset class. Volatility could be elevated, especially given uncertainty over the Republicans' ability to deliver on tax reform and fiscal stimulus. A choppy market may dampen demand f or high-yield bonds. Disappointing progress in Washington or projected corporate earnings reports also could cause a stock market decline that could pressure high-yield bond returns. Additionally, if OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countrie s) doesn't follow through on its planned production cuts, oil prices could pull back further, hurting the energy sector.Given relatively high valuations on high-yield bonds and the potential for a pickup in volatility, we've kept the Fund conserv atively positioned, maintaining a shorter duration and higher-quality bias than the Index. By protecting the Fund's downside and minimizing volatility, we believe we can stay ahead of the Index in market declines and capture much of the upside in rallies , helping to drive long-term relative performance. At period end, the Fund's duration was 3.2 years, compared to the Index's duration of 3.9 years. In addition, the Fund's biggest credit concentration was in B-rated bonds, which generally have less durat ion. Lower duration usually means bond prices decline less as credit spreads widen.
At period-end, the Fund had a small allocation to the higher-quality split-rated BB/BBB segment and in the CCC and B rated segments, a bias toward less volatile issues. In the energy sector, we've continued to favor higher-quality, lower-cost producers t hat, in our view, are less susceptible to price volatility. During the quarter, we added to some of our core exploration and production names, and took advantage of opportunities in energy services. Our energy stake at quarter end was slightly underweigh t the sector's approximately 14% weight in the Index. In healthcare, the second largest sector in the Fund, we had a bias toward bonds issued by healthcare services providers and companies that serve to reduce cost, such as contract research organization s (CROs). The Fund was underweight hospital bonds, which could be vulnerable to a repeal of the Affordable Care Act, and had a shorter duration focus in the pharmaceutical segment.

Credit ratings are categorized using S&P. If S&P does not publish a rating, then the Moody's rating is applied. Ratings, which are subject to change, apply to the creditworthiness of the issuers of the underlying securities and not to the Fund or its sha res. Credit ratings measure the quality of a bond based on the issuer's creditworthiness, with ratings ranging from AAA, being the highest, to D, being the lowest based on S&P measures. Ratings of BBB or higher by S&P or Fitch (Baa or higher by Moody's)  are considered to be investment-grade quality. Credit ratings are based largely on the ratings agency's analysis at the time of rating. The rating assigned to any particular security is not necessarily a reflection of the issuer's current financial condi tion and does not necessarily reflect its assessment of the volatility of a security's market value or of the liquidity of an investment in the security. Holdings designated as "Not Rated" are not rated by the national ratings agencies stated above.

The Fund
The Fund seeks to exploit investment opportunities in the high-yield market, primarily through diversified exposure to high-yield, high-risk corporate bonds. Investment opportunities that maximize total return are sought through a well-defined investment  process that has been in place for over 20 years.



The Approach
Fundamental bottom-up credit research is the cornerstone of our approach to high-yield investing. We combine our fundamental research with an investment process that emphasizes both risk management and relative-value investing to achieve competitive risk -adjusted returns.



The Features
The Fund’s high-yield bond holdings have historically produced higher income and lower correlation to interest-rate movements than higher-quality corporate bonds. In addition to high current income, the Fund offers the potential for capital appreci ation.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Performance is for the stated time period only; due to market vola tility, the Fund’s current performance may be lower or higher than quoted. Returns are historical and are calculated by determining the percentage change in net asset value (NAV) with all distributions reinvested. Returns for other classes of share s offered by the Fund are different. Performance less than or equal to one year is cumulative. Max Sales Charge: 5%.

About Risk: 
An imbalance in supply and demand in the income market may result in valuation uncertainties and greater volatility, less liquidity, widening credit spreads and a lack of price transparency in the market. Investments in income securities may be affected  by changes in the creditworthiness of the issuer and are subject to the risk of nonpayment of principal and interest. The value of income securities also may decline because of real or perceived concerns about the issuer's ability to make principal and i nterest payments. Investments rated below investment grade (typically referred to as "junk") are generally subject to greater price volatility and illiquidity than higher-rated investments. As interest rates rise, the value of certain income investments  is likely to decline. Derivative instruments can be used to take both long and short positions, be highly volatile, result in economic leverage (which can increase both the risk and return potential of the Fund), and involve risks in addition to the risk s of the underlying instrument on which the derivative is based, such as counterparty, correlation and liquidity risk. If a counterparty is unable to honor its commitments, the value of Fund shares may decline and/or the Fund could experience delays in t he return of collateral or other assets held by the counterparty. The Fund will incur a loss as a result of a short sale if the price of the security sold short increases in value between the date of the short sale and the date on which the Fund purchase s the security to replace the borrowed security. No fund is a complete investment program and you may lose money investing in a fund. The Fund may engage in other investment practices that may involve additional risks and you should review the Fund prosp ectus for a complete description.



1. Effective January 1, 2012, Class B shares are closed to new purchases. Exchanges from other Eaton Vance funds or through reinvestment of distributions is still permitted.
2. Class A and I Ratings: 3-year: 4 and 5 stars, respectively; 5-year: 4 and 5 stars, respectively; 10-year: 3 and 3 stars, respectively. The total number of funds in the High Yield Bond category for the 3, 5 and 10 year periods are 590, 474, 317, respectiv ely. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for  36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star ratin g formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. Star ratings do not reflect the effect of any applicable sales load.
3. BofA Merrill Lynch U.S. High Yield Index is an unmanaged index of below-investment grade U.S. corporate bonds. Unless otherwise stated, index returns do not reflect the effect of any applicable sales charges, commissions, expenses, taxes or leverage, as  applicable.

The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds and exchange-traded funds) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considere d a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding  consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.The Overall Morningstar Rat ing for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns,  60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most  weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.

6. The Morningstar High Yield Bond Category includes funds that invest in lower-quality bonds with typically 65% or more in bonds not rated or rated BB or below by one of the major ratings agencies.
7. SEC 30-day yield is a standardized measure based on the estimated yield to maturity of a fund's investments over a 30-day period and is based on the maximum offer price at the date specified. The SEC 30-day yield is not based on the distributions made by  the fund, which may differ. Distribution Rate at NAV is calculated by dividing the last distribution paid per share (annualized) by NAV. The Fund's monthly distribution may be comprised of ordinary income, net realized capital gains and returns of capit al.
8. A portion of the Fund's returns may be comprised of return of capital or short term capital gains. The Fund will determine the tax characteristics of all Fund distributions after the end of the calendar year and will provide shareholders such information  at that time.

Credit ratings are categorized using S&P. If S&P does not publish a rating, then the Moody's rating is applied. Ratings, which are subject to change, apply to the creditworthiness of the issuers of the underlying securities and not to the Fund or its sha res. Credit ratings measure the quality of a bond based on the issuer's creditworthiness, with ratings ranging from AAA, being the highest, to D, being the lowest based on S&P measures. Ratings of BBB or higher by S&P or Fitch (Baa or higher by Moody's)  are considered to be investment-grade quality. Credit ratings are based largely on the ratings agency's analysis at the time of rating. The rating assigned to any particular security is not necessarily a reflection of the issuer's current financial condi tion and does not necessarily reflect its assessment of the volatility of a security's market value or of the liquidity of an investment in the security. Holdings designated as "Not Rated" are not rated by the national ratings agencies stated above.

About Risk: 
An imbalance in supply and demand in the income market may result in valuation uncertainties and greater volatility, less liquidity, widening credit spreads and a lack of price transparency in the market. Investments in income securities may be affected  by changes in the creditworthiness of the issuer and are subject to the risk of nonpayment of principal and interest. The value of income securities also may decline because of real or perceived concerns about the issuer's ability to make principal and i nterest payments. Investments rated below investment grade (typically referred to as "junk") are generally subject to greater price volatility and illiquidity than higher-rated investments. As interest rates rise, the value of certain income investments  is likely to decline. Derivative instruments can be used to take both long and short positions, be highly volatile, result in economic leverage (which can increase both the risk and return potential of the Fund), and involve risks in addition to the risk s of the underlying instrument on which the derivative is based, such as counterparty, correlation and liquidity risk. If a counterparty is unable to honor its commitments, the value of Fund shares may decline and/or the Fund could experience delays in t he return of collateral or other assets held by the counterparty. The Fund will incur a loss as a result of a short sale if the price of the security sold short increases in value between the date of the short sale and the date on which the Fund purchase s the security to replace the borrowed security. No fund is a complete investment program and you may lose money investing in a fund. The Fund may engage in other investment practices that may involve additional risks and you should review the Fund prosp ectus for a complete description.

 Insights & Analysis  Commentary
A Word On The Markets as of  Mar 31, 2017
High-yield bonds started the year strong, benefiting from post-election optimism regarding potential tax reform, deregulation and fiscal stimulus. Favorable fourth-quarter earnings reports and improving economic data also helped. Market conditions, howev er, weakened in March. Oil prices started to slide, pressuring returns in energy, the largest sector weighting in the BofA Merrill Lynch U.S. High Yield Index (the Index).3 In addition, concern about an accelerated timetable for interest rate hikes sa pped investors' appetite for risk, undermining demand. Concurrently, new high-yield bond issuance surged as refinancings rose ahead of further interest-rate increases or possible tax changes affecting the deductibility of interest expenses. The Federal R eserve's (Fed's) March 15 decision to inch its key target rate higher had little impact on high yield, but the asset class did see inflows pick up as expectations for the pace of future rate increases eased. This tailwind was somewhat offset by Republica ns' inability to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, raising questions about when and if the new administration would be able to pass much-anticipated tax reform and meaningful fiscal stimulus.
High-yield bond fundamentals continued to improve, as evidenced by better revenue and earnings growth numbers. Corporate leverage modestly decreased for the second consecutive quarter due to improved earnings and interest coverage, a measure of high-yiel d issuers' ability to service their debt obligations. The trailing 12-month default rate declined to 1.90% at quarter end, down from 3.57% at the start of the year, due to the fact that Q1 2016's elevated defaults in the energy and metals/mining sectors  have now rolled off the trailing 12-month period. The default rate ex-energy and metals/mining issuers is currently 0.65%. Average yields on high-yield bonds tightened to 5.88%, and prices modestly improved.
For the three months ended March 31, 2017, the Index returned 2.71%, beating the 0.82% gain of the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index,13 but lagging the 6.07% return of the S&P 500 Index.14 Within the Index, lower-quality and longer-durati on issues posted the strongest gains.


Performance Summary 
Eaton Vance High Income Opportunities Fund (the Fund) posted a modest gain at net asset value for the quarter that was slightly behind the return of the Index.

The Fund's higher-quality, lower-volatility bias, notably in the CCC-rated segment and the energy sector, protected the Fund in March, but hindered performance for the quarter, as lower-quality issues outperformed.
Duration15 positioning hampered performance, largely because of the Fund's overweight in shorter-duration issues, which lagged longer-duration bonds, and credit selection in the two- to five-year duration segment.
By contrast, the Fund benefited from an underweight and credit selection in the weaker-performing BB category.
Credit selection was positive in the services, diversified media, diversified financial services and chemicals segments, that generally benefited from expectations of improved economic growth.

Contributors 
Factors contributing to the Fund's relative performance compared to the Index during the quarter:

A small post-restructuring equity holding benefited performance most.
An underweight and credit selection in the weaker-performing BB segment also had a positive impact.
Credit selection and an overweight in the services segment further benefited performance, led by an overweight in bonds issued by a commercial equipment rental company that returned over 40% for the quarter.
Credit selection in the diversified media, diversified financial services and chemicals categories had a positive effect on Fund performance. Top individual contributors included an off-benchmark position in a gaming company, a marketing firm, and an air craft leasing firm.



Detractors 
Factors detracting from the Fund's relative performance compared to the Index during the quarter:

Credit selection in the CCC- and B-rated segments hurt Fund performance, largely because the Fund favored higher-quality, less volatile bonds that lagged lower-quality issues.
Credit selection among two- to five-year duration bonds also detracted from Fund Performance, along with an overweight in securities with durations of two years or less.
The Fund's quality bias in energy hindered performance. Credit selection and relative weighting in telecommunications and retail further detracted.



Investment Outlook And Fund Positioning 
We think the backdrop for high-yield bonds remains supportive. Going forward, we expect modest economic growth to result in relatively stable bond prices. While short-term interest rates will likely increase, we don't think the economy will overheat to t he point where the Fed becomes overly aggressive. What is less clear is when, or if, proposed pro-growth initiatives will be enacted and what impact that will have on investment markets.
Some of the government's proposed initiatives, if approved, could have a positive effect on high-yield bonds. For example, if the tax deductibility of corporate interest expense is no longer allowed, that could, on the margin, lead to less new issuance i n high-yield. At the same time, a lower tax rate on interest income earned by high-income filers could boost demand for high yield. The implementation of tax reform or infrastructure spending plans could also help extend the duration of the U.S. economic  recovery, in turn aiding high-yield fundamentals and driving down default rates.
We recognize, however, that there are also potential headwinds for the asset class. Volatility could be elevated, especially given uncertainty over the Republicans' ability to deliver on tax reform and fiscal stimulus. A choppy market may dampen demand f or high-yield bonds. Disappointing progress in Washington or projected corporate earnings reports also could cause a stock market decline that could pressure high-yield bond returns. Additionally, if OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countrie s) doesn't follow through on its planned production cuts, oil prices could pull back further, hurting the energy sector.Given relatively high valuations on high-yield bonds and the potential for a pickup in volatility, we've kept the Fund conserv atively positioned, maintaining a shorter duration and higher-quality bias than the Index. By protecting the Fund's downside and minimizing volatility, we believe we can stay ahead of the Index in market declines and capture much of the upside in rallies , helping to drive long-term relative performance. At period end, the Fund's duration was 3.2 years, compared to the Index's duration of 3.9 years. In addition, the Fund's biggest credit concentration was in B-rated bonds, which generally have less durat ion. Lower duration usually means bond prices decline less as credit spreads widen.
At period-end, the Fund had a small allocation to the higher-quality split-rated BB/BBB segment and in the CCC and B rated segments, a bias toward less volatile issues. In the energy sector, we've continued to favor higher-quality, lower-cost producers t hat, in our view, are less susceptible to price volatility. During the quarter, we added to some of our core exploration and production names, and took advantage of opportunities in energy services. Our energy stake at quarter end was slightly underweigh t the sector's approximately 14% weight in the Index. In healthcare, the second largest sector in the Fund, we had a bias toward bonds issued by healthcare services providers and companies that serve to reduce cost, such as contract research organization s (CROs). The Fund was underweight hospital bonds, which could be vulnerable to a repeal of the Affordable Care Act, and had a shorter duration focus in the pharmaceutical segment.

Credit ratings are categorized using S&P. If S&P does not publish a rating, then the Moody's rating is applied. Ratings, which are subject to change, apply to the creditworthiness of the issuers of the underlying securities and not to the Fund or its sha res. Credit ratings measure the quality of a bond based on the issuer's creditworthiness, with ratings ranging from AAA, being the highest, to D, being the lowest based on S&P measures. Ratings of BBB or higher by S&P or Fitch (Baa or higher by Moody's)  are considered to be investment-grade quality. Credit ratings are based largely on the ratings agency's analysis at the time of rating. The rating assigned to any particular security is not necessarily a reflection of the issuer's current financial condi tion and does not necessarily reflect its assessment of the volatility of a security's market value or of the liquidity of an investment in the security. Holdings designated as "Not Rated" are not rated by the national ratings agencies stated above.
