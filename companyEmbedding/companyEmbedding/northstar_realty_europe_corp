(NYSE:    NRE) ("NorthStar Realty Europe" or "NRE"), a European-focused predominately office REIT, partnered with China Resources Land Limited ("CRL"), a leading property developer in China listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKSE: 1109) with an approximate $19 billion equity market capitalization, to acquire 20 Gresham Street, a trophy office building located in the City of London, for approximately £300 million from AXA Investment Managers. The acquisition represents CRL's first real estate investment in Europe.

NRE's expertise in the London and broader European real estate market makes us an excellent partner for CRL and we look forward to continuing to develop this important relationship as CRL looks to expand its footprint outside of China.
