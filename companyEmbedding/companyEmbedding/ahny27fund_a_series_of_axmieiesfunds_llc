			Objective & Strategy
		

			
				The fund seeks to achieve total return, comprised of current income and capital appreciation by investing in a diversified portfolio of investment-grade, fixed-income securities with a weighted average effective maturity and effective duration of less than three years.

			
			
				
			
		


Monthly Income
An actively managed, short-term bond strategy for investors seeking monthly income, limited interest rate risk and total return opportunities.



Quality
 
Income
 
Potentially limited interest rate risk


Designed for risk-conscious investors, the investment grade bond portfolio is composed of short term, high quality government, corporate and structured securities.
 
The fund complements its core high quality bonds with measured exposure to high yield bonds, which may provide opportunities for higher risk adjusted returns and incremental yield.
 
The short term portfolio targets to keep the average effective maturity and effective duration, a measure of sensitivity to interest rate risk, less than three years, which may limit investor exposure to changing interest rates.1





Footnote(s)

1 The average effective maturity of a portfolio is the weighted average of the maturities of the underlying bonds, taking into account the possibility that a bond might be called back to the issuer. Effective duration is a measure, as estimated by the fund’s portfolio managers, of a bond fund's price sensitivity to changes in interest rates. It takes into account mortgage prepayments, puts, adjustable coupons and potential call dates. The longer a fund’s duration, the more sensitive the fund is to shifts in interest rates.

Morningstar details

Source: Morningstar Inc. Ratings are based on a risk-adjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Open-end mutual funds and exchange-traded funds are considered a single population for comparison purposes. Ratings are calculated for funds with at least a three year history. The overall rating is derived from a weighted average of three-, five- and 10-year rating metrics, as applicable, excluding sales charges and including fees and expenses. ©2017 Morningstar Inc. All rights reserved. The information contained herein is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its content providers. It may not be copied or distributed and is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The top 10% of funds in a category receive five stars, the next 22.5% four stars, the next 35% three stars, the next 22.5% two stars and the bottom 10% one star. Ratings are subject to change monthly. Had fees not been waived and/or expenses reimbursed currently or in the past, the Morningstar rating would have been lower. Ratings for other share classes may differ due to different performance characteristics.

		Performance quoted is past performance and cannot guarantee comparable future results; current performance may be lower or higher. Investment return and principal value will vary so that you may have a gain or a loss when you sell shares. 


Performance shown at NAV does not include applicable front-end or CDSC sales charges, which would have reduced the performance.


		
		Performance figures reflect reinvested distributions and changes in net asset value (NAV) and the effect of the maximum sales charge unless otherwise stated.


Had fees not been waived and/or expenses reimbursed currently or in the past, returns would have been lower.

Ratings are based on S&P, Moody's or Fitch, as applicable. A credit rating is an assessment provided by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO) of the creditworthiness of an issuer with respect to debt obligations, including specific securities, money market instruments or other debts. Ratings are measured on a scale that generally ranges from AAA (highest) to D (lowest); ratings are subject to change without notice. NR indicates the debtor was not rated, and should not be interpreted as indicating low quality. If securities are rated differently by the rating agencies, the higher rating is applied. Credit ratings are based largely on the rating agency's investment analysis at the time of rating and the rating assigned to any particular security is not necessarily a reflection of the issuer's current financial condition. The rating assigned to a security by a rating agency does not necessarily reflect its assessment of the volatility of a security's market value or of the liquidity of an investment in the security. For more information on the rating methodology, please visit the following NRSRO websites: www.standardandpoors.com and select 'Understanding Ratings' under Rating Resources on the homepage; www.moodys.com and select 'Rating Methodologies' under Research and Ratings on the homepage; www.fitchratings.com and select 'Ratings Definitions' on the homepage.

 About risk
			 


Active Trading Risk. Active trading of portfolio securities may result in
high brokerage costs, which may lower the Fund's actual return. Active
trading also may increase the proportion of the Fund's gains that are short
term, which are taxed at a higher rate than long term gains. 

Changing Fixed Income Market Conditions Risk. The current low interest
rate environment was created in part by the Federal Reserve Board (FRB)
and certain foreign central banks keeping the federal funds and equivalent
foreign rates at or near zero. Increases in the federal funds and equivalent
foreign rates may expose fixed income markets to heightened volatility and
reduced liquidity for certain fixed income investments, particularly those with
longer maturities. In addition, decreases in fixed income dealer
market-making capacity may persist in the future, potentially leading to
heightened volatility and reduced liquidity in the fixed income markets. As a
result, the value of the Fund's investments and share price may decline. In
addition, because of changing central bank policies, the Fund may
experience higher than normal shareholder redemptions which could
potentially increase portfolio turnover and the Fund's transaction costs and
potentially lower the Fund's performance returns. 

Collateralized Loan Obligations Risk. CLOs are subject to the risks of
substantial losses due to actual defaults by underlying borrowers, which will
be greater during periods of economic or financial stress. CLOs may also
lose value due to collateral defaults and disappearance of subordinate
tranches, market anticipation of defaults, and investor aversion to CLO
securities as a class. The risks of CLOs will be greater if the Fund invests in
CLOs that hold loans of uncreditworthy borrowers or if the Fund holds
subordinate tranches of the CLO that absorbs losses from the defaults
before senior tranches. In addition, CLOs are subject to interest rate risk and
credit risk. 

Debt Securities Risk. The prices of debt securities held by the Fund will
be affected by changes in interest rates, the creditworthiness of the issuer
and other factors. An increase in prevailing interest rates typically causes
the value of existing debt securities to fall and often has a greater impact on
longer-duration debt securities and higher quality debt securities. Falling
interest rates will cause the Fund to reinvest the proceeds of debt securities
that have been repaid by the issuer at lower interest rates. Falling interest
rates may also reduce the Fund's distributable income because interest
payments on floating rate debt instruments held by the Fund will decline.
The Fund could lose money on investments in debt securities if the issuer or
borrower fails to meet its obligations to make interest payments and/or to
repay principal in a timely manner. If an issuer seeks to restructure the
terms of its borrowings or the Fund is required to seek recovery upon a
default in the payment of interest or the repayment of principal, the Fund
may incur additional expenses. Changes in an issuer's financial strength, the
market's perception of such strength or in the credit rating of the issuer or
the security may affect the value of debt securities. The Adviser's credit
analysis may fail to anticipate such changes, which could result in buying a
debt security at an inopportune time or failing to sell a debt security in
advance of a price decline or other credit event. 

Derivatives Risk. A derivative is an instrument whose value depends
largely on (and is derived from) the value of an underlying security, currency,
commodity, interest rate, index or other asset (each referred to as an
underlying asset). In addition to risks relating to the underlying assets, the
use of derivatives may include other, possibly greater, risks, which are
described below.

Counterparty Risk. Certain derivatives do not trade on an established
    exchange (referred to as over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives) and are
    simply financial contracts between the Fund and a counterparty.
    When the Fund is owed money on an OTC derivative, the Fund is
    dependent on the counterparty to pay or, in some cases, deliver the
    underlying asset, unless the Fund can otherwise sell its derivative
    contract to a third party prior to its expiration. Many counterparties
    are financial institutions such as banks and broker-dealers and their
    creditworthiness (and ability to pay or perform) may be negatively
    impacted by factors affecting financial institutions generally. In
    addition, in the event that a counterparty becomes bankrupt or
    insolvent, the Fund's ability to recover the collateral that the Fund has
    on deposit with the counterparty could be delayed or impaired. For
    derivatives traded on a centralized exchange, the Fund generally is
    dependent upon the solvency of the relevant exchange clearing house
    (which acts as a guarantor for each contractual obligation under such
    derivatives) for payment on derivative instruments for which the Fund
    is owed money.
Leverage Risk. Many derivatives do not require a payment up front
    equal to the economic exposure created by owning the derivative,
    which creates a form of leverage. As a result, an adverse change in
    the value of the underlying asset could result in the Fund sustaining a
    loss that is substantially greater than the amount invested in the
    derivative. Leverage may therefore make the Fund's returns more
    volatile and increase the risk of loss. The Fund segregates or
    earmarks liquid assets with a value at least equal to the amount that
    the Fund owes the derivative counterparty each day, if any, or
    otherwise holds instruments that offset the Fund's daily obligation
    under the derivatives instrument. This process is sometimes referred
    to as "cover." The amount of liquid assets needed as cover will
    fluctuate over time as the value of the derivative instrument rises and
    falls. If the value of the Fund's derivative positions or the value of the
    assets used as cover unexpectedly decreases, the Fund may be
    forced to segregate additional liquid assets as cover or sell assets at
    a disadvantageous time or price to meet its derivative obligations or
    to meet redemption requests, which could affect management of the
    Fund and the Fund's returns. In certain market conditions, losses on
    derivative instruments can grow larger while the value of the Fund's
    other assets fall, resulting in the Fund's derivative positions becoming
    a larger percentage of the Fund's investments.
Liquidity Risk. There is a smaller pool of buyers and sellers for certain
    derivatives, particularly OTC derivatives, than more traditional
    investments such as stocks. These buyers and sellers are often
    financial institutions that may be unable or unwilling to buy or sell
    derivatives during times of financial or market stress. Derivative
    instruments may therefore be less liquid than more traditional
    investments and the Fund may be unable to sell or exit its derivative
    positions at a desirable time or price. This risk may be more acute
    under adverse market conditions, during which the Fund may be
    most in need of liquidating its derivative positions. To the extent that
    the Fund is unable to exit a derivative position because of market
    illiquidity, the Fund may not be able to prevent further losses of value
    in its derivatives holdings and the liquidity of the Fund and its ability
    to meet redemption requests may be impaired to the extent that a
    substantial portion of the Fund's otherwise liquid assets must be used
    as margin or cover. Another consequence of illiquidity is that the Fund
    may be required to hold a derivative instrument to maturity and take
    or make delivery of the underlying asset that the Adviser would
    otherwise have attempted to avoid.
Other Risks. Compared to other types of investments, derivatives may
    be harder to value and may also be less tax efficient, as described
    under the "Taxes" section of the prospectus. In addition, changes in
    government regulation of derivative instruments could affect the
    character, timing and amount of the Fund's taxable income or gains,
    and may limit or prevent the Fund from using certain types of
    derivative instruments as a part of its investment strategy, which
    could make the investment strategy more costly to implement or
    require the Fund to change its investment strategy. To the extent that
    the Fund uses derivatives for hedging or to gain or limit exposure to a
    particular market or market segment, there may be imperfect
    correlation between the value of the derivative instrument and the
    value of the instrument being hedged or the relevant market or
    market segment, in which case the Fund may not realize the intended
    benefits. There is also the risk that during adverse market conditions,
    an instrument which would usually operate as a hedge provides no
    hedging benefits at all. The Fund's use of derivatives may be limited
    by the requirements for taxation of the Fund as a regulated
    investment company.

Emerging Markets Securities Risk. Emerging markets (also referred to
as developing markets) are generally subject to greater market volatility,
political, social and economic instability, uncertainty regarding the existence
of trading markets and more governmental limitations on foreign investment
than more developed markets. In addition, companies operating in emerging
markets may be subject to lower trading volume and greater price
fluctuations than companies in more developed markets. Securities law in
many emerging market countries is relatively new and unsettled. Therefore,
laws regarding foreign investment in emerging market securities, securities
regulation, title to securities, and shareholder rights may change quickly and
unpredictably. In addition, the enforcement of systems of taxation at federal,
regional and local levels in emerging market countries may be inconsistent,
and subject to sudden change. Other risks of investing in emerging markets
securities may include additional transaction costs, delays in settlement
procedures, and lack of timely information. 

Foreign Credit Exposure Risk. U.S. dollar-denominated securities
carrying foreign credit exposure may be affected by unfavorable political,
economic or governmental developments that could affect payments of
principal and interest. 

Foreign Government Debt Risk. Investments in foreign government debt
securities (sometimes referred to as sovereign debt securities) involve
certain risks in addition to those relating to foreign securities or debt
securities generally. The issuer of the debt or the governmental authorities
that control the repayment of the debt may be unable or unwilling to repay
principal or interest when due in accordance with the terms of such debt,
and the Fund may have limited recourse in the event of a default against the
defaulting government. A foreign government debtor's willingness or ability
to repay principal and pay interest in a timely manner may be affected by,
among other factors, its cash flow situation, the extent of its foreign
currency reserves, the availability of sufficient foreign exchange, the relative
size of the debt burden, the foreign government debtor's policy toward its
principal international lenders and local political constraints. Certain issuers
of foreign government debt may be dependent on disbursements from
foreign governments, multinational agencies and other entities to reduce
principal and interest arrearages on their debt. Without the approval of debt
holders, some governmental debtors have in the past been able to
reschedule or restructure their debt payments or declare moratoria on
payments. 

Foreign Securities Risk. The value of the Fund's foreign investments
may be adversely affected by political and social instability in the home
countries of the issuers of the investments, by changes in economic or
taxation policies in those countries, or by the difficulty in enforcing
obligations in those countries. Foreign investments also involve the risk of
the possible seizure, nationalization or expropriation of the issuer or foreign
deposits (in which the Fund could lose its entire investments in a certain
market) and the possible adoption of foreign governmental restrictions such
as exchange controls. Foreign companies generally may be subject to less
stringent regulations than U.S. companies, including financial reporting
requirements and auditing and accounting controls, and may therefore be
more susceptible to fraud or corruption. Also, there may be less publicly
available information about companies in certain foreign countries than
about U.S. companies making it more difficult for the Adviser to evaluate
those companies. The laws of certain countries may put limits on the Fund's
ability to recover its assets held at a foreign bank if the foreign bank,
depository or issuer of a security, or any of their agents, goes bankrupt.
Trading in many foreign securities may be less liquid and more volatile than
U.S. securities due to the size of the market or other factors. Unless the
Fund has hedged its foreign securities risk, foreign securities risk also
involves the risk of negative foreign currency rate fluctuations, which may
cause the value of securities denominated in such foreign currency (or other
instruments through which the Fund has exposure to foreign currencies) to
decline in value. Currency exchange rates may fluctuate significantly over
short periods of time. Currency hedging strategies, if used, are not always
successful. 

High Yield Debt Securities (Junk Bond) Risk. The Fund's investments in
high yield debt securities (commonly referred to as "junk bonds") and other
lower-rated securities will subject the Fund to substantial risk of loss. These
securities are considered to be speculative with respect to the issuer's
ability to pay interest and principal when due and are more susceptible to
default or decline in market value due to adverse economic, regulatory,
political or company developments than higher rated or investment grade
securities. Prices of high yield debt securities tend to be very volatile. These
securities are less liquid than investment grade debt securities and may be
difficult to sell at a desirable time or price, particularly in times of negative
sentiment toward high yield securities. 

Liquidity Risk. The Fund may be unable to sell illiquid investments at the
time or price it desires and, as a result, could lose its entire investment in
such investments. An investment may be illiquid due to a lack of trading
volume in the investment or if the investment is privately placed and not
traded in any public market or is otherwise restricted from trading. Certain
restricted securities require special registration and pose valuation
difficulties. Liquid securities can become illiquid during periods of market
stress. If a significant amount of the Fund's securities become illiquid, the
Fund may not be able to timely pay redemption proceeds and may need to
sell securities at significantly reduced prices. 

Management Risk. The Fund is actively managed and depends heavily
on the Adviser's judgment about markets, interest rates or the
attractiveness, relative values, liquidity, or potential appreciation of particular
investments made for the Fund's portfolio. The Fund could experience
losses if these judgments prove to be incorrect. There can be no guarantee
that the Adviser's investment techniques or investment decisions will
produce the desired results. Additionally, legislative, regulatory, or tax
developments may affect the investments or investment strategies available
to the investment manager in connection with managing the Fund, which
may also adversely affect the ability of the Fund to achieve its investment
objective. 

Market Risk. The market values of the Fund's investments, and
therefore the value of the Fund's shares, will go up and down, sometimes
rapidly or unpredictably. Market risk may affect a single issuer, industry or
section of the economy, or it may affect the market as a whole. The value of
the Fund's investments may go up or down due to general market
conditions which are not specifically related to the particular issuer, such as
real or perceived adverse economic conditions, changes in the general
outlook for revenues or corporate earnings, changes in interest or currency
rates, regional or global instability, or adverse investor sentiment generally.
The value of the Fund's investments may also go up or down due to factors
that affect an individual issuer or a particular industry or sector, such as
changes in production costs and competitive conditions within an industry.
Individual stock prices tend to go up and down more dramatically than those
of certain other types of investments, such as bonds. During a general
downturn in the financial markets, multiple asset classes may decline in
value. When markets perform well, there can be no assurance that specific
investments held by the Fund will rise in value. 

Mortgage- and Asset-Backed Securities Risk. Mortgage- and
asset-backed securities, including collateralized debt obligations and
collateralized mortgage obligations, differ from conventional debt securities
because principal is paid back over the life of the security rather than at
maturity. Mortgage- and asset-backed securities are subject to prepayment
or call risk, which is the risk that a borrower's payments may be received
earlier or later than expected due to changes in prepayment rates on
underlying loans. Faster prepayments often happen when interest rates are
falling. As a result, the Fund may reinvest these early payments at lower
interest rates, thereby reducing the Fund's income. Mortgage- and
asset-backed securities also are subject to extension risk. An unexpected
rise in interest rates could reduce the rate of prepayments and extend the
life of the mortgage- and asset-backed securities, causing the price of the
mortgage- and asset-backed securities and the Fund's share price to fall
and would make the mortgage- and asset-backed securities more sensitive
to interest rate changes. An unexpectedly high rate of defaults on the
mortgages held by a mortgage pool will adversely affect the value of
mortgage-backed securities and will result in losses to the Fund. The Fund
may invest in mortgage pools that include subprime mortgages, which are
loans made to borrowers with weakened credit histories or with lower
capacity to make timely payments on their mortgages. Privately issued
mortgage-related securities are not subject to the same underwriting
requirements for the underlying mortgages that are applicable to those
mortgage-related securities that have government or
government-sponsored entity guarantees. As a result, the mortgage loans
underlying privately issued mortgage-related securities may, and frequently
do, have less favorable collateral, credit risk or other underwriting
characteristics than government or government-sponsored
mortgage-related securities and have wider variances in a number of terms
including interest rate, term, size, purpose and borrower characteristics. 

Municipal Securities Risk. The risk of a municipal obligation generally
depends on the financial and credit status of the issuer. Constitutional
amendments, legislative enactments, executive orders, administrative
regulations, voter initiatives, and the issuer's regional economic conditions
may affect the municipal security's value, interest payments, repayment of
principal and the Fund's ability to sell the security. Municipal obligations may
be more susceptible to downgrades or defaults during recessions or similar
periods of economic stress. Municipal securities structured as revenue
bonds are generally not backed by the taxing power of the issuing
municipality but rather the revenue from the particular project or entity for
which the bonds were issued. If the Internal Revenue Service determines
that an issuer of a municipal security has not complied with applicable tax
requirements, interest from the security could be treated as taxable, which
could result in a decline in the security's value. In addition, there could be
changes in applicable tax laws or tax treatments that reduce or eliminate
the current federal income tax exemption on municipal securities or
otherwise adversely affect the current federal or state tax status of
municipal securities. 

TBA Transactions Risk. TBA transactions involve the risk that the
securities received may be less favorable than what was anticipated by the
Fund when entering into the TBA transaction. TBA transactions also involve
the risk that the counterparty will fail to deliver the securities, exposing the
Fund to further losses. Whether or not the Fund takes delivery of the
securities at the termination date of a TBA transaction, the Fund will
nonetheless be exposed to changes in the value of the underlying
investments during the term of the agreement. If the Fund sells short TBA
mortgages that it does not own and the mortgages increase in value, the
Fund may be required to pay a higher price than anticipated to purchase the
deliverable mortgages to settle the short sale and thereby incur a loss. A
short position in TBA mortgages poses more risk than holding the same TBA
mortgages long. It is possible that the market value of the mortgage
securities the Fund holds in long positions will decline at the same time that
the market value of the mortgage securities the Fund has sold short
increases, thereby magnifying any losses. The more the Fund pays to
purchase the mortgage securities sold short, the more it will lose on the
transaction, which adversely affects its share price. The loss on a long
position is limited to what the Fund originally paid for the TBA mortgage,
together with any transaction costs. In short transactions, there is no limit on
how much the price of a security can increase, thus the Fund's exposure is
theoretically unlimited. The Fund normally closes a short sale of TBA
mortgages that it does not own by purchasing mortgage securities on the
open market and delivering them to the broker. The Fund may not always be
able to complete or "close out" the short position by purchasing mortgage
securities at a particular time or at an acceptable price. The Fund incurs a
loss if the Fund is required to buy the deliverable mortgage securities at a
time when they have appreciated in value from the date of the short sale.
The Fund will incur increased transaction costs associated with selling TBA
mortgages short. In addition, taking short positions results in a form of
leverage. As a result, changes in the value of a Fund's investments will have
a larger effect on its share price than if it did not engage in these
transactions. 

U.S. Government Obligations Risk. Obligations of U.S. Government
agencies and authorities receive varying levels of support and may not be
backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government, which could
affect the Fund's ability to recover should they default. No assurance can be
given that the U.S. Government will provide financial support to its agencies
and authorities if it is not obligated by law to do so.
When-Issued, Delayed Delivery and Forward Commitment Risks.
When-issued and delayed delivery transactions are subject to market risk as
the value or yield of a security at delivery may be more or less than the
purchase price or the yield generally available on securities when delivery
occurs. In addition, the Fund is subject to counterparty risk because it relies
on the buyer or seller, as the case may be, to consummate the transaction,
and failure by the counterparty to complete the transaction may result in the
Fund missing the opportunity of obtaining a price or yield considered to be
advantageous. These transactions have a leveraging effect on the Fund
because the Fund commits to purchase securities that it does not have to
pay for until a later date. These investments therefore increase the Fund's
overall investment exposure and, as a result, its volatility. Typically, no
income accrues on securities the Fund has committed to purchase prior to
the time delivery of the securities is made, although the Fund may earn
income on securities it has set aside to cover these positions. 

Zero Coupon or Pay-In-Kind Securities Risk. Zero coupon and
pay-in-kind securities may be subject to greater fluctuation in value and less
liquidity in the event of adverse market conditions than comparably rated
securities paying cash interest at regular interest payment periods. Prices
on non-cash-paying instruments may be more sensitive to changes in the
issuer's financial condition, fluctuation in interest rates and market
demand/supply imbalances than cash-paying securities with similar credit
ratings, and thus may be more speculative. Investors may purchase zero
coupon and pay-in-kind securities at a price below the amount payable at
maturity. Because such securities do not entitle the holder to any periodic
payments of interest prior to maturity, this prevents any reinvestment of
interest payments at prevailing interest rates if prevailing interest rates rise.
The higher yields and interest rates on pay-in-kind securities reflect the
payment deferral and increased credit risk associated with such instruments
and that such investments may represent a higher credit risk than coupon
loans. Pay-in-kind securities may have a potential variability in valuations
because their continuing accruals require continuing judgments about the
collectability of the deferred payments and the value of any associated
collateral. Special tax considerations are associated with investing in certain
lower-grade securities, such as zero coupon or pay-in-kind securities.

Counsel for Defendants Laborers International Union of North America and Raymond Pocino

KENNETH M. KARAS, District Judge:

Before the Court is Plaintiff’s Motion to File a Proposed Second Amended Complaint

(“PSAC”) against Defendants Proskauer Rose LLP (“Proskauer”), Ishry Singh, Raymond

Pocino, John Virga, the Greater New York Laborers-Employers Cooperation and Education

Trust Fund (“GNYLECET”), Mason Tenders District Council Trust Funds (“MTDCTF”),

Laborers International Union of North America (“LIUNA”), Paul O’Brien, Charles Carron,

Merrick Rossein, and Chris Columbia (collectively “Defendants”).1 Plaintiff alleges that several

Defendants have breached fiduciary duties to the MTDCTF2; that Plaintiff was discharged from

his employment in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974

(“ERISA”), 29 U.S.C. § 1001 et seq.; that several Defendants violated the Racketeer Influenced

and Corrupt Organizations Act (“RICO”), 18 U.S.C. § 1961 et seq.; and that some defamed

Plaintiff. Defendants oppose Plaintiff’s Motion on futility grounds, arguing that Plaintiff has

failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). For

the reasons stated below, Plaintiff’s Motion is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part.

I. Background

A background of the facts leading up to this point in the litigation of this case is

1These Defendants are identified by Plaintiff in the caption of the PSAC.

2Hereinafter referred to as “Fund Defendants” or “the Fund.” Fund Defendants are
Singh; LECET; MTDCTF; Pocino, in his capacity as a Trustee of the MTDCTF; and Virga.

2

Case 1:05-cv-09625-RJS Document 84 Filed 10/19/2007 Page 3 of 53

discussed in a prior Opinion & Order from this Court. See Ello v. Singh, No. 05 Civ. 9625, 2006

WL 2270871 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 7, 2006) (denying Plaintiff’s motion to disqualify counsel). 

Rather than repeat those familiar facts here, the Court will refer to the relevant facts only when

necessary.

There is a need, however, to lay out the procedural history of this case. This case began

on November 15, 2005 when Plaintiff filed a Complaint. (Dkt. No. 1.) Then, on February 9,

2006, Plaintiff filed an Amended Complaint. (Dkt. No. 33.) Five months later, on July 13, 2006

– the same day the Court scheduled oral argument on Plaintiff’s motion to disqualify

Defendants’ counsel (Dkt. No. 36) – Plaintiff again attempted to amend his Complaint, this time

without prior permission of the Court.3 The Court denied Plaintiff’s disqualification motion, see

Ello, 2006 WL 2270871, at *1, and denied Plaintiff’s attempt to file the July 13th Complaint for

failure to comply with the Court’s Individual Practices (Dkt. No. 38).4 Less than a week later,

Plaintiff sought the Court’s permission to file an Amended Complaint. (Dkt. No. 40.) However,

before the Court could schedule a conference to hear the Parties on what Complaint Plaintiff

would seek leave to file, Plaintiff asked the Court to refrain from scheduling a conference,

because he intended to file yet another Amended Complaint. Before Plaintiff submitted his next

Amended Complaint and accompanying motion, the Court explained that any additional

amendments to the Complaint would have to be based on new evidence that was not previously

3This Amended Complaint was filed just after midnight of the day of oral argument on

Plaintiff’s motion to disqualify defense counsel. 

4Pursuant to this Court’s Order of October 10, 2006, the Amended Complaint that

Plaintiff attempted to file on July 13, 2006 was stricken from the Court’s Electronic Case Filing
System. (Dkt. No. 56.)

3

Case 1:05-cv-09625-RJS Document 84 Filed 10/19/2007 Page 4 of 53

available to Plaintiff. (Ct. Conf. Tr. 5-7, Sept. 12, 2006.) After an exchange of letters between

the Parties, Plaintiff filed a Motion to Amend the Complaint with a PSAC on September 15,

2006. 

But there is more. On November 6, 2006, this litigation took another step backward

before moving forward. On that date, Plaintiff filed his Reply Memorandum of Law in Support

of its Motion to File the PSAC (“Plaintiff’s Reply Memorandum”). Plaintiff’s Reply

Memorandum, which unjustifiably exceeded the permitted page limit by thirty-nine pages,5 was

also accompanied by what amounts to a Second Proposed Second Amended Complaint

(“SPSAC”). Plaintiff’s SPSAC, which he did not seek permission to file – the second time that

has happened in this case – seeks to expand Plaintiff’s defamation claims and to add a malicious

prosecution claim against Singh and Proskauer. 

To summarize: After filing his Complaint in this case, Plaintiff amended his Complaint,

and after doing so, he filed a different, proposed Amended Complaint which was subsequently

rejected for failure to comply with the Court’s Individual practices. Plaintiff next withdrew a

different proposed Complaint (a third version of the Complaint, in effect), then submitted a

PSAC. Finally, in the midst of briefing on the PSAC, without permission, Plaintiff attempted to

file a SPSAC. Tallying the score, Plaintiff has filed five versions of the Complaint. At the pre-

5The Court’s Individual Practices state that “[u]nless prior permission has been granted,
memoranda of law in support of and in opposition to motions are limited to 25 pages, and reply
memoranda are limited to 10 pages.” Hon. Kenneth M. Karas, Individual Practices, available at
http://www1.nysd.uscourts.gov/cases/show.php?db=judge_info&id=341. The reply brief
submitted by Plaintiff contained fifty numbered pages, including a cover page and two different
pages numbered “7.” Plaintiff acknowledged that he failed to seek permission to file a forty-nine
page brief, but did so anyhow. (See Pre-motion Conf. Tr. 7-8, Dec. 12, 2006.) 


4

Case 1:05-cv-09625-RJS Document 84 Filed 10/19/2007 Page 5 of 53

motion conference on the PSAC, after an inquiry by the Court as to what Complaint Plaintiff was

seeking leave to file, Plaintiff indicated that he is pursuing all of the causes of action in the

PSAC and the defamation claim raised in the SPSAC.6 (Pre-motion Conf. Tr. 26, Dec. 12,

2006.) However, Plaintiff confirmed that he does not intend to go to trial on the malicious

prosecution claim raised in the SPSAC. (Id.) 

Plaintiff’s allegations (which are assumed to be true for the purposes of this Motion) are

as follows: (1) Defendants Proskauer, Virga, Pocino, O’Brien, and Carron breached fiduciary

duties owed to the Mason Tenders District Council Pension Plan and Welfare Plan (PSAC ¶¶ 24-

135); (2) Defendants Pocino, Proskauer, and Virga violated Section 510 of ERISA by

discharging Plaintiff from his positions with LIUNA and GNYLECET (id. ¶¶ 136-96); (3)

Defendants Proskauer, Virga, Pocino, O’Brien, and Carron, operated MTDCTF in violation of

RICO (id. ¶¶ 197-286); and (4) Defendants Proskauer, Pocino, Rossein, Singh, and Columbia

defamed Plaintiff (SPSAC ¶¶ 287-418).

This case initially arose out of an allegation by Singh, an accounts payable employee of

the MTDCTF, that Plaintiff sexually assaulted Singh on February 4, 2005. At the time, Plaintiff

was an employee of the LIUNA and the MTDC, where he held numerous positions within both

organizations. See Ello, 2006 WL 2270871, at *1 (describing Plaintiff’s prior positions). 

Plaintiff claims that Singh, an employee of MTDCTF,7 approached Plaintiff on a number of

6Plaintiff stated at the December 12, 2006 conference that the expanded defamation
claims in the SPSAC were prompted by the discovery of Merrick Rossein’s report, which
Plaintiff’s counsel described as “new evidence” that “was shared with us . . . recently.” (Pre-
motion Conf. Tr. 25-26, Dec. 12, 2006.)

7MTDC is responsible for appointing trustees to the MTDCTF. (PSAC ¶ 5.) MTDC is a

LIUNA-affiliated district counsel which engages in collective bargaining with employers on

5

Case 1:05-cv-09625-RJS Document 84 Filed 10/19/2007 Page 6 of 53

occasions between December 2004 and February 2005 to solicit Plaintiff’s assistance in securing

a position with the MTDC. Plaintiff allegedly rebuffed Singh’s requests, due to what Plaintiff

says were budgetary constraints and policies which favor LECET and Local #279 employees for

available positions. Despite Plaintiff’s refusal to offer Singh employment, Singh allegedly

continued to remind Plaintiff that he was interested in employment. On February 4, 2005,

Plaintiff and Singh had a conversation at a local restaurant and bar. During this conversation,

Singh allegedly attempted to make his prospective employment more attractive by claiming that

he had family in law enforcement. Plaintiff allegedly told Singh that LIUNA maintained an

active Inspector General’s Office and that there was no need for the assistance of outside law

enforcement. Plaintiff claims that this was the end of their interactions that night – once the

conversation ended, the two men headed towards the offices of the MTDCTF and eventually

parted ways. 

Plaintiff claims that Singh retaliated against Plaintiff for his refusal to hire him by filing

false allegations that Plaintiff sexually assaulted Singh on February 4, 2005. Plaintiff alleges

that he learned of Singh’s allegation on February 9, 2005, from New York City Detective

Whelan. (PSAC ¶ 167.) That same day, Plaintiff believes that a meeting of Trustees was held to

discuss Singh’s allegations against Plaintiff. (Id. ¶ 166.) This alleged meeting was held in

Plaintiff’s absence and the minutes were subsequently withheld from Plaintiff. (Id.) That same

day, Pocino told Plaintiff to stay away from the MTDCTF’s employees and staff, allegedly

pursuant to Proskauer’s advice. (Id. ¶ 172.) Pocino refused to discuss Singh’s harassment report

behalf of union members. (Id.) “LIUNA is a national labor organization overseeing the
operations of local unions and district councils. In that role, LIUNA acts as the parent
organization of MTDC.” Ello, 2006 WL 2270871, at *1 n.2.

6

Case 1:05-cv-09625-RJS Document 84 Filed 10/19/2007 Page 7 of 53

with Plaintiff, also allegedly pursuant to Proskauer’s advice. (Id.) Singh’s allegation caused the

MTDCTF to subsequently investigate the claim. Proskauer, serving as counsel, retained Merrick

T. Rossein, Esq., to conduct an investigation. Plaintiff, apparently on the advice of his counsel,

never met with Rossein. In mid-March 2005, Pocino requested Plaintiff’s resignation, which

Plaintiff submitted under “duress.” (Id. ¶¶ 188-89.) 

II. Discussion

A. Standard of Review

Rule 15(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure states that leave to amend a complaint

should be “freely given when justice so requires.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a). However, “[a] district

court has discretion to deny leave for good reason, including futility, bad faith, undue delay, or

undue prejudice to the opposing party.” McCarthy v. Dun & Bradstreet Corp., 482 F.3d 184,

200 (2d Cir. 2007). “When the plaintiff has submitted a proposed amended complaint, the

district judge may review that pleading for adequacy and need not allow its filing if it does not

state a claim upon which relief can be granted.” Ricciuti v. N.Y.C. Transit Auth., 941 F.2d 119,

123 (2d Cir. 1991). The adequacy of the proposed amended complaint is judged by the same

standard as that applied to a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, Rule 12(b)(6) of the

Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. See General Elec. Capital Financial, Inc. v. Bank Leumi Trust

Co. of New York, No. 95 Civ. 9224, 1999 WL 33029, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 21, 1999) (citing

Ricciuti, 941 F.2d at 123).

A motion brought under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) posits that Plaintiff has failed “to state a

claim upon which relief can be granted.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). The Supreme Court has

recently held that “[w]hile a complaint attacked by a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss does not

7

Case 1:05-cv-09625-RJS Document 84 Filed 10/19/2007 Page 8 of 53

need detailed factual allegations, a plaintiff’s obligation to provide the ‘grounds’ of his ‘entitle-

[ment] to relief’ requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the

elements of a cause of action will not do.” Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 1964-65

(2007) (citations omitted and second alteration in original). In Bell Atlantic, id. at 1964-69, the

Supreme Court also abandoned reliance on the oft-quoted refrain from Conley v. Gibson that, “a

complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that

the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief[,]” 

355 U.S. 41, 45-46 (1957). As the Court explained, a literal application of Conley’s “no set of

facts” rationale is improper because “a wholly conclusory statement of claim would survive a

motion to dismiss whenever the pleadings left open the possibility that a plaintiff might later

establish some ‘set of [undisclosed] facts’ to support recovery . . . .” Bell Atl., 127 S. Ct. at

1968. Instead, the Court emphasized that “[f]actual allegations must be enough to raise a right to

relief above the speculative level . . . [,]” id. at 1965, and “once a claim has been stated

adequately, it may be supported by showing any set of facts consistent with the allegations in the

complaint[,]” id. at 1969. Plaintiff must allege “enough facts to state a claim to relief that is

plausible on its face.” Id. at 1974; see also Iqbal v. Hasty, 490 F.3d 143, 157-58 (2d Cir. 2007)

(“After careful consideration of the Court’s opinion and the conflicting signals from it that we

have identified, we believe the Court is not requiring a universal standard of heightened fact

pleading, but is instead requiring a flexible ‘plausibility standard,’ which obliges a pleader to

amplify a claim with some factual allegations in those contexts where such amplification is

needed to render the claim plausible.”). If Plaintiff “ha[s] not nudged [his] claims across the line

from conceivable to plausible, [his] complaint must be dismissed.” Bell Atl., 127 S. Ct. at 1974. 

8

Case 1:05-cv-09625-RJS Document 84 Filed 10/19/2007 Page 9 of 53

When considering a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, a court must limit itself to facts stated in the

complaint, documents attached to the complaint, and documents incorporated into the complaint.

See Newman & Schwartz v. Asplundh Tree Expert Co., 102 F.3d 660, 662 (2d Cir. 1996)

(citation omitted). The Court will accept as true Plaintiff’s allegations, and draw all inferences

in Plaintiff’s favor. See Mills v. Polar Molecular Corp., 12 F.3d 1170, 1174 (2d Cir. 1993);

Blimpie Int’l, Inc. v. Blimpie of the Keys, 371 F. Supp. 2d 469, 470-71 (S.D.N.Y. 2005). At this

stage, the Court is not concerned with weighing the evidence which would be presented at trial. 

See Chosun Int’l Inc. v. Chrisha Creations, Ltd., 413 F.3d 324, 327 (2d Cir. 2005).

B. ERISA

Congress has stated that the primary purpose of ERISA is to “protect interstate commerce

and the interests of participants in employee benefit plans and their beneficiaries, by requiring

the disclosure and reporting to participants and beneficiaries of financial and other information . .

. .” 29 U.S.C. § 1001(b). ERISA achieves these objectives “by establishing standards of

conduct, responsibility, and obligation for fiduciaries of employee benefit plans, and by

providing for appropriate remedies, sanctions, and ready access to the Federal courts.” Id. In

addition, ERISA was intended to “to protect interstate commerce, the Federal taxing power, and

the interests of participants in private pension plans and their beneficiaries by improving the

equitable character and the soundness of such plans by requiring them to vest the accrued

benefits of employees with significant periods of service, to meet minimum standards of funding,

and by requiring plan termination insurance.” 29 U.S.C. § 1001(c). 

9

Case 1:05-cv-09625-RJS Document 84 Filed 10/19/2007 Page 10 of 53

Plaintiff has pled two ERISA causes of action. First, he alleges that certain Defendants

breached their fiduciary duties under ERISA. Second, he alleges that his employment was

terminated in violation of ERISA. Both claims are discussed, in turn.

1. Breach of Fiduciary Duty under Section 502 of ERISA

Section 502 of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. § 1132, provides a number of causes of action to

enforce ERISA’s regulation of employee benefit plans. The rights enforced by Section 502 are

found in each employee benefit plan, in the statutes that make-up ERISA, and in the common-

law of ERISA as developed by the courts. Plaintiff’s first ERISA claim is for breach of fiduciary

duties. Plaintiff brings this action as a former Trustee of the MTDCTF and as a participant in the

Pension and Welfare Plans.8 (PSAC ¶ 24.) Plaintiff claims that Proskauer, Virga, Pocino,

O’Brien, and Carron9 breached their fiduciary duties owed towards the MTDC Pension, Annuity,

and Welfare Plans. (Id.) Section 404 of ERISA describes four affirmative duties for fiduciaries: 

(1) exclusive purpose; (2) prudence; (3) diversification; and (4) acting in accordance with the

plan. See 29 U.S.C. § 1104. Plaintiff seeks injunctive and equitable relief pursuant to 29 U.S.C.

§ 1132(a). ( PSAC ¶ 24.) 

Plaintiff alleges that Proskauer, serving as counsel to MTDC and MTDCTF, acted as a

fiduciary as that term is defined in 29 U.S.C. § 1002(21). Plaintiff merely alleges, on

information and belief, that Proskauer was retained as a “Fund fiduciary.” (PSAC ¶ 31.) He

alleges that Proskauer is a fiduciary of the pension, annuity, and welfare plans because it went

8Plaintiff does not claim that he was a participant in the Training Fund, so he cannot

bring an ERISA action against the Training Fund. (See PSAC ¶¶ 72-75.)

9 LIUNA is never specifically named as a Defendant in this count.

10

Case 1:05-cv-09625-RJS Document 84 Filed 10/19/2007 Page 11 of 53

beyond merely providing legal advice. (Id.) Proskauer also allegedly usurped the Trustees’

powers by dictating certain courses of action, rather than merely advising the Trustees. (Id. ¶

33.) According to Plaintiff, Proskauer undertook discretionary control and authority in the

administration of the MTDC. (Id. ¶¶ 34-75.) The allegations include: Proskauer selected Virga

for the position of Director based on a pre-existing relationship, despite Virga’s lack of adequate

credentials (id. ¶ 35); Proskauer attorneys attended Trust Fund and Executive Board meetings,

even though their attendance was not mandatory (id. ¶ 36); Proskauer’s presence deterred

opposition to Proskauer’s views on various matters (id. ¶ 38); Proskauer wrote the minutes for

several, high-level meetings, and billed the MTDC for time devoted to this effort – work which

Plaintiff claims was unnecessary and costly (id. ¶¶ 40-49); Proskauer attorneys traveled to

MTDCTF meetings at the expense of the MTDC (id. ¶¶ 51-53); Proskauer took over MTDC’s

delinquency work (id. ¶¶ 54-59); Proskauer favored litigation over settlement in a particular case

(id. ¶¶ 60-67); Proskauer advised against taking any legal action against Carlos Mellace, who at

one time was a co-administrator of MTDCTF (id. ¶¶ 68-71); and Proskauer submitted a bill for

$49,192.50 for services related to a real estate purchase under the Training Fund, which Plaintiff

claims was not authorized (id. ¶¶ 72-75). 

With respect to the other Defendants named in this cause of action, Plaintiff alleges a

number of other breaches of fiduciary duties, including: the authorization of a vehicle for Virga’s

use (id. ¶¶ 81-84); Virga’s decision to provide breakfast for himself and other employees (id. ¶

85); the payment of welfare benefits to at least one expelled member of the union – a matter

which Plaintiff investigated and Proskauer attempted to conceal (id. ¶¶ 90-98); Virga’s failure to

report account delinquencies (id. ¶¶ 100-11); O’Brien’s recommendation to hire Lazard Asset

11

Case 1:05-cv-09625-RJS Document 84 Filed 10/19/2007 Page 12 of 53

Management (“Lazard”) to manage plan assets without disclosing that O’Brien’s son, a recent

college graduate, had been hired by Lazard (id. ¶¶ 112-15); the conflict of interest due to

Proskauer’s representation of Lazard (id.); the all-expense-paid golfing trips to exclusive golf

resorts enjoyed by Pocino and his wife (id. ¶¶ 116-18); Proskauer’s revision of an investment

management agreement to establish higher fees (id. ¶¶ 119-21, 126-27); Proskauer’s use of plan

assets to prove Plaintiff was criminally liable for assaulting Singh (id. ¶¶ 122-24); Proskauer’s,

Virga’s, O’Brien’s, and Carron’s conspiracy to preclude Plaintiff from attending Trust Fund and

Executive Board meetings (id. ¶ 125); Proskauer’s, Virga’s, O’Brien’s, and Carron’s conspiracy

to deny Plaintiff access to records (id.); and Proskauer’s erroneous advice to MTDCTF regarding

the Pension Plan’s Summary Plan Description (id. ¶¶ 130-35). 

The Court begins its analysis of these claims with an examination of the standing

requirement under Section 502 of ERISA. Section 502 names three classes of persons who may

commence an action for breach of a fiduciary duty: (1) a participant or beneficiary, (2) the

Secretary of Labor, and (3) a fiduciary. 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a); see McCabe v. Trombley, 867 F.

Supp. 120, 125 n.3 (N.D.N.Y. 1994) (“Section 1132 is the provision which defines the scope of

the court’s subject matter jurisdiction over the instant suit, in which plaintiff alleges a breach of

fiduciary duty.”). Plaintiff brings this cause of action as a former Trustee of the MTDCTF, as

well as a plan participant. 

As a former Trustee, Plaintiff lacks standing to allege a breach of fiduciary duties. In

Chemung Canal Trust Co. v. Sovran Bank/Md., 939 F.2d 12 (2d Cir. 1991), the Second Circuit

long ago held that a former fiduciary lacks standing to claim a breach of ERISA’s fiduciary

duties, id. at 14. The Second Circuit considered the list of people that Section 502 allows to sue,

12

Case 1:05-cv-09625-RJS Document 84 Filed 10/19/2007 Page 13 of 53

and concluded that “[t]he statute names only three classes of persons who may commence an

action, and a former fiduciary is not one of them.” Id. The Second Circuit went on to explain

that the list in Section 502 was “exclusive” and that the statute’s legislative history indicated no

intent to “grant a former fiduciary a continuing right to sue on behalf of the plan . . . .” Id. 

Accordingly, Plaintiff lacks standing to sue as a former Trustee.10

Plaintiff also claims standing as a plan participant. Standing requirements for a plan

participant differ depending on kind of relief requested by Plaintiff.11 While “a plan participant

may have Article III standing to obtain injunctive relief related to ERISA’s disclosure and

fiduciary duty requirements without a showing of individual harm to the participant[,]” Plaintiff

must have “suffered an injury-in-fact” to claim restitution or disgorgement. Cent. States Se. &

Sw. Areas Health & Welfare Fund v. Merck-Medco Managed Care, L.L.C., 433 F.3d 181, 199-

200 (2d Cir. 2005); see also New York Dist. Council of Carpenters Pension Fund v. Savasta, No.

99 Civ. 11362, 2005 WL 22872, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 4, 2005) (noting that Section 502(a)(3)

provides for limited relief, and not “classic compensatory and punitive damages.”).

The PSAC contains two instances where the Plaintiff alleges that he was personally

affected by the alleged breaches of fiduciary duty. First, Plaintiff claims that Proskauer

expended plan assets starting in February 2005 to prove Plaintiff was guilty of criminal charges

(PSAC ¶ 122); and second, that Proskauer, Virga, O’Brien, and Carron conspired to deny

10The Court is perplexed that counsel for Plaintiff did not research this point before filing

the various proposed amended complaints, or retreat from this position in her reply brief after
being presented with this on-point authority. 

11 Plaintiff requests various kinds of relief, including, but not limited to, restitution and

disgorgement. (PSAC ¶ 135(III)). 

13

Case 1:05-cv-09625-RJS Document 84 Filed 10/19/2007 Page 14 of 53

Plaintiff access to Fund records and to preclude him from attending Trust Fund and Executive

Board meetings (id. ¶ 125). The Court will assume that Plaintiff has adequate participant

standing for these two allegations because of these specific claims in the PSAC that Plaintiff was

personally injured. 

Standing, however, does not end the matter: Fund Defendants argue that even if Plaintiff

has standing, he has not pled a breach of any duty, because no interest of his in the Fund has

been denied or taken away. The Court agrees. An employer’s investigation of allegation of

sexual harassment “is not a gratuitous or optional undertaking; under federal law, an employer’s

failure to investigate may allow a jury to impose liability on the employer.” See Malik v. Carrier

Corp., 202 F.3d 97, 105 (2d Cir. 2000). Thus, Fund Defendants had “an affirmative duty to

investigate the report of an allegation of sexual harassment.” Id. at 109. Furthermore, Proskauer

cannot be sued for a breach of fiduciary duties in investigating Singh’s allegations because, inter

alia, its services were authorized by the Trustees, and do not “amount to illegal profits or ill-

gotten gains derived directly from defendants’ alleged culpable acts.” See Savasta, 2005 WL

22872, at *2-3 (holding that fees paid to a non-fiduciary pursuant to a service agreement with a

union fund are not actionable as disgorgement under Section 502 of ERISA). Although Section

510 of ERISA may permit a cause of action against a fund attorney, see Greenwood Mills, Inc. v.

Burris, 130 F. Supp. 2d 949, 960-61 (M.D.Tenn. 2001), Plaintiff must allege far more egregious

conduct than what he alleges here, which is nothing more than his disagreement with

Proskauer’s role and some of their fees. 

Plaintiff’s second allegation of breach is also unfounded. Fund Defendants’ decision to

preclude Plaintiff from attending a meeting of the Trustees and accessing Fund records, even if

14

Case 1:05-cv-09625-RJS Document 84 Filed 10/19/2007 Page 15 of 53

true, does not state a breach of fiduciary duty recognized by statute, any plan, or the common-

law. Plaintiff’s allegations do not state a claim, in large part, because they are far afield from

ERISA’s purpose, as well as the statutory rights and rights at common-law that ERISA seeks to

protect. See 29 U.S.C. §§1001(b)-(c), 1104, 1132(a); see also Massachusetts v. Morash, 490

U.S. 107, 112 (1989) (“ERISA was passed by Congress in 1974 to safeguard employees from the

abuse and mismanagement of funds that had been accumulated to finance various types of

employee benefits.”); Ancekewicz v. Long Island Univ., No. 02 Civ. 4490, 2005 WL 1411917, at

*8 (E.D.N.Y. June 15, 2005) (“ERISA’s goal of protecting [pension and other] benefits from

interference does not transform ERISA’s statutory scheme into a federal job protection scheme.”

(quoting Raymond v. Mobil Oil Corp., 983 F.2d 1528, 1539 (10th Cir. 1993)) (alteration in

original). Nothing about precluding Plaintiff from meetings about his alleged sexual assault,

even if that assault never occurred, remotely threatens the management of Plaintiff’s benefits. 

Proskauer also argues that Plaintiff has not sufficiently pled that Proskauer is a fiduciary

under 29 U.S.C. § 1002(21). The statute states, in relevant part:

a person is a fiduciary with respect to a plan to the extent (i) he
exercises any discretionary authority or discretionary control
respecting management of such plan or exercises any authority or
control respecting management or disposition of its assets, (ii) he
renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation, direct
or indirect, with respect to any moneys or other property of such
plan, or has any authority or responsibility to do so, or (iii) he has
any discretionary authority or discretionary responsibility in the
administration of such plan. 

29 U.S.C.A. § 1002(21)(A). “This definition requires (1) showing that the plan assets are at

issue and (2) that the individual defendants exercised authority or control relating to the

management or disposition of such assets.” Maney v. Fischer, No. 96 Civ. 0561, 1998 WL

15

Case 1:05-cv-09625-RJS Document 84 Filed 10/19/2007 Page 16 of 53

151023, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 31, 1998). Courts have construed broadly the definition of

“fiduciary” contained in ERISA. See Mertens v. Hewitt Assocs., 508 U.S. 248, 262 (1993). 

“[W]hether or not an individual or entity is an ERISA fiduciary must be determined by focusing

on the function performed, rather than on the title held.” Blatt v. Marshall & Lassman, 812 F.2d

810, 812 (2d Cir. 1987) (holding that defendants were fiduciaries because they exercised actual

control over plan assets). Relying on the Department of Labor’s regulations promulgated under

ERISA, the Second Circuit has explained that:

[A]n attorney, accountant, actuary or consultant who renders legal,
accounting, actuarial or consulting services to an employee benefit
plan . . . [is not] a fiduciary to the plan solely by virtue of the
rendering of such services, absent a showing that such consultant
(a) exercises discretionary authority or discretionary control
respecting the management of the plan, (b) exercises authority or
control respecting management or disposition of the plan’s assets,
(c) renders investment advice for a fee, direct or indirect, with
respect to the assets of the plan, or has any authority or
responsibility to do so, or (d) has any discretionary authority or
discretionary responsibility in the administration of the plan.

F.H. Krear & Co. v. Nineteen Named Trustees, 810 F.2d 1250, 1259-60 (2d Cir. 1987) (quoting

29 C.F.R. § 2509.75-5 (1986)). 

Plaintiff’s conclusory allegations merely portray Proskauer as a zealous advocate for the

Fund, and Plaintiff’s personal opposition to Proskauer’s role or billing practices fails to make

Proskauer a fiduciary. The allegations in the PSAC fall far short of claiming that Proskauer had

discretionary authority or control over the Fund; that Proskauer managed Fund assets; rendered

investment advice; or had discretionary authority or responsibility over the administration of the

Fund. While Plaintiff also makes many conclusory allegations about Proskauer’s hands-on

involvement with the Fund, nothing in the PSAC is sufficient to allege that Proskauer crossed the

16

Case 1:05-cv-09625-RJS Document 84 Filed 10/19/2007 Page 17 of 53

threshold from legal counsel to that of a fund fiduciary. See Acosta v. Pace Local I-300 Health

Fund, No. 04 Civ. 3885, 2007 WL 496877, at *8-9 (D. N.J. Feb. 9, 2007) (holding that

conclusory claims that lawyer acted as fiduciary for ERISA purposes did not state a claim upon

which relief could be granted). Instead, Plaintiff’s allegations merely demonstrate that

Proskauer’s services were typical of those provided by legal counsel, rather than those of a

fiduciary. See, e.g., Health Cost Controls of Illinois, Inc. v. Washington, 187 F.3d 703, 709 (7th

Cir. 1999) (“[L]awyers and other professionals who render services to the plan’s administrator

do not exercise any decisionmaking authority over the plan or plan assets; the power to act for

the plan is essential to status as a fiduciary under ERISA.”) (internal quotations omitted); see

Custer v. Sweeney, 89 F.3d 1156, 1163 (4th Cir. 1996) (affirming dismissal of claim that lawyer

was fiduciary because allegations in complaint were insufficient to allege status as fiduciary)

(citing 5A Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1357 at

317-18 (2d ed. 1990) (noting that court need not accept plaintiff’s “‘unwarranted deductions,’

‘footless conclusions of law,’ or ‘sweeping legal conclusions cast in the form of factual

allegations’” (footnotes omitted)); Bd. of Trs. of Teamsters Local 918 Pension Fund v. Freeburg

& Freeburg, C.P.A., No. 98 Civ. 4895, 1999 WL 803895, at *2 n.1 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 28, 1999)

(“Professionals, such as attorneys or accountants, are not fiduciaries unless they provide more

than ordinary professional services to a plan.”); Carpenters’ Local Union No. 964 Pension Fund

v. Silverman, No. 93 Civ. 8787, 1995 WL 378539, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. June 26, 1995) (“The mere

provision of usual or ordinary professional services, such as by attorneys, does not imply

17

Case 1:05-cv-09625-RJS Document 84 Filed 10/19/2007 Page 18 of 53

fiduciary status.”).12 Accordingly, Proskauer cannot be sued as an ERISA fiduciary and

Plaintiff’s claim in this regard fails. 

Fund Defendants also contend that several of Plaintiff’s allegations are barred by

ERISA’s statute of limitations. ERISA requires that an action for breach of fiduciary duty be

brought: 

(1) six years after (A) the date of the last action which constituted
a part of the breach or violation, or (B) in the case of an omission
the latest date on which the fiduciary could have cured the breach
or violation, or (2) three years after the earliest date on which the
plaintiff had actual knowledge of the breach or violation; except
that in the case of fraud or concealment, such action may be
commenced not later than six years after the date of discovery of
such breach or violation. 

29 U.S.C. § 1113. Fund Defendants argue that Plaintiff’s position as a Trustee gave Plaintiff

actual knowledge of many of the alleged breaches of fiduciary duty brought in this case. 

Plaintiff became a Trustee of the MTDC in August 1996, see Ello, 2006 WL 2270871, at *2, and

remained a Trustee until his resignation on April 1, 2005, which Plaintiff characterizes as a

constructive discharge. (PSAC ¶¶ 188-89.) It is not clear, however, whether the three-year

limitation or the six-year limitation applies in this case, or if some combination of the three- and

six-year limitations apply to different claims. 

The three-year limitation applies “three years after the earliest date on which the plaintiff

had actual knowledge of the breach or violation . . . .” 29 U.S.C. § 1113(2). “[A] plaintiff has

‘actual knowledge of the breach or violation’ within the meaning of ERISA § 413(2), 29 U.S.C.

12 For an example of a case where an attorney became a fiduciary, see Mason Tenders
Dist. Council Pension Fund v. Messera, 958 F. Supp. 869, 882 (S.D.N.Y. 1997) (holding that
lawyer who was member of fund’s investment committee who made investment decisions was a
fiduciary). 

18

Case 1:05-cv-09625-RJS Document 84 Filed 10/19/2007 Page 19 of 53

§ 1113(2), when he has knowledge of all material facts necessary to understand that an ERISA

fiduciary has breached his or her duty or otherwise violated the Act.” Caputo v. Pfizer, Inc., 267

F.3d 181, 193 (2d Cir. 2001). By contrast, “the six-year statute of limitations should be applied

to cases in which a fiduciary: (1) breached its duty by making a knowing misrepresentation or

omission of a material fact to induce an employee/beneficiary to act to his detriment; or (2)

engaged in acts to hinder the discovery of a breach of fiduciary duty.” Id. at 190. 

At this stage of the case, Defendants have opposed Plaintiff’s Motion to File a Proposed

Second Amended Complaint on futility grounds. Defendants argue that the PSAC fails to state a

claim upon which relief can be granted. Much of what Fund Defendants ask the Court to decide

on the statue of limitations defense cannot be decided on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion because the

Court must limit its review to the PSAC, documents attached to the PSAC, and documents

incorporated into the PSAC by reference. See Newman, 102 F.3d at 662. “Dismissal for failure

to state a claim based on a statute of limitations is appropriate only if a complaint shows clearly

that a claim is not timely.” Toussaint v. JJ Weiser & Co., No. 04 Civ. 2592, 2005 WL 356834,

at *11 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 13, 2005); see also Harris v. City of New York, 186 F.3d 243, 251 (2d Cir.

1999). The PSAC, in all but a single instance, which is discussed below, fails to identify when

the alleged breaches took place. Fund Defendants’ counsel asks the Court to consider the

affidavit of John J. Virga, which offers dates for the alleged breaches, to fill the void left by the

PSAC. Virga’s affidavit, however, does not fit within the three categories of materials that this

Court can consider when Defendants merely contest the sufficiency of the pleadings, as they

19

Case 1:05-cv-09625-RJS Document 84 Filed 10/19/2007 Page 20 of 53

have done here. Therefore, the Court will not consider Virga’s affidavit to decide the statute of

limitations defense.13

One of Plaintiff’s claims is susceptible to adjudication on the pleadings. Plaintiff claims

that the Trustees’ decision to retain Carlos Mellace, who retired in December 1998, was a breach

of fiduciary duty. (PSAC ¶¶ 68-71.) Under the more lenient, six-year statute of limitations,

Plaintiff’s last opportunity to bring a claim for this alleged breach was December 2004.14 

Plaintiff’s first Complaint in this case was filed on November 15, 2005, which is beyond the six-

year limitation period. This claim is barred under the statute of limitations and therefore is

futile.15 

13Fund Defendants are correct to note, however, that the existence of these documents
may be relevant to the good faith and due diligence of Plaintiff and his counsel in making the
allegations in the PSAC. 

14Because Plaintiff himself was a Trustee starting in 1996, he also had actual knowledge

of this alleged breach well before the three-year statute of limitations ran.

15Counsel for LIUNA and Pocino urge the Court to hold that Plaintiff violated Fed. R.

Civ. P. 23.1 by failing to make a demand on the MTDCTF to bring suit, citing Diduck v.
Kaszycki & Sons Contractors, Inc., 974 F.2d 270, 287 (2d Cir. 1992). This argument is rejected,
because Diduck’s holding was limited to claims brought under Section 502(g)(2), 29 U.S.C. §
1132(g)(2), which can only be brought by fiduciaries. See Coan v. Kaufman, 457 F.3d 250, 258
(2d Cir. 2006) (explaining that a fiduciary’s right of action under Section 502(g)(2) must comply
with Fed. R. Civ. P. 23.1, but that a claim brought as a plan participant under Section 502(a)(2)
is not controlled by Diduck). Plaintiff, as a participant, need not comply with Rule 23.1, because
he may not proceed under Section 502(g)(2), and Diduck is only controlling as to the latter.
Fund Defendants argue that Plaintiff’s claims are barred by the doctrines of unclean

hands, in pari delicto, and acquiescence, because Plaintiff served as a Trustee when many of the
events in the PSAC took place. The Court cannot decide this issue without considering the
affidavit of John J. Virga. For reasons explained above, Virga’s affidavit does not fit within the
three categories of materials that this Court can consider when Defendants merely contest the
sufficiency of the pleadings. Fund Defendants’ citations suggesting otherwise miss the mark,
and merely reinforce the long-standing practice described in Newman. See San Leandro
Emergency Med. Group Profit Sharing Plan v. Philip Morris Companies, Inc., 75 F.3d 801, 808-
09 (2d Cir. 1996) (holding that a district court may review an entire document if a portion of the
document is quoted in the complaint); Cortec Indus., Inc. v. Sum Holding L.P., 949 F.2d 42, 47-

20

Case 1:05-cv-09625-RJS Document 84 Filed 10/19/2007 Page 21 of 53

2. Unlawful Discharge Under ERISA Section 510

Section 510 of ERISA (“Section 510”), 29 U.S.C. § 1140, makes it unlawful for any

person to discharge or take other adverse action against employees for exercising their rights

under an employee benefit plan or for the purpose of interfering with the attainment of any right

to which employees may become entitled.16 As a second ERISA claim, Plaintiff alleges that

Pocino, Proskauer, and Virga illegally interfered with his rights under Section 510. (PSAC ¶¶

136-96.) Specifically, Plaintiff claims that he was preemptively and constructively discharged

after Singh accused Plaintiff of sexual assault. According to Plaintiff, he was improperly denied

access to Fund records and improperly barred from attending a meeting of the Trustees as a

result of Singh’s allegations. (Id. ¶¶ 138, 162-75, 178-92.) Additionally, Plaintiff claims he was

constructively discharged as retaliation for his whistle-blowing efforts to expose waste,

48 (2d Cir. 1991) (allowing the district court, in a securities action, to consider a prospectus). 

16Section 510 of ERISA states, in relevant part, that:

It shall be unlawful for any person to discharge, fine, suspend,
expel, discipline, or discriminate against a participant or
beneficiary for exercising any right to which he is entitled under
the provisions of an employee benefit plan, this subchapter, section
1201 of this title, or the Welfare and Pension Plans Disclosure Act
[29 U.S.C.A. § 301 et seq.], or for the purpose of interfering with
the attainment of any right to which such participant may become
entitled under the plan, this subchapter, or the Welfare and Pension
Plans Disclosure Act. It shall be unlawful for any person to
discharge, fine, suspend, expel, or discriminate against any person
because he has given information or has testified or is about to
testify in any inquiry or proceeding relating to this chapter or the
Welfare and Pension Plans Disclosure Act.

29 U.S.C. § 1140 (alteration in original).

21

Case 1:05-cv-09625-RJS Document 84 Filed 10/19/2007 Page 22 of 53

corruption, and graft within the Fund, which Plaintiff says include Singh’s allegations against

Plaintiff. (Id. ¶¶ 137, 141-61, 176, 192.)

Section 510 of ERISA “was designed primarily to prevent unscrupulous employers from

discharging or harassing their employees in order to keep them from obtaining vested pension

rights.” Dister v. Continental Group, Inc., 859 F.2d 1108, 1111 (2d Cir. 1988). “[A] § 510

claim involves three elements: 1) prohibited employer conduct; 2) taken for the purpose of

interfering; 3) with the attainment of any right to which the employee may become entitled.” 

Hayes v. Compass Group USA, Inc., 343 F. Supp. 2d 112, 121 (D. Conn. 2004). “In order to

prevail on a Section 510 claim, the plaintiff must demonstrate that an employer, in taking

adverse employment action against the employee, ‘was at least in part motivated by the specific

intent to engage in activity prohibited by § 510.’” Tavoloni v. Mount Sinai Med. Ctr., 26 F.

Supp. 2d 678, 680 (S.D.N.Y. 1998) (quoting Dister, 859 F.2d at 1111). The Second Circuit has

described the demonstration of specific intent under Section 510 as “[a]n essential element of

plaintiff’s proof under the statute . . . .” Dister, 859 F.2d at 1111. 

a. Claim Against Fund Defendants and Proskauer

Plaintiff claims that Pocino, Proskauer, and Virga prevented him from attending meetings

of the Trustees and denied him access to Fund records in response to Singh’s allegations. In

particular, Plaintiff claims that Virga falsely denied that a specific Trustees meeting had been

scheduled, and subsequently withheld the minutes of that meeting from Plaintiff. (PSAC ¶¶ 165-

66, 169.) Plaintiff alleges that Pocino told Plaintiff that Proskauer had advised Pocino to inform

Plaintiff that Plaintiff was to “stay away from the Trust Funds and its employees.” (Id. ¶ 172.) 

This directive, in effect, “suspended [Plaintiff] from the bulk of this [sic] salaried positions[,]”

22

Case 1:05-cv-09625-RJS Document 84 Filed 10/19/2007 Page 23 of 53

and from ascertaining what Singh had said about Plaintiff. (Id. ¶ 173-75.) According to

Plaintiff, Pocino and Proskauer issued the directive to keep Plaintiff from “pursuing the welfare

fund fraud and the Singh matter.” (Id. ¶ 176.) 

For Plaintiff’s claim to survive a motion to dismiss, he must plead that the Fund’s

motivation for terminating his employment was to deny him a right protected under Section 510. 

See Vallone v. Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, NY Branch, No. 02 Civ. 6064, 2004 WL 2912887,

at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 14, 2004) (“[A]n employer’s intent is the central question under § 510”);

see also Blessing v. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., No. 02 Civ. 3874, 2003 WL 470338, at *3

(S.D.N.Y. Feb. 24, 2003) (dismissing Section 510 claim because plaintiff did not “allege that he

was terminated in order to avoid paying him severance”). The courts of this District, as well as

the Second Circuit, have made clear that “no claim ‘lies where the loss of pension benefits was a

mere consequence of, but not a motivating factor behind,’ an adverse employment action.” 

Tavoloni, 26 F. Supp. 2d at 680 (quoting Dister, 859 F.2d at 1111); see also Burke v. Gregory,

356 F. Supp. 2d 179, 187 (N.D.N.Y. 2005) (dismissing a Section 510 claim because plaintiff

failed to demonstrate that her termination was motivated by her employer’s desire to deprive her

of plan benefits); Romano v. Verizon Commc’ns, Inc., No. 01 Civ. 6737, 2002 WL 472192, at *5

(S.D.N.Y. Mar. 27, 2002) (“Plaintiffs also fail to allege that the defendants acted with the intent

to prevent plaintiffs from attaining enhanced benefits.”). 

Plaintiff has not alleged, as the plain words of the statute require, that his rights were

impaired as a result of “exercising a[] right to which he is entitled under the provisions of an

employee benefit plan.” 29 U.S.C. § 1140. Nor has he claimed that he was discharged in order

to “interfer[e] with the attainment of any right.” Id. In addition, Plaintiff has failed to plead

23

Case 1:05-cv-09625-RJS Document 84 Filed 10/19/2007 Page 24 of 53

adequately that his employer infringed on any of his protected rights. Only rights referenced in

Section 510, typically plan benefits, are protected. The fact that Plaintiff’s benefits were

terminated after he was constructively discharged is not sufficient to plead the requisite intent to

sustain this claim. See Kendall v. Fisse, No. 00 Civ. 5154, 2004 WL 1196811, at *7 (E.D.N.Y.

May 25, 2004) (“Plaintiff must prove more than the simple fact that his termination precluded

him from vesting into a pension plan; he must also show that Citibank had an unlawful purpose

in firing him.”). Even construing the PSAC broadly, and in a light most favorable to Plaintiff, it

is impossible to identify the right that Plaintiff’s employer was denying to Plaintiff.17 See

McLellan v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours & Co., Inc., No. 04 Civ. 314, 2006 WL 3751583, at *20

(W.D.N.Y. Dec. 19, 2006) (“Nevertheless, relief under § 510 for adverse action taken for

exercising a right under the Plan is unavailable to McLellan who, according to a careful review

of the Complaint, fails to identify any such right exercised.”). 

The “rights” that Plaintiff claims he was denied include the right to attend a Trustees’

meeting about allegations of criminal conduct by Plaintiff, to have access to Fund records, and,

presumably, to retain his status as a Trustee. These “rights,” however, are not actionable under

Section 510. Section 510 protects employees from unscrupulous employers that seek to

improperly deny employees their pension rights. See Dister, 859 F.2d at 1111; see also Quinby

v. WestLB AG, No. 04 Civ. 7406, 2007 WL 1153994, at *15 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 19, 2007) (finding

inference of discrimination when plaintiff was terminated two weeks before pension was to

vest); Infantolino v. Joint Indus. Bd. of the Elec. Indus., No. 06 Civ. 520, 2007 WL 879415, at *8

17This defect in Plaintiff’s pleading applies with equal force to his claim that he was

constructively discharged in retaliation for his whistle-blowing efforts.

24

Case 1:05-cv-09625-RJS Document 84 Filed 10/19/2007 Page 25 of 53

(E.D.N.Y. Mar. 15, 2007) (denying motion to dismiss when plaintiff alleged that his benefits

were terminated as retaliation for filing a discrimination lawsuit). Section 510 is not a vehicle

for Plaintiff to challenge any Defendant’s decision to bar Plaintiff from a Trustees’ meeting that

was investigating Plaintiff’s alleged criminal conduct, or the Trustees’ ultimate decision to seek

Plaintiff’s resignation. See Ancekewicz, 2005 WL 1411917, at *8 (“ERISA’s goal of protecting

[pension and other] benefits from interference does not transform ERISA’s statutory scheme into

a federal job protection scheme.” (quoting Raymond v. Mobil Oil Corp., 983 F.2d 1528, 1539

(10th Cir. 1993)) (alteration in original). Therefore, Plaintiff’s Section 510 claim is futile.18

18 Proskauer argues that the lack of an employment relationship between Plaintiff and

Proskauer bars the Section 510 claim. While Proskauer correctly notes that “courts in this
District have held that § 510 only proscribes interference with the employment relationship," 
Tirone v. New York Stock Exchange, Inc., No. 05 Civ. 8703, 2006 WL 2773862, at *3 (S.D.N.Y.
Sept. 28, 2006) (collecting cases), it does not necessarily follow that Proskauer could not
interfere with Plaintiff’s employment relationship simply because it did not directly employ
Plaintiff. See Swanson v. U.A. Local 13 Pension Plan, 779 F. Supp. 690, 700-01 (W.D.N.Y
1991) (noting that Section 510 reaches conduct which fundamentally changes the employer-
employee relationship so as to interfere with pension rights and that “not only employers may be
liable” of such conduct). However, as Plaintiff has not adequately alleged the violation of any
right protected under Section 510, supra, the Court need not address the issue of whether
Proskauer, serving in an advisory role to Plaintiff’s employer, could be held liable for such
conduct. 

Proskauer also argues that Plaintiff, while serving as a Trustee, had no actual

employment relationship with MTDC Funds (Fund Def.'s Br. in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss
Second Am. Compl. at 18.) When queried by the Court at oral argument on the instant Motion,
Plaintiff claimed that his employment relationship with MTDC Funds was evident throughout
the Amended Complaint, but could not point to any particular page where the employment
relationship was definitively stated. (Hr'g Tr., Sept. 7, 2007.) If Plaintiff never had an actual
employment relationship with MTDC Funds, Plaintiff’s Section 510 claim would be futile.
However, as noted above, the Court need not resolve the dispute over Plaintiff’s true
employment status as his claims are dismissed on other grounds.

25

Case 1:05-cv-09625-RJS Document 84 Filed 10/19/2007 Page 26 of 53

b. Union Defendants

The retaliation claim against Union Defendants,19 however, is a different story. Plaintiff

has alleged that he has consistently reported fraud and abuse within the Fund, and, in particular,

that he informed Virga that Joseph Giardina, and at least four others, were improperly receiving

benefits. (PSAC ¶¶ 144-52.) Following up on this supposed complaint, Plaintiff alleges that he

sought a meeting with a variety of LIUNA officials, including the Inspector General in late

November 2004. (Id. ¶¶ 152.)20 Plaintiff later objected to a recommendation to merely terminate

the improper benefits, because Plaintiff thought that an audit was necessary to determine if

others were improperly receiving benefits. (Id. ¶¶ 153-61.) Soon thereafter, Virga allegedly

expressed his “displeasure” that Plaintiff had referred to the matter to LIUNA. (Id. ¶ 160.) 

According to Plaintiff, it was soon after this series of events that Plaintiff was asked by Pocino in

mid-March 2005 to resign from his LIUNA and GYNLECET positions, and it is to those

positions (and not to any positions with the MTDCF) that Plaintiff seeks reinstatement. (Id. ¶¶

177, 188, and 196.) 

“Whistle-blowers” are protected under Section 510 of ERISA from adverse employment

actions relating to whistle-blowing activity. The relevant portion of Section 510 provides that

“[i]t shall be unlawful for any person to discharge, fine, suspend, expel, or discriminate against

19“Union Defendants” consists of LIUNA and Raymond Pocino, Vice President and

Eastern Regional Manager of LIUNA, in his individual and official capacities. Although
Plaintiff’s allegations against Union Defendants focus principally on Pocino, on at least one
occasion Plaintiff alleges that Pocino was acting on behalf of LIUNA, an allegation which could
be construed as a claim against LIUNA based on the theory of respondeat superior. (PSAC ¶
137.) The Court cannot say that such an allegation would be futile. However, Plaintiff would be
well advised to clarify his theory of liability in his Amended Complaint. 

20The PSAC lists two paragraphs as 152. The cite above is to the second such paragraph.

26

Case 1:05-cv-09625-RJS Document 84 Filed 10/19/2007 Page 27 of 53

any person because he has given information or has testified or is about to testify in any inquiry

or proceeding relating to this chapter or the Welfare and Pension Plans Disclosure Act.” 29

U.S.C. § 1140. It is unarguable that termination from employment is an adverse employment

action covered by Section 510. However, Union Defendants argue that Plaintiff fails to allege

that Union Defendants acted with the requisite intent to deprive plaintiff of some protected

ERISA right or benefit, and that Plaintiff fails to allege that he engaged in protected conduct

under Section 510. 

Regarding the first point, “to prevail on a Section 510 claim, the plaintiff must

demonstrate that an employer, in taking adverse employment action against the employee, ‘was

at least in part motivated by the specific intent to engage in activity prohibited by § 510.’”

Tavolini, 26 F. Supp. 2d at 680 (quoting Dister, 859 F.2d at 1111). According to Union

Defendants, Plaintiff has failed to satisfy this element because he only has alleged that he was

deprived of his rights as a Trustee of the Fund, and because any actions by Pocino were in not in

his Union capacity. Relatedly, Union Defendants argue that Plaintiff’s alleged whistleblower

activities related only to the operation of the Fund, and not to the operation of LIUNA. These

arguments, while potentially dispositive at the summary judgment stage, fail to demonstrate that

Plaintiff’s proposed amendment is futile. While some of Plaintiff’s allegations involve limits on

his role as a Trustee of the Fund, and by themselves do not make out a Section 510 claim, the

core of his claim is that he lost his job at LIUNA because of his complaints regarding fraudulent

administration of the Fund. And while the PSAC is a little vague about which capacity Pocino

was acting when he sought Plaintiff’s resignation, it cannot be said that Plaintiff’s allegations

regarding Pocino’s motives, or what hat he was wearing, bar the claim. Thus, given the

27

Case 1:05-cv-09625-RJS Document 84 Filed 10/19/2007 Page 28 of 53

plausibility of Plaintiff’s claims regarding Pocino’s conduct, and, in particular, the motives for

that conduct, the scope of Plaintiff’s whistle-blower activities is best left for either summary

judgment or a trial. 

Defendant’s second point asks whether Plaintiff’s whistle-blowing activities involved an

“inquiry” for purposes of Section 510. Here, Plaintiff is helped by the Second Circuit’s decision

in Nicolaou v. Horizon Media, 402 F.3d 325, 330 (2d Cir. 2005), in which the Court held that

“the proper focus is not on the formality or informality of the circumstances under which an

individual gives information, but rather on whether the circumstances can fairly be deemed to

constitute an ‘inquiry’” and thus be entitled to protection under Section 510. Plaintiff adequately

alleges, though just barely, that he sought meetings with several individuals, including the

LIUNA Inspector General, to provide information about suspected fraud in benefits

disbursement. While Plaintiff does not allege he was responding to, or providing information to,

a formal inquiry, Plaintiff’s claims regarding his alleged efforts at scheduling a meeting with

decision-makers and those who might begin a formal inquiry, could constitute a Section 510

claim. Id. (noting that allegations that Plaintiff met with outside counsel and the employer’s

president sufficient to state a claim under Section 510). Thus, Plaintiff’s proposed amendment to

his second cause of action against Union Defendants may proceed, but his allegations regarding

Proskauer and Fund Defendants may not. 

C. Civil RICO

Plaintiff alleges that Proskauer, Virga, Pocino, O’Brien, and Carron, acting individually

and in concert, committed illegal acts which constitute violations of RICO. Plaintiff alleges that

the MTDCTF is the RICO enterprise. Although Plaintiff alleges a total of nineteen racketeering

28

Case 1:05-cv-09625-RJS Document 84 Filed 10/19/2007 Page 29 of 53

acts, these allegations can be reduced to a group of four allegations. First, Plaintiff claims that

Virga allowed former members of the Union, who had been proscribed from receiving benefits

pursuant to a court order, to continue to receive benefits.21 (PSAC ¶¶ 215-52.) Second, Plaintiff

alleges that Proskauer illegally received compensation for its representation of the MTDCTF in

Plaintiff’s dispute with Singh and in connection with Proskauer’s efforts in this case.22 (Id. ¶¶

253-57.) Third, Plaintiff alleges that Proskauer gave illegal gifts to Pocino, Virga, O’Brien, and

Carron.23 (Id. ¶¶ 258-84.) Finally, Plaintiff pleads that the above-named Defendants all

conspired to engage in the illegal conduct described in the PSAC.24 (Id. ¶ 285.) Plaintiff

contends that this illegal activity has injured him in two ways: first, he argues that he is liable for

the losses of the MTDCTF as a result of the illegal activity (id. ¶ 205); and second, he claims

that his property interest in the Pension Plan and Welfare Fund has been harmed because “every

dollar of loss is a dollar that is unavailable to pay benefits to plaintiff and his dependents” (id. ¶

206).

The elements of a RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) are that: (1) defendants

through the commission of two or more predicate acts; (2) constituting a “pattern”; (3) of

21Plaintiff claims that Virga violated the following federal statutes: 18 U.S.C. § 664 (theft
or embezzlement from employee benefit plan); 18 U.S.C. § 1341 (mail fraud); 18 U.S.C. § 1343
(fraud by wire, radio, or television); and 18 U.S.C. § 1957 (engaging in monetary transactions in
property derived from unspecified unlawful activity).

22Plaintiff claims that Proskauer violated 18 U.S.C. § 664 (theft or embezzlement from

employee benefit plan). 

23Plaintiff claims that Proskauer, Pocino, Virga, O’Brien and Carrion violated 18 U.S.C.

§ 1954 (offer, acceptance, or solicitation to influence operations of employee benefit plan). 

24Plaintiff claims that Defendants violated 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d) ([RICO] prohibited

activities). 

29

Case 1:05-cv-09625-RJS Document 84 Filed 10/19/2007 Page 30 of 53

“racketeering activity”; (4) directly or indirectly invested in, or maintained an interest in, or

participated in; (5) an “enterprise”; (6) the activities of which affect interstate or foreign

commerce. See Nat’l Group for Commc’n & Computers Ltd. v. Lucent Techs. Inc., 420 F. Supp.

2d 253, 270 (S.D.N.Y. 2006).25 Plaintiff must establish each element as to each individual

defendant. Id. at 270 n.28. “In order to have standing, plaintiff must also show that injuries to

its business or property were ‘proximately caused by a pattern of racketeering activity violating

Section 1962 or by individual RICO predicate acts.’” Id. at 270 (quoting Lerner v. Fleet Bank

N.A., 318 F.3d 113, 122-23 (2d Cir. 2003)).

Defendants argue that Plaintiff lacks standing to pursue a civil RICO claim because he

has not pled a sufficient injury. Defendants also argue that the PSAC does not allege any

racketeering activity and that Plaintiff has failed to plead operation and control of the alleged

enterprise. Indeed, there are more holes in Plaintiff’s RICO cause of action than in the

proverbial piece of swiss cheese. However, because the Court agrees with Defendants that

Plaintiff lacks standing under RICO to bring this claim, the Court need not reach these other

deficiencies.

Civil RICO allows “[a]ny person injured in his business or property by reason of a

violation of Section 1962” to sue for treble damages and attorneys’ fees. 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c). 

“From this language, courts have extracted the conditions a plaintiff must meet to satisfy RICO’s

2518 U.S.C. § 1962(c) states: 

It shall be unlawful for any person employed by or associated with
any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect,
interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly
or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise’s affairs through a
pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt.

30

Case 1:05-cv-09625-RJS Document 84 Filed 10/19/2007 Page 31 of 53

standing requirements: ‘(1) a violation of Section 1962; (2) injury to business or property; and

(3) causation of the injury by the violation.’” First Nationwide Bank v. Gelt Funding Corp., 27

F.3d 763, 767 (2d Cir. 1994) (quoting Hecht v. Commerce Clearing House, Inc., 897 F.2d 21, 23

(2d Cir. 1990)). Plaintiff “only has standing if, and can only recover to the extent that, he has

been injured in his business or property by the conduct constituting the violation.” Sedima,

S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U.S. 479, 496 (1985); accord First Nationwide, 27 F.3d at 768. 

Furthermore, Plaintiff must show that the alleged racketeering was both the proximate and “but-

for” cause of his injuries. See First Nationwide, 27 F.3d at 769.

The alleged injury claimed here is two-fold. First, Plaintiff claims that he, presumably as

a former fiduciary, is liable for any losses incurred as a result of Defendants’ alleged

racketeering activity. Second, Plaintiff claims that his personal property interest in the Pension

and Welfare Plans has been injured because every dollar lost is a dollar that is no longer

available to pay his benefits. Neither of these allegations is sufficient to state a claim for

standing under RICO.

Plaintiff’s putative liability as a former Trustee is not sufficient to claim an injury under

RICO. “[A]s a general rule, a cause of action does not accrue under RICO until the amount of

damages becomes clear and definite.” Motorola Credit Corp. v. Uzan, 322 F.3d 130, 135 (2d

Cir. 2003); First Nationwide, 27 F.3d at 768. Any potential liability that Plaintiff may incur as a

former Trustee has yet to materialize. A civil RICO action can only be brought when a

plaintiff’s “actual loss becomes clear and definite.” Denney v. Deutsche Bank AG, 443 F.3d 253,

266 (2d Cir. 2006); Motorola Credit Corp., 322 F.3d at 136; First Nationwide, 27 F.3d at 769. 

Thus, Plaintiff’s claim that he has been injured because he may face a lawsuit in the future is not

31

Case 1:05-cv-09625-RJS Document 84 Filed 10/19/2007 Page 32 of 53

an injury under RICO. See Hecht, 897 F.2d at 24 (holding that claim for loss of future

commissions was “too speculative to confer standing”).

Plaintiff also fails to adequately plead standing based on any losses suffered by the

Union because he has not pled any losses suffered as a direct injury to his business or property as

a result of the alleged RICO violation. See Laborers Local 17 Health & Benefit Fund v. Philip

Morris, Inc., 191 F.3d 229, 235 (2d Cir. 1999) (holding that pleading a “direct injury” is

necessary for establishing proximate causation in a RICO action). The potential direct losses

alleged here would be borne by the Union – any indirect injury to Plaintiff at some unknown

point in the future is too attenuated to confer standing under RICO. See Commer v. Am. Fed’n

of State, County & Mun. Employees, No. 01 Civ. 4260, 2003 WL 21697873, at *3 (S.D.N.Y.

July 22, 2003) (holding that injuries suffered by a third-party union did not confer standing upon

one of its former members to sue under RICO for losses incurred by all of the union’s members);

Mayes v. Local 106, No. 93 Civ. 716, 1999 WL 60135, at *3 (N.D.N.Y. Feb. 5, 1999) (“A

plaintiff cannot bring a civil suit under RICO, in a personal capacity, where the injury he alleges

has been incurred by a union of which he is a member and any derivative injury to him is no

different from that sustained by similarly situated members of the same union.”), aff’d, 201 F.3d

431 (2d Cir. 1999). Plaintiff, therefore, lacks standing in his capacity as a Plan participant to sue

under RICO. The RICO cause of action is thus futile.

32

Case 1:05-cv-09625-RJS Document 84 Filed 10/19/2007 Page 33 of 53

D. Defamation

Plaintiff’s final cause of action is for defamation against Rossein, Proskauer, Pocino,

Singh, and Columbia. (SPSAC ¶ 289.)26 Plaintiff claims that these Defendants defamed him by

making false statements in connection with the investigation of Singh’s allegations of sexual

assault against Plaintiff. 

To state a claim for defamation under New York law, Plaintiff must establish: “(1) that a

defamatory statement of fact was made concerning [Plaintiff]; (2) that the defendant published

that statement to a third party; (3) that the statement was false; (4) that there exists some degree

of fault; (5) and that there are special damages or that the statement is defamatory per se, i.e. it

disparaged the plaintiff in the way of his or her office, profession or trade.” Muzio v. Inc. Village

of Bayville, No. 99 Civ. 8605, 2006 WL 39063, at *8 (E.D.N.Y. Jan. 3, 2006). The Court will

consider the alleged defamatory statements made by each Defendant.

“While the defamation need not be plead in haec verba, ‘a pleading is only sufficient if it

adequately identifies the purported communication, and an indication of who made the

statement, when it was made, and to whom it was communicated.’” Camp Summit of

Summitville, Inc., No. 06 Civ. 4994, 2007 WL 1152894, at *10 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 16, 2007)

(quoting Scholastic, Inc. v. Stouffer, 124 F. Supp. 2d 836, 849 (S.D.N.Y. 2000)). “The central

concern is that the complaint afford defendant sufficient notice of the communications

complained of to enable him to defend himself.” Kelly v. Schmidberger, 806 F.2d 44, 46 (2d Cir.

1986) (citations omitted). Thus, “[m]ere conclusory statements that the claimant was disparaged

26Defamation includes slander, which is spoken, and libel, which is written. See Albert v.

Loksen, 239 F.3d 256, 265 (2d Cir. 2001) (stating that “spoken defamatory words are slander;
written defamatory words are libel”).

33

Case 1:05-cv-09625-RJS Document 84 Filed 10/19/2007 Page 34 of 53

by false statements are insufficient to state a defamation claim.” Scholastic, 124 F. Supp. 2d at

849; see also Ford v. Clement, 834 F. Supp. 72, 78 (S.D.N.Y. 1993) (holding that allegations of

defamation were insufficient where they failed to “give [defendant] any notice whatsoever of the

communications at issue”), aff’d, 29 F.3d 621 (2d Cir. 1994). The Court will consider the

alleged defamatory statements made by each Defendant.

1. Rossein

Merrick Rossein was retained by Proskauer on behalf of the Funds to investigate Singh’s

allegations against Plaintiff and to issue a report detailing his findings (“Rossein Report” or

“Report”). Plaintiff claims that the Rossein Report is libelous, but doesn’t identify any particular

portion of the report as containing the libelous material. The Court will liberally construe

Plaintiff’s claim to encompass the entire Report.27 

Fund Defendants argue that the contents of the Rossein Report are protected by a

qualified privilege.28 Under New York law, a “conditional, or qualified, privilege extends to a

‘communication made by one person to another upon a subject in which both have an interest.’” 

Liberman v. Gelstein, 605 N.E.2d 344, 349 (N.Y. 1992) (quoting Stillman v. Ford, 22 N.Y.2d 48,

53 (1968)). In the employment context, the qualified privilege is recognized as protecting the

27Although the entire Report is not reproduced in the SPSAC, it is both referred to in the

SPSAC and integral to the PSAC, so the Court will consider the contents of the Report. See
Chambers v. Time Warner, Inc., 282 F.3d 147, 153 (2d Cir. 2002) (“Even where a document is
not incorporated by reference, the court may nevertheless consider it where the complaint ‘relies
heavily upon its terms and effect,’ which renders the document ‘integral’ to the complaint.”
(quoting Int’l Audiotext Network, Inc. v. AT&T, 62 F.3d 69, 72 (2d Cir. 1995)); see also San
Leandro, 75 F.3d at 808. 

34

Case 1:05-cv-09625-RJS Document 84 Filed 10/19/2007 Page 35 of 53

free flow of information. See Dunson v. Tri-Maintenance & Contractors, Inc., 171 F. Supp. 2d

103, 116-17 (E.D.N.Y. 2001). Communications regarding alleged employee misconduct are

covered by the privilege. See Loksen, 239 F.3d at 272. However, a defendant can forfeit the

privilege “by making a false, defamatory statement with malice of either the common-law or

constitutional variety.” Id.; see also Liberman, 605 N.E.2d at 350 (explaining that a finding of

either form of malice defeats the privilege). “Common-law malice is based on the traditional

concept of spite or ill will, while constitutional malice or ‘actual’ malice refers to publication of

false material with knowledge of its falsity, or a high degree of awareness of the falsity.” 

Dunson, 171 F. Supp. 2d at 117. Plaintiff must show malice based on a preponderance of the

evidence. See id.

Plaintiff has failed to adequately plead that Rossein’s Report satisfies either common-law

malice or actual malice. To establish common-law malice, Plaintiff must show that Rossein’s ill

will towards Plaintiff was “the one and only cause for the publication . . . .” Loksen, 239 F.3d at

272 (internal quotations and citation omitted). Thus, for Plaintiff to show common-law malice,

he must show that Rossein issued the Report solely to harm Plaintiff. The SPSAC does not

make that allegation. As an initial matter, Rossein was retained as an outsider to conduct an

investigation into Singh’s allegations against Plaintiff. (SPSAC ¶ 320.) When Rossein was

retained, he was a stranger with no motive to harm Plaintiff and Plaintiff has not pled that

Rossein subsequently developed any animus towards Plaintiff. See Brattis v. Rainbow Adver.

Holdings, L.L.C., No. 99 Civ. 10144, 2000 WL 702921, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. May 31, 2000) (stating

that a finding of personal animus is necessary to establish common-law malice). Plaintiff

contends that Rossein’s Report was one-sided, even though the SPSAC documents Rossein’s

35

Case 1:05-cv-09625-RJS Document 84 Filed 10/19/2007 Page 36 of 53

attempt to interview Plaintiff before he issued his report. (SPSAC ¶ 351.) According to the

SPSAC, after Rossein spoke to Plaintiff’s counsel, Rossein agreed to meet with Plaintiff and

Plaintiff’s counsel on April 6, 2005. (Id. ¶¶ 352-53.) Plaintiff acknowledges, however, that it

was Plaintiff’s counsel who advised Plaintiff to refuse to meet with Rossein on the day of their

scheduled meeting. (Id. ¶ 353.) Based solely on the facts pled in the SPSAC, it is apparent that

Rossein omitted Plaintiff’s version of the events from the Report because Plaintiff, upon advice

of counsel, refused to meet with Rossein. (Id.) Notwithstanding these facts, Plaintiff remarkably

claims that Rossein’s Report is defamatory because it fails to take Plaintiff’s side of the story

into account. (SPSAC ¶¶ 362-89.) The merits of the Rossein Report, however, are not at issue;

the question, rather, is whether Rossein issued his report strictly out of ill-will towards Plaintiff. 

Nothing in the SPSAC even suggests an affirmative answer to that question. If anything, the

SPSAC supports the opposite inference.

The same conclusion follows under the actual malice standard, which asks whether

Rossein knew that the defamatory statements in his Report were false, or had a high degree of

awareness that they were false. Again, Plaintiff’s refusal to meet with Rossein made it

impossible for Rossein to credit Plaintiff’s version of Singh’s allegations. (SPSAC ¶ 372.) 

Moreover, Plaintiff cannot claim actual malice under these circumstances, because “[i]t is well

settled that a defendant’s failure to investigate before making defamatory statements does not

support a finding of actual malice.” Boyd v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 208 F.3d 406, 408 (2d

Cir. 2000) (citing Harte-Hanks Communications, Inc. v. Connaughton, 491 U.S. 657, 666-67

36

Case 1:05-cv-09625-RJS Document 84 Filed 10/19/2007 Page 37 of 53

(1989)); accord Brattis, 2000 WL 702921, at *5.29 In any event, Rossein’s Report is certainly

more thorough than other employer-generated, investigative reports that have enjoyed the

employer’s qualified privilege. See Dunson, 171 F. Supp. 2d at 117 (questioning the accuracy or

conclusions drawn in a report not enough to defeat privilege). In addition, Plaintiff also fails to

plead that Rossein knew the conclusions in his Report were false or that he was aware of a

likelihood of falsity. 

2. Proskauer

Proskauer is alleged to have defamed Plaintiff three times. (SPSAC ¶¶ 390-406.) First,

Plaintiff alleges that Detective Whelan “told plaintiff that [Kathleen] McKenna, [a partner at

Proskauer,] telephoned him repeatedly regarding the charges and made statements evidencing

her belief in plaintiff’s guilt” in connection with the Singh episode. (SPSAC ¶ 315.)30 Second,

Plaintiff claims that McKenna defamed Plaintiff in a letter setting out the Rossein Report’s

findings which was sent to Plaintiff’s counsel on June 28, 2005. (Id. ¶ 397.) Third, Plaintiff

claims that a letter sent to Assistant District Attorney Willa Concannon, which included a copy

of the Rossein Report in response to a subpoena, contained defamatory statements. (Id. ¶ 404.) 

29The Court does not mean to suggest that Rossein failed to investigate Plaintiff’s side of

the story, but even if Platiniff’s allegations could be construed to suggest such a claim, they
would be futile as a matter of law based on Plaintiff’s own allegations.

30 Even more generically, Plaintiff alleges that McKenna “has knowingly submitted false

and defamatory information to law enforcement and judicial authorities.” How Ms. McKenna
could possibly defend against such an amorphous allegation is a mystery, and, therefore, it does
not even come close to stating a claim. See Reilly v. Natwest Markets Group, Inc., 181 F.3d 253,
271 (2d Cir. 1999) (affirming dismissal of plaintiff’s bare claim that defendant “said ‘something
bad’ about him to client”). 

37

Case 1:05-cv-09625-RJS Document 84 Filed 10/19/2007 Page 38 of 53

The first claim is deficient for it utterly fails to identify what McKenna is alleged to have

said to Detective Whelan, let alone even estimate when she is alleged to have made any

particular statements to the Detective. Instead, the only allegation is that Detective Whelan

supposedly told Plaintiff that McKenna made statements “evidencing her belief in plaintiff’s

guilt” in connection with the Singh episode. Yet, there is not a single reference to what

McKenna actually said. Indeed, it is entirely unclear if Detective Whelan interpreted whatever

McKenna said properly, or if he based his conclusion about McKenna’s belief in Plaintiff’s guilt

from something other than McKenna’s actual words, such as her tone of voice. And because

Plaintiff has not provided any information regarding when Detective Whelan and McKenna had

these conversations, the Court concludes that this claim of defamation fails to state a claim and

therefore is futile. See Scholastic, 124 F. Supp. 2d at 850 (dismissing defamation claim which

failed to identify when and where the allegedly defamatory statements were made); Broome v.

Biondi, No. 96 Civ. 805, 1997 WL 83295, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 10, 1997) (“While defendants

adequately identify the purported communication and who said such statements, defendants fail

to sufficiently indicate when the communications took place and to whom these defamatory

words were said . . .”).

The second claim Plaintiff makes relates to a June 28, 2005 letter McKenna sent to

counsel for Plaintiff. According to Plaintiff, this letter was written in response to a letter sent by

Plaintiff’s counsel accusing the Union and Fund Defendants (and Proskauer) of violating

Plaintiff’s statutory and common law rights. Plaintiff’s claim regarding the June 28, 2005 letter

fails, however, because he does not allege that the contents of the letter are false, let alone how

they are otherwise defamatory. “A plaintiff in a libel action must identify a plausible defamatory

38

Case 1:05-cv-09625-RJS Document 84 Filed 10/19/2007 Page 39 of 53

meaning of the challenged statement or publication.” Celle v. Filipino Reporter Enterps., Inc.,

209 F.3d 163, 178 (2d Cir. 2000). “Whether a statement is susceptible of a defamatory meaning

is a threshold question of law to be resolved by the court. If the statement complained of is

susceptible of more than one meaning, at least one of which is defamatory, the claim must go to

the jury.” Netzer v. Continuity Graphic Assocs., Inc., 963 F. Supp. 1308, 1324 (S.D.N.Y. 1997). 

Under New York law, a statement will be found defamatory only if it “tend[s] to expose one to

public hatred, shame, obloquy, contumely, odium, contempt, ridicule, aversion, ostracism,

degradation or disgrace, or to induce an evil opinion of one in the minds of right-thinking

persons, and to deprive one of their confidence and friendly intercourse in society.” Fairley v.

Peekskill Star Corp., 445 N.Y.S.2d 156, 158 (App. Div. 1981). 

The block-quoted portions of the June 28, 2005 letter in the PSAC say nothing

defamatory about Plaintiff. In essence, this letter states: (i) that Proskauer represents the Funds;

(ii) that Plaintiff’s counsel’s letter contains inaccuracies regarding Plaintiff’s departure from the

Union; (iii) that Plaintiff’s cooperation with the investigation by Mr. Rossein might have better

informed counsel about the facts and circumstances of the investigation (while detailing

Rossein’s unsuccessful efforts to interview Plaintiff); and (iv) that McKenna believes that the

Funds committed no violation of Plaintiff’s statutory or common law rights. In short, Plaintiff

identifies nothing about the contents of this letter that defames him, even if the contents of the

letter were untrue, and even if McKenna knew them to be untrue. Nor does Plaintiff’s

conclusory allegations that McKenna or Proskauer intended to defame Plaintiff save this

particular allegation. See Scholastic, 124 F. Supp. 2d at 849-50 (noting insufficiency of

39

Case 1:05-cv-09625-RJS Document 84 Filed 10/19/2007 Page 40 of 53

conclusory allegation that plaintiff was defamed by false statements). Thus, it would be futile

for Plaintiff to proceed on this claim. 

Finally, there is nothing actionable about Proskauer’s production of the Rossein Report to

the Assistant District Attorney, as that production was absolutely privileged. According to the

Second Circuit, “[v]intage case law demonstrates that New York bestows an absolute privilege

upon those whom the government compels to give evidence.” Boice v. Unisys Corp., 50 F.3d

1145, 1149 (2d Cir. 1995). This absolute privilege attaches when “(1) the disclosure was

compelled by subpoena; (2) the disclosure materially responded to the subpoena; and (3) the

person did not set the investigation in motion, or otherwise manipulate the investigative process

to promote the libel.” Boice, 50 F.3d at 1149. The first factor–that the disclosure was compelled

by a subpoena–is conceded by Plaintiff when he quotes McKenna’s letter to the Assistant

District Attorney in the SPSAC, without disputing McKenna’s claim that she was producing the

Report in response to a subpoena. (SPSAC ¶ 404.) Nor does Plaintiff claim that the production

of the Report exceeded the scope of the subpoena, leaving only the third factor to consider. The

PSAC is not clear, however, on the third factor. Plaintiff claims that McKenna informed the

District Attorney’s office after April 27, 2005, though the date is not specified, that Rossein had

prepared a report on Singh’s sexual assault claim. (Id. ¶ 399.) The SPSAC does not allege,

however, that McKenna set the investigation in motion or that she manipulated the police

investigation. In fact, the SPSAC acknowledges that the investigation was initiated by Singh in

February 2005, and that a detective was assigned to investigate Singh’s allegations. (Id. ¶ 309.) 

Accordingly, by Plaintiff’s own pleadings, it is clear that law enforcement officials learned about

Singh’s allegations from Singh and initiated the investigation on their own. Thus, McKenna’s

40

Case 1:05-cv-09625-RJS Document 84 Filed 10/19/2007 Page 41 of 53

production of the Rossein report and her provision of other information to the District Attorney’s

Office was absolutely privileged, thus making Plaintiff’s allegation on this point futile. 

3. Pocino

Pocino is alleged to have defamed Plaintiff by “doing Proskauer’s bidding and

ostracizing him” and by “treat[ing] plaintiff as if though he was guilty” which created the “false

impression that plaintiff, was, in fact, guilty.” (SPSAC ¶¶ 299-300.) Pocino also is alleged to

have provided Rossein false and misleading information. (Id. ¶ 301.) 

The Court will consider the first group of allegations as claiming defamation by

implication, since Plaintiff has not pled that Pocino said anything defamatory, with the exception

of his statements to Rossein. “Defamation by implication involves ‘false suggestions,

impressions and implications arising from otherwise truthful statements.”’ Levin v. McPhee, 119

F.3d 189, 196 n.5 (2d Cir. 1997) (quoting Armstrong v. Simon & Schuster, Inc., 649 N.E.2d 825,

829 (N.Y. 1995)). Neither the New York Courts nor the Second Circuit has specifically

identified the pleading elements of defamation by implication. See Levin, 119 F.3d at 196 n.5;

see also Roberti v. Schroder Inv. Mgmt N. Am., Inc., No. 04 Civ. 2404, 2006 WL 647718, at *9

(S.D.N.Y. Mar. 14, 2006). The Court has found no case law, however, suggesting that a claim

for defamation by implication relieves Plaintiff of identifying the allegedly defamatory words

that were uttered and to whom they were directed.

Plaintiff’s claim that Pocino did Proksauer’s bidding, treated him as though Plaintiff was

guilty, and created the impression he was guilty are futile, because Plaintiff has not identified a

statement or writing from which the alleged defamation arose. In Armstrong, the New York

Court of Appeals described Memphis Publ. Co. v. Nichols, 569 S.W.2d 412 (Tenn. 1978) as

41

Case 1:05-cv-09625-RJS Document 84 Filed 10/19/2007 Page 42 of 53

“illustrative” of defamation by implication. In Nichols, the alleged defamation was a newspaper

article. Although the plaintiff in Nichols was suing based on a defamatory implication arising

from the article, the Court finds it instructive that the implication arose from a finite collection of

identifiable words reproduced in print. Thus, the Court reads Armstrong to require Plaintiff to

identify the exact words that Plaintiff believes were uttered in order to adequately support a

claim of defamation by implication. Furthermore, in cases alleging defamation by implication,

“[p]laintiffs typically have to show that [d]efendants affirmatively intended such implication.” 

Vinas v. Chubb Corp., 499 F.Supp. 2d 427, 437 (S.D.N.Y. 2007). The SPSAC does not

sufficiently plead that Pocino intended to impugn Plaintiff. Plaintiff pleads that Pocino made

false statements willfully and maliciously, but he offers nothing more than this conclusory

statement to support his allegation. Simply reciting the elements of claim in a complaint, as

Plaintiff has done here, is not sufficient to defeat a Rule 12(b)(6) motion. See Bell Atl., 127 S.

Ct. at 1964-65. And to the extent that Pocino’s conduct or words were solely directed at

Plaintiff, those claims are dismissed because they were not published to a third party. See

Muzio, 2006 WL 39063, at *8 (explaining that publication to a third party is a required element

of a defamation claim). 

Finally, the allegation that Pocino provided Rossein with false information cannot be

construed as a claim for defamation by implication, but simply as a claim for defamation. This

claim is futile because Plaintiff has not identified the allegedly defamatory words or writings that

Pocino passed on to Rossein. Additionally, anything Pocino said to Rossein for the purposes of

Rossein’s investigation is protected by a qualified privilege, see Loksen, 239 F.3d at 272, and

Plaintiff has not sufficiently pled actual or common-law malice with respect to Pocino.

42

Case 1:05-cv-09625-RJS Document 84 Filed 10/19/2007 Page 43 of 53

4. Singh

Plaintiff alleges that Singh “willfully and maliciously provided false information to law

enforcement authorities with the intent to have plaintiff arrested and prosecuted.” (SPSAC ¶

408.) He further alleges that “Singh willfully and maliciously provided false information to the

Funds and Rossein to bolster his criminal complaint.” (Id. ¶ 409.)

The allegations against Singh fail to state a claim and are thus futile. “In evaluating the

sufficiency of claims of slander, the courts in this Circuit have required that the complaint

adequately identify the allegedly defamatory statements, the person who made the statements,

the time when the statements were made, and the third parties to whom the statements were

published.” Mobile Data Shred, Inc. v. United Bank of Switzerland, No. 99 Civ. 10315, 2000

WL 351516, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 5, 2000). The SPSAC does not identify the particular

statements made by Singh that Plaintiff believes are defamatory. The SPSAC merely claims that

Singh made false statements to others, but neglects to identify what Singh actually said. 

Moreover, Plaintiff has to identify the recipients of the slander. See id. at *6-7 (dismissing

slander claim for failing to identify the identity of recipients). In sum, the allegations against

Singh lack sufficient detail regarding both the content and recipient of the statements to survive a 

Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, and thus may not go forward.

5. Columbia

Plaintiff claims that the LECET Director, Christopher Columbia, committed slander

when he told other LECET “personnel” that “he believed Singh’s allegations,” that Ello engaged

43

Case 1:05-cv-09625-RJS Document 84 Filed 10/19/2007 Page 44 of 53

in “‘shady’ dealings,” and that Ello “had been living with a man for 12 years.” (PSAC ¶ 406.)31 

Plaintiff also alleges that in the Fall of 2005, Columbia knew that one of his “subordinates

created and posted on the union computer system a calendar and other document which included

an image of plaintiff’s head on the body of an obviously homosexual man.” (Id. ¶ 407.) 

These allegations fail to state a claim and are futile for a number of reasons. First, 

Plaintiff fails to identify to whom these statements were made, or the time and manner in which

they were made. See United Bank of Switzerland, 2000 WL 351516, at *6-7. Second, comments

made in the employment context, such as those discussed above in regard to the Rossein Report,

are entitled to qualified immunity from suit for defamation. On the basis of Plaintiff’s SPSAC,

Columbia’s alleged statements were made in the employment context, and Plaintiff has not pled

that they were made with actual or common-law malice. Nor has Plaintiff pled that Columbia’s

disclosures exceeded the scope of interested recipients. See Milam v. Herrlin, 819 F. Supp. 295,

304 (S.D.N.Y. 1993) (holding that communications to interested employees regarding the results

of an employer’s investigation of misconduct were protected by qualified privilege); Rosen v.

Piluso, 652 N.Y.S.2d 104, 105 (App. Div. 1997) (explaining that a letter to the editor did not fall

under a qualified privilege because the wide scope of the communication exceeded the

acceptable scope of interested persons). Columbia enjoys protection of qualified immunity from

suit; as a result, these statements are not actionable. See Esser v. T-Mobile USA, Inc., No. 03

Civ. 9485, 2004 WL 1276839, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. June 8, 2004) (granting motion to dismiss in libel

case on grounds of qualified privilege). Third, Columbia’s purported statement that Plainitff

31The SPSAC contains two paragraphs numbered “406.” These statements come from

the second such paragraph. 

44

Case 1:05-cv-09625-RJS Document 84 Filed 10/19/2007 Page 45 of 53

engaged in shady dealings is not definite enough to state a claim. See Reilly, 181 F.3d at 271

(holding that claim that “something bad” had been said about plaintiff failed to state a claim and

afford adequate notice to defendant). 

Plaintiff’s claim that Columbia’s subordinates posted a defamatory picture of him also

fails to state a claim in regard to Columbia. Under New York law, an employer can be held

liable for its subordinates’ statements under the theory of respondeat superior if those statements

were made in the course of performance of the employee’s duties. See Rausman v. Baugh, 682

N.Y.S.2d 42, 43 (App. Div. 1998); see also Riviello v. Waldron, 391 N.E.2d 1278, 1280-81

(N.Y. 1979) (discussing respondeat superior in the employer/employee context). Although

“[t]here is no single mechanical test to determine whether at a particular moment an employee is

engaged in the employer’s business[,]” Rausman, 682 N.Y.S.2d at 43, the following factors have

been identified as important to the inquiry: (1) whether the employee’s act fell within the

discretion and control of the employer; (2) whether the employee acted under the express or

implied authority of the employer; (3) whether the employee’s act was in furtherance of the

employer’s interests; (4) whether the employee’s acts were in the “discharge of duty” to the

employer; (5) whether the act was in execution of the employer’s orders or part of the work

assigned by the employer; and (6) whether the acts were “so closely connected” with what the

employee was hired to do, and “so fairly and reasonably incidental to it, that they may be

regarded as methods, even though quite improper ones, of carrying out the objectives of

employment.” Id. at 43-44 (internal citations omitted). In addition, courts have noted that “there

is no respondeat superior liability for torts committed for personal motives unrelated to the

45

Case 1:05-cv-09625-RJS Document 84 Filed 10/19/2007 Page 46 of 53

furtherance of the employer’s business.” Murray v. Watervliet City School Dist., 515 N.Y.S.2d

150, 152 (App. Div. 1987) (internal quotations and citation omitted).

The extent of the allegations against Columbia is that he “knew” that some subordinates

had posted a picture of Plaintiff on the computer system. (SPSAC ¶ 407.) This allegation is not

enough to implicate any of the six factors identified above, which means that Plaintiff has no

claim against Columbia based on respondeat superior. If any claim lies here at all, it is against

the person or persons who created and uploaded the image, who may have done so for their own

reasons. See Murray, 515 N.Y.S.2d at 152. Thus, this claim is also futile. 

E. Protective Order

Proskauer requests that limited portions of the Parties’ submissions be sealed. In

particular, Proskauer notes several paragraphs in the PSAC, ¶¶ 64, 69 and 96, where Plaintiff

divulges legal advice given by Proskauer to the MTCDTF that Plaintiff learned in his prior role

as trustee. Proskauer also argues that Plaintiff’s consistent “mudslinging” warrants a protective

order denying public access.

There is a general presumption in favor of public access to judicial records. This

presumption is based on the need to hold the federal courts accountable to the public and to

foster confidence in the administration of justice. See United States v. Amodeo, 71 F.3d 1044,

1048 (2d Cir. 1995) (“Amodeo II”). Although courts have a variety of internal checks –

appellate review, in particular – public monitoring is an essential method for imposing

democratic control and deterring arbitrary judicial behavior. See id. Such public monitoring,

however, is impossible without access to the testimony and documents used by the courts in the

performance of their Article III functions. See id. 

46

Case 1:05-cv-09625-RJS Document 84 Filed 10/19/2007 Page 47 of 53

In Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, the Second Circuit enumerated the steps that a

district court must take when determining whether to issue a protective order denying public

access to records. 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006).32 First, a court must determine whether the

32 The Court has analyzed Proskauer’s requests in light of the common law right of

access, not a constitutional right of access. In Lugosch, the Second Circuit held that “there exists
a qualified First Amendment right of access to documents submitted to the court in connection
with a summary judgment motion.” Lugosch, 435 F.3d at 124 (emphasis added). The court then
noted that a constitutional right of access necessitated a more strict balancing test for keeping
records under seal. Whereas under the common law documents may be kept under seal if
“countervailing factors” are shown, the constitutional analysis requires “specific, on-the-record
findings that sealing is necessary to preserve higher values” and a sealing order which is
“narrowly tailored to achieve that aim.” Id. The court in Lugosch resisted determining,
however, whether the attorney-client privilege was a sufficiently compelling reason to satisfy the
“higher values” and “narrow tailoring” required to seal documents under the First Amendment. 
Id. at 125 (noting that “the attorney-client privilege might well be such a compelling reason” to
seal documents covered by the constitutional right to access). The court remanded the case, in
part, to further develop the facts in connection with this particular point of law. 

Upon remand, Magistrate Judge Treece recommended that the attorney-client privilege

and work product doctrine were “the highest values within our judicial system and constitute
compelling reasons, under the First Amendment, and countervailing factors, under the common
law, that sufficiently outweigh the public’s right of access.” Lugosch v. Congel, No. 00 Civ.
0784, 2006 WL 931687, at *36 (N.D.N.Y., Mar. 07, 2006). Magistrate Treece qualified this
recommendation, however, by stating that a party could not attempt to seal a document on
privilege grounds if the party requesting the protective order was the same party that interjected
the privileged documents into the litigation. Id. at *23 (noting that waiver of the privilege only
occurs when the party that claims the privilege interjects the privileged material into the
litigation).

This line of precedent is still developing. The Second Circuit has not yet determined

whether a constitutional right of access exists in regard to judicial documents other than those
relating to summary judgment, such as the Motion to File the PSAC in the instant case. In fact,
at least one court has ruled that certain documents submitted in connection with a rule 12(b)(6)
motion to dismiss are not “judicial,” and therefore not covered by a constitutional right of access. 
See Standard Inv. Chateau, No. 07 Civ. 2014, 2007 WL 2790387, at *7-8 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 26,
2007). If, however, such a right does exist, the protective order requested by Proskauer appears
to fit comfortably within the emerging constitutional analysis developed in the two Lugosch
decisions. Proskauer’s request relates to statements allegedly protected by the attorney-client
privilege that were introduced into the litigation by Plaintiff, rather than Proskauer. 
Furthermore, Proskauer’s request is narrowly tailored – only three paragraphs out of several
hundred. Therefore, if constitutional analysis is applicable to the instant case, the result would
be the same.

47

Case 1:05-cv-09625-RJS Document 84 Filed 10/19/2007 Page 48 of 53

documents are “judicial documents." Id. at 119. To qualify as a judicial document, “‘the item

filed must be relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial

process.’” Id. (quoting Amodeo II, 44 F.3d at 145). If the documents are deemed non-judicial,

then there is no presumption of public access, and the movant need only make a baseline

showing of good cause in order to justify the imposition of a protective order. See Standard Inv.

Chateau, No. 07 Civ. 2014, 2007 WL 2790387, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 26, 2007). If, however,

the court determines that the documents are judicial in nature, there is a presumption of public

access. Id. Second, the court determines the weight of the presumption. The weight of the

presumption is “governed by the role of the material at issue in the exercise of the Article III

judicial power and the resultant value of such information to those monitoring the federal

courts.” Lugosch, 435 F.3d at 119 (quoting Amodeo II, 71 F.3d at 1049). The material at issue

“will fall somewhere on a continuum from matters that directly affect the adjudication to matters

that come within a court’s purview solely to insure their irrelevance.” Id. Finally, after the court

has determined the weight of the presumption of access, “the court must ‘balance competing

considerations against it.’” Lugosch, 435 F.3d at 120 (quoting Amodeo II, 71 F.3d at 1050); see

also Standard Inv. Chartered Inc., 2007 WL 2790387, at *3. These competing considerations

include, inter alia, “the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.” Lugosch, 435 F.3d at 120

(quoting Amodeo II, 71 F.3d at 1050).

The Court reviews Proskauer’s request to seal portions of the PSAC in light of this three

step analysis. First, the PSAC is clearly a judicial document. As noted in Section II.A of this

Opinion, supra, Plaintiff’s Motion to File a Proposed Second Amended Complaint is assessed

under Rule 12(b)(6). Under Rule 12(b)(6), the Court assesses Plaintiff’s claim by determining

48

Case 1:05-cv-09625-RJS Document 84 Filed 10/19/2007 Page 49 of 53

whether Plaintiff has alleged “enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.” 

Bell Atl., 127 S. Ct. at 1974. The 12(b)(6) motion depends entirely upon the legal sufficiency of

Plaintiff’s pleadings. See Newman, 103 F.3d at 662 (“In considering a motion to dismiss for

failure to state a claim under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), a district court must limit itself to facts

stated in the complaint or in documents attached to the complaint as exhibits or incorporated in

the complaint by reference.” (quoting Kramer v. Time Warner, Inc., 937 F.2d 767, 773 (2d Cir.

1991)). As a result, the Plaintiff’s Proposed Second Amended Complaint must necessarily be a

judicial document – the Motion currently before the Court hinges on the Court’s assessment of

the adequacy of the allegations in that document.33 

Second, the weight of that presumption should be considerable, for many of the same

reasons just enumerated. The Motion currently before the Court pertains to the legal sufficiency

of the document that Proskauer would like to seal: Plaintiff’s Proposed Second Amended

Complaint. As a result, public access to the PSAC is necessary to monitor the decision of the

33In Standard Investment Chartered Inc., the court held that “documents submitted in

connection with a Rule 12(b)(6) motion cannot qualify as judicial.” See Standard Inv.
Chartered, Inc., 2007 WL 2790387, at *6. The key language here is the phrase “in connection.” 
Noting that a court is restricted in its ability to go outside the pleadings in assessing a Rule
12(b)(6) motion, Judge Kram held that documents submitted “in connection” with a 12(b)(6)
motion are not judicial documents, as they cannot play any role in the court’s deliberations. Id.
(explaining that only documents that a court “could legitimately rely upon” qualify as judicial
documents); see also In re Policy Mgmt. Sys. Corp., No. 94 Civ. 2254, 1995 WL 541623, at *4
(4th Cir. 1995) (same). If such documents were used by a court, the motion would no longer be
a Rule 12(b)(6) motion for dismissal, but rather a Rule 56 motion for summary judgment. See
Standard Inv. Chartered, Inc., 2007 WL 2790387, at *6. 

documents submitted “in connection” with a 12(b)(6) motion are judicial documents, but rather
whether the Complaint itself is a judicial document. The answer hinges on whether the Court
“could legitimately rely upon” the documents in forming its decision. Id. The Complaint (or in
this case, the Proposed Second Amended Complaint) is the sort of document that the Court must
rely upon, as it is the principal object of Plaintiff’s Motion to Amend.

The issue before this Court is quite different: the Court is not assessing whether

49

Case 1:05-cv-09625-RJS Document 84 Filed 10/19/2007 Page 50 of 53

Court. Without access to the PSAC, the public would be unable to “assess the correctness of the

judge’s decision.” See Lugosch, 435 F.3d at 120 (quotations omitted). 

The final question is whether the “competing considerations” noted by Proskauer –

attorney client privilege and unwarranted mudslinging – are sufficient to overcome the

presumption against denying public access. The Court initally agrees with Proskauer in regard

to its narrow request to seal the three statements in the PSAC that implicate only the attorney

client privilege. See Rapkin v. Rocque, 87 F. Supp. 2d 140, 143 (D. Conn. 2000) (“We agree

with Defendants that the public interest in preserving the attorney-client privilege ordinarily

outweighs the presumption of access to judicial documents.); see also Diversified Group, Inc. v.

Daugerdas, 304 F. Supp. 2d 507, 511 (S.D.N.Y. 2003) (noting that attorney-client privilege

“would be sufficient to outweigh the presumption of access if the Summary Judgment

Documents were replete with privileged attorney-client communications.”). However, the Court

does not agree in regard to the “mudslinging” claims. While the Second Circuit’s analysis does

invite consideration of broad privacy interests, and while the Court is troubled by some of the

cavalier statements by Plaintiff’s counsel about Defendants in this case, the statements in the

PSAC do not “gratify private spite or promote public scandal” to such a degree that they

overcome the presumption against sealing judicial records. See Amodeo II, 71 F.3d at 1051.

The portions of the PSAC identified by Proskauer as containing privileged

communications, ¶¶ 64, 69 and 96, are to be sealed for ten days to allow Plaintiff to explain, in a

letter no longer than three pages, why they should not be so sealed. In addition, this Opinion

will remain sealed for ten days, after which it will be unsealed if there are no objections from the

Parties. If the parties do have objections, they are instructed to identify for the Court any

50

Case 1:05-cv-09625-RJS Document 84 Filed 10/19/2007 Page 51 of 53

portions of the Opinion which should be kept under seal beyond the ten-day period. Any

objections should be presented to the Court in a letter no longer than three pages. Failure to

strictly honor these deadlines will result in a waiver of any objections the Party has to the sealing

decisions outlined herein. 

F. Amendment of the Complaint

Plaintiff has thirty days to file a Second Amended Complaint consistent with this

Opinion. This Second Amended Complaint will be the final version of the Complaint permitted

by the Court. Plaintiff already has attempted to amend his Complaint on five separate occasions

– he will not receive a sixth opportunity. See Dluhos v. Floating & Abandoned Vessel, Known

as N.Y., 162 F.3d 63, 69 (2d Cir. 1998) (recognizing liberal standard for granting leave to amend,

“[n]onetheless a motion to amend should be denied if there is an ‘apparent or declared

reason-such as undue delay, bad faith or dilatory motive ..., repeated failure to cure deficiencies

by amendments previously allowed, undue prejudice to the opposing party by virtue of the

allowance of the amendment, [or] futility of amendment.’ ” (quoting Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S.

178, 182, (1962))); Chill v. General Electric Co., 101 F.3d 263, 272 (2d Cir. 1996) ( “[F]utility

is a good reason to deny leave to amend.” (quotations and citation omitted)); Mackensworth v.

S.S. American Merchant, 28 F.3d 246, 251 (2d Cir. 1994) (“Although leave to amend shall be

freely granted when justice requires, valid reasons for denying leave to amend include undue

delay, bad faith or futility of the amendment.” (citations omitted)). Indeed, counsel for Plaintiff

has repeatedly mentioned her desire to move this case along. Further skirmishing over any

additional amendments will only undermine that interest. In addition, Plaintiff will serve a copy

of the Second Amended Complaint on the other Parties in this action prior to submitting the final
