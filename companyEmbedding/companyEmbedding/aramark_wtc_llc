FOOD THAT ENRICHES EXPERIENCES






When great food turns a meal into a memory, we know we’ve done our job.







Food inspired by the people we serve.
A revitalizing lunch that powers a team through the workday. 
A warm meal that fuels students through finals. 
The essential nutrients that help a patient recover.
A game-time snack that energizes the most devoted fan.
We create memorable food experiences wherever people work, learn, recover and play.
Whether it’s designing an innovative menu based on consumer insights, setting high service standards, or ensuring we have the right people with the right skills, we put those we serve at the core of what we do.
Our approach is simple:

Craft chef-inspired menus with high-quality ingredients 
Encourage healthier living with nutritious options
Offer convenience that fits different lifestyles
Enable personalized experiences through exceptional service

We believe that excellent food can enhance experiences and empower people to be better. So we work to channel our passion for food into enriching and nourishing the lives we touch. And we do it with a singular goal: to enable great food experiences that go beyond what’s expected.








OUR PASSION FOR FOOD GOES INTO EVERY ITEM WE CRAFT.
See how we feed people’s desire for experiences that matter.













WE BRING FLAVOR TO MANY INDUSTRIES AND SETTINGS

FOOD THAT ENRICHES EXPERIENCES






When great food turns a meal into a memory, we know we’ve done our job.







Food inspired by the people we serve.
A revitalizing lunch that powers a team through the workday. 
A warm meal that fuels students through finals. 
The essential nutrients that help a patient recover.
A game-time snack that energizes the most devoted fan.
We create memorable food experiences wherever people work, learn, recover and play.
Whether it’s designing an innovative menu based on consumer insights, setting high service standards, or ensuring we have the right people with the right skills, we put those we serve at the core of what we do.
Our approach is simple:

Craft chef-inspired menus with high-quality ingredients 
Encourage healthier living with nutritious options
Offer convenience that fits different lifestyles
Enable personalized experiences through exceptional service

We believe that excellent food can enhance experiences and empower people to be better. So we work to channel our passion for food into enriching and nourishing the lives we touch. And we do it with a singular goal: to enable great food experiences that go beyond what’s expected.








OUR PASSION FOR FOOD GOES INTO EVERY ITEM WE CRAFT.
See how we feed people’s desire for experiences that matter.













WE BRING FLAVOR TO MANY INDUSTRIES AND SETTINGS

WTC / World Trade Center list of companies and business offices in the Twin Towers in New York destroyed by terrorist attacks







Gary Stock: UnBlinking











List of Business Offices, Tenants, and Companies in the World Trade Center (WTC)





Searching the web, we find many companies related to the World Trade Center.  Hundreds of firms did business in these New York skyscrapers, now destroyed.  How many offices were in the Twin
Towers?  The tally of WTC tenants is not yet complete.



Sun 2001-10-14 00:30 UTC
 UnBlinking has identified over 700 prospects by name.  Preliminary research suggests as many as 60 more firms
maintained a business presence within the Trade Center complex.  Details below, with links to over 200 corporate home pages of WTC tenants.



Wed 2001-09-19 16:00 UTC UnBlinking has identified over  240 phone listings
present in the WTC complex.  These may help confirm details of your other searches. (Data were found through unique capabilities of Southwestern Bell SMARTpages.)



Wed 2001-09-26 17:00 UTC UnBlinking has identified over  75 vacant office
suites present in the WTC complex.  These may help confirm details of your other searches. (Data were found through unique capabilities of Google.)


UnBlinking scans the wealth of information on the internet, gathering background on people and events.  Using public search engines, UnBlinking collates what may be known (and what
may have been forgotten).

Twin Towers Tenants (WTC Companies and Offices)





Several news sources have echoed a list of tenants provided online by the CoStar Group:



News and Observer: World Trade Center Tenants
USA Today: North Tower Tenants (One World Trade Center)
USA Today: South Tower Tenants (Two World Trade Center)
Crain's New York Business: North Tower (1 World Trade Center)
Crain's New York Business: South Tower (2 World Trade Center)



All these lists contain the same 280 names known to CoStar.  However, many other sources, included WTC documents indicate from 435 to 500 businesses were housed in the WTC Twin Towers.

UnBlinking has scanned free search engines to identify other firms within the WTC complex.  We have discovered 240 more firms online, but we are in the same position as CoStar:



Although CoStar makes efforts to ensure the accuracy and reliability of its information, CoStar makes no representation or warranty regarding the quality, accuracy, timeliness or completeness of such
information. CoStar cannot guarantee that its tenant specific data is 100 percent accurate or complete, and errors and omissions do occur. Accordingly, CoStar is not responsible if its information is not
accurate, complete or current, and CoStar has no responsibility for any consequence relating directly or indirectly to any action or inaction that you (or a third party) take based upon the tenant
specific data presented here.



Please confirm any information listed here before taking action.  (Search engines - in an effort to take a snapshot of the entire web - are notorious for preserving stale, out-of-date information
alongside newer, more accurate data.)  The list below may overstate active business operations at the time of collapse.  Some firms are not full occupancy (for example, contractors or DBA
representatives).  Others may have departed Trade Center offices recently.  


All items with Current date "2001" appear very reliable.  A Current year with a live link offers an online reference; "VSP" indicates a current listing in Verizon Super
Pages.  Asterisks (**) indicate corporate or US headquarters.



This page lists all seven WTC buildings, and so is quite large; our apologies.  However, this permits you to use your browser's Search function to scan for specific names.


 



Green indicates that although older web references place an entity in the WTC,

newer references indicate it had moved out before 11 September 2001.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
