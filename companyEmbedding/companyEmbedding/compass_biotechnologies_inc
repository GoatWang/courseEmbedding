A Compass partner managed their Drug Substance Development, Drug Product Development, Analytical Development, Manufacturing, Facilities and Quality programs. 





Cell Genesys
A Compass partner managed Cell Genesys’s 100,000 sq ft biotech facility with direct and indirect oversight of its120 employees representing all facets of GMP operations, producing GVAX® cancer immunotherapies, with direct line function responsibility for Manufacturing, Facilities, Engineering and Supply Chain.




BioMarin
A Compass partner managed their CMC operations, facilitating and managing their FDA approval for N-acetylgalactoseamine-4-sulfatase (Naglazyme®).  Also, managed the commercial manufacturing of both Naglazyme® and alpha-L-iduronidase (Aldurazyme®).




 Onyx Pharmaceuticals
A Compass partner managed clinical development of the oncolytic adenovirus ONYX-015 program, which was subsequently commercialized by Sunway in China.




 Bayer
A Compass partner managed process development and protein characterization, working directly on rFVIII (Kogenate®), IgIV (Gamunex®), alpha-1PI (Prolastin®), and ATIII(Thrombate III®). Built and managed a new manufacturing science organization for Kogenate® operations, with separate groups providing technical support to the cell culture, purification and fill/finish production functional areas.




 Genentech
A Compass partner focused on fine tuning specific process development and protein characterization work.  Worked on tPA (Activase®), IGF1 (Increlex®), anti-IgE (Xolair®), anti-Her2 (Herceptin®), and DNase (Pulmozyme®).

Compass Biotechnology Contract Management




















































































  Contract Management   Process Management   
  Science   Operations   Validation   Support  





Contract Negotiation, Development and Management

Traditionally, small to medium sized biotech firms have often struggled to develop sound contractual agreements with established CMOs.  Understandably, smaller firms are frequently wrapped up in the technical minutia of their process development work, and they sometimes lack the differing skill set necessary to successfully negotiate a sound CMO contract that truly benefits all parties.  To insure that this critical component of the production process is carried out effectively, Compass has developed a set of detailed guidelines that will enable the contractual relationship between the biotech and the CMO to start and end on solid footing.

 Compass will:

work closely with the biotech and CMO in writing the initial contracts, which will include all the necessary procedures and tools for resourceful management of the entire production process.  Compass works from several pre-formulated templates that help to expedite these agreements;


implement “Best Practices” procedures, tailored to a specific production process, to be included in the contract and employed at all times;


negotiate and construct all related partnership agreements and corporate governance documents, which may include bylaws, charters, and management’s code of conduct during the term of the contract;


construct confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements between all parties, as well as Master Service Agreements to indemnify the entire process development platform;


negotiate change orders and revise budgets during all phases of the contract.

Compass Biotechnologies Inc. Announces Acquisition of efsAUDIO Inc.


SALT LAKE CITY, UT / ACCESSWIRE / February 5, 2016 / Compass Biotechnologies Inc. (OTC PINK: COBI) (PINKSHEETS: COBI) (Compass) is pleased to announce the previously mentioned acquisition target is efsAUDIO Inc., manufacturer of the Motion Sound product line. Since 1994, Motion Sound products have been developed and manufactured with the focus on innovation, quality, reliability and tone. Motion Sound amplifiers are recognized as an industry standard through their quality and innovation in proprietary rotary speaker technology and stereo amplification for organs, pianos and synthesizers. Motion Sound keyboard and guitar amplifiers are used and endorsed by well-known artists throughout the world. To view a list of artists, please visit the Motion Sound web site at www.msamps.com.
The completion of the acquisition of efsAUDIO is expected late next week, which will result in efsAUDIO becoming a subsidiary of Compass. The Company will effect a name change to reflect its new business direction after the acquisition is completed.
It has come to our attention that several recent inquiries have gone unanswered due to technical difficulties with our email system and investor phone line. We would like to apologize for any absence in communications, and these issues have been rectified.
