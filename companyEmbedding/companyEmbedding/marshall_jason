Plot|Movie TitlesForgetting Sarah MarshallSynopsisStruggling musician Peter Bretter (Jason Segel) has spent six years idolizing his girlfriend, television star Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell).  He’s the guy left holding her purse in paparazzi photos and accidentally omitted from acceptance award speeches.  But his world is rocked when she dumps him and Peter finds himself alone.  After an unsuccessful bout of womanizing and an on-the-job nervous breakdown, he sees that not having Sarah may just ruin his life.      To clear his head, Peter takes an impulsive trip to Oahu, where he is confronted by his worst nightmare: his ex and her tragically hip new British-rocker boyfriend, Aldous (Russell Brand), are sharing his hotel.  But as he torments himself with the reality of Sarah’s new life, he finds relief in a flirtation with Rachel (Mila Kunis), a beautiful resort employee whose laid-back approach tempts him to rejoin the world.  He also finds relief in several hundred embarrassing, fruity cocktails.      For anyone who has ever had their heart ripped out and cut into a billion pieces comes a hilarious, heartfelt look at relationships—featuring Paul Rudd, Jonah Hill, Bill Hader and Jack McBrayer.  Part romantic comedy, part disaster film, Forgetting Sarah Marshall is the world’s first romantic disaster comedy.Details|FormatDVDColorColorRatingRRatingReasonsexual content, language and some graphic nudityGenreComedyYear2008Release Date2008-09-30Cast and Crew|DirectorNick StollerCastJason Segel, Kristen Bell, Mila Kunis, Bill Hader, Russell Brand, Kristen Wiig, Jonah Hill, Paul Rudd, Maria Thayer, Carla Gallo

Jason  Marshall  














Biography




























Jason Marshall's 2003 arrival in New York City signified the continuation of hard swinging, forward thinking baritone saxophone playing. With early encouragement to appreciate all types of music, Jason has developed a style that encompasses with whole of African-American music.
Years of dedication and perseverance have resulted in a giant, soulful sound and instantly appealing concept. Influences such as Leo Parker, Nick Brignola and Bruce Johnstone have coalesced to ensure an open perception of the baritone sax and a “take -no-prisoners” approach to playing jazz music. Jason has studied with no less than the elite baritone saxophone specialists of the 20th century including Hamiett Bluiett, Ronnie Cuber and Gary Smulyan.
