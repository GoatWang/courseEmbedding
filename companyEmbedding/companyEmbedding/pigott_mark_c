      ■ Truck manufacturing executive Mark C. Pigott was the CEO and
      chairman of the Bellevue, Washington-based PACCAR. As the leader of this
      diversified, multinational company, Pigott was responsible for maintaining
      the consistently high standards of quality that PACCAR had historically
      guaranteed in all of its products. Pigott ensured that his lines of
      well-engineered, highly customized, and exceptionally performing products
      were sold efficiently throughout its global markets. In fact, in 2003
      Pigott was awarded the Order of the British Empire in recognition of
      outstanding services that were directed toward strengthening business
      relationships between the United Kingdom and the United States. In 2004
      Pigott was named CEO of the Year by 
      
        Washington CEO
      
       magazine. In that same year PACCAR won the International Stevie Business
      Award based on the company's consistently producing the
      highest-quality products in their sector, along with maintaining strong
      cost controls and developing new and original technological applications.
    

      PACCAR
    

      As a global technology company, PACCAR was the world's
      second-largest manufacturer of big rig trucks, with sales in North
      America, Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. (Daimler Chrysler's
      Freightliner subsidiary was the largest such maker.) Because PACCAR had
      consistently been a leader with regards to technology, Pigott maintained
      that PACCAR should rightfully be called a technology company that made
      trucks, not a truck company that used technology. PACCAR designed and
      manufactured exclusive lines of light-, medium-, and heavy-duty trucks
      that included the Kenworth, Peterbilt, DAF, Leyland, and Foden nameplates.
      In addition, the company also provided customer support and aftermarket
      parts for its products. PACCAR's other products included Braden,
      Carco, and Gearmatic industrial winches. Except for a few company-owned
      branches, PACCAR's trucks and parts were sold exclusively through
      independent dealerships. The company's PacLease and PACCAR
      Financial Corporation subsidiaries sold PACCAR products in many countries
      worldwide, along with truck leasing and financing services. In the early
      2000s PACCAR employed about 17,000 people in 11 factories, nine
      distribution centers, and various regional offices around the world.
    

      FOUR GENERATIONS OF PACCAR LEADERS
    

      In 1905 William Pigott Sr. (1860–1929), the son of Irish immigrants
      and great-grandfather of Mark Pigott, founded the Seattle Car
      Manufacturing Company—as PACCAR was originally known—in West
      Seattle, Washington, where it made logging equipment and trucks. The
      company was incorporated on February 11, 1905. It merged with a Portland,
      Oregon, company, Twohy Brothers, in 1917 and was renamed the Pacific Car
      and Foundry Company, where it expanded into making rail cars. The company
      was sold to American Car and Foundry in 1924 and went through several
      difficult periods during the Great Depression as demand decreased for rail
      cars. The Pigott family did not have control of the company from the late
      1920s to the early 1930s.
    

      Paul Pigott (1900–1961), William Pigott's son and
      Mark's grandfather, reacquired the company in 1934 and ran it as
      chairman and CEO until his death in 1961. The company manufactured Sherman
      tanks for use during World War II. At
       the war's end, however, in 1945, the company migrated its business
      into truck manufacturing when it acquired the Kenworth Motor Truck Company
      in Seattle, Washington, and later the Peterbilt Truck Company, based in
      California. Charles M. Pigott (1929–), Paul Pigott's son and
      Mark's father, became president in 1965 and added the titles of
      chairman and CEO three years later. On January 25, 1971, Pacific Car and
      Foundry Company changed its name to PACCAR to better describe the
      businesses it owned and operated. Charles's son, Mark Pigott, the
      company's chairman and CEO in the early 21st century, succeeded him
      in 1997.
    

      CAREER WITH PACCAR
    

      Pigott worked at the company during the summers while he was in high
      school. During summer breaks from Stanford University, Pigott was employed
      at PACCAR dealerships. Those early experiences, which included welding,
      painting trucks, operating forklifts, and assembling chassis (main frames
      of trucks), helped Pigott learn almost all aspects of the business. After
      college he was hired in 1977 as an internal auditor. Pigott advanced in
      several positions at a number of divisions including Peterbilt Motors,
      headquartered in Denton, Texas, and Foden Trucks in the United Kingdom.
      Pigott was hired as vice president of PACCAR in October 1988 and was
      promoted in January 1990 to the position of senior vice president. In
      December 1993 he was selected to be PACCAR's executive vice
      president. Pigott became a director beginning in 1994 and was promoted to
      vice chairman in January 1995. Pigott became CEO and chairman in January
      1997.
    

      Pigott was a low-key leader, avoiding interviews and the high-profile
      lifestyles often led by his corporate peers. In fact, Pigott was opposed
      to the publicity-seeking headlines that were all too often prominent in
      corporate management. On the other hand, he was very lively and
      informative when speaking with pride, for example, about his aerodynamic
      truck bodies and various custom-made accessories inside the cabs. An
      enthusiastic, detail-oriented leader, Pigott gained a reputation as one of
      the most respected world authorities in the trucking industry. People who
      knew the tall, lanky Pigott frequently commented about how dedicated he
      was to the company and its people. No doubt part of that passion for
      PACCAR came from the long family heritage of building vehicles to
      transport freight.
    

      PACCAR IN THE 1990S
    

      During the 1990s Pigott continued the consistent, customer-oriented
      philosophy that had been adopted by his predecessors within the company.
      Pigott also maintained a strong leadership style for PACCAR. Consequently,
      PACCAR was not as negatively affected as other large companies during
      periodic operational and economic upheavals in the industry.
    

      Pigott spent much of his time in the 1990s supporting new technologies
      within PACCAR. He was proud of the fact that PACCAR was one of the few
      truck manufacturers that incorporated technology in its designing,
      manufacturing, and marketing processes. For example, Pigott introduced
      computer technology when bringing parts into PACCAR factories. This
      just-in-time process (a set of computer techniques to improve the return
      on investment by reducing in-house inventories and their related costs)
      dramatically reduced the amount of storage space needed for PACCAR, area
      that was eventually turned into additional manufacturing surfaces.
      Application of this and other innovative technologies meant that PACCAR
      was able to develop new truck lines in months, not years, like other
      companies. In fact, the company was recognized by 
      
        PC Week
      
       magazine in 1999 for the quality of its information technology systems.
    

      According to Pigott, such investments in technology gave PACCAR a
      three-to-five-year lead over its competition with respect to overall
      ability to design, manufacture, and market products, serve customers, and
      manage finances. With very little debt to restrict its operations, Pigott
      was able to invest more money in the business for quicker production of
      its goods. Such actions yielded greater profits, higher market share, and
      better name recognition, all of which resulted in PACCAR's winning
      quality awards from around the world. Stock analysts who regularly
      followed PACCAR agreed that Pigott's focus on operational
      excellence would continue to increase the company's share of this
      key manufacturing market.
    

      In 1992 PACCAR's Parts Division opened a new headquarters building
      in Renton, Washington. The building occupied part of the company's
      historic Pacific Car and Foundry site. The 1990s were also an important
      growth period for PACCAR Financial Corporation, which offered in-house
      financing for Kenworth and Peterbilt and for PACCAR's leasing
      corporation, which became one of the 10 largest full-service leasing
      companies in North America. By 1995 PACCAR marketed trucks in more than 40
      countries and was one of the largest exporters of capital goods in North
      America. By the end of the 1990s Pigott had overseen the inception of
      several capital projects, including a 24,300 square-foot research and
      development center at its Kenworth truck plant in Renton; an expansion
      project that nearly doubled the size of its customer call center, also in
      Renton; and new parts distribution centers in Atlanta, Georgia, and
      Leyland, England.
    

      During the late 1990s Pigott focused on communication and management
      systems for its truck dealers and owner operators. Pigott had
      PACCAR's Dealer Management Consulting arm offer services for human
      resources, insurance and financial planning, dealership operations and
      management, and computer systems management. Pigott directed
      PACCAR's Driver Board and Dealer Councils to let Kenworth and
      Peterbilt drivers and dealers share customer feedback with the
       PACCAR management team. As a result of Pigott's innovations,
      especially with new computer technologies, improved design features and
      greater product quality were incorporated into all of the company's
      products.
    

      DRIVING SUCCESS
    

      Net income in the first quarter of 2004 at PACCAR rose 64 percent to
      $182.2 million compared with $110.8 million just one year earlier. At the
      same time, revenue rose 32 percent to $2.37 billion from $1.8 billion.
      Pigott announced that all of PACCAR's segments had strong results,
      with 2003 being the company's second-best year in its history.
    

      Pigott also participated in various activities outside of PACCAR. He was a
      member of the Washington State Roundtable, the Business Council in
      Washington, D.C., the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and the
      Society of American Engineers, and he was active in numerous local
      charitable organizations in the Pacific Northwest.
    

      A TRADITION OF EXCELLENCE
    

      The four generations of Pigott men who led PACCAR achieved quality results
      for decades, earning a net profit and paying a dividend every year since
      1941. With Pigott's technological innovations and attention to
      customer services, PACCAR continued to show consistent profits even though
      the trade and transportation industry went through a dramatic downturn at
      the beginning of the 2000s. Mark Pigott, along with his forebears, pursued
      nearly a century of quality that led to PACCAR's being a strong
      business leader in the northwestern United States and a major global
      corporation.
    

      Pigott credited the creative contributions of PACCAR's employees
      and coordinated efforts by management to expand market share overseas and
      to invest in facilities, new products, and information technology for the
      company's outstanding performance in the 1990s and early 2000s.
      PACCAR was well positioned in the early 21st century to extend its string
      of profitable years.

■ Truck manufacturing executive Mark C. Pigott was the CEO and chairman of the Bellevue, Washington-based PACCAR. As the leader of this diversified, multinational company, Pigott was responsible for maintaining the consistently high standards of quality that PACCAR had historically guaranteed in all of its products. Pigott ensured that his lines of well-engineered, highly customized, and exceptionally performing products were sold efficiently throughout its global markets. In fact, in 2003 Pigott was awarded the Order of the British Empire in recognition of outstanding services that were directed toward strengthening business relationships between the United Kingdom and the United States. In 2004 Pigott was named CEO of the Year by Washington CEO magazine. In that same year PACCAR won the International Stevie Business Award based on the company's consistently producing the highest-quality products in their sector, along with maintaining strong cost controls and developing new and original technological applications.
PACCAR


As a global technology company, PACCAR was the world's second-largest manufacturer of big rig trucks, with sales in North America, Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. (Daimler Chrysler's Freightliner subsidiary was the largest such maker.) Because PACCAR had consistently been a leader with regards to technology, Pigott maintained that PACCAR should rightfully be called a technology company that made trucks, not a truck company that used technology. PACCAR designed and manufactured exclusive lines of light-, medium-, and heavy-duty trucks that included the Kenworth, Peterbilt, DAF, Leyland, and Foden nameplates. In addition, the company also provided customer support and aftermarket parts for its products. PACCAR's other products included Braden, Carco, and Gearmatic industrial winches. Except for a few company-owned branches, PACCAR's trucks and parts were sold exclusively through independent dealerships. The company's PacLease and PACCAR Financial Corporation subsidiaries sold PACCAR products in many countries worldwide, along with truck leasing and financing services. In the early 2000s PACCAR employed about 17,000 people in 11 factories, nine distribution centers, and various regional offices around the world.
FOUR GENERATIONS OF PACCAR LEADERS
In 1905 William Pigott Sr. (1860–1929), the son of Irish immigrants and great-grandfather of Mark Pigott, founded the Seattle Car Manufacturing Company—as PACCAR was originally known—in West Seattle, Washington, where it made logging equipment and trucks. The company was incorporated on February 11, 1905. It merged with a Portland, Oregon, company, Twohy Brothers, in 1917 and was renamed the Pacific Car and Foundry Company, where it expanded into making rail cars. The company was sold to American Car and Foundry in 1924 and went through several difficult periods during the Great Depression as demand decreased for rail cars. The Pigott family did not have control of the company from the late 1920s to the early 1930s.
Paul Pigott (1900–1961), William Pigott's son and Mark's grandfather, reacquired the company in 1934 and ran it as chairman and CEO until his death in 1961. The company manufactured Sherman tanks for use during World War II. At the war's end, however, in 1945, the company migrated its business into truck manufacturing when it acquired the Kenworth Motor Truck Company in Seattle, Washington, and later the Peterbilt Truck Company, based in California. Charles M. Pigott (1929–), Paul Pigott's son and Mark's father, became president in 1965 and added the titles of chairman and CEO three years later. On January 25, 1971, Pacific Car and Foundry Company changed its name to PACCAR to better describe the businesses it owned and operated. Charles's son, Mark Pigott, the company's chairman and CEO in the early 21st century, succeeded him in 1997.
CAREER WITH PACCAR
Pigott worked at the company during the summers while he was in high school. During summer breaks from Stanford University, Pigott was employed at PACCAR dealerships. Those early experiences, which included welding, painting trucks, operating forklifts, and assembling chassis (main frames of trucks), helped Pigott learn almost all aspects of the business. After college he was hired in 1977 as an internal auditor. Pigott advanced in several positions at a number of divisions including Peterbilt Motors, headquartered in Denton, Texas, and Foden Trucks in the United Kingdom. Pigott was hired as vice president of PACCAR in October 1988 and was promoted in January 1990 to the position of senior vice president. In December 1993 he was selected to be PACCAR's executive vice president. Pigott became a director beginning in 1994 and was promoted to vice chairman in January 1995. Pigott became CEO and chairman in January 1997.
Pigott was a low-key leader, avoiding interviews and the high-profile lifestyles often led by his corporate peers. In fact, Pigott was opposed to the publicity-seeking headlines that were all too often prominent in corporate management. On the other hand, he was very lively and informative when speaking with pride, for example, about his aerodynamic truck bodies and various custom-made accessories inside the cabs. An enthusiastic, detail-oriented leader, Pigott gained a reputation as one of the most respected world authorities in the trucking industry. People who knew the tall, lanky Pigott frequently commented about how dedicated he was to the company and its people. No doubt part of that passion for PACCAR came from the long family heritage of building vehicles to transport freight.
PACCAR IN THE 1990S
During the 1990s Pigott continued the consistent, customer-oriented philosophy that had been adopted by his predecessors within the company. Pigott also maintained a strong leadership style for PACCAR. Consequently, PACCAR was not as negatively affected as other large companies during periodic operational and economic upheavals in the industry.
Pigott spent much of his time in the 1990s supporting new technologies within PACCAR. He was proud of the fact that PACCAR was one of the few truck manufacturers that incorporated technology in its designing, manufacturing, and marketing processes. For example, Pigott introduced computer technology when bringing parts into PACCAR factories. This just-in-time process (a set of computer techniques to improve the return on investment by reducing in-house inventories and their related costs) dramatically reduced the amount of storage space needed for PACCAR, area that was eventually turned into additional manufacturing surfaces. Application of this and other innovative technologies meant that PACCAR was able to develop new truck lines in months, not years, like other companies. In fact, the company was recognized by PC Week magazine in 1999 for the quality of its information technology systems.
According to Pigott, such investments in technology gave PACCAR a three-to-five-year lead over its competition with respect to overall ability to design, manufacture, and market products, serve customers, and manage finances. With very little debt to restrict its operations, Pigott was able to invest more money in the business for quicker production of its goods. Such actions yielded greater profits, higher market share, and better name recognition, all of which resulted in PACCAR's winning quality awards from around the world. Stock analysts who regularly followed PACCAR agreed that Pigott's focus on operational excellence would continue to increase the company's share of this key manufacturing market.
In 1992 PACCAR's Parts Division opened a new headquarters building in Renton, Washington. The building occupied part of the company's historic Pacific Car and Foundry site. The 1990s were also an important growth period for PACCAR Financial Corporation, which offered in-house financing for Kenworth and Peterbilt and for PACCAR's leasing corporation, which became one of the 10 largest full-service leasing companies in North America. By 1995 PACCAR marketed trucks in more than 40 countries and was one of the largest exporters of capital goods in North America. By the end of the 1990s Pigott had overseen the inception of several capital projects, including a 24,300 square-foot research and development center at its Kenworth truck plant in Renton; an expansion project that nearly doubled the size of its customer call center, also in Renton; and new parts distribution centers in Atlanta, Georgia, and Leyland, England.


During the late 1990s Pigott focused on communication and management systems for its truck dealers and owner operators. Pigott had PACCAR's Dealer Management Consulting arm offer services for human resources, insurance and financial planning, dealership operations and management, and computer systems management. Pigott directed PACCAR's Driver Board and Dealer Councils to let Kenworth and Peterbilt drivers and dealers share customer feedback with the PACCAR management team. As a result of Pigott's innovations, especially with new computer technologies, improved design features and greater product quality were incorporated into all of the company's products.
DRIVING SUCCESS
Net income in the first quarter of 2004 at PACCAR rose 64 percent to $182.2 million compared with $110.8 million just one year earlier. At the same time, revenue rose 32 percent to $2.37 billion from $1.8 billion. Pigott announced that all of PACCAR's segments had strong results, with 2003 being the company's second-best year in its history.
Pigott also participated in various activities outside of PACCAR. He was a member of the Washington State Roundtable, the Business Council in Washington, D.C., the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and the Society of American Engineers, and he was active in numerous local charitable organizations in the Pacific Northwest.
A TRADITION OF EXCELLENCE
The four generations of Pigott men who led PACCAR achieved quality results for decades, earning a net profit and paying a dividend every year since 1941. With Pigott's technological innovations and attention to customer services, PACCAR continued to show consistent profits even though the trade and transportation industry went through a dramatic downturn at the beginning of the 2000s. Mark Pigott, along with his forebears, pursued nearly a century of quality that led to PACCAR's being a strong business leader in the northwestern United States and a major global corporation.
Pigott credited the creative contributions of PACCAR's employees and coordinated efforts by management to expand market share overseas and to invest in facilities, new products, and information technology for the company's outstanding performance in the 1990s and early 2000s. PACCAR was well positioned in the early 21st century to extend its string of profitable years.

Business career[edit]
Mark Pigott's successful career with PACCAR began in 1978. He is the fourth generation of the Pigott family to lead the company. PACCAR, a Fortune 200 company, celebrated its 110th year in 2015 and has earned 77 years of consecutive profitability. PACCAR (revenues $19.12 billion) (Nasdaq:PCAR)[8] is publicly traded and is a global technology leader in the capital goods and financial services industries. PACCAR's major brands are DAF Trucks, Kenworth and Peterbilt trucks, PACCAR Financial, PacLease, PACCAR Parts and PACCAR Information Technology.
Under Mark Pigott's leadership as Chairman and CEO, Paccar has delivered a 1,700 percent total return to shareholders. Pigott's focus on quality and innovation has resulted in Paccar receiving many J.D. Power and Associates Awards for highest customer satisfaction as well as International Truck of the Year Awards.
PACCAR has earned the distinction of being one of the nation's leading companies by Forbes, Barron's, BusinessWeek, Industryweek, and InformationWeek magazine.
Pigott has been Chairman of the DAF Supervisory Board since 1996, served on the Business Council (Washington, D.C.) (retired), and on the Washington State Business Roundtable Executive Committee (retired).
Harvard Business Review (January 2010) named Pigott as one of the top 50 global CEO's based on long term shareholder returns.
Philanthropy[edit]
Mark Pigott is President of the PACCAR Foundation,[9] which annually donates $5–$10 million in support of education, social services and the arts. Beneficiaries included University of North Texas (2006), Stanford University (2006), Mississippi State University (2007), Gonzaga University (2006), East Mississippi Community College (2007), University of Washington (2008) Seattle University (2009) University of Puget Sound[10] (2013) and Washington State University[11] (2014). Pigott established the prestigious PACCAR Award for Teaching Excellence[12] at the University of Washington in 1997. This is the highest honorarium teaching award for MBA professors in the United States. Pigott's strong support of corporate giving is demonstrated by the fact that in 2014,[13] PACCAR was ranked fifth on a list of 25 top large corporate philanthropists in the state of Washington by the Puget Sound Business Journal Book of Lists.[14]
On a personal basis, Pigott has funded professorships and scholarships at Stanford University, Trinity College Dublin, the University of Washington, Gonzaga University, Kings College, Cambridge, Cambridge University[15] and Trinity College, Dublin.[16]
He purchased a seat on the Board of the Royal Shakespeare Company America,[17] The British Library Foundation,[18] St. George's Society (New York) Advisory Board[19] and Trinity College Foundation.[20] He is a life member of the National Gallery London,[21] The British Library, Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufacture Commerce (RSA),[22] and the Royal National Theatre,[23] UK. Major philanthropy also includes strategic planning and implementation of capital projects at St Paul's Cathedral, London,[24] the Royal Shakespeare Company, National Gallery UK and Trinity College, Dublin.[25] An avid bibliophile, Mark Pigott is involved in numerous projects benefiting the British Library[26] and the Folger Shakespeare Library.[27] For over a decade, his dedication to educating the next generation of leaders is evidenced by his participation as a lecturer at numerous graduate schools of business, including the University of Washington,[28] Seattle University,[29] Gonzaga University,[30] Stanford,[31] and Trinity College, Dublin.[25]

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
