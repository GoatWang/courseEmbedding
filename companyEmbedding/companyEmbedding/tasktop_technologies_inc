	Congratulations to Tasktop Technologies, 2013's #5 Most Innovative Company in B.C.
Countless hours are wasted at work due to inefficient communication between departments. Mik Kersten, CEO and co-founder of Vancouver-based Tasktop Technologies Inc., has set out to solve this very human problem, at least for software developers.


Kersten and his team created a tool to help companies with large software development divisions track their time and tasks more effectively from the creation phase all the way to testing and delivery. Typically, developers use what’s known in the industry as application lifecycle management, or ALM, tools to help developers, testers and other staff organize and coordinate their work. Larger companies might use a number of such systems; Boeing, for example, might use one from Microsoft and another from HP. These systems don’t always communicate with each another, leaving teams out of sync, with constantly evolving requirements lost in the translation from idea to a final software product.


Tasktop created software that allows management systems for software developers to integrate and communicate more efficiently. They’re the first company to connect disparate software-development systems, up to 70 at a time, and the first to market in this area, according to Rizwan Kheraj, the industrial technology adviser for the National Research Council’s IRAP program at SFU who has worked with Tasktop since its inception. “You can think of them as the Switzerland of ALM systems,” Kheraj says. “They’re sort of the arms dealer that deals with multiple conflicts.”


Since its launch in 2008, Tasktop has continually expanded its efforts to quell conflicts in the software world. An earlier version of its software called Mylyn, released for free as open source, is downloaded two million times a month.


Tasktop counts such Global 2000 corporations as IBM and Microsoft among its clients and has doubled staff and revenue in the past 18 months.

New Tasktop Tool Scales Agile, DevOps Integrations

By David Ramel02/01/2017


 
Tasktop Technologies Inc. combined several of its software development and delivery products into a new suite that it says takes a different approach to integrating enterprise agile and DevOps initiatives.

Announced yesterday, the Tasktop Integration Hub is designed to harness all of an organization's development and delivery tools, workflows and integrations into one tool that can scale as needed.

This scaling capability is especially important as methodologies such as agile and DevOps have transformed enterprise software development, the company said. One aspect of that transformation is the shift from single, inclusive platforms to disaggregated best-of-breed tools from multiple sources.

While integrating just a few disparate tools is relatively simple, the interrelationships and integration problems become much more complex as the number of tools increases, which Tasktop said is a recent industry trend.












"In prior decades, the way to succeed with new methodologies involved betting on the right platform," said Tasktop CEO Mik Kersten in a blog post yesterday.  "But in the world of agile and DevOps, there is no one platform.  Instead, we are witnessing a large-scale disaggregation of the tool chain towards the best-of-breed solutions.  For large-scale agile and DevOps transformations to succeed, we must shift our thinking from end-to-end platform to tool chain modularity."

 Integration Hub Overview (source: Tasktop)  
To that end, the new integration hub combines tools that were previously offered independently, including Tasktop Sync (an integration server), Data (a data repository for near real-time analytics) and Gateway (an integration tool for connecting DevOps tools to the software lifecycle).

The integration hub introduces the concept of model-based integration that helps disparate tools work together, something that becomes more problematic as the number of tools increases. Tasktop used the metaphor of language translation to illustrate this concept. Whereas translating a document from Spanish to French and vice versa is relatively easy, translating a bunch of languages into all of the other languages is much more difficult. In the model-based approach, this becomes easier, as a language is first translated into a model -- a kind of universal language, like English, for example -- and then that single model is translated into all the other languages.

"For example, user stories, defects and support ticket models are defined in Tasktop, and then can be easily mapped across dozens of different projects and tools," Kersten said.

 Integration Hub in Action (source: Tasktop)  
Tasktop said its approach enables organizations to grow their software deployments to the scale of hundreds of projects, tens of thousands of users and millions of artifacts -- such as tasks, defects and requirements -- without the need to write any code.

In addition to the model-based integration, other features of the new offering highlighted by the company include:


Support for applying different styles of integration across tools. For example, agile and ITSM tools can be integrated for defect/ticket unification then easily connected to a database for instant Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR) metrics.
Easy scaling across hundreds of projects. By defining models that span projects and tools, new projects can be on-boarded easily and connected to the value stream.
All integrations work all of the time via Tasktop's  Integration Factory. Multiple versions of the same tool can be connected, along with old versions of legacy tools and the frequently updated APIs of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) tools, without breaking because Tasktop tests all version combinations. Currently, Tasktop supports 51 tools and 364 versions.

Tasktop said its integration hub, which has been under development for three years and available as a limited release for about 10 months, is now generally available.

"As organizations transform into digital businesses, the agile and DevOps movements powering those transformations start to fail once they are deployed to hundreds and thousands of IT staff," the company said in a statement yesterday.  "The best-of-breed tools that make start-ups successful were not designed to work together at this scale, resulting in duplicate entry, a lack of visibility, cost overruns and compliance exposure. Point-to-point integrations, Enterprise Services Buses and in-house approaches cannot solve the problem as they become prohibitively expensive to maintain due to the countless tools and versions that make up the modern tool chain. 

"Tasktop serves as a Value Stream Integration platform, the first of its kind, providing organizations with an enterprise-grade backbone that flows information in real time across all of the people, processes and tools involved in software delivery."

TASKTOP INTEGRATION HUB

 Make Agile and DevOps Work at Scale    


Tasktop In Action

 








 
 
Flow Information Between Teams

Everyone in your organization works in their tools of choice, but has access to updates other team members make in theirs. This reduces manual re-keying of information, mistakes caused by old or incomplete information as well as interminable email threads and status meetings. For example, requirements will flow automatically from the BA’s tool to the dev team’s Agile planning tool and to the tester’s test management tool. Defects are automatically recorded in the defect tracking tool when the code scanning tools find security vulnerabilities.  









 
 
Start Small, Scale DevOps Fast

Whether you’re connecting two tools or 20, just a few projects or hundreds, your integrations need to be straightforward to set up and manage. With Tasktop's model-based integration, you're able to use customized models for each artifact allowing you to reuse those models across multiple projects and tools.     









 
 
Gain Visibility and Traceability Across Your Value Stream

Individual tools can only report on the data they manage, making it difficult to see the bottleneck in your software delivery. Tasktop enables visibility and traceability across the full lifecycle of software development and delivery, from ideation to production. Whenever artifacts change in any of the connected tools, activity data is streamed to a centralized database where it can be manipulated and visualized using standard business intelligence tools.

LIFECYCLE TOOLS

 Lifecycle Management Tools are often the systems of record for various development and delivery artifacts. This category includes tools for PPM; requirements management; test management and defect tracking; agile planning; service desk; and others. Tasktop integrates these tools to each other by synchronizing the artifacts across them. In addition, it can create or modify artifacts in these lifecycle tools based on activity in connected DevOps tools. And because Tasktop is a witness to all this activity, it streams activity data to Database tools to enable full-lifecycle visibility.

Integrations




 Integrate your tools. Connect your software development and delivery team.There are superb tools available today for every phase of software development and delivery. Tools for developers, for testers, for business analysts and product managers. Tools for service desk, software security, and portfolio management professionals. Without question, these tools make each individual more productive in their own specialty.The issue is none of these tools speak the same language.  Which means more collaboration, status updates and reporting – using email, spreadsheets and status meetings. This is where software integration comes in. By connecting your endpoints your teams can share the artifacts they create and improve workflow processes across multiple departments. Gateway Add-On Tasktop Gateway capability allows organizations to scale their DevOps practices by integrating DevOps automation tools enabling visibility across the entire software development and delivery lifecycle. Organizations can now connect tools like CI, CD and test automation; analysis tools like code review and static code analysis; and monitoring tools like APM products to the entire range of Agile and ALM, PPM and ITSM tools supported by Tasktop. The Gateway capability is available as an add-on module for Tasktop Sync and is included as part of Tasktop Data. Explore Gateway > Tasktop Sync enables:CollaborationConnect all stakeholders in the software delivery supply chain. Reduce friction that slows development, introduces errors and makes regulatory compliance difficult. Flow Unlock data trapped within lifecycle tool silos and let it flow automatically between systems.Traceability Get a view into the relationships among development artifacts and changes made to them – no matter what tool those changes were made in.  
 


  Ease of deployment and useSystem administrators can integrate software tools through a graphical interface that lets them create, maintain and monitor integrations – with no programming.Differences among data types, text formatting, and even very complex relationships among artifacts are handled right out of the box.Browser-based analytics and dashboards simplify management and monitoring of ALM systems.ALM tool users never see Tasktop Sync and don’t leave their tool of choice; artifacts are synched automatically without manual intervention.Support for leading ALM and DevOps toolsOur technology approach and vendor relationships give us unrivaled knowledge of the nuances of each system, create very sophisticated integrations among these systems and allows us to stay abreast of changes in the endpoint systems.When the tool vendors release a new version, we support it soon after. For SaaS products, our test lab catches API changes as soon as the release is rolled out.Enterprise-grade solutionOur test lab with over 200 dedicated VMs runs hundreds of thousands of tests nightly.Tasktop Sync understands, mirrors and synchronizes artifact relationships, no matter how complex, across the enterprise.Provides real-time synchronization with <1s response time.Highly-efficient change detection algorithm does not over-burden endpoint systems; performance is not gated by the number of artifacts synched.Tasktop Sync integrates on-premise, on-demand and hybrid infrastructures.Provides advanced conflict resolution – handles simultaneous updates and conflicts resulting from differences in workflow rules among endpoint systems.Operates even when endpoints are disconnected or offline.Integration templates facilitate large-scale deployments.
