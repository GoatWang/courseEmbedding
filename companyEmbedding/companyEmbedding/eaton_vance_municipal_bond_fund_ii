This data reflects distributions paid on Fund shares held for the full calendar year and is not predictive of the tax character of current or future distributions.  Fund shareholders should refer to the individual IRS Form 1099-DIVs provided to them shor tly after each year-end to determine the appropriate federal income tax treatment of the distributions they receive.  Eaton Vance is not responsible for any errors in tax reporting that may result from using the above data. Exempt-interest dividends are  not subject to regular federal income tax. Exempt-interest dividends derived from specified private activity bonds are subject to the alternative minimum tax (AMT). Non-qualified ordinary dividends are subject to federal income tax at ordinary rates. Cap ital gains distributions are taxable at long-term capital gain rates.

 Insights & Analysis  Commentary
A Word On The Markets as of  Mar 31, 2017
The U.S. municipal bond market posted positive returns for the first quarter of 2017, with the Bloomberg Barclays Municipal Bond Index (the Index)5 returning 1.6% for the three-month period. After experiencing a significant amount of volatility foll owing Donald Trump's presidential election victory during the fourth quarter of 2016, the municipal market stabilized during the first quarter. During the period, short-term municipal yields declined 20-25 basis points, while intermediate- and longer-ter m yields were flat to slightly higher.
After experiencing significantly negative outflows during the last six weeks of 2016, mutual fund flows stabilized and turned positive in January, as some investors sought to take advantage of both higher municipal yields and attractive relative valuatio ns. Despite this expression of confidence at the beginning of the year, mutual fund flows for the entire quarter were fairly tepid with overall inflows totaling just under $5 billion. Issuance during the quarter declined to $88 billion compared to $100 b illion during the fourth quarter of 2016. The slowdown in issuance was largely related to the a decline in refunding activity due to higher interest rates and the uncertainty surrounding President Trump's agenda for health care, tax reform and infrastruc ture spending.
Compared to the sharp sell-off during the fourth quarter, the municipal market was relatively quiet during the first quarter. Treasury yields traded in a fairly tight range and the curve was more or less unchanged. Meanwhile, the municipal yield curve st eepened significantly as two- and five-year yields declined 19 and 24 basis points, respectively, while 30-year yields increased 1bp. As a result, short term municipals outperformed longer-term municipals with the five-and seven-year part of the curve le ading the way.
In terms of credit quality, lower quality municipals outperformed higher quality as BBB's within the Index returned 2.2% compared to AAAs up 1.4%. Similarly, after underperforming significantly during the fourth quarter, the Bloomberg Barclays High Yield  Municipal Bond Index6 returned 4.1%, significantly outperforming investment grade. This outperformance was primarily due to higher carry, spread tightening and renewed strength in the tobacco sector, which returned 13.1%. Finally, Puerto Rico cred its underperformed significantly following the release of its Certified Financial Plan in mid-March, which proved to be more negative for all bondholders than previously anticipated.


Performance Summary 
Eaton Vance Municipal Bond Fund II (the Fund) (EIV) underperformed the Index7 at net asset value for the quarter. An overweight exposure to Pre-refunded bonds detracted from relative performance and the Fund's security selection among zero coupon bond s also diminished performance relative to the Index. Aiding the Fund's performance was its security selection in the Electric/Power sector and its use of leverage employed through TOBs and auction rate preferred shares. These securities act as a financin g mechanism allowing investors to borrow at short-term rates and invest in higher-yielding bonds.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Performance is for the stated time period only; due to market volatili ty, the Fund's current performance may be lower or higher than quoted. The Fund's performance at market price will differ from its results at NAV. Returns are historical and are calculated by determining the percentage change in net asset value or market  price (as applicable) with all distributions reinvested and includes management fees and other expenses. Until the reinvestment of Fund distributions is completed, returns are calculated using the lower of the net asset value or market price of the shar es on the distribution ex date.  Once the reinvestment is complete, returns are calculated using the average reinvestment price.  Performance less than or equal to one year is cumulative.

Investment Outlook And Fund Positioning 
We believe munis continue to be attractive on both an absolute and relative level. Intermediate- and longer-term municipals stabilized during the quarter, and the 10- and 30-year municipal-to-Treasury ratios ended the quarter at 94% and 101%, respectivel y.
Lackluster mutual fund flows and the ongoing expectation of lower taxes under the Trump administration have combined to keep municipal valuations attractive, in our view. In addition, we continue to lack specific details related to the specifics of Trump 's policies, what will get through Congress, and when. As a result, there are a wide range of potential outcomes.
In our view, the historic move higher in yields during the fourth quarter of 2016 created an emerging opportunity to lock in higher yields and potentially generate higher future returns. After the first three months of 2017, we believe this opportunity r emains in place. In recent history, the municipal market has proven to be resilient and sharp increases in municipal yields have resulted in buying opportunities and rewarded investors with strong returns in subsequent months. Therefore, we continue to b elieve that municipal yields could move back down a bit in 2017. There are other factors that could cause rates to retrace a bit, especially on the longer end of the Treasury curve. First, U.S. Treasury yields are still historically low, but very attract ive when compared with other developed markets such as Europe and Japan. Second, following the failure to reform the Affordable Care Act, uncertainty surrounding President Trump's ability to deliver on the policy front has increased. And finally, after i ncreasing the fed Funds rate by 25 basis points during the first quarter, the Federal Reserve is forecasting two more rate hikes in 2017, demonstrating a willingness to squeeze off inflationary pressures, if necessary.
Given this outlook, we believe tax-sensitive investors continue to be offered the opportunity to scale into munis at attractive yields and valuations. In addition, we believe municipals will continue to act as an anchor to provide diversification in the  context of an overall portfolio.8

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Performance is for the stated time period only; due to market volatili ty, the Fund's current performance may be lower or higher than quoted. The Fund's performance at market price will differ from its results at NAV. Returns are historical and are calculated by determining the percentage change in net asset value or market  price (as applicable) with all distributions reinvested and includes management fees and other expenses. Until the reinvestment of Fund distributions is completed, returns are calculated using the lower of the net asset value or market price of the shar es on the distribution ex date.  Once the reinvestment is complete, returns are calculated using the average reinvestment price.  Performance less than or equal to one year is cumulative.

This data reflects distributions paid on Fund shares held for the full calendar year and is not predictive of the tax character of current or future distributions.  Fund shareholders should refer to the individual IRS Form 1099-DIVs provided to them shor tly after each year-end to determine the appropriate federal income tax treatment of the distributions they receive.  Eaton Vance is not responsible for any errors in tax reporting that may result from using the above data. Exempt-interest dividends are  not subject to regular federal income tax. Exempt-interest dividends derived from specified private activity bonds are subject to the alternative minimum tax (AMT). Non-qualified ordinary dividends are subject to federal income tax at ordinary rates. Cap ital gains distributions are taxable at long-term capital gain rates. Nondividend distributions, also known as return of capital distributions, are not subject to current federal income tax. Instead, the tax cost basis of each shareholder receiving a ret urn of capital distribution is reduced by the amount of the distribution.
