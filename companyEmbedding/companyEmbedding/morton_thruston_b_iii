Early life[edit]
Morton was born in Louisville, Kentucky, to David Morton and his wife, Mary Ballard, descended from pioneer settlers of the area. He had a brother, Rogers Clark Ballard Morton, who also became a politician (as discussed below), and a sister, Jane, who survived him. He attended local public schools then the Woodberry Forest School before he entered Yale University. He received a B.A. there in 1929.
Morton then worked in the family business, Ballard & Ballard Flour Milling, becoming its chairman of the board before the company was sold to the Pillsbury Company.
A lifelong Episcopalian, he married Belle Clay Lyons and was survived by their two sons, Clay Lyons Morton and Thruston Ballard Morton Jr, and five grandchildren.
His brother, Rogers Clark Ballard Morton, represented Maryland in the US House of Representatives from 1963 through 1971, when he became Secretary of the Interior in the administration of Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Gerald R. Ford and Secretary of Commerce under Ford, before heading Ford's re-election campaign in 1976.
US House of Representatives[edit]
After naval service in World War II, Morton defeated incumbent Democrat Emmet O'Neal in 1946 for his native Louisville area, 61,899 votes to 44,599. He served three terms in the House, from January 3, 1947 to January 3, 1953.
Assistant Secretary of State[edit]
After leaving the House, Morton served as Assistant Secretary of State for Congressional Relations[1] in the administration of Dwight D. Eisenhower, garnering support for Eisenhower's foreign policy.
US Senate[edit]
In 1956, Morton, by a very narrow margin, defeated incumbent Democratic United States Senator Earle C. Clements, a former Kentucky governor and minority leader in the Senate, by 506,903 votes to 499,922. Morton was re-elected to a second term in the Senate in 1962, defeating the Democratic lieutenant governor and former mayor of Louisville, Wilson W. Wyatt.
Morton served from January 3, 1957 until his resignation, on December 16, 1968. He vacated the seat a few weeks early to allow his successor, Marlow Cook, a fellow Republican with similar views, to gain an edge in seniority.
In the Senate, Morton was considered a moderate and voted, along with his Republican colleague John Sherman Cooper and most other Republicans, for the Civil Rights Act of 1964. A compromise that Morton proposed to guarantee jury trials in all criminal contempt cases except for voting rights proved, with the assistance of Senators Everett Dirksen and Bourke Hickenlooper, crucial in passing that Civil Rights Act.[2]
Morton was the chairman of the Republican National Committee from 1959 to 1961 and chaired the Republican National Convention of 1964.
When Morton resigned, he surprised many, who considered him at the peak of his political power. However, he opposed the Vietnam War despite being criticized by Representative William Cowger. Also, he was both depressed by the urban violence after the deaths of Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy and disappointed in his party's failure to address the broader social issues. He also ultimately counseled Lyndon Johnson to decline to seek re-election, and he supported the unsuccessful presidential candidacy of Nelson Rockefeller.
Morton is interviewed in the 1968 documentary film In the Year of the Pig, and another interview is available through the Lyndon Baines Johnson Presidential Library.[3]
Final years, death and legacy[edit]
After his retirement from the Senate, Morton served as vice chairman of Liberty National Bank in Louisville, president of the American Horse Council, and chairman of the board of Churchill Downs, and he served as one of the directors of the University of Louisville, Pillsbury Company, Pittston Company, Louisville Board of Trade, Texas Gas Company, R.J. Reynolds Company, and the Ohio Valley Assembly.
Morton died after many years of declining health. His brother Rogers Morton had died three years previously, and his wife, Belle, survived him by more than a decade.[4] His papers are held by Louisville's Filson Historical Society, which his grandfather had revitalized.[5] The Kentucky Digital Library has a collection of his speeches.[6]

Early life[edit]
Morton was born in Louisville, Kentucky, to David Morton and his wife, Mary Ballard, descended from pioneer settlers of the area. He had a brother, Rogers Clark Ballard Morton, who also became a politician (as discussed below), and a sister, Jane, who survived him. He attended local public schools then the Woodberry Forest School before he entered Yale University. He received a B.A. there in 1929.
Morton then worked in the family business, Ballard & Ballard Flour Milling, becoming its chairman of the board before the company was sold to the Pillsbury Company.
A lifelong Episcopalian, he married Belle Clay Lyons and was survived by their two sons, Clay Lyons Morton and Thruston Ballard Morton Jr, and five grandchildren.
His brother, Rogers Clark Ballard Morton, represented Maryland in the US House of Representatives from 1963 through 1971, when he became Secretary of the Interior in the administration of Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Gerald R. Ford and Secretary of Commerce under Ford, before heading Ford's re-election campaign in 1976.
US House of Representatives[edit]
After naval service in World War II, Morton defeated incumbent Democrat Emmet O'Neal in 1946 for his native Louisville area, 61,899 votes to 44,599. He served three terms in the House, from January 3, 1947 to January 3, 1953.
Assistant Secretary of State[edit]
After leaving the House, Morton served as Assistant Secretary of State for Congressional Relations[1] in the administration of Dwight D. Eisenhower, garnering support for Eisenhower's foreign policy.
US Senate[edit]
In 1956, Morton, by a very narrow margin, defeated incumbent Democratic United States Senator Earle C.

Morton was re-elected to a second term in the Senate in 1962, defeating the Democratic lieutenant governor and former mayor of Louisville, Wilson W. Wyatt.

Early life[edit]
Morton was born in Louisville, Kentucky, to David Morton and his wife, Mary Ballard, descended from pioneer settlers of the area. He had a brother, Rogers Clark Ballard Morton, who also became a politician (as discussed below), and a sister, Jane, who survived him. He attended local public schools then the Woodberry Forest School before he entered Yale University. He received a B.A. there in 1929.
Morton then worked in the family business, Ballard & Ballard Flour Milling, becoming its chairman of the board before the company was sold to the Pillsbury Company.
A lifelong Episcopalian, he married Belle Clay Lyons and was survived by their two sons, Clay Lyons Morton and Thruston Ballard Morton Jr, and five grandchildren.
His brother, Rogers Clark Ballard Morton, represented Maryland in the US House of Representatives from 1963 through 1971, when he became Secretary of the Interior in the administration of Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Gerald R. Ford and Secretary of Commerce under Ford, before heading Ford's re-election campaign in 1976.
US House of Representatives[edit]
After naval service in World War II, Morton defeated incumbent Democrat Emmet O'Neal in 1946 for his native Louisville area, 61,899 votes to 44,599. He served three terms in the House, from January 3, 1947 to January 3, 1953.
Assistant Secretary of State[edit]
After leaving the House, Morton served as Assistant Secretary of State for Congressional Relations[1] in the administration of Dwight D. Eisenhower, garnering support for Eisenhower's foreign policy.
US Senate[edit]
In 1956, Morton, by a very narrow margin, defeated incumbent Democratic United States Senator Earle C. Clements, a former Kentucky governor and minority leader in the Senate, by 506,903 votes to 499,922. Morton was re-elected to a second term in the Senate in 1962, defeating the Democratic lieutenant governor and former mayor of Louisville, Wilson W. Wyatt.
Morton served from January 3, 1957 until his resignation, on December 16, 1968. He vacated the seat a few weeks early to allow his successor, Marlow Cook, a fellow Republican with similar views, to gain an edge in seniority.
In the Senate, Morton was considered a moderate and voted, along with his Republican colleague John Sherman Cooper and most other Republicans, for the Civil Rights Act of 1964. A compromise that Morton proposed to guarantee jury trials in all criminal contempt cases except for voting rights proved, with the assistance of Senators Everett Dirksen and Bourke Hickenlooper, crucial in passing that Civil Rights Act.[2]
Morton was the chairman of the Republican National Committee from 1959 to 1961 and chaired the Republican National Convention of 1964.
When Morton resigned, he surprised many, who considered him at the peak of his political power. However, he opposed the Vietnam War despite being criticized by Representative William Cowger. Also, he was both depressed by the urban violence after the deaths of Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy and disappointed in his party's failure to address the broader social issues. He also ultimately counseled Lyndon Johnson to decline to seek re-election, and he supported the unsuccessful presidential candidacy of Nelson Rockefeller.
Morton is interviewed in the 1968 documentary film In the Year of the Pig, and another interview is available through the Lyndon Baines Johnson Presidential Library.[3]
Final years, death and legacy[edit]
After his retirement from the Senate, Morton served as vice chairman of Liberty National Bank in Louisville, president of the American Horse Council, and chairman of the board of Churchill Downs, and he served as one of the directors of the University of Louisville, Pillsbury Company, Pittston Company, Louisville Board of Trade, Texas Gas Company, R.J. Reynolds Company, and the Ohio Valley Assembly.
Morton died after many years of declining health. His brother Rogers Morton had died three years previously, and his wife, Belle, survived him by more than a decade.[4] His papers are held by Louisville's Filson Historical Society, which his grandfather had revitalized.[5] The Kentucky Digital Library has a collection of his speeches.[6]

Early life[edit]
Morton was born in Louisville, Kentucky, to David Morton and his wife, Mary Ballard, descended from pioneer settlers of the area. He had a brother, Rogers Clark Ballard Morton, who also became a politician (as discussed below), and a sister, Jane, who survived him. He attended local public schools then the Woodberry Forest School before he entered Yale University. He received a B.A. there in 1929.
Morton then worked in the family business, Ballard & Ballard Flour Milling, becoming its chairman of the board before the company was sold to the Pillsbury Company.
A lifelong Episcopalian, he married Belle Clay Lyons and was survived by their two sons, Clay Lyons Morton and Thruston Ballard Morton Jr, and five grandchildren.
His brother, Rogers Clark Ballard Morton, represented Maryland in the US House of Representatives from 1963 through 1971, when he became Secretary of the Interior in the administration of Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Gerald R. Ford and Secretary of Commerce under Ford, before heading Ford's re-election campaign in 1976.
US House of Representatives[edit]
After naval service in World War II, Morton defeated incumbent Democrat Emmet O'Neal in 1946 for his native Louisville area, 61,899 votes to 44,599. He served three terms in the House, from January 3, 1947 to January 3, 1953.
Assistant Secretary of State[edit]
After leaving the House, Morton served as Assistant Secretary of State for Congressional Relations[1] in the administration of Dwight D. Eisenhower, garnering support for Eisenhower's foreign policy.
US Senate[edit]
In 1956, Morton, by a very narrow margin, defeated incumbent Democratic United States Senator Earle C.

In the Senate, Morton was considered a moderate and voted, along with his Republican colleague John Sherman Cooper and most other Republicans, for the Civil Rights Act of 1964. A compromise that Morton proposed to guarantee jury trials in all criminal contempt cases except for voting rights proved, with the assistance of Senators Everett Dirksen and Bourke Hickenlooper, crucial in passing that Civil Rights Act.[2]
Morton was the chairman of the Republican National Committee from 1959 to 1961 and chaired the Republican National Convention of 1964.
When Morton resigned, he surprised many, who considered him at the peak of his political power. However, he opposed the Vietnam War despite being criticized by Representative William Cowger. Also, he was both depressed by the urban violence after the deaths of Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy and disappointed in his party's failure to address the broader social issues. He also ultimately counseled Lyndon Johnson to decline to seek re-election, and he supported the unsuccessful presidential candidacy of Nelson Rockefeller.
Morton is interviewed in the 1968 documentary film In the Year of the Pig, and another interview is available through the Lyndon Baines Johnson Presidential Library.[3]
Final years, death and legacy[edit]
After his retirement from the Senate, Morton served as vice chairman of Liberty National Bank in Louisville, president of the American Horse Council, and chairman of the board of Churchill Downs, and he served as one of the directors of the University of Louisville, Pillsbury Company, Pittston Company, Louisville Board of Trade, Texas Gas Company, R.J. Reynolds Company, and the Ohio Valley Assembly.
Morton died after many years of declining health. His brother Rogers Morton had died three years previously, and his wife, Belle, survived him by more than a decade.[4] His papers are held by Louisville's Filson Historical Society, which his grandfather had revitalized.[5] The Kentucky Digital Library has a collection of his speeches.[6]

Early life[edit]
Morton was born in Louisville, Kentucky, to David Morton and his wife, Mary Ballard, descended from pioneer settlers of the area. He had a brother, Rogers Clark Ballard Morton, who also became a politician (as discussed below), and a sister, Jane, who survived him. He attended local public schools then the Woodberry Forest School before he entered Yale University. He received a B.A. there in 1929.
Morton then worked in the family business, Ballard & Ballard Flour Milling, becoming its chairman of the board before the company was sold to the Pillsbury Company.
A lifelong Episcopalian, he married Belle Clay Lyons and was survived by their two sons, Clay Lyons Morton and Thruston Ballard Morton Jr, and five grandchildren.
His brother, Rogers Clark Ballard Morton, represented Maryland in the US House of Representatives from 1963 through 1971, when he became Secretary of the Interior in the administration of Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Gerald R. Ford and Secretary of Commerce under Ford, before heading Ford's re-election campaign in 1976.
US House of Representatives[edit]
After naval service in World War II, Morton defeated incumbent Democrat Emmet O'Neal in 1946 for his native Louisville area, 61,899 votes to 44,599. He served three terms in the House, from January 3, 1947 to January 3, 1953.
Assistant Secretary of State[edit]
After leaving the House, Morton served as Assistant Secretary of State for Congressional Relations[1] in the administration of Dwight D. Eisenhower, garnering support for Eisenhower's foreign policy.
US Senate[edit]
In 1956, Morton, by a very narrow margin, defeated incumbent Democratic United States Senator Earle C. Clements, a former Kentucky governor and minority leader in the Senate, by 506,903 votes to 499,922. Morton was re-elected to a second term in the Senate in 1962, defeating the Democratic lieutenant governor and former mayor of Louisville, Wilson W. Wyatt.
Morton served from January 3, 1957 until his resignation, on December 16, 1968. He vacated the seat a few weeks early to allow his successor, Marlow Cook, a fellow Republican with similar views, to gain an edge in seniority.
In the Senate, Morton was considered a moderate and voted, along with his Republican colleague John Sherman Cooper and most other Republicans, for the Civil Rights Act of 1964. A compromise that Morton proposed to guarantee jury trials in all criminal contempt cases except for voting rights proved, with the assistance of Senators Everett Dirksen and Bourke Hickenlooper, crucial in passing that Civil Rights Act.[2]
Morton was the chairman of the Republican National Committee from 1959 to 1961 and chaired the Republican National Convention of 1964.
When Morton resigned, he surprised many, who considered him at the peak of his political power. However, he opposed the Vietnam War despite being criticized by Representative William Cowger. Also, he was both depressed by the urban violence after the deaths of Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy and disappointed in his party's failure to address the broader social issues. He also ultimately counseled Lyndon Johnson to decline to seek re-election, and he supported the unsuccessful presidential candidacy of Nelson Rockefeller.
Morton is interviewed in the 1968 documentary film In the Year of the Pig, and another interview is available through the Lyndon Baines Johnson Presidential Library.[3]
Final years, death and legacy[edit]
After his retirement from the Senate, Morton served as vice chairman of Liberty National Bank in Louisville, president of the American Horse Council, and chairman of the board of Churchill Downs, and he served as one of the directors of the University of Louisville, Pillsbury Company, Pittston Company, Louisville Board of Trade, Texas Gas Company, R.J. Reynolds Company, and the Ohio Valley Assembly.
Morton died after many years of declining health. His brother Rogers Morton had died three years previously, and his wife, Belle, survived him by more than a decade.[4] His papers are held by Louisville's Filson Historical Society, which his grandfather had revitalized.[5] The Kentucky Digital Library has a collection of his speeches.[6]

Early life[edit]
Morton was born in Louisville, Kentucky, to David Morton and his wife, Mary Ballard, descended from pioneer settlers of the area. He had a brother, Rogers Clark Ballard Morton, who also became a politician (as discussed below), and a sister, Jane, who survived him. He attended local public schools then the Woodberry Forest School before he entered Yale University. He received a B.A. there in 1929.
Morton then worked in the family business, Ballard & Ballard Flour Milling, becoming its chairman of the board before the company was sold to the Pillsbury Company.
A lifelong Episcopalian, he married Belle Clay Lyons and was survived by their two sons, Clay Lyons Morton and Thruston Ballard Morton Jr, and five grandchildren.
His brother, Rogers Clark Ballard Morton, represented Maryland in the US House of Representatives from 1963 through 1971, when he became Secretary of the Interior in the administration of Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Gerald R. Ford and Secretary of Commerce under Ford, before heading Ford's re-election campaign in 1976.
US House of Representatives[edit]
After naval service in World War II, Morton defeated incumbent Democrat Emmet O'Neal in 1946 for his native Louisville area, 61,899 votes to 44,599. He served three terms in the House, from January 3, 1947 to January 3, 1953.
Assistant Secretary of State[edit]
After leaving the House, Morton served as Assistant Secretary of State for Congressional Relations[1] in the administration of Dwight D. Eisenhower, garnering support for Eisenhower's foreign policy.
US Senate[edit]
In 1956, Morton, by a very narrow margin, defeated incumbent Democratic United States Senator Earle C. Clements, a former Kentucky governor and minority leader in the Senate, by 506,903 votes to 499,922. Morton was re-elected to a second term in the Senate in 1962, defeating the Democratic lieutenant governor and former mayor of Louisville, Wilson W. Wyatt.
Morton served from January 3, 1957 until his resignation, on December 16, 1968. He vacated the seat a few weeks early to allow his successor, Marlow Cook, a fellow Republican with similar views, to gain an edge in seniority.
In the Senate, Morton was considered a moderate and voted, along with his Republican colleague John Sherman Cooper and most other Republicans, for the Civil Rights Act of 1964. A compromise that Morton proposed to guarantee jury trials in all criminal contempt cases except for voting rights proved, with the assistance of Senators Everett Dirksen and Bourke Hickenlooper, crucial in passing that Civil Rights Act.[2]
Morton was the chairman of the Republican National Committee from 1959 to 1961 and chaired the Republican National Convention of 1964.
When Morton resigned, he surprised many, who considered him at the peak of his political power. However, he opposed the Vietnam War despite being criticized by Representative William Cowger. Also, he was both depressed by the urban violence after the deaths of Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy and disappointed in his party's failure to address the broader social issues. He also ultimately counseled Lyndon Johnson to decline to seek re-election, and he supported the unsuccessful presidential candidacy of Nelson Rockefeller.
Morton is interviewed in the 1968 documentary film In the Year of the Pig, and another interview is available through the Lyndon Baines Johnson Presidential Library.[3]
Final years, death and legacy[edit]
After his retirement from the Senate, Morton served as vice chairman of Liberty National Bank in Louisville, president of the American Horse Council, and chairman of the board of Churchill Downs, and he served as one of the directors of the University of Louisville, Pillsbury Company, Pittston Company, Louisville Board of Trade, Texas Gas Company, R.J. Reynolds Company, and the Ohio Valley Assembly.
Morton died after many years of declining health. His brother Rogers Morton had died three years previously, and his wife, Belle, survived him by more than a decade.[4] His papers are held by Louisville's Filson Historical Society, which his grandfather had revitalized.[5] The Kentucky Digital Library has a collection of his speeches.[6]

THRUSTON B. MORTON IS DEAD AT 74
THRUSTON B. MORTON IS DEAD AT 74; SERVED AS SENATOR FROM KENTUCKY


By DOROTHY J. GAITER


Published: August 15, 1982









                    Thruston B. Morton, a former United States Senator, member of the House of Representatives from Kentucky and national chairman of the Republican Party, died yesterday at his home in Louisville after a long illness. He was 74 years old.        

                    Mr. Morton, a descendant of Kentucky pioneers, represented the Louisville area in the House from 1947 to 1953, when he declined to seek a fourth term and became an Assistant Secretary of State, a post he held three years. His job was to win support for the Eisenhower Administration's foreign policy.        

                    In 1956 he was elected to the Senate, defeating Earle C. Clements, the Democratic former Kentucky Governor who was then acting Senate majority leader.        

                    Mr. Morton's brother, Rogers C.B. Morton, was a Congressman from Maryland, Secretary of the Interior in the Nixon Administration and Republican national chairman. He died in 1979. Declined to Run in 1968        

                    Thruston Morton, a Congressman of considerable prestige and fortitude, was at the peak of his influence after more than a quarter of a century of public service, when, in 1968, he abruptly decided not to seek re-election.        

                    ''To use an old Kentucky expression, I suppose I am just plain track sore,'' he said. It was later learned that he was in ill health. A close associate described him as profoundly depressed by the combination of the Vietnam War, urban violence and what he regarded as insufficient national leadership and the failure of the Republican Party to rise to the occasion.        

                    Although Mr. Morton could be ferociously partisan, he lined up at times with liberal Democrats on Vietnam and the civil rights movement.        

                    At first he had embraced the Johnson Administration's Vietnam policy, but his views moderated as the war eroded the national pride and prestige.        

                    In 1968, when such critics of the war as Senators Robert F.  Kennedy, Democrat of New York, and Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, suggested in speeches that corruption and lack of dedication in South Vietnam were reaching the point at which the South Vietnamese Government no longer warranted the support of the United States, it was Senator Morton who introduced the speeches into the Congressional Record. Cautioned Johnson on Running        

                    He also suggested that President Johnson decline to seek reelection. ''But,'' he said, ''I do not expect a man so mesmerized by power to relinguish it voluntarily.''        

                    When Senator Eugene J. McCarthy of Minnesota campaigned for the Democratic nomination for the Presidency that year, he included Mr.  Morton among people he would consider naming as Secretary of State because of the similarity of their outlook.        

                    For his part, Mr. Morton helped the reluctant campaign of Gov.  Nelson A. Rockefeller of New York for the Republican nomination. He toured the country, trying to generate enough popular interest to lead Mr. Rockefeller to declare. He felt that the Republican Party was risking extinction unless it turned to imaginative leadership.        

                    He later became a co-chairman of Mr. Rockefeller's campaign. After his candidate's loss to Richard M. Nixon at the national convention in Miami Beach, he joined the Nixon campaign. His brother, Rogers Morton, had been Mr. Nixon's convention floor manager.        

                    In February 1968, the month he announced his retirement, he joined the bipartisan coalition of Senate liberals that won a first round in the difficult Senate debate on legislation to provide Federal protection to people seeking to exercise their civil rights.        

                    He was understood to have argued that in an election year, Republicans should not seem to align themselves with Southern conservatives by voting for a Southern substitute bill that would have limited Federal protection.        

                    Thruston Ballard Morton was born in Louisville and was graduated from Yale University in 1909. He joined the family business, Ballard & Ballard Flour Milling, and worked his way up to become chairman of the board. The company was later sold to Pillsbury.        

                    Mr. Morton served in the Navy from 1940 to 1945 in the Pacific.  After his retirement from active politics, he became a vice chairman of Liberty National Bank in Louisville, president of the American Horse Council and chairman of the board of Churchill Downs.  He also served on the boards of directors of Pillsbury, the Pittston Company, a coal mining corporation, and Texas Gas.        

                    He is survived by his wife, the former Belle Clay Lyons, two sons, Clay Lyons Morton and T. Ballard Morton Jr.; a sister, Jane Morton Norton, and five grandchildren, all of Louisville.        

                    Services have been scheduled for 11:30 A.M. tomorrow at Christ Church Cathedral in Louisville.

Show moreFood You want to feed your family healthy food, but making the best choices can be difficult, especially if you're on a budget or short on time   or if you or any members of your family have special dietary needs. Fortunately, Walmart makes it easy to plan meals and stock up on delicious and nutritious food that is also affordable. Barbecue essentials Anytime is a great time to fire up the barbecue. Grab some hot dogs, hamburgers, steaks, chops, corn on the cob and whatever else you like to grill and get ready for a fun food fest. Of course, barbecue essentials don't necessarily need to be cooked on a grill. Don't forget the: Chips and snacks, like pistachios and mixed nuts, almonds and snack crackers Dips and spreads, including salsa, guacamole and black bean dip Side dishes of rice, mac and cheese and pasta salad beans and chili Condiments, like ketchup, mustard, mayo and more You'll also find Walmart's lowest prices on picnic items like paper plates, napkins, plastic cups, plasticware and more, should you want to take your meal to the great outdoors. Beverages From water and juice to coffee, beer and wine, you'll find a wide variety of delicious and refreshing beverages at Walmart, all at Every Day Low Prices. Explore the varied selection of juices, where you'll find common favorites like apple, orange and cranberry juice as well as mixed fruit and vegetable juices and much more. Browse the soft drinks: colas, root beer, cream soda, fruit sodas and more in both standard and sugar-free varieties, including options from popular brands such as Coca Cola, Pepsi and A&W. If you've been exercising, try sports drinks, like Gatorade, to keep yourself hydrated and maybe a caffeinated energy drink to keep yourself going throughout the day. There is also a large selection of hot beverages, including coffee, tea and hot cocoa, plus adult beverages, including beer, wine and spirits. To turn an ordinary glass of water into a more appealing beverage, consider powdered drink mixes and drink enhancers, which come in a wide range of flavors and include diet and fortified options featuring vitamins and electrolytes. Healthy options Are you confused by all the nutritional information that's available? Walmart's Great For You products feature a simple icon that lets you know you're choosing a healthy item. That includes lots of the foods nutritionists say people should get more of, including fruits and vegetables, nuts and seeds and lean meats. It's also easy to find foods that meet special requirements. Simply filter your grocery searches by dietary need and you'll find products that are: Gluten free Sugar free Sodium free Fat free Nut free Dairy free There are also natural, organic, vegetarian, kosher and halal options. Walmart makes it easier to find the foods you want while simultaneously meeting your dietary requirements. No matter what type of special diet you are looking for, there are options that will help you make the right food choices day in and day out. Organic foods If you prefer to feed your family with natural or organic foods, enjoy Walmart's inventory of organic delights, which are made without artificial ingredients; they're grown without synthetic pesticides or chemical fertilizers. A food is labeled as organic by the way farmers grow and process their agricultural products, like different meats, fruits, vegetables, grains and dairy products. Organic farming practices are created to promote soil and water conservation and also to reduce pollution. The farmers who grow organic produce don't use what would be considered conventional methods to fertilize and control weeds. For example, organic farming practices would include the use of natural fertilizers to feed the soil and plants, while using crop rotation or mulch to manage the weeds. So what makes a product organic for certain? The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) established a certification program that requires all organic-labeled foods to meet strict government standards first. These standards regulate how such foods are grown, handled and processed. Thus, any product labeled as organic must be USDA certified. You could look through a variety of foods and check for the organic label on each one, but it s a much easier shopping process when everything can be found together, in one convenient location. Whatever your dietary goals or requirements are, you can easily find foods that meet your needs at Walmart. Just filter your search by dietary need and you'll find a large selection of delicious foods. Save Money.
