Title: Board Member
               Company: First Western Trust Bank
Job Details
               Scott Wylie, an entrepreneur and banker, founded First Western in 2002 with the vision to create an organization that wouldn't force individuals to choose between high levels of sophistication or personalized boutique service. Then, he built it. By combining Scott's depth of knowledge in relationship banking with an expertise in sophisticated investment management, First Western provides our clients with integrated wealth management solutions on a private banking platform. This vision has led to the ConnectView® approach. It allows our associates to see how every financial decision impacts our clients' lives, and then allows us to create plans that will most effectively meet their objectives. Throughout our company's history, we have embodied the entrepreneurial spirit that started with our founder, Scott. After all, this is what enables such a strong understanding of our clients. Our focus on risk management and our commitment to our clients and communities we serve have helped us succeed as an organization, and, most importantly, as trusted advisors.
