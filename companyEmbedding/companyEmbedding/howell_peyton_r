AmerisourceBergen Names Peyton R. Howell as Senior Vice President, 
      AmerisourceBergen Corporation and President, Global Sourcing and 
      Manufacturer Relationships






December 05, 2012 07:00 AM Eastern Standard Time



VALLEY FORGE, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--AmerisourceBergen Corporation (NYSE: ABC) today announced that Peyton R. 
      Howell has been named Senior Vice President, AmerisourceBergen 
      Corporation and President, Global Sourcing and Manufacturer Relations, 
      effective immediately. Howell was most recently Senior Vice President, 
      Business Development, AmerisourceBergen Corporation and President of 
      AmerisourceBergen Consulting Services, a business unit of the Company. 
      She was also a founder and President of Lash Group, which became part of 
      AmerisourceBergen in 1998.
    

      Howell will be responsible for directing the relationships with the 
      portfolio teams from pharmaceutical manufacturers. One of Howell’s 
      initial objectives will be to work collaboratively to match 
      AmerisourceBergen’s nearly $80 billion in annual pharmaceutical sales 
      with the needs of manufacturers, including specialty, brand, generic and 
      over-the-counter products. Howell’s health care policy background will 
      also help to ensure that AmerisourceBergen is positioned to support the 
      future needs of manufacturers and health care providers.
    

      Steve H. Collis, President and Chief Executive Officer of 
      AmerisourceBergen said, “Peyton’s appointment clearly demonstrates our 
      commitment to providing value to our manufacturer partners. By creating 
      and placing this position at the enterprise level and putting someone 
      with Peyton’s expertise in this role, we are poised to be the preferred 
      partner to manufacturers by providing best-in-class services from the 
      entire AmerisourceBergen portfolio.”
    

      Howell holds a master's degree in Health Administration from The Ohio 
      State University and a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Illinois. 
      In addition to serving various leadership roles in the Healthcare 
      Distribution and Management Association (HDMA), she is also a member of 
      the Healthcare Financial Management Association (HFMA), American College 
      of Healthcare Executives (ACHE) and the Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy 
      (AMCP).

Forward-Looking Statements


      Certain of the statements contained in this press release are 
      "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the 
      Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 
      1934. These statements are based on management's current expectations 
      and are subject to uncertainty and change in circumstances. Among the 
      factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those 
      projected, anticipated or implied are the following: changes in 
      pharmaceutical market growth rates; the loss of one or more key customer 
      or supplier relationships; changes in customer mix; customer 
      delinquencies, defaults or insolvencies; supplier defaults or 
      insolvencies; changes in pharmaceutical manufacturers' pricing and 
      distribution policies or practices; adverse resolution of any contract 
      or other dispute with customers or suppliers; federal and state 
      government enforcement initiatives to detect and prevent suspicious 
      orders of controlled substances and the diversion of controlled 
      substances; qui tam litigation for alleged violations of fraud 
      and abuse laws and regulations and/or any other laws and regulations 
      governing the marketing, sale, purchase, and/or dispensing of 
      pharmaceutical products or services and any related litigation, 
      including shareholder derivative lawsuits; changes in federal and state 
      legislation or regulatory action affecting pharmaceutical product 
      pricing or reimbursement policies, including under Medicaid and 
      Medicare; changes in regulatory or clinical medical guidelines and/or 
      labeling for the pharmaceutical products we distribute, including 
      certain anemia products; price inflation in branded pharmaceuticals and 
      price deflation in generics; greater or less than anticipated benefit 
      from launches of the generic versions of previously patented 
      pharmaceutical products; significant breakdown or interruption of our 
      information technology systems; our inability to realize the anticipated 
      benefits of the implementation of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) 
      system; success of integration, restructuring or systems initiatives; 
      interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; risks 
      associated with international business operations, including 
      non-compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, anti-bribery 
      laws and economic sanctions and import laws and regulations; economic, 
      business, competitive and/or regulatory developments outside of the 
      United States; changes and/or potential changes in Canadian provincial 
      legislation affecting pharmaceutical product pricing or service fees or 
      regulatory action by provincial authorities in Canada to lower 
      pharmaceutical product pricing and service fees; the impact of 
      divestitures or the acquisition of businesses that do not perform as we 
      expect or that are difficult for us to integrate or control; our 
      inability to successfully complete any other transaction that we may 
      wish to pursue from time to time; changes in tax laws or legislative 
      initiatives that could adversely affect our tax positions and/or our tax 
      liabilities or adverse resolution of challenges to our tax positions; 
      increased costs of maintaining, or reductions in our ability to 
      maintain, adequate liquidity and financing sources; volatility and 
      deterioration of the capital and credit markets; and other economic, 
      business, competitive, legal, tax, regulatory and/or operational factors 
      affecting our business generally. Certain additional factors that 
      management believes could cause actual outcomes and results to differ 
      materially from those described in forward-looking statements are set 
      forth (i) in Item 1A (Risk Factors) in the Company's Annual Report on 
      Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012 and elsewhere in 
      that report and (ii) in other reports filed by the Company pursuant to
