 Plantation Family Law Blog

   Be careful what you post on Facebook as a parent      On behalf of  Kelley Joseph  of  Law Office of Kelley A. Joseph, P.A.  posted in Child Custody on Friday, July 21, 2017.     Many Florida parents enjoy posting pictures of their children on Facebook so family members and friends can stay up-to-date on the latest news of their children. However, when we post things on social media, they could end up being seen by more than just family and friends -- they could go viral.Recently, a Sebring mother found out that a video going viral isn't always the best news in the world. The Florida mom posted a video on Facebook last month that showed her baby getting attacked by a snake. The problem is, it's clear that the mother purposefully put the attacking snake in front of her baby.    
   Supervised visitation: Helping kids safely see their parents      On behalf of  Kelley Joseph  of  Law Office of Kelley A. Joseph, P.A.  posted in Visitation on Friday, July 14, 2017.     Psychologists and Florida courts agree: The more time children spend with both parents, the better off they are psychologically and emotionally and they grow and mature. However, what happens if one of the parents is a violent criminal, a registered sex offender or has committed domestic violence against his or her family on multiple occasions?Even in cases of a potentially dangerous parent, courts recognize that it's important for children to have time with the parent. However, the court will want these visits to be supervised in a safe environment to protect the children from harm. This is where the practice of supervised visitation comes into play.    
   Does your family need a child custody modification?      On behalf of  Kelley Joseph  of  Law Office of Kelley A. Joseph, P.A.  posted in Child Custody on Friday, July 7, 2017.     Single parents have a lot to juggle, even when everything is going according to plan. It's not the same when you shift from having a two-parent household to having a one-parent household. Even though the modern trend is for parents to split caring for their children 50-50, so the children are with each parent on and off for half a week at a time, those days when you're caring for your kids can get hectic.During your divorce process -- whether you reach an out-of-court settlement or rely on the decision of a Florida family court judge to determine your parenting plan -- you will likely develop a parenting plan that honors the best interests of your children, while staying realistic with regard to what's possible for you and your ex's schedules. However, after several years, as your children grow and your and your ex's lives develop, that parenting plan might not always fit the needs of your family.    
   Factors that may influence your visitation schedule      On behalf of  Kelley Joseph  of  Law Office of Kelley A. Joseph, P.A.  posted in Visitation on Friday, June 30, 2017.     Among the different decisions a family law judge makes in child custody cases, determining which arrangement is going to be in the best interest of the child is one of them. In order to render such decisions, judges must weigh how well the child gets along with his or her parents and which one is most apt to equip the child with the necessary skills to be productive later in life.Sometimes, this means that a parent's request for custody may be denied. In situations such as this, it may require you to devise a visitation schedule to see your kid.    
   What do you think of tri-parenting?      On behalf of  Kelley Joseph  of  Law Office of Kelley A. Joseph, P.A.  posted in Child Custody on Friday, June 23, 2017.     A new parenting model is emerging around the nation, and a lot of state family law judges are agreeing with the idea. It's called tri-parenting, and it involves a child having three parents instead of two.On the surface, tri-parenting might not make a lot of sense unless you're considering a polygamous marriage. But if you consider the legalization of gay marriage two years ago, tri-parenting is exactly the model we need -- especially when a same-sex female couple decides to bring a male friend into the equation to have a baby.    
   Odd work schedules and child custody      On behalf of  Kelley Joseph  of  Law Office of Kelley A. Joseph, P.A.  posted in Child Custody on Friday, June 16, 2017.     Everyone has their own way of making money. Some of us have jobs that keep a regular nine-to-five schedule and others of us have anything but a normal schedule. For those who have odd work schedules, it's not a very big issue until we want to spend time with people in the nine-to-five world -- and it can become an even bigger issue if you're a newly single parent.Doctors, nurses, firefighters, police officers and others working unusual hours could face special challenges when trying to negotiate a suitable parenting schedule with their exes. Let's say you're a firefighter and on shift for 24 hours at a time twice a week. Even worse, one of those 24-hour periods overlaps the weekend -- and your ex works a nine-to-five job at an accounting firm. You're going to have a hard time making you and your ex's schedules mesh.    
   The 3 primary components of a child visitation plan in Florida      On behalf of  Kelley Joseph  of  Law Office of Kelley A. Joseph, P.A.  posted in Visitation on Friday, June 9, 2017.     Family law courts in Florida don't use the terms "custody and visitation" to describe child sharing arrangements anymore. They prefer to call it "time-sharing." If you haven't established time-sharing rights regarding your children, and the other parent is unwilling to give them to you voluntarily, you may need to file a child custody case to assert your parental rights in court.When establishing your time-sharing rights, there are three primary components that the court will consider:    
   When grandparents take custody of their grandchildren      On behalf of  Kelley Joseph  of  Law Office of Kelley A. Joseph, P.A.  posted in Child Custody on Friday, June 2, 2017.     If both parents of a child die, a grandparent or another family member might step in as the new legal guardian of the child. However, aside from death, there are other scenarios under which a Florida grandparent might feel it's important to assume the role of parent for his or her grandchildren.Here some of the most common reasons why grandparents become parents again:    
   Protect your children from the divorce blues      On behalf of  Kelley Joseph  of  Law Office of Kelley A. Joseph, P.A.  posted in Child Custody on Friday, May 26, 2017.     If you're in the throes of a child custody dispute, remember: Even though the process is stressful and scary for you, it could be even more frightening for your children. It's important for Florida parents to try and shield their children from the most psychologically tumultuous effects of their child custody proceedings.Here are a few things to keep in mind in order to protect your children's feelings of security during your divorce process:    
   How do Floridians organize their child visitation schedules?      On behalf of  Kelley Joseph  of  Law Office of Kelley A. Joseph, P.A.  posted in Visitation on Wednesday, May 17, 2017.     When you're trying to negotiate a child visitation schedule with your soon-to-be ex-spouse, it can be a difficult and emotional process. More than that, though, spouses often feel lost as to what visitation schedule is the most appropriate. Fortunately, Florida parents don't have to reinvent the wheel when it comes to visitation schedules.Usually, the non-custodial parent will be in charge of about 20 percent of parenting time. This doesn't account for daycare time or school time. Here are some of the most common child custody arrangements that parents select:

When The Divorce Process Impacts Your Children


When a divorce involves children, simple disputes can quickly become emotionally charged. Unfortunately, many parents lose sight of 
					what the children might be thinking or worrying about. With more than 20 years of family law experience, our attorneys are well-equipped to answer questions and provide valuable insight regarding the divorce process.
				
At the Law Offices of Kelley A. Joseph, P.A., we have extensive experience guiding Fort Lauderdale clients through divorce involving children. We understand the challenges that parents face while going through a divorce.
With all of the emotionally charged disputes and financially turbulent negotiations, it is easy for parents to lose sight of children through the divorce process. We focus exclusively on guiding Florida clients through divorce, paying special attention to the needs of children. Even though the court has adopted the standard of "best interests of the children," it does little to address the emotional impact of a divorce and the issues that a child might face when the divorce is finalized. At the Law Offices of Kelley A. Joseph, P.A., we stand ready to help our clients understand how the proceeding might be viewed from a child's perspective.
Past elements of the negotiation such as 
					custody or 
					support, it is our goal to answer your questions and provide guidance every step of the way.
				
Attorney Kelley A. Joseph intimately understands 
					divorce with special needs children. After raising an autistic child herself, she understands the adjustments that need to be made and the legal challenges that await parents of special needs children through the divorce process.

Plantation Paternity Lawyer


The Importance of Establishing PaternityPaternity is a common problem in many child-related family law matters. A father cannot assert his right to parenting time or custodial authority until it is established as a legal matter that he is indeed the father of the child. On the other hand, a mother cannot obtain court-ordered child support until the father is identified. Paternity is a critical matter in many divorce and family law proceedings.Plantation attorney Kelley A. Joseph has a wealth of experience helping Florida clients with the process of establishing paternity. Like any other family law proceeding, the matter can be handled amicably or contentiously. At the Law Offices of Kelley A. Joseph, the goal is to work through matters as efficiently and amicably as possible. When matters become contentious, attorney Kelley A. Joseph will use her many years of litigation experience to fight aggressively for her clients in court, but she does everything possible to save her clients the cost and added stress of protracted litigation.How to Establish Paternity | Chapter 742Chapter 742 is Florida's paternity statute. Attorney Kelley A. Joseph has experience working with this statute to establish paternity. There are a few essential ways to establish paternity, including:Marriage: Since paternity is generally assumed in the context of marriage, the issue of paternity comes up most frequently in the context of children outside of the context of marriage. There are occasions, however, in which paternity becomes an issue in traditional divorces, as well.Signed admission from the father: When a mother is seeking child support, the father simply signing an admission is the simplest way to establish paternity.DNA testing: If a father is seeking to establish his parental rights, or a mother is trying to seek financial support, the court can order DNA testing to establish whether the man in question really is the father."Paternity issues are difficult enough for people without the attorney adding to the stress. I do everything I can to handle paternity issues for my clients as amicably as possible. I will fight it out in court when needed, and I have a great deal of litigation experience, but my focus is on settling matters more amicably when I can. This is just one more way I serve my clients." ∙ Plantation Paternity Attorney Kelley A. JosephThe Law Offices of Kelley A. Joseph represents both men and women who wish to legally determine the paternity of a child.Contact South Florida Paternity Lawyer | Kelley A.

              (Editor's note: This story has been changed from the print edition to reflect a pending job change by Mr. Kelley.)A cowboy accountant?      Yessirree, but not the kind who's wild and loose with numbers — one who keeps figures and cattle perfectly under control with equal skill, that would be Joe Kelley. Though he's penned up much of the time these days, Mr. Kelley used to interrupt his work after tax season every year, telling his bosses at the former tax accounting firm Coopers and Lybrand in Cleveland he was bound for Wyoming or Idaho. “When the weather turned nice I said, "You guys are crazy for working inside. The real life is a cowboy,'” Mr. Kelley, 39, would tell his bosses every year. Then, when the snows hit the range, Mr. Kelley would come back to Coopers and Lybrand, work through winter and spring, and leave again. After about five years of that cycle, Mr. Kelley finally gave in to the firm's pleas that he begin working as a CPA year round, and since then his financial career has taken off like a good quarter horse.  He went to Chicago, worked  with a startup and shepherded it through an initial public offering, got married and eventually went to work for Lincoln Electric Co. in 2003 as director of accounting,  before becoming CFO of that  company's European operations.  He joined PolyOne in 2009 after he was recruited by CFO Bob  Patterson there — a move Mr.  Patterson said he still counts as one of his better ones. "From an investor relations perspective, he's been instrumental in telling our transformation story and building credibility on Wall Street, evidenced by our 160% increase in share price since he joined the company," Mr. Patterson said.But he won't be telling that story much longer, as Mr. Kelley soon will be moving to a new job.Mr. Kelley said he's heading to Materion Corp. in Mayfield Heights, where he will be vice president of finance for the company's Advanced Materials Group. Advanced materials is the main focus of the company, which had revenues of $1.3 billion in 2010.Announcing his departure was awkward and difficult, Mr. Kelley said, but Mr. Patterson said he understands the move and “didn't want to stand in the way of a great guy taking advantage of an outstanding opportunity.”

She knows the judges and the court staff.  She was always a professional - inside and outside of court.  She always returned my calls.  I did a lot of research before hiring her and was impressed with her written client recommendations  on another business networking site, where you have to Include your first and last name.  All her recommendations were flawless and her clients said exactly what I was looking for.  That's the thing I don't like as much here.  Anyone can write anything anonymously.    I believe what I can prove, and she is a high caliber attorney.    I work in import/export and have a lot of assets.   I don't have  kids but had some complex financial issues and retirement assets to divide.  She spent the time needed to explain to me my options, and how assets are not valued the same way. She got me a great forensic accountant.  My only complaint was that she hired a terrible secretary for a few weeks then got rid of her, but that caused some delay.  Once she was gone it was smooth sailing.
Ms. Joseph could've turned my case into a very expensive long term case. Instead she focused on what I wanted -  speedy resolution.  Ms. Joseph guided me through the divorce process and made it painless.  Her assistant Laura helped me do discovery along with the expert.  I would recommend her to anyone looking for a "top notch" attorney in Broward.   She's the best.More Great Family Law Attorney5.0 starsPosted by anonymous November  8, 2016Kelley is a knowledgable and extremely capable attorney who cared about my case.  Kelley truly shined when she neutralized opposing counsel on many occasions, who--to put it nicely--was unnecessarily difficult.  I am very happy with the results of my case: I went from having zero contact with my child to having nearly 50/50 timesharing.     
More This review is from a person who hired this attorney. Hired attorney Kelley saved my daughter5.0 starsPosted by anonymous November 22, 2011I hired Kelly after my original attorney did nothing for a year while my daughter lived with my ex who is an addict.  Kelly filed and got her drug tested and got me sole custody after she found a supervisor for visitation who finally saw the truth and told the judge.  She also found me a sliding scare therapist for my daughter.  Kelly knows all the supervision and drug testing people the court used, I highly recommend Kelly...she knows how to help kids.   I hired her because my friend used her as a guardian ad litem in his case.More See all reviews Attorney endorsements (11)Are you an attorney?
