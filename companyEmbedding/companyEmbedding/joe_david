 Joe & Joe DVD Features

Undeniable charm--Variety""A Delightful Film""--San Francisco ChronicleIn a small village on picturesque Cape Cod, Joe & Joe live uncomplicated lives of mowing lawns, fishing, drinking beer and dreaming of bigger thingslike a new riding mower to replace the two ineffective push mowers they have now. Without modern equipment, the two Joes are worried they'll lose out to the competition and be forced to find ""real jobs"". Then they meet an enchanting young woman who begins telling them tales about their landlord, the reclusive Broadway composer Hubbell Brown and the jewels buried on his estate. She lures Joe & Joe into a hilarious search that reveals a hidden past, a mysterious death and a secret romance.
