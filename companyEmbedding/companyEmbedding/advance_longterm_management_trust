Code of Ethics & Professional Conduct


Ethics Resources


Ethics Complaints









Ethics is about making the best possible decisions concerning people, resources and the environment. Ethical choices diminish risk, advance positive results, increase trust, determine long term success and build reputations. Leadership is absolutely dependent on ethical choices.

PMI members have determined that honesty, responsibility, respect and fairness are the values that drive ethical conduct for the project management profession. PMI’s Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct applies those values to the real-life practice of project management, where the best outcome is the most ethical one.
All PMI members, volunteers, certification holders and certification applicants must comply with the Code.







Valuing Ethics
PMI President & CEO Mark A. Langley talks about valuing ethics.

 Being Ethical is Profitable
Some companies falsely believe that being ethical is an expensive practice that causes an organization to forego profits. In fact, ethics is about following what is right for society, customers and stakeholders while keeping the organization’s long-term vision in mind.

Code of Ethics & Professional Conduct

Ethics Complaints














Why Ethics Matter
Ethical conduct is especially important for project managers. Find out why.



Decisions and Dilemmas
Project management is driven by decisions, often dozens or more per day. Some decisions are small and barely noticed while others are prominent. Some require deep thought because they involve people, resources and the environment. And sometimes these factors are in conflict, creating a dilemma and perhaps significant risks. While project managers normally know what to do, how to do it can become a puzzle — especially when stakeholder interests conflict. Like all leaders, project managers build trust by the way they make decisions. Here again, the “how to do it” can be puzzling yet is instrumentally important. 
Ethics is the discipline of “how to do it best”.  To guide behavior and help with tough decisions, we’ve crafted a Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct and an Ethical Decision-Making Framework. To deepen your knowledge and perspective, we provide numerous articles, papers and webinars . 
When unethical behaviors arise, take action. Use our ethics complaint and review process and see the specialized resources available.


Impact of Ethical Decisions









When practiced to the highest standards, ethics increases the quality and quantity of business. When a long-term client displayed an ethical lapse, I told them it violated my standards and would cause the loss of my support to their business. Instead of firing me, they changed their behavior and increased the scope of work with my consulting company.

Michael O'Brochta, PMI-ACP, PMP 
PMI Ethics Member Advisory Group
Roanoke, Virginia, USA











When faced with ethical dilemmas, making ethical decisions is complex, challenging and difficult. We can only gauge their impact by answering in the positive whether such decisions increase trust and transparency, and ensure positive long term effects with everyone’s interests protected. Good project managers are relentless in their quest to remain ethical.

Alankar Karpe, PMI-ACP, PMP 
PMI Ethics Member Advisory Group
Bangalore, India











Project managers leading business initiatives play a central role in implementing an ethical culture. Because good ethics is good business, we should focus on establishing a culture of ethical awareness and decision making so that ethics permeates the workplace and manifests into actions and results.


Shobhna Raghupathy, MS, PMP
PMI Ethics Review Committee
Atlanta, Georgia, USA

Choosing an Interior Paint Sheen
Sheen refers to paint's shininess. When deciding on paint sheen, consider the condition of the wall and whether the area is high/low traffic. Here's a partial list to get started:

Flat or matte sheen provides great depth of color and is ideal for less-than-perfect surfaces.
Eggshell, pearl and satin sheens are light, easy to clean, work great in high traffic areas, and reveal color with a softly polished glow.
Semi-gloss sheens are particularly durable and are often recommended for moldings and trim.

Choosing an Exterior Paint Sheen
Our super-premium products offer the same durability and washability in all sheens, so the selection of the finish is more of a personal preference. But here are a few things to remember:

Flat is good at hiding surface imperfections and delivers beautiful color.
Satin stays cleaner and stands up to abrasion better than Flat.
Semi-Gloss is more moisture resistant and easier to clean.
High-Gloss allows rich, deep color but magnifies surface imperfections.

Choosing a Stain Finish
Stain opacity levels range from clear to solid, with the amount of pigment in a stain determining its opacity. Translucent, Semi-Transparent, and Semi-Solid Stains are designed to protect without completely obscuring the natural color and texture of wood. As the opacity moves towards solid, less grain shows through the finish. In contrast, solid stains will completely mask the wood grain, while allowing the wood texture to show through, and the greater its protection will be over time.
What is VOC?
VOC means Volatile Organic Compounds. The paint industry is filled with definitions of what "green paint" is. Other manufacturers use tints that add VOCs to their paints, but Benjamin Moore's waterborne tinting technology ensures that our paints retain their low - or zero-VOC properties.
Green Promise®
Benjamin Moore's Green Promise® designation is our assurance that the product is environmentally-friendly and meets - and often exceeds - the strictest industry standards, while also delivering the premium levels of performance you expect from Benjamin Moore.
