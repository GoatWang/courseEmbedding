Hood River Small Cap Growth Fund Performance


There can be no guarantee that any strategy (risk management or otherwise) will be successful. All investing involves risk, including loss of principal. Performance quoted represents past performance for the Fund’s institutional class shares and there is no guarantee of future results. The investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted above. Please call 800-497-2960 to obtain current and the most recent month-end performance data.

Past performance does not guarantee future results.
Hood River Small Cap Growth Fund (Class I) was rated against the following numbers of U.S.-domiciled small growth funds over the following time periods: 599 funds in the last three years, 533 funds in the last five years, 398 funds in the last 10 years. With respect to these Small Growth Funds, Hood River Small Cap Growth Fund received a Morningstar Rating of 5 stars, 5 stars and 4 stars for the three-, five- and 10-year periods, respectively as of June 30, 2017. The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or “star rating,” is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history.  Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes.  It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product’s monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance.  The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.  The Overall Morningstar Rating™ for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics.  The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns.  While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.
