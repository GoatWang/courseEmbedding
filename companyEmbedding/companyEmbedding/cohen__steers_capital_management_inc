* The Class F performance for Cohen & Steers Real Estate Securities Fund and Cohen & Steers Preferred Securities and Income Fund are cumulative since their inception 4/3/17.

1 12-Month Distribution Yield is calculated by adding each fund’s trailing 12-month income distributions, and dividing the sum by the fund’s most recent month ended NAV. Note that the number of income distributions is based on the fund’s distribution payment frequency (i.e., monthly, quarterly or semi-annually) as disclosed in the fund’s prospectus. A fund may pay distributions in excess of its net investment company taxable income and, to the extent this occurs, the distribution yield quoted will include a return of capital. The estimated return of capital for each distribution is  available on this Web site by clicking on the fund’s 12-Month Distribution Yield. However, please note that distributions are subject to recharacterization for tax purposes and the final tax treatment of these distributions will be reported to shareholders after the close of each calendar year on form 1099-DIV. 

2 The SEC yield is calculated by dividing annualized net investment income per share during a 30-day period by the maximum offering price per share as of the close of that period. SEC yield reflects the rate at which the fund is earning income on its current portfolio of securities. Since certain distributions received by the funds from real estate investment trusts (REITs) and master limited partnerships (MLPs) may consist of dividend income, return of capital and capital gains, and the character of these distributions cannot be determined until after the end of the year, the SEC yield has been adjusted for the funds that invest significantly in REITs based on estimates of return of capital and capital gains. The SEC 30-Day Yield is computed under an SEC standardized formula and is based on the maximum offer price per share. Subsidized (Sub.) yields reflect fee waivers in effect. Without such waivers, yields would be reduced. Unsubsidized (Unsub.) yields do not reflect fee waivers in effect. 

3 12-Month Distribution Yield will fluctuate from month to month, and is not equivalent to the subsidized or unsubsidized 30-day SEC yield of the fund. You should consult each fund’s prospectus for additional information about the Fund’s dividends and distributions policy. 

4 12-Month Distribution Yield for the global and international funds may vary significantly year-over-year due to tax adjustments, and are subject to change from the yields quoted.

5 Cohen & Steers Realty Shares and Cohen & Steers Real Estate Securities Fund  do not currently have a fee waiver in effect. 

The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. The investment return and the principal value of an investment will fluctuate, and shares, if redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. Annualized total returns of the open-end funds current to the most recent month-end can be obtained by clicking on the fund name above. 

Please consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of any U.S. Registered open-end fund carefully before investing. A summary prospectus and prospectus containing this and other information may be obtained by calling 1-800-330-7348 or clicking here. Please read the prospectus carefully before investing.
