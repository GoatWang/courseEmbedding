GOLF COURSES



HIT THE LINKS IN PARADISE
                                    The North Shore may be synonymous with some of the world’s most challenging surf, but one cannot overlook the equally spectacular opportunities to tee it up. Two legends of golf – Arnold Palmer and George Fazio – have chosen to leave their indelible mark on the North Shore with two premier courses right here, oceanside at Turtle Bay.

"We finished our 3 island Hawaiian road trip with a three night stay at Turtle Bay, without question our favourite and the one to leave us with some lasting memories. 
The view from our room was just amazing, the sunset is breathtaking, the grounds/hotel are impeccably maintained. From the live music at the pool bar, with awesome service, snacks and cocktails to the surprisingly fun time we had at the karaoke (increasing number of beers may have numbed our ears) we genuinely cannot think of any faults!! 
Every one of the many staff we met were cheerful, full of smiles and helpful, a special thumbs-up and Mahalo to Leilani on the front desk for going above and beyond. 
The absolute icing on the cake was the complimentary courtesy room for us to freshen up on our last day (30 minutes, pre-booking required), its those little touches that just set Turtle Bay apart from the rest."

"My husband and I booked a cottage within this resort and it was worth it. The resort itself was amazing, the staff was very kind and helpful, the food was excellent, and there was a ton of things to keep us occupied. The resort has multiple restaurants, all of which were amazing. The resort has a spa, golf course, pool with hot tubs, and a large stretch of hidden beach. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting the north shore."

"My first trip to the Islands and I couldn't have asked for a nicer place to stay. The location is positively breathtaking. The resort is beautiful, the rooms were spacious and the surrounding beaches pristine. Service was great too....especially Evelyn in housekeeping who made sure we were well taken care of! Looking forward to coming again!"

"Words may not describe the time spent on Oahu at Turtle Bay Resort-"Heaven on earth" is all I can come close to. I can promise you..... from the Valet guys to Ms. Bernadette.... #1 !Concierge..... before, during, and after our visit...... even the groundskeepers, housemaids, everyone was one hundred percent perfection! In our 12 years of travel this is the best trip we've ever had..... and I have to admit, so much of it will be contributed to TBR and it's personnel. We are forever grateful!"










Ceginsberg




 

 
“We ABSOLUTELY LOVE this PLACE! We have never stayed at this resort, and was told there was some major Rennovations done over the years, this Place has the most beautiful surrounding views this island has to offer, on every side of the Resort. Resort Location is also away from the Concrete Jungle, and located on GODS COUNTRY side of the Island where it is always Green! The Resort's Decor and Interior are Top Notch!”

5 THINGS THAT MAKE TURTLE BAY YOUR DREAM DESTINATION



  
 





MORE INCREDIBLE THINGS TO DO IN A DAY. EVERY DAY. 
You’ll never run out of things to do on Oahu. No matter what activities you like to do.
Imagine setting off from our Oahu hotel on horseback pre-breakfast, a surf session after lunch, and a hike at sunset. In addition to our on-site beaches and pools, Turtle Bay Resort offers the kind of endless, unbelievably unique activities that most Hawaii resorts can’t ever claim to offer: surfing, stand-up paddling, kayaking, snorkeling, Segway tours, horseback riding, helicopter adventures, cycling, tennis, and golf.

Blessed with the Best of Land and Sea
Surfing. Snorkeling. Hiking. Horseback Riding. And that’s just the short list.
While the North Shore is a virtual magnet for big surf, those seeking calmer waters can discover protected bays for swimming and snorkeling. On shore, fertile farmlands and lush forest sanctuaries feature amazing biodiversity and unspoiled vistas. We’re grateful for these gifts and are equally committed to protecting them.

AN UNFORGETTABLE GATHERING PLACE
Talk story with the locals. Rub elbows with the famous. Bring everyone together in one magical place. 
Considered the living room of the North Shore, Turtle Bay is a welcoming hub where locals and tourists hang out with visiting pro athletes, celebrities, and artists on a regular basis. Our diverse range of Oahu activities and settings also makes us the ideal resort in Hawaii for bringing together large groups of people to share stories and create lasting memories.

PLENTY OF ROOM TO ROAM
Find a private stretch of sand. Follow an endless trail. Let yourself get lost in the peace and tranquility of it all. 
At Turtle Bay, we take the concept of “getting away from it all” literally. As the most spacious Oahu resort, we offer guests extra room to explore, stretch out and soak up the scenery.  With a little more than 400 individual accommodations, we have approximately 2 acres of green space to every room. With a massive span of 850 acres, all of Waikiki can fit on our Hawaii resort, with room to spare. It simply makes your visit even more relaxing.

TRUE FARM-TO-TABLE
When we say fresh we mean REALLY fresh. 
Farm-to-Table isn’t just clever marketing speak at Turtle Bay. It’s the real deal. Here, fresh means picked just minutes away from your plate. We’re fortunate to have partnerships with many of the local farmers on the North Shore to source our ingredients, some of which are sourced directly from farmlands on our property.
