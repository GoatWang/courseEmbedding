ABOUT US






The Beginning
Republic Act 720 otherwise known as the Rural Bank Act of 1952 was brought about by the need to provide farmers, fisherman and rural folks, who constituted 85% of the population, access to credit. This is to give them opportunity to improve the quality of their lives as they participate in the countryside activities from growth and development. Also, to stimulate private investments in order that this particular sector of our nation may participate in countryside nation building.
Our country then was on its way to full recovery from the destructive effect of the war and was very anxious to attain full progress. This RA 720 became a call for progress. One of the first to answer this call is Mr. Isidro B. Liamzon Sr. of Montalban, Rizal. He established Marikina Valley Rural Bank in 1953, making it the second oldest rural bank in the country.
In Pateros, a group of socially-conscious people led by Anatolio B. Cruz saw the need of putting up a bank to serve the needs of the people including its neighboring towns. Rural Bank of Pateros, Inc. (RBPI) was established and incorporated on August 20, 1960. In the year 1964, Mr. Cruz and his group sold their stockholdings to Mr. Liamzon whose reputation as banker was well respected and recognized in and out of the banking industry. He placed the stocks in the name of his corporation I. B. Liamzon and Sons, Inc. In those days, Mr. Liamzon had already established several rural banks in the province of Rizal.
From then on, RBPI enjoy the trust and confidence of the people. In the same manner that “balut” was closely identified with the town of Pateros, so with RBPI. The people called it their rural bank and indeed it was. For sometime, it had the reputation of the only bank in Pateros and the name carrier of the town. We can rightfully claim that RBPI gave the people of Pateros their first bank exposure.
Sincere to its commitment of providing the countryside with basic banking needs, the bank fulfilled its role of assisting the small and medium enterprises in their initial and additional capital requirements. Going through the loan portfolio of the bank, you will discover its diverse purposes. A proof that the bank is committed to carry it’s’ mission.
With the adoption of a more liberalized banking system by the Central Bank of the Philippines – now Banko Sentral ng Pilipinas, RBPI found itself working side by side with its peers in an atmosphere of healthy competition.
In September 1992, its first branch was established in Angono, Rizal. The following year, another branch was opened in Morong ( April 1993) , also a town of Rizal. The primary reason of RBPI in putting up these two branches was to enhance the bank’s agriculture-related capabilities.
In August 1994, the bank has its third branch opened. This is in Dasmariñas Cavite. Instead of putting it up in the town proper, it was built in the Barrio of Bagumbayan. The purpose is to serve the barrio folks including the students from nearby schools and universities. The commercial developments that took place in Bagumbayan for the last six years were overwhelming. We are proud to say that we are one of the first bank who took the initiative.
Since RBPI is growing, it cannot be helped but changed its business name to a more appropriate one. In 1995, Rural Bank of Pateros, Inc. became….FIRST MACRO BANK. Serious to its role as a partner in countryside development, FMB opened its other branches and Micro Banking Offices (MBO’s) in Alabang (September 1996) , Bicutan (October 1996) , GMA (June 1997), Pasig (December 1997) and Las Piñas (January 1998), MBO’s  Biñan Laguna , Antipolo City, Trece Martires Cavite, Silang Cavite and Imus Cavite  (July 2012). Putting-up these branches and MBO’s  enabled FMB to reach out to a wider customer base.
From a single-storey building when it started, to a 2-storey building six years ago, FMB – Corporate Office now rises to 5-stories. First Macro Bank has grown together with the town. Pateros has increased its standing as a municipality. This could be evidenced by the entry of big fast-food chains such as Jollibee and Mc Donald’s. The building serves as a landmark in Pateros being one of the highest establishments there. It also has a multi-purpose hall to hold different functions.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.

How can we make better investments?




































Investment is an important pillar of the financial system. But how can we assess risk, predict the future, avoid mistakes, and make smarter, more profitable investments? We speak with the economic experts who’ve dedicated themselves to understanding human and market behavior.

















  Can we avoid the next financial crisis? 
 























What can we learn from the financial crisis?



Nobel Laureate Joseph E. Stiglitz doesn’t mince his words. As one of the most well-known economists working today, he carries his signature moral compass everywhere he goes. So it’s no wonder he takes a big interest in the recent financial crisis, where he says more could have been done to avoid the worst. 
















“My theories had explained why it was so important to regulate. And since one of the central problems with the financial market was gathering information, we should not expect the financial sector to work well.” 






So Stiglitz at least partly blames the economists whose theories said there was no need for regulations. And while he says there’s no overnight fix, he thinks it is possible to rewrite the rules.


























    Find out how from Stiglitz
				




















What does the financial sector need to re-establish trust?

















Laureate Robert Merton strongly believes that to leave the financial crisis behind us, trust needs to be re-established between the financial sector and the people it serves. He knows this can be done. And it’s to everyone’s benefit that it is:
"If you can create trust, you can create a huge amount of value." 


























    Discover more with Merton
				




















What will trust look like in the future?



Myron S. Scholes thinks that technology’s going to play a huge part in shaping the future of finance, and of trust. Scholes suggests that blockchain technology will revolutionize the way markets work. Instead of trust being invested solely in banks and other institutions, we’ll all become trusted actors in a financial play. 
















"The trust will come through verification of our transactions, just like when we want to go a restaurant, we can now access the internet to see people’s ratings." 






Technology will also speed-up banking processes, "compressing time", which will make it more difficult for anyone to cheat the system. 


























    Discover more with Scholes
				




















Can you ever eliminate risk?



"Don’t put all your eggs in one basket," the saying goes. The same, it turns out, applies to investing - although it’s a bit more complicated than that. Nobel Laureate Harry M. Markowitz came up with a pioneering new way to look at investment called 'Portfolio Theory'. It says investing can be less risky by choosing investments with different levels of risk - and assessing how they work together as a set. 
















"The notion is that if you diversify enough, risk will go away - that is true of uncorrelated risk. But especially one who has lived through the depression, or the stock market crashes, we also have correlated risk…" 






And that, he says, always carries a danger.


























    Explore the issue with Markowitz
				




















Why is it so hard to beat the stock market?



Nobel Laureate Paul A. Samuelson’s work appears to agree with Markowitz. When starting out in his career he had a clear vision… 
















"My dream is to create an economic model that is humane and warm-hearted, but that doesn’t sacrifice efficiency or progress." 






Ultimately he knew that the best economics couldn’t rely on mathematics alone. So he used a rigorous scientific approach, which took human and political factors into account too. This produced his 'Efficient Markets Hypothesis', which can be neatly summed up to mean 'it’s very hard to beat the stock market'.


























    Find out more from Samuelson
				




















What really influences markets?



Taking Samuelson’s work even further, Nobel Laureate Robert J. Shiller aimed to give “a more truthful account” of how markets work, which ultimately led to his first highly influential paper in 1981. Shiller believes it was wrong to be too rigid when assessing the economy.
















In his research, he argues that instead of mathematics, finance and the global economy are actually driven by people’s behavior and thinking.
"[The market is mostly driven by] non-economic things, people’s fears, prejudices, reactions to news-stories, elections and campaigns." 


























    Find out more from Shiller
				




















What sparks economic growth?



Though stock markets ‘may go up as well as down,' Nobel Laureate, Robert M. Solow explored what makes them move. When looking into why some economies grow faster than others, he originally thought the answer was the accumulation of capital - the slow process of saving, investing and building infrastructure. But it wasn’t the case. 
















"[My model] was capable of including as many economic growth factors as you could think of. I could say, well, some countries have faster population growth than others, some have richer natural resources, some countries save and invest more… To my surprise, it turned out for the US, the accumulation of capital wasn’t the most important factor in the American economy’s growth between 1919 and 1949; it was actually the large amount of technological change." 


























    Explore the issue with Solow
				




















How can we predict the future?



The use of technology can help us predict human and market behavior. In Nobel Laureate Robert F. Engle’s lab, he does just that. They run 60,000 econometric models per day, gathering data from every market in the world. The aim is to examine and prove theories, and explore how volatile markets behave over time.
But there’s a problem with long-term risk. It changes.
That’s why Engle uses stress tests for banks to see how they would perform under particular scenarios, and whether they’d have enough capital. 
















"How much capital would it take to rescue the entire banking system, in the event of another financial crisis?" Engle smiles. "Today, that number is about $3.5 trillion."

Can a society work for  us all?




































As life becomes more and more complex, how can we make sure technology, employment, our pension systems and the environment work for everyone? We asked some of the world’s greatest economic experts to share their opinion with us. 

















  Intro film ‘Will I lose my job to a robot? 
 























Will we still have jobs when robots take over?



For centuries, technology has significantly improved our way of life. So why are we now suspicious of new technology and afraid of what the future holds?
One of the obvious reasons is the fear of mass unemployment. Various studies say that up to 50% of all people might lose their jobs due to technology, robots and artificial intelligence. Are we creating a self-destructive force?
Nobel Laureate Robert M. Solow believes that even though 80% of the US economy’s growth is driven by technological progress, people will still play a vital role if they have the right skills. So, even if the modern technological revolution is transforming the way we do business, humans can stay in the driving seat.
















"We’ve allowed for substantial amounts of our workers to be inadequately educated for modern industrial work. The responsibility is on us to change that, to see we educate our youth." 


























    Find out more from Solow
				




















How do we make sure everyone benefits in the age of technology?



Edmund S. Phelps also sees technology as our ticket to global prosperity. But for him, innovation is the vital ingredient. Like Robert M. Solow, he believes innovation only flourishes when people are included in it at every level of employment. And not just in places like Silicon Valley, but across the country. He argues that if we don’t plug everyone into creative and innovative work, it’ll be bad for the economy and society as a whole.
















"Silicon Valley is just a small part of the economy - innovations have stopped in the heartland of the country. It’s the working-class people deeply connected to that heartland who’ve been suffering." 


























    Explore the issue with Phelps
				




















So what skills do we need to survive in the modern world? 

















Theodore W. Schultz thought it was the skills of ordinary people that mattered most. In fact, he had little time for the rich urban elite. He believed that since most people in the world are poor, it’s they who should be the focus for economists.
He believed the key is to make sure that the poorest in society are educated to the highest possible level and able to reach their full potential in life. 






"What’s the most important thing in economics currently? It’s seeing the increase in returns from schooling and education."

  The only skill you need in Life 
 























Why is there unemployment when jobs are available? 



Sir Christopher has studied this question extensively and realized that existing models couldn’t explain it. His research shows that the traditional supply and demand model didn’t fit the problem: employment isn’t transactional, it’s more like dating - the chemistry has to be right. His study of the labor market was a big step forward, and it’s been beneficial to governments, the unemployed and society as a whole. 
















"Unemployment is one of the biggest failures of our economic system." 






Laureate Edmund S. Phelps also rocked the boat when he challenged the accepted theory that inflation helped unemployment. He upset traditional economists by wanting to use life-like actors in his economic models, to reflect the fact that people make decisions without having all the right information at their fingertips.


























    Explore the issue with Pissarides
				




















"The focal point of economic attention should be on what leads to a more dynamic economy and society, not just what leads to more efficient markets."






    Find out more from Phelps
				
























How can we stop old-age poverty?



For those who manage to find employment, the age in which they retire has continued to grow and grow. But when it’s eventually time to throw in the towel, what will future generations do when their pension system, creaking under an aging population, fails? William F. Sharpe believes a growing knowledge-base and an intelligent immigration system could be the answer.
















"You need younger people to come into the economy. To be productive and help the economy function. And basically help support all the old people." 


























    Find out more from Sharpe
				





















  What can I live from when I am old? 
 























Can game theory avoid wars and help create peace?



Technological and scientific breakthroughs are common in the defense industry. So while we develop more and more efficient ways to destroy people and cities, there’s also a new science that works towards preventing war.
Nobel Laureate Robert J. Aumann used game theory to study conflict and cooperation between decision makers, to develop models that might prevent wars from happening in the first place. Studies have already shown that being prepared for war is actually a big part of promoting peace. 
















"Anybody who talks about any kind of military preparedness should hope that it makes the use of military unnecessary. The goal is to be prepared for war so it doesn’t have to happen." 


























    Explore the issue with Aumann
				





















  Can Game Theory avoid wars? 























Can game theory save lives?



We know that game theory can help avoid wars. But what about applying it to markets to save lives outside of the battlefield? 
Nobel Laureate, Alvin E. Roth, realized that speed dating, applying to secondary school and even undergoing a potentially life-saving organ transplant can all be seen as markets. As a result, he pioneered a kidney swap program. It helped people wanting to donate a kidney to a loved one with an incompatible blood type to be matched with other incompatible donor pairs. 
He also used game theory to solve the challenge of matching students with schools in big cities like New York and Boston, and finding the best way to match couples when speed dating.
So yes, it appears that game theory can change and even save lives.   
















"As the conditions of the market change, the behavior of people change, and that causes old rules to be discarded and new rules to be created ." 


























    Find out more from Roth
				




















Can we stop terrorism?



Laureate Myerson believes that by learning from past mistakes, we can create a framework to advance humanity and tackle terrorism:
















"After World War II, everybody understood that the reparations scheme that was imposed after World War I was a disastrous mistake, so that mistake was not going to be repeated." 






He argues that Game Theory can provide this framework, and that by taking into account all of the issues, we can look to the root of threats like ISIS and tackle them, creating a more peaceful world.


























    Discover more with Myerson
				




















Can economics save the planet too?



Nobel Laureate Robert M. Solow was interested in who should pay to keep our environment clean. We often blame modern technology for increasing pollution, but he believes it’s a social and economic issue. Technology, he says, could actually provide many of the answers to mopping up the mess. 
Solow reasons that the polluter should pay, once people can agree on who that polluter is. Is it the company who makes the product, the person who uses it, or both? The solution, says Solow, is to add the costs of cleaning to the price of the goods that the consumer buys.
"We know that, at a cost to ourselves, we can control environmental pollution. What we fight about is who will pay for those costs." 








    Explore the issue with Solow
				


















How can people manage their own resources?



Elinor C. Ostrom was the first female Nobel Laureate in Economic Sciences. She believed that people are perfectly capable of taking control of important community decisions, without external authorities imposing rules. Her extensive fieldwork focused on how people interact with ecosystems, such as forests, fisheries and irrigation systems, while maintaining their long-term sustainability. 
















"I think we’ve now gained a much greater respect for human ingenuity and creativity, and our capacity to come up with many kinds of solutions to challenging problems."

How can we create a better life for everyone?




































Why is equality still so elusive, while inequality is seen as normal and almost inevitable? We interview the greatest economic minds in the world, as they share ideas about what real economic equality might look like - and how it could be achieved across the world.

















  Will we ever close the gap between the rich and the poor? 























Why is there such a large gap between the richest and the poorest?



Nobel Laureate Robert M. Solow explored why some economies grow much faster than others; and why economic growth is stagnant in some parts of the world, while elsewhere there’s been rapid industrialization. He argued that there was no economic need for such a sharp contrast between the world’s ‘haves’ and ‘have nots’, and firmly believed that economics could be used to improve equality.
















"The science of economics should teach us not only how to increase the wealth of all of us, but to share the wealth more equally than we do."

Does wealth always improve your life?



There’s no question that achieving equality is one of the world’s most important and complicated challenges. But how do we measure poverty? And will money always make people happier?
Acknowledging the disparity of wealth in the world, Nobel Laureate Sir Angus S. Deaton says money isn’t always the answer to inequality – especially when people’s lives can be improved by better healthcare and education. In fact, financial aid can make things worse.
















"It’s very difficult to overcome the simplistic view that if you’re poor and I’m rich and I give you money, that’ll make you better off." 


























    Explore the issue with Deaton
				




















Why do some countries get stuck in poverty?



Growing up in St. Lucia during the First World War, Nobel Laureate Sir Arthur Lewis had firsthand experience of the ‘have nots’, as the country was very poor and still dealing with the aftermath of slavery.
He described an economy with a modern capitalist sector and an under-developed sector - which led to inequality and lower wages. His work on economic development, and why some countries get stuck in cycles of poverty, challenged the thinking of the time.
















"High levels of unemployment allow an urban entrepreneurial class to exploit plentiful labor. They enjoy the profits of their development, while people at the bottom of society don’t progress at all and unemployment becomes indigenous to the system as a whole."


























    Find out more from Lewis
				




















So how can we tackle inequality?



How can we make sure that the world’s poor have better lives? Nobel Laureate Paul R. Krugman was interested in income equality, arguing that people should earn enough money not just for food and shelter, but enough to be able to really take part in society. He thought this should come in the form of a basic income, for everybody. But is this really an achievable reality, or just a far-fetched utopian dream?
















"There are things we know we can do, and things we think we can do. But we should be doing all of them. Redistribution, taxes and transfers; guaranteeing a basic income for the less fortunate, paid for by taxes of the more fortunate - we can do that."


























    Explore the issue with Krugman
				




















Can we rewrite the rules of our economy to achieve equality?



Nobel Laureate Joseph E. Stiglitz says there’s no easy overnight way to do this. But he also says that if we wrote the rules to make the economy more unequal, we should now be able to rewrite them too.
















"Give workers more bargaining rights, curb the power of corporations, create better corporate governance, keep checks and balances on the financial sector. There is an agenda that can promote strong growth in the US economy."


























    Find out more from Stiglitz
				




















Can we use tax to make things fairer for the many?



Laureate Sir James A. Mirrlees is an expert in development economics, and developing systems that create fairness for everyone in society.
















 "It’s about getting rid of poverty and poor education", he says. "To make the poorest well-enough off, you have to take money from the rich." 






Though, he concedes, this is a simplistic viewpoint that doesn’t take into account the real world.


























    Explore the issue with Mirrlees
				




















Mirrlees lives in Hong Kong, so he’s seen first-hand the rise of China as an economic power - and how it’s lifted many of its population from poverty. He suspects it’ll continue on an upwards trajectory: "I feel pretty sure that urban wages in the big Chinese cities will be comparable with wages in the big (western) cities within the next 50 years."
















Is globalization helping or hindering equality?



We’ve all witnessed the world becoming increasingly interconnected, not just the products and services we use but also our culture. While globalization has been taking place for hundreds of years, it has sky rocketed over the last half-century. Has this hyper-globalization created inequality or spread the wealth?
It doesn’t appear to have helped close the gap between the richest and the poorest, but it has been good for developing countries. Nobel Laureates Paul R. Krugman and Joseph E.Stiglitz point out that one of the positives has been the huge rise of middle classes in countries like China and India. This means that hundreds of millions of previously deprived people are now relatively well off. 
















Will China rule the world?























It’s not just about the economy, what about gender equality?



Women could add $12 trillion to the global economy in the next decade* - their wealth is growing faster than men’s.
But gender equality still hasn’t come far enough, despite obvious steps forward in recent decades. In fact, the World Economic Forum predicts the gender gap won’t close entirely until 2086.
