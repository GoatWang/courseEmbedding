What is Subclincial Mastitis?

Subclinical mastitis infections are those that don’t cause any visible changes in milk or udder appearance. These infections reduce milk production, decrease milk quality, and suppress reproductive performance. The estimated loss in milk production due to subclinical mastitis is more than 1,500 pounds per cow.

Investing in the future
of food and agriculture.


With support from our investors and board members, we’re generating information that counts for the people who raise our food. Technology that improves animal health, increases productivity, and protects access to treatment interventions has great implications for the sustainability of agriculture.
 


“AAD fits well into our mission as investors as it offers advanced technologies that help livestock producers manage their animals better and run more efficiently as a business. As with human diagnostics, we want early indications so we can treat diseases more efficiently and minimize their damage.”
“Applying these advanced technologies to the health of animals raised to provide nutrition to humans is of great importance to livestock producers in this country and around the world,
and to all of us as consumers.”

AAD Board Chairman

QScout Farm Lab - Universal Diagnostic Analyzer

Share









 
 
Lab-quality testing that results in healthier animals, improved food quality, and improved business process. QScout Farm Lab is a new on-farm diagnostic system that puts you and your employees in control of animal health and productivity. The QScout Farm Lab–when teamed with the QScout line of on-farm diagnostic tests– produces reliable data that you can act on. Its quick, quantitative, quality test results remove the guesswork from scouting for hidden infections that rob your profits.

                        What is QScout?
                    



Similar to point-of-care testing (POCT) administered by physicians at or near the site of the patient, Advanced Animal Diagnostics’
“Point-of-Cow” approach to diagnostics allows for quicker, accurate results that empower real-time management decisions.
With a QScout Farm Lab installed on your dairy, you empower employees to run tests and make animal care decisions in minutes instead of losing time and money waiting for central lab results. It displays simple color-coded test results that fit easily into on-farm protocols, and more detailed reports are available for download.
To ensure success, our professional staff provides training, implementation and ongoing support.






                        Why Use QScout Farm Lab?
                    



Early detection of infection matters. Consider that mastitis costs the U.S. dairy industry $2 billion annually, or about $200 per cow.
Finding and treating mastitis early can prevent production losses – especially important when cows are approaching peak lactation (Wilson, 2004). Milk production drops dramatically during the first three months after calving when a cow experiences a case of mastitis. This impact on early lactation milk production influences peak milk production and production for the remainder of that lactation – and typically into subsequent lactations.
With the data provided by the QScout line of on-farm diagnostics, you are empowered to precisely care for your animals – and prevent future losses.
