        The beauty of the Connecticut River Valley in Massachusetts has always left visitors groping for superlatives, and the town of Northampton—once dubbed “The Athens of the Connecticut Valley”—has lately experienced a renaissance. Interest in the city has only risen through the years, and an assessment of its prominence throughout history easily explains its consistent attraction. From its settling in 1654 to the present, Northampton has been a hotbed of activity, idealism, growth, and change. Walking the streets of Northampton at different times were revolutionaries like Daniel Shays, patriots like Joseph Hawley, religious visionaries like Jonathan Edwards, idealists like the members of the utopian community in Florence, and governors like Caleb Strong and future president Calvin Coolidge. Notables like Sojourner Truth, Alexander Graham Bell, and President Franklin Pierce came and left, but their influences have remained.
