        Ozanne is letting Laird off the hook -- James Timbers
    



Jun 29, 2016



















































































I can hardly believe the incredible weakness of Dane County District Attorney Ismael Ozanne.He was handed a felony conviction on a silver platter and still cannot do his job. His weakness and racism amounts to making Genele Laird's behavior at East Towne Mall acceptable in our society.
Ozanne is quoted that, in light of the attention the case has received, he supported this outcome. A little bad press from the uninformed public and Ozanne is willing to sell our safety. The real kicker is he "believes" Laird has accepted responsibility for her actions. I have yet to see any such statement from her, let alone an apology to those she assaulted.
If I'm at the mall in broad daylight and someone threatens my life and pulls a knife, it may be time to start carrying a gun in Madison.
