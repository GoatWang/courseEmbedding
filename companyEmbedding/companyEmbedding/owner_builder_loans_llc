BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 02/14/2014
            

                BBB has determined that Owner Builder Loans, LLC meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.

Company

Our History: Answering a Need

Owner Builder Loans, LLC is family-owned, operated, and headquartered in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Our company was conceptualized through an observation of how other lenders were uninterested in assisting those who sought to help themselves, owner builders. Our founder was an Owner Builder himself years ago and utilized his knowledge of the construction process and his experience in the financial services industry to create a custom-tailored loan program to suit the needs of do-it-yourselfers.With over 40 years of owner builder construction lending experience, the Owner Builder Loans team is uniquely qualified to help our borrowers avoid the perils and pitfalls of home building. We have assisted over 3,000 Owner Builders successfully build dream homes, vacation homes, or investment properties.

Our Product: Build Your Own Home, Your Way

Having assisted over 3,000 owner builder projects, our construction loan has evolved to fit the specialized needs of both inexperienced and experienced do-it-yourselfers. Use our construction loan to finish construction which has already been started or to build from the ground up. Unlike many other lenders, we do not sell other building-related materials or services that we then require you to buy in order to obtain a loan with us. Simply put, you are the builder, we are the lender. Our construction loan can be used for conventional, kit or log home construction financing, and it allows you to self-build or hire a contractor to build your home. Additionally, borrowers can take up to 12-months to complete their homes and during that time they pay only monthly interest on the loan funds which they have drawn. If you finish early, great! We do not charge pre-payment penalties. If you find that you need additional time, we offer 3-month extensions to those who qualify. To find out more, please call us at 800-543-5600. We’ll be happy to answer all of your questions. You may also email us at any time or use our Chat Now feature when a representative is available.

Our Mission: Partnering to Build Dreams

At Owner Builder Loans, LLC, our mission is to empower borrowers to get the most out of their homebuilding experience. Whether your goal is to save on traditional building costs or to simply have increased control over the building process, our loan enables you to do it. We have minimized the hurdles that traditional financing forces borrowers to navigate while still maintaining certain safeguards to ensure you don’t install a toilet without having the necessary plumbing first.To streamline your borrowing experience, the mortgage banker you work with from the point of application will be your personal loan adviser throughout the whole loan. This saves you the trouble of having to navigate company directories and explaining your situation over and over again to get assistance with your loan. Building a home yourself can be enough of a headache. Financing your home construction shouldn’t be a part of that. Discover the Owner Builder Loans difference. Apply for an Owner Builder Loans construction loan today and join the thousands of others who we have partnered with to build dreams.



The Easiest and Most Flexible Construction Loan Available!

You want to build your home, your way, and we want to help you do it! We empower you to design your own home, hire the subcontractors you want, and purchase the materials you want. Building a home is a big project! Don’t choose a lender that will add to the headache. Choose Owner Builder Loans!

Construction Loans for Owner Builders


angela12345November 21, 2005 


Hi Everyone !!! Have you missed me ? (Don't answer unless the answer is "yes"!) No, I didn't elope with Mickey (or Minnie for that matter) or get dizzy and fall off the teacups resulting in amnesia. I have just been soooo incredibly busy lately. I have really missed visiting you guys here and have sent tons of people this way, though. So glad to see a lot of the people I recognize are still here !!!
So, to get on with the topic ... I have been working as a loan officer in the mortgage industry for the last 16 months. One thing that I would like to be able to offer to more of my customers that are going the owner-builder route is more options for their construction loan lender. I only personally know of 2 lenders that will lend to owner-builders. Of those of you who owner-built, who did you use for your construction loan ? (Don't answer if you went with a GC, 'cause there are TONS of banks that will do construction lending with a GC).
I have been searching the internet, and this is what I have copied and pasted ...
Bismark Mortgage has some interesting programs. They come highly recommended by brokers and are very flexible with owner builders. Accepts scores as low as 540. Site Supervisor or Contractor is not required.
Fireball Financial - Midlothian, Texas 76065 972-723-9554
Mid America Mortgage - 107 North Cedar Ridge st 100, Duncanville,Texas 75116 972-780-5587 or 877-310-8444
IndyMac does 95% for owner builder (100% if you use buildmax or a construction supervisor).
Mid Country Bank does up to 100% on land and construction. They lend for ICF, SIPS, Modular and Green Homes. Very open to new building technology. I have been told that they can work with scores as low as 580, if the DTI isn't too high. Site Supervisor or Contractor is not required.
M & T Mortgage offers loans for land and construction with as little as 5% down. If you own the land, that goes towards your down payment.
United Midwest Bank offers construction loans with 5% down. If the land is owned (or has equity), that is used towards the downpayment. A 661 middle score is needed for this loan. Site Supervisor or Contractor is not required. They will ask you to fill out a form indicating you are knowledgeable about the construction process.
________________________________________
This list is a start. Who else can you recommend ? National lenders or local lenders are fine. As long as they will lend to Owner-Builders. Thanks !

gizthecat We have our current mortage with Wells Fargo and they are going to do our construction loan too. We are going the owner/builder route.

sue36 I'm surprised about Wells Fargo. Ours does not allow owner/builders. It was very aggravating because DH is a licensed contractor, and they still wouldn't allow it. They would let him build someone else's house, but not his own. Stupid. We had to have a friend who is a builder say he is the builder even though he really isn't. I hate WF, but that is an entiirely different thread.

housewitch We used Branch Banking & Trust (BB&T), which is a regional bank in the Southeast for our construction loan. AgSouth (formerly Georgia Farm Credit) also offers loans to owner/builders. We have our mortgage with them. Nearly all of our local banks will handle owner/builder construction loans and/or mortgages with very little trouble.

DavidInTexas One question- do any of them allow for more than 12 months completion? I would like to build my next house (when, I don't know). If I do most of the work myself and hire a helper once in a while, it will take more than 12 months for me to complete.
Thanks,
Dave

ownerbuilder Angela - What a wonderful resource you provided! We ended up going with a local bank for our owner/builder loan. But, they required a CA licensed general contractor to be listed as a consulting contractor on the loan.
I checked with the list of contractors they referred and they all wanted 12%+ of the cost of the house for their compensation! Not much benefit to being an owner/builder in that case!
We ended up finding a friend of a friend who would be our "consultant". He charged us $3,500 for the privelege of helping us get our loan.
I would have loved to have your list at the beginning of our project!

kcmo_ken I was surprised how challenging it was as an O-B to get a construction loan. We finally found two regional banks through other O-Bs in our area that handle this type of loan. I guess these are pretty high risk, why loan a person with no experience in construction a significant amount of money to build a house? I have some construction background coupled with a fair amount of capital and was still surprised how difficult it was to get a loan.
I would tell you who I used, but I cannot give them a positive reference so I will keep it off the forum. You can tell where I live, if you are in my region PM me and I will give you a source. They used to be better, alot of our subs used to bank there as well, but some executive changes have been made and alot of the construction business have changed where they bank as a result.

logicalone I don't think it's so much that they are high risk. It's that they are a very labor intensive loan for a bank to administor. Lots of upfront work and no real way to automate the draw process Unless a bank is big enough to make enough construction loans to owner builders, they can't justify having a specialist on staff

back_in_texas We went with the Fort Worth National Bank branch in Arlington, Texas. They were very easy to work with. We went through the Owner Builder Network and this is one of the banks they have a relationship with. I don't know for sure if they would do a loan for someone who is building on their own without OBN, but they may.

rhome410 I'm bumping this up to see if there are any others to make additions to this great resource. We are in Washington state (Puget Sound area) and still in the process of finding and deciding on a bank to finance our DIY O-B project. My DH teaches home construction, so has lots of building experience and expertise, but doesn't have a contractor's license. I'm thinking the banks want someone with a bond to go after money if necessary, since one bank told us it wouldn't matter what trade he was licensed in (building, painting, excavation), just that they require a license. They obviously weren't looking for a certain level of house-building experience.
So far we've found WestSound (thanks to someone on this forum) and Timberland that will deal with owner-builders. There are a couple of others we talked to with good service, lower rates, and faster closing, but they require a licensed contractor to 'sign on,' then all drafts and paperwork would have to go through that person, creating work and expense that they'd have to pass on to us.
Timberland has a voucher method for payment that I'm unsure of, and I am worried about their bookkeeping--maybe just a technology problem. (We have our land loan through them and they can never tell me how much interest we've accrued--I always have to wait for the monthly statement--and they have improperly applied 2 of our payments.) The contact person we've dealt with there, though, was very helpful and creative when we needed help with the land loan. They do seem to be able to make individual decisions appropriate to individual customer needs.
WestSound is currently undergoing some changes with their construction financing, so I am waiting to see how that all works out, and checking for other options at the same time...so I'd welcome any other suggestions!

builderswife Our local bank handled our loan. Our loan officer said they normally charged an extra fee for an owner/builder but waived it in our case so I'm not sure how much extra they would have charged.

lisakk rhome, we just finished our house in March in Issaquah. We used Timberland Bank. I was a little worried about the voucher method, but it turned out to be pretty simple. The guy I dealt with, Gary Masterjohn at their Auburn branch was easy to work with. The only thing I would have done differently was to open a checking account with Timberland during construction. That way they will deposit your voucher checks to reimburse you for out-of-pocket expenses directly into that checking account. You will get your money about two days earlier that way.
Pretty much all the subs I dealt with had either worked with Timberland's system before or were okay with it. I was always sure to go over it with them as soon as I accepted their bid, so they weren't surprised. The construction loans are handled out of Spanaway. Typically, the turnaround time was two to three days from when the sub mailed his voucher in.
We considered West Sound, but we were informed by them that they were a quarter point higher than Timberland, because they allow draws at any time of the month. Timberland generally wants to pay after the monthly inspection (done by the 10th). They were always willing to make exceptions to this, though.

rhome410 lisakk, Thanks for the info and report on your experience with Timberland. So it was no problem to pay cash/pay ahead for things, then get reimbursed? My dh knows different people who say they can get them good prices on things, but I'm sure that in most cases, when someone is willing to give you a good price, they want cash, not paperwork hassles. We will be buying materials, not really paying subs, since we will be doing all but 1 or 2 things ourselves.

lawyergirl We used our local credit union and the loan fee was $300, no fees for draws, etc., but rate is 8%. They have been fantastic to work with. I tried working with ownerbuilderfinance.com, they seemed okay but the fees were quite high and they worked with IndyMac. Since we are in a rural area, they (IndyMac) didn't like our appraisals.

kbkids We used a local bank (hometown-type bank) with no problems at all. In fact, they've been extremely helpful. They do four draws, 25% each - the first is done after the foundation is poured. We have a home equity loan on our current house that we had planned to draw from to pay for this up front, expecting the subs to want their money before the bank would be ready to do the draw, but they said that it was no problem if we needed to advance some early throughout the loan - just give them the contractor bid. Actually, I've been very surprised throughout the process of how easy the loan was to get - honestly expected more of a problem. Our rate was prime, and it will convert to a mortgage at completion with no extra closing costs, locking in a rate 90 days before completion.

hitzjk DO NOT EVER-EVER-EVER USE WELLS FARGO BANK FOR A CONSTRUCTION LOAN!!!! It would take hours of typing to explain what they have put us through, but it has been horrible. When we finally gave up trying to convert it into a mortgage, we switched (at the expense of all the fees they charged us) to another company who has been wonderful. However, they also are fed up with Wells Fargo. They have been trying to get a payoff amount for the construction loan for 2 weeks and have gotten nowhere!!!! DON'T USE WELLS FARGO!!!!

modhouse I read and lurk a good bit on a site dedicated to owner builders. I don't know if anyone has posted about them, but they are a valuable resource for anyone building a home.
It is OwnerBuilderBook.com
They have general forums dedicated to different aspects of building a home. One of those fourums is called "Financing". It has quite a few threads on finding financing and the trials and tribulations of finding a good lender for OB's.
Much of the information in the first post came from a thread on that board.
LOANS FOR OWNER BUILDERS
The site also has local forums and OB's can network with others in their area.
Here is a link that might be useful: Owner Builder Forums and Resources

rhome410 To follow up on our own experience in the Puget Sound area: The only ones we found willing to deal with owner-builders were Timberland and WestSound. Besides having a branch in our town with a helpful loan officer, WestSound had less expensive closing costs and much less complicated paperwork...Their interest rate was the same as Timberland's. Their monthly draw system is very 'user friendly,' too. We are very happy we chose them.

osorry1 I also suffered a delay of over 2 months waiting for Wells Fargo, and in the end after repeatedly saying "yes, we'll do your loan it's in process," they then said NO!
I went with CTX mortgage and they have been great.

mehulsey Does anyone have any information on a construction loan draw sheet. I have a lot of contacts in the industry, and therefore want to subcontract a lot of the building process on my own. I have a builder that is willing to work as a construction manager, while i pull my own permits.We are trying to come up with a fair way to pay him, and he wants to come up with a total fee if he were to complete the entire project. At whatever point i want him to stop, he will take payment based upon the percentage that the bank has let us draw.what are your thoughts/

staccato Wells Fargo is generally the worst lending institution out there. Avoid them at all costs for ANY type of loan.

bushleague Angela this is great info, Thank you. Loans of this type are going to vary greatly from LTV to LTC (loan to cost). If you own the land outright you should be able to get 100% paper for the construction. As far as being your own contractor this is where LLC's and P.O. boxes come in handy. What's wrong with your local bank? Anything under 750 is subprime and lenders are being extra particular these days.

tom_in_sc Our local Savings and Loan would do the owner-builder, but only because they knew me. We went with Bank Of America (I am a long-time customer), but they farmed out the construction loan to SunTrust.

kemptoncourt We're going with Wells Fargo. The Builder Best product. We were pre-approved with a 1/2 hour consultation with our Loan Officer. Submitted zero paperwork (Approved even without 1099's or paystubs).....I'm sure there will be enough to sign when we lock in a rate and open the loan but so far it's been quick and painless.

gshea Unfortunately I also chose to go with Wells Fargo Builder Best product (before I discovered GardenWeb forums)I was pre-approved quickly also, but did come up with paystubs and plenty of other paperwork and statements etc.Last month (about 5 months into build) my broker's assistant called and recommended I lock-in (which there was a 5,000 fee to lock in, which I wasn't told about up front). I did lock.Now I've been trying for a week to set up a closing to permloan, and finally was emailed a nasty suprise from my broker last night... I was supposedly qual'd with a 10/1 INTEREST ONLY ARM for a portion of the mortgage, plus a prime+ HELOC for the remainder (the first portion is still far above jumbo, so it's not like he's trying to avoid jumbo rates)I applied as owner/builder with my husband being the GC (25+ years as GC). I was told they don't normally do that, but he was sure he could get an exception. I had to submit more paperwork for my husband to get approved as a wells-fargo builder than I had to submit for my mortgage. A couple weeks later, he got a wonderful important package designating him as a Wells-Fargo builder, please let any future customers know... However, the DAY BEFORE I closed on my construction loan, I got a call saying he couldn't be MY builder...I've also had several other nuisances along the way, like my disbursement specialist gone all of a sudden, and several weeks of different specialists until I was assigned another, who, while very nice, is very hard to reach...Sorry for the rant, if anyone has any advice on how to get out from wells-fargo, Please let me know...So, I'll add to the BEWARE or Be Careful when dealing with wells-fargo...

            Owner Builder Loan        


We are currently only accepting owner builder loans if you’re borrowing less than 60% of the value of the land plus the cost of construction.

Did you know that most banks only finance the construction of homes built by licensed builders?
Owner builder construction loans are available from a few select lenders if you have equity in your land, savings, or a guarantor that’s willing to provide additional security for your mortgage.
The lending guidelines can be tough but we can help! 


Getting Approved
Other Unusual Situations
FAQ




How much can you borrow?



95% of the project cost: If you’re a licensed builder building your own property. This is on a case by case basis only.
60% of the project cost: If you’re not a builder, your loan will be limited to 60% of the land value plus cost of construction.
Kit homes: Our lenders can finance these as per the above guidelines. However, you must have either equity in your property or savings available so that you can finance the purchase of the kit upfront.
100% loans: Borrow up to 100% of the land and construction costs with some of our lenders if you have a guarantor.
Low doc: Refer to the ‘Other Unusual Situations’ section on this page.
Owner builder development loans: Refer to the ‘Other Unusual Situations’ section on this page.
Discounts: Competitive professional package and basic loan discounts are available in some cases.

You may be able to borrow up to 100% of the land and construction costs by using a guarantor.
However, it can get quite complicated when it comes to owner builder projects so it’s best to get in touch to find out if you qualify.


Why are the banks so conservative?


In the past, many lenders were happy to work with owner builders. Since then, several banks noticed that there was a high incidence of people changing their plans, going over budget or not completing the project.
Because of this, many banks and building societies have withdrawn their funding for people that are building their own home.
Lenders tend to view some applicants more favourably than others.
Applicants that are licensed builders, have experience with one or more trades or are using a program such as the Home Building System are seen as a lower risk.
For more information on different lending policies or to speak to a specialist mortgage broker about applying for a loan, complete our enquire online or call us on 1300 889 743 and we can help you get approval!


Apply for owner builder finance


Our mortgage brokers understand the process of building a new home! We know which banks can approve your loan application and offer you a competitive interest rate.

Choose from four competitive lenders that accept owner builder home loans.
Our mortgage brokers can help you organise your cost estimates for the bank.
Avoid delays and headaches, work with the experts!

If you’d like our help to finance your project, then please call us on 1300 889 743 or fill in our free assessment form and one of our mortgage brokers will call you to discuss the amount you need to build your home.







Small developments


One of our lenders specialises in helping developers complete small projects, ideal for builders who are making the first step from building to developing but who may not yet have the track record of successful projects to easily get approval.

Simple finance is available for up to four dwellings up to $1,500,000.
Larger development projects can be financed if you have a strong asset position.
Some lenders don’t need proof of income if you plan to sell the properties on completion.
You can borrow up to 70% of the Gross Realisation Value (GRV) or 80% of the hard costs.
No presales are required for small duplex, townhouse and unit developments.

You may refinance your project on completion with a standard investment loan or low doc loan and keep some of the properties.
If you’d like our help to finance your project, then please call us on 1300 889 743 or fill in our free assessment form and one of our mortgage brokers will assist you in applying to ensure that you get approval!


Low doc owner builder loans


Licensed builders completing a small development of their own
We can help you finance a project of up to four dwellings, with a maximum loan amount of $1,500,000. You won’t need to provide any evidence of your income. 
You can borrow up to the lesser of 70% of the Gross Realisation Value (GRV) or 80% of the hard costs (value of land plus cost of construction only).
Do I need to be a licensed builder to get a low doc loan?
We can’t assist you with construction finance if you need a low doc owner builder loan unless you are a builder.
However, we can arrange a low doc loan for up to 80% of the land value (not the on completion value) as well as 80% of the value of any other properties that you own. 
Once your property is complete, we can then increase your low doc loan to 80% of the value of your property. 
For more information or to speak to one of our expert mortgage brokers, please complete our free assessment form or call 1300 889 743 and we can help you apply with the right lender. Speak to us today!


Partially complete homes


Have you run out of money half way through your owner builder project? Has your bank refused to lend you additional funds to complete your home? 
Unfortunately, almost every lender in Australia won’t accept a partially built home as security for a mortgage. 
You must apply for the loan either before you start construction or when the construction is completed.
However, if you need additional funds during construction we can help you in the following situations:

Owner builder: We can lend up to 60% of the total cost.
Licensed builder building their own home: 75% of the total cost.
Standard construction with a licensed builder: 80% of the total cost.

The above loan amounts must be enough to pay out your existing mortgage and complete the construction of your property. 
There are no exceptions to the above Loan to Value Ratios (LVRs).
Please call us on 1300 889 743 or enquire online and we can assist you in obtaining the funds you need to complete your project.
Note: For partially complete homes, we’ll charge a brokerage fee as there is significantly more work involved then there is for a standard home loan.


Using a guarantor with a construction loan


If you have a friend or family member that can guarantee your loan then you may be able to borrow more than 80% of the project cost and up to a maximum of 100% on a case by case basis. 
For more information, please refer to our no deposit guarantor loan page. 
Standard guarantor loans aren’t available so you’ll need to apply for an 80/20 guarantor loan.
This is where the guarantor takes out a mortgage on their property and then lends this to you to make up the difference between your 80% mortgage secured by your property and the amount that you require to complete the project.
For more information on how a guarantor can help you get a construction loan, please call us on 1300 889 743 or fill in our free assessment form. We can make the application process less stressful for you!







How are the loan funds advanced?


Unlike a traditional home loan, the lender won’t pay you all of the loan funds when the loan is setup. Instead, they’ll release funds to you as construction progresses.
This is known as ‘progress payments’ or ‘construction draw downs’.
Once you have completed each step of construction, a bank valuer will be sent out to assess your work, confirm you have followed the floor plans and then authorise the bank to make the next payment.
If you have significant equity available in your land then we may be able to arrange a line of credit based on the value of your land alone.
This will allow you to build your new home without the need for the lender to monitor your progress. This is usually available when you’re borrowing no more than 80% to 90% of the land value alone.


Which documents do you need to provide?


As an owner builder you’ll need to provide more documents than a traditional borrower:

Building plans / floor plans.
An itemized estimate of the total cost of construction.
A copy of your owner builder insurance (if applicable).
Evidence that you are using the Home Building System (if applicable).
A copy of your owner builder permit (if applicable).

Once you have obtained council approval you’ll be required to provide a copy of the council approved plans to the lender.


Value or Cost?


When lenders assess the value of a property that’s yet to be built, they ask their valuer to complete a ‘To Be Erected’ (TBE) valuation. 
Typically, the valuer will look at the plans, the cost of construction and, in almost all cases, will value the construction project at the value of the land plus the cost of construction.
Lenders are always conservative when assessing the value of the property you’re using as security. 
They will use the lesser amount of the actual valuation or the total of the purchase price / value of the land and cost of construction.
This is no different for owner builder loans and as a result it’s important to have significant equity in your vacant land otherwise you may be unable to obtain a loan approval.
Please complete our free assessment form or speak to us on 1300 889 743 for more information.
Our mortgage brokers will aim to assist you in getting the loan amount you need. Call us today!


What type of building license do you have?


There are many different types of building licenses with different restrictions placed on each one. 
The lenders that we work with for owner builder finance tend to prefer borrowers who have an unlimited building license rather than a project management license. 
If you have an unlimited building license, you’ll have a better selection of lenders to work with.
Of course if you don’t have a building licence at all then you’re still eligible for an owner builder loan, but you’ll need a larger deposit.


The golden rules


We’ve helped a lot of owner builders finance their construction project. Follow these simple rules to avoid the headaches!
 Don’t run out of money
If you run out of money during construction then in most cases the bank won’t approve a loan increase for you. In other words, you’re in big trouble!
We have one lender that may be able to help if you run out of money. However, unless you’re a licensed builder yourself, they won’t lend any more than 60% of the project cost.
 Don’t begin construction yet
Wait until your loan is formally approved before you commence construction.
The majority of lenders won’t approve a loan if you have already commenced construction. Unfortunately, many people aren’t told this by their bank.
Most people begin building using their savings and only apply for a loan towards the end of the project, when they run short of funds.
 Budget carefully
Complete a cost estimate worksheet before beginning your project.
You’ll need to provide this to the bank as part of your loan approval. Please make this as accurate as possible and include a contingency in-case you go over budget.
If this isn’t done properly then you risk running out of money. In addition, try not to make many changes after your loan is approved because you may need to re-apply for your mortgage.
 Experience counts
Are you sure you know what you’re doing?
If you have trouble creating the budget for your project or don’t have a background in the construction industry then we don’t recommend that you build your own home.
Inexperienced owner builders are almost certain to regret the decision to build their own home.
Do you need help to apply for your owner builder mortgage? 
Please call us on 1300 889 743 or complete our free assessment form and one of our mortgage brokers will discuss your options with you.


Owner builder training courses


We strongly recommend that you complete the appropriate training before you begin your construction project. In some states, this is mandatory. 
We recommend undertaking a course with ABE Education, a Registered Training Organisation that provides quality nationally accredited training to owner-builders in NSW and the ACT.
This training will enable you to obtain your owner builder permit/ licence and will assist with your finance approval.
ABE Education specialise in e-learning, which is simple, user-friendly and interactive. You can take as long as you wish to complete your course, as all your work is saved for the next time you log in.

Alistair Bell



I own a plot of land in southern QLD. I want to develop it as a hobby farm, so I’ll have some construction there which I believe will take 6 months. Will the bank view this as a issue, and whether I can lend the full amount for the construction or not?






Home Loan Experts



If you are planning to get a mortgage to build a property on your own, most lenders will limit lending to 60% of the total land and construction value. There are 1-2 lenders that could go up to 80%, however your overall application should be very strong, like your credit history, genuine savings, financial position and employment history among others.






Watson



I am looking for your help in identifying a lender to finance a project, which is to knockdown and re-build a semi-detached property in Kingsford, NSW. It’s for residential purposes and I’d like to execute this project as an Owner Builder. The estimated value of the property, post construction, is around AUD 1.5 to 2 mil and I’m looking for a loan at an LVR of 70-75%. Also looking to refinance an existing loan with CBA, which was used to purchase the land plus existing property and is now at 75% LVR.
We have done a lot of research into this topic over the past six months and we understand the risks and challenges of an owner builder project. I personally have 15+ years of experience in managing large transformation projects for financial institutions and feel comfortable with the budgeting and legal aspects of an owner builder project. Can you guys help with this?






Home Loan Experts



Hi Watson,
Based on what you’ve stated, I expect we can get you approved. We’ve got a couple of owner builder specialists and as an owner builder loan is more complex, I think it’s best to meet in person and discuss it along with any other details you may have missed out. Please call us on 1300 889 743 and one of our brokers will go through your situation.






Lucy L



I’m getting 2 houses ($700k each) built on land that I own. I had initially taken out a $1.4m loan with a bank and I owe $269k. My builder in in liquidation and one of my houses is partially complete. I want to build the rest of it myself. I have owner builder permits and $400k in savings although I own another investment property where I still owe $400k. Can I get $1m loan for constructing? I will of course live in the property upon completion.






Home Loan Experts



Hi Lucy, right now the main problem that most lenders will identify is a high lend on an incomplete house. If you want to avoid an owner builder loan, you can potentially consider cash out. We do have a few lenders in mind that can possibly help and it’s likely that we can also get an exception based on the land value only. We will need to discuss your situation clearly and then speak with the lenders. Please call us on 1300 889 743 to speak with one of our owner builder specialists.






Ogilby



I owe $110k on a piece of land worth $180k and I want to get an owner builder loan of $240k to build a residential house. I have $20k in cash and will be going full doc. The DA has approved it and there’s electricity, telephone and road access (spent $90k to fix all this). Can you guys help?






Home Loan Experts



Hello Ogilby,
It’s likely that the banks won’t accept your loan application as it is. The location may also prove to be a problem to the lenders. However, if we can change the situation then it can be more likely to be accepted, e.g. if you have a guarantor or you get a gift or loan from your parents, or you get a licensed builder. Please call 1300 889 743 to discuss this with an expert owner builder mortgage broker.






Austin



Hi there, I applied for pre-approval with NAB 6 months ago and then there was a delay with council. I spoke to them yesterday and they said they don’t lend 80% for owner builder any more???






Home Loan Experts



Hey Austin,
Yes, that’s true. NAB have restricted their policy in this space. Unfortunately, some customers have been left in difficult situations as a result. There are other lenders that can help especially if you are a licensed builder yourself. If you’re not a licensed builder then the maximum you can borrow is now 60% of the property value.






Leigh Tipper



Is there anyone who does Owner builder  loans at the previous 80%. like the previous person I am in the same boat. Have 35% of the cost for land and house build. But now this has put me in the position of paying a larger amount for the house we want through a project builder.
Leigh






Home Loan Experts



Hi Leigh,
Unfortunately no. If you are a builder yourself then we can lend you up to 95%. If not then you’re limited to 60%. You may be able to use a guarantor loan in some circumstances to allow you to borrow more. When the house is complete you can increase your loan and pay out the guarantor https://www.homeloanexperts.com.au/guarantor-home-loans






Luke Beardwood



I am a licensed builder looking to build my own house, i work full time as an employee in the construction industry also with a good wage. I wish to borrow 85% of all construction and land costs, is this viable as i am licensed myself?






Home Loan Experts



Hi Luke,
Yes this is viable. If you’re using your own building licence then this is fine and we can assist you to borrow 85%. We’d need to know the full details of your situation to be sure. Please complete this form https://www.homeloanexperts.com.au/free-quote/ and we’ll complete a full assessment.






Deering



I’ve got $80k savings and I need $30k to start building. I’m a registered builder but I currently owe around $60k. I can’t provide any financials at the moment I do have ATO notice of assessment. The bank I initially went with rejected my loan application so what should I do?






Home Loan Experts



Hello Deering, you can consider getting a personal loan or a quick business loan. We can then help consolidate this for you so you can pay it off in your mortgage interest rate. If you want to discuss this in detail, please call 1300 889 743.






VH



Own my own land outright valued $800k. Own existing house valued $560k, owe $80k. Got $340k in line of credit against existing house to put towards owner build project. Need total of $800k to build, inc contingency. Therefore need owner builder loan of approx $460. Will sell current house at end of build, or should we sell upfront and rent? Build will take approx 14 months. Can we get finance?






Home Loan Experts



Hi VH
Yes we can likely do an owner builder equity loan using the land as you have a significant amount of equity. 14 months is a very long time for a construction project of that type, I’m assuming you’re being conservative with this?
Assuming everything else in your siutation is ok it is likely we can help you. https://www.homeloanexperts.com.au/free-quote/






Sandy



Hi
We own our land outright and have got our house to lockup (owner built). We now need an extra 80K to complete the build. Is there a lender which will do this. The land value is 290K and the house at this stage which we have paid into with our own funds is 200K.






Home Loan Experts



Hi Sandy,
Yes if it’s at lock up stage and we’re just relying on the land value then we can finance this. It’s a difficult loan and outside of most lender’s policies so it would be with a specialist lender at a higher rate and we’d need to charge a brokerage fee because of the small loan size and additional work.
When the house is complete we can refinance to a mainstream lender.

Ed Wills



Hi, I am looking at purchasing an unfinished home. I am looking at obtaining finance for the land value $250K (which will cover the purchase price) and this way I will get 80% LVR and then I would be looking at obtaining owner builder construction loan to finish the project. I anticipate 200K to finish it. Just wondering what my chances are of obtaining 60% of this amount?  And will I need to show 40% deposit to obtain the 60%? Keeping in mind estimated value of property once complete will be between $800K – 1 million.






Home Loan Experts



Hi Ed.
This type of project can only be done by someone with a lot of cash or who has other property that can be used as security.
We’d be able to lend you 80% of the land value only.
The on completion value would be ignored by a residential lender as they assess the lesser of the project cost or valuation.






Lawry Williams



Just want to clarify things! I am not a  licensed builder and we have purchased a block of land freehold for 110k. The cost of construction we are looking at is around the 180k mark. Is the 60%  plus the cost of construction mean theoretically could borrow say 240k or only 65 or so?






Home Loan Experts



Hi Lawry,
The calculation is $110k + $180k = $290k cost of the project.
A 60% lend would mean you can borrow $174k.
Unfortunately we can’t assist with loans under $200k.






KI



Hi. I own outright land worth 1.765m. Would like to owner build a house and borrow $800k. Would there be a loan product where this is possible? Thx






Home Loan Experts



Hi KI
Yes this is something we can help with. This is known as cash out for construction and it is something that some lenders will do and others will not. Usually they’re concerned that the borrower will use the money for another purpose so providing us evidence such as the council approved plans will help us to choose from more lenders.






AG



Hi I have a 75% finished house in Mathinna Tas 7214. I had it valued through a lender and it is now worth $125K. I tried for finance but the banks won’t lend me the money to finish the house because I am an owner builder and the house in not fuly finished. Land value would only be $12k. It needs another $25k to have it ready to be signed off by council. It needs the verandah finished as the veranda incorporates part of the structure for the deck supports and balistrade. Other than that deck is basically complete. There are other things the valuers said that meant it has “risk” attached. Such as, colourbond corner flashings, carpet in the bedrooms and benchtops and cupboard doors in the kitchen. I am slowly chipping away at it. But am now maxxed out on my personal loan borrowing power, which sits at $31K. The veranda would be about $9-10K including paying the builders. Kitchen needs $3-4K, carpet about $1500 and other minor things about another $1500. Is there anyway I can get finance? I would want to pay out the $30k I owe and borrow another $30k to finish the build. I’m confident I can complete it for $20k plus what I oweAn extra $10k would just allow for any contingencies.






Charteredparul Garg



Hi Ki, we do owner builder finance, you can contact us on 0468763369, thanks






Charteredparul Garg



Hi Lawry, we can help for finance under 200k, owner builder, you can contact us on 0468763369, thanks






Charteredparul Garg



Hi Ed, we do owner builder finance. You can get 80% LVR against the land provided you fulfill the other requirements anticipated with this project. I want to know more about this project. Please give me a buzz on my mobile at 0468763369, thanks






Is



Hi i own a house on a duplex site and wanted to build a duplex at the moment i owe 270000 and wanted to borrow 650000 to build each duplex will be worth 850000 on completion i am planning to live in one rent other just wanted to know what percentage i can borrow thank you 






Home Loan Experts



Hi Is,
The total completion value is $850k each so $1.7mil total. The existing loan $270k plus the construction loan of $650k means a total of $920k.
The total LVR would be approx 55%. Max borrowing generally would be 80% due to loan amount restrictions unless you subdivide, then the loan amount will be under $1mil each so should be fine to go 90%.






Charteredparul Garg



Hi,  in case of owner builder, we can borrow upto 60% of the total project cost, that is the value of land and construction amount, this is the first part, if you want to know in details plz contact us on 0468763369, thanks 






Maxy



Hi,
Have land worth $265,000 owe $207,000.
Savings of $150,000 and require $260,000 to complete build
Would we qualify for an owner builder loan?






Home Loan Experts



Hi Maxy,
Yes you should qualify because you have a lot in savings. Don’t start construction until you have the formal loan approval.






Dav



Hi,
I have purchased land for $330K with 80% LVR so owing $264K at the moment. The land value has increased by approximately 50K since i purchased. 
I would like to borrow about 150 – 175K for the build. I have approximately 65K of savings to contribute to the project. 
Would i be able to borrow the amount above via an owner builder loan? 
I work for a project home builder and have 10years+ experience, I am the manager of my department. I also have a B.Construction Management UNSW. I do not have a builders licence though. Would there be any consideration for my experience and qualification?
Thank you






Home Loan Experts



Hi Dav
Yes you should qualify as you should be below 60% LVR.
Your experience wont affect lending as you aren’t the licence holder. If you held a building licence then you could borrow 95%. Please understand that common sense isn’t common with our banks!

Ad campaign costs accrued before receiving a credit, as well as costs accrued after all credits are used, will be charged to the payment method associated with the Bing Ads account. If customer payment fails, the coupon amount will not be applied.  Ads will continue to run and accrue costs after any promotional credit has been used up. Any portion of the credit not used within ninety (90) days of credit redemption will expire and can't be carried over even if the Bing Ads Customer switches their payment method. Offer valid only to residents of the United States. In order for the offer to be valid, a form of payment must be entered into your account prior to redemption of the promotional code and prior to your account going live to take advantage of the credit. This offer may not be combined with any other offer, promotional code coupon or discount, separated, redeemed for cash, transferred, sold, or bartered. Microsoft, in its sole discretion, can close your account for any suspected coupon abuse. Refund of the $25 is not permitted.  See Bing Ads Terms and Conditions for more details at sign-up. Other terms and conditions may apply.  Microsoft reserves the right to cancel, change, or suspend this offer at any time without notice.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
