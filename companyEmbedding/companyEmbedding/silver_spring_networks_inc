Enabling the Internet of Important Things™ 






Reliably and securely connecting things that matter.
With the emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT), a growing array of devices and applications have begun to play vital role in helping people live well and organizations thrive. They include preserving the safety and well-being of entire communities, making more efficient use of our limited natural resources, tracking and managing high-value corporate assets, and ensuring that critical services are delivered on time, all the time.
To power these critical IoT applications, organizations must be able to rely on networks that are always connected yet stringently protected. Cost-effective yet high-performance. Flexible, yet reliable. Easy to deploy, yet resilient and scalable.
These applications, and the networks that enable them, make up the Internet of Important Things™. And they will increasingly define qualify of life for millions of people around the world, while helping to ensure that large organizations operate cost-effectively and efficiently.
At Silver Spring Networks, we understand what it takes to enable critical IoT applications, because we’ve been doing it for more than a decade. We done it by leveraging a unique combination of strengths found nowhere else in the industry, and by building our solutions around recognized Internet standards.
Our solutions are:

Cost-effective. Offered as both private and public cloud networks, Silver Spring’s platform reduces TCO and risk over years.
Reliable and high-performance: A single wireless mesh network eliminates the single point of failure and other vulnerabilities that plague too many IoT networks, while customers benefit from the best combination of throughput, range and latency.
Resilient and secure: Silver Spring’s platform works with virtually any connectable device, protects data with military grade security, and is designed to “just work” – with 99+ percent reliability.
Comprehensive. Our long history of successful deployments and our broad ecosystem of hardware and software developers enable us to deliver complete solutions that address the current and future needs of an array of customers.
We build IoT networks designed to work for decades.

Organizations that harness the possibilities of the Internet of Important Things will transform their businesses and communities, unleashing unparalleled innovation. At Silver Spring, we’re connecting them with that future.

Social ResponsibilityOne thing that we are sure of, no matter how good our deeds are, a collective effort always has more impact. That’s why we have unveiled a set of programs that guides our actions today and into the future, we call it the Silver Spring Foundation. The foundation is another way we reflect our values and our social commitment.
Community Grant: This program will create a unique opportunity for Silver Spring to engage with our customers, partners and employees to work together towards a common goal and with a sense of shared values.
Outreach: This program aspires to touch developing areas of the world raising awareness around clean energy, thereby improving health through integrated renewable energy and reduced dependency on fossil fuels.
Green: This program is focused on continuing to improve our work and local environment. From recycling and composting in every break room to ensuring we have fewer disposable items in our kitchens. Larger projects will include green certifying our business, and developing measures of our success in reducing our carbon footprint.
Community: This program looks to engage employees in scientifically and economically sound activities and programs that work to enhance the global communities in which we live, work, and do business.



A Partner to the EnvironmentThrough partnership with cities, utilities, and companies, Silver Spring hopes to make a lasting impact on energy consumption around the world, by increasing the efficiency of the grid and empowering consumers to track and reduce their use of energy, gas and water.
Power Over Energy is an energy literacy initiative focused on educating, empowering, and motivating us to make smart decisions about the way we use electricity. Since we launched in 2013, our social media campaign has reached over 100 million consumers and built and engaged a vibrant global community primarily through Facebook. The initiative is backed by a coalition of business, nonprofit, and government organizations united in the desire to increase awareness about the wide-reaching impact of our current energy consumption, the benefits of energy efficiency, and the importance of modernizing the electricity grid.

Why Silver Spring Networks, Inc. Stock Plunged Today
The smart-grid products company fell after a disappointing quarterly report. Here's what investors need to know.











                Steve Symington
            

                (TMFSymington)



            
            Feb 22, 2017 at 1:50PM
            
            





What happened
Shares of Silver Spring Networks Inc. (NYSE:SSNI) were down 14.3% as of 11:30 a.m. Wednesday after the smart-grid products specialist announced strong fourth-quarter 2016 results, but followed with underwhelming guidance.
So what
Quarterly revenue fell 66.7% year over year, to $66.3 million, including a 71.8% decline in product revenue, to $40.4 million, and a 53.9% drop in services revenue, to $25.9 million. Billings for the quarter climbed 4%, to $77.7 million. And on the bottom line, that translated to a GAAP net loss of just under $14 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, compared to net income of $61.9 million, or $1.19 per diluted share in the same year-ago period. On a non-GAAP basis, which adjusts for one-time gains and expenses, Silver Spring Networks generated earnings of $0.05 per share.
By comparison, analysts' consensus estimates called for lower adjusted earnings of $0.02 per share, and lower billings of $76 million.

IMAGE SOURCE: Silver Spring Networks, Inc.

Silver Spring Networks CEO Mike Bell elaborated:

We enter 2017 in a strong position, with solid fourth quarter results and several new international awards. In 2016, we achieved record bookings, with major awards from Con Edison, Entergy and Pacific Power, generated over $20.7 million in operating cash flow for the year, and finished the year with more than 25.5 million cumulative network endpoints delivered. We are focused on ramping production of our Gen5 platform for our major upcoming deployments, driving international growth, and expanding our platform to additional smart utility applications and new vertical markets within the broader Internet of Important Things opportunity.






Now what
For the current quarter, Silver Spring expects revenue of $45 million to $50 million, with billings of $67 million to $71 million. The latter range, however, was well below the $75.3 million in billings Wall Street was anticipating.
For the full year of 2017, Silver Spring expects revenue in the range of $400 million to $420 million, as the company continues focusing on reducing its deferred revenue. Full-year 2017 billings are expected to be in the range of $300 million to $320 million, again below analysts' consensus estimates for $375.5 million.
In short, while Silver Spring is rightly pleased with its fourth-quarter performance and momentum headed into 2017, it's obvious the market was even more optimistic regarding billings going forward. So with the caveat that Silver Spring might well be under-promising with the intention of over-delivering, it's no surprise to see shares trading lower today.

      Sensor Network – has been recognized as TMCNet.com’s 2014 Smart Grid
      Product of the Year,” said Alex Zheng, SilverLink Business Lead, Silver

      and quickly and cost effectively develop and deliver new services. The
      SilverLink Sensor Network expedites the implementation of smart grid
      applications so utilities have greater insight into the data flowing off
      their network. These insights can be used to transform the customer
      experience.”
    

      The SilverLink Sensor Network enables utilities and other network
      operators to connect real-time data to business processes to make
      smarter and faster business decisions, lower IT costs, create a more
      agile organization, and more quickly and cost-effectively launch new
      business models and services. Partners including AutoGrid, Bidgely,
      Detectent, DVI, MongoDB, ONZO, Plotwatt, and Sentient are already
      engaging with Silver Spring to leverage the SilverLink Sensor Network.

					Full Description



Silver Spring Networks, Inc., incorporated on July 3, 2002, is engaged in creating, building and deploying large-scale networks and solutions enabling the Internet of things (IoT) for critical infrastructure. The Company provides a networking platform and solutions that enable utilities to transform the power grid infrastructure into the smart grid. Its networking platform enables customers to communicate with devices connected to the power grid. Its networking platform comprises hardware, such as access points and relays; its communications modules; its SilverLinkOS network operating software, and its GridScape management and security software. The Company offers an array of solutions built upon SilverLink Network and Data platforms, including advanced metering, distribution automation, demand-side management, street lights and its wireless Internet protocol version 6 (IPv6) network service for the IoT, Starfish.The Company also offers professional services to design and optimization, deployment support, software and systems integration, program management, consulting services and training. Its managed services include monitoring the performance of the network, tracking trends, providing alerts, monitoring security and planning disaster response. Through its managed application services, it manages the SilverLink Control Platform and SilverLink Applications. Its software as a service (SaaS) offering allows utility customers to eliminate initial investments in software and hardware systems and transform their system usage to an on-demand basis. The Company also offers technical, network and product support at a variety of service levels.Advanced meteringThe Company's advanced metering solution provides utilities with two-way communications from its communications module integrated into a third-party meter to their back office, enabling utilities to remotely perform functions, such as reading meter usage, capturing time-of-use consumption data, connecting and disconnecting service, and detecting power outages. The Company collaborates with various meter manufacturers to provide a range of meter options for its utility customers. Its advanced metering software includes Advanced Metering Manager (AMM) software application and may include its CustomerIQ and SensorIQ applications.Distribution AutomationThe Company's distribution automation solution provides two-way communications from distribution devices along the power grid to the back office or substations, providing utilities with real-time information for grid monitoring and control. Its distribution automation solution comprises of bridges paired with third-party devices and its SensorIQ application, Outage Detection System (ODS) application, GridScape application and Operations Optimizer application.Demand-Side ManagementThe Company offers approximately three solutions to support demand-side management. Energy Efficiency helps reduce overall energy consumption, or base load. Its energy efficiency solution leverages the two-way communications in and information gathered from its advanced metering solution to provide consumers with timely information about their energy usage through either the Web-based portal, CustomerIQ, or a third-party in-home device, such as a thermostat. Demand Response helps reduce energy consumption when demand is at peak load. With the Company's technology, utilities can send messages to consumers in anticipation of a peak-load event. Utilities can leverage its technology to support both price-based and load control-based demand response programs. Also with its technology, the utility can incentivize consumers to charge their electric vehicles during non-peak times, helping utilities manage this new demand.Street LightsBy integrating the Company's communications module with a photocell or other control device, cities can retrofit existing lighting and convert it to a networked light. Another approach is to replace legacy lighting with light emitting diode (LED) lighting, which includes an integrated communications module. The Company also offers control and management software for smart city and street light offerings.Starfish IoT Network ServiceThe Company's Starfishm is a wireless IPv6 network service for the IoT, which is intended to build upon the Company's customers' network footprint to enable commercial enterprises, cities, utilities and developers to access an IoT network service with service level agreements that meet their needs. The Company focuses on creating an ecosystem of partners and developers to effect the deployment of a network footprint; enable communications capabilities to a range of devices, and a diversity of applications to connect a number of full solutions to the emerging IoT space.The Company competes with Aclara Incorporated, Honeywell International Inc., Itron Inc., Toshiba Corporation, Sensus Metering Systems Inc., Trilliant Holdings, Inc., Xylem, Inc., Cisco Systems, Inc., General Electric Company, S&C Electric Company, Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories, Inc., C3 IoT Inc., Grid Net Inc., Oracle Corporation, Tendril Networks Inc., Echelon Corporation, Harvard Engineering PLC, Verizon Wireless, Telensa Limited, Royal Philips Electronics and Schreder Group.

Men's ClothingGuys, it’s time to update your wardrobe. Luckily for you, we’ve got all the staples and on-trend pieces your closet needs. Explore men’s clothing (including big & tall sizes), plus shoes and accessories to create outfits tailored for every occasion. And if you’re interested in a few helpful styling tips, then check out our Men’s Guide to Style. Don’t worry, you can thank us later.
First, let’s keep it casual. The keys to a great laid-back wardrobe are to pick pieces that fit well, are comfortable and are versatile. T-shirts and tees are a great place to start. Plain tees are simple and can be worn with anything. Bonus? They can double as undershirts in a pinch. Graphic tees are an easy way to show off your personality. Go with versions that showcase your interests, rep your favorite sports team or just look cool. Finish your chill shirt collection with a few polos—they’re a more polished option and can easily be dressed down or up.
Now that you’ve got your list of classic casual shirts, it’s time to focus on refreshing your collection of shorts and pants. From cargos and chinos to denim, we’ve got you covered. When it comes to jeans, especially, grab a few pairs in various washes—think light, medium and dark. Feeling adventurous? Colored denim provides a fresh update to your look. From skinny and slim fit to bootcut and relaxed, fit matters and you should always pick pairs that suit your frame and that you feel good in.
Let’s move on to pieces you’ll need to dress to impress. Look pulled together with suits, dress shirts, undershirts and men’s dress shoes. Take the opportunity to mix and match with sport coats and blazers. Pair them with dress pants or jeans for a modern feel (but only if if the dress code is more lenient). Whether you’re headed to the office, a wedding or special event, your stylish clothes will speak for themselves. Don’t forget accessories. Grab a wallet, cuff links, ties, belts and more to round out your look.
Whether you’re dressed up or down, you’ll need to layer up when it’s cold outside. Our collection of jacket, coats and vest will keep you warm. Throw on cozy sweaters and sweatshirts into your look, and for even more warmth, stock up on hats, scarves and gloves. Stick with Timberland boots and thicker fabrics that help trap heat—think wool, leather, cotton and more.
Oh, and we can’t forget workout clothes. Whether you live at the gym or are just getting back into an exercise routine, you’re going to need a solid collection of activewear. And on rest days (and every evening), pajamas and loungewear will come in handy. We’re here to help you look great every hour of the day. Find helpful styling tops and tricks with Macy’s Men’s Guide to Style.
Who’s ready for a wardrobe refresh? Shop men’s clothing, shoes, accessories and more at Macy’s.Looking for huge savings? Shop our Black Friday, Cyber Monday and Holiday Gift Guide!

"Good Morning, I was able to find your site very easy. The odrer process was simple, and shipment was seedy. Thank you so much. My purchase was based on my husbands need for mayo in his lunch box. Mayo is a testy food that goes bad quickly. I plan to look around your site in the near future. To see if there may be other things that wood help out in a lunch box.  Thank your so much. I give you 5 stars.M.S. (Woodford VA)
"Please note that the items were well packaged and arrived intact. You are also the only service that offered Enrico’s salsa at a reasonable price at this particular time. Thanks.S.M. (Pound Ridge NY)

Takeout & Pizza Supplies
Ciao Bella! Everything you need to create and serve the perfect pizza



        Takeout and pizza supply items are at the heart of our product offering targeted for the independent operator. Takeout revenues are highly important for many mom and pop restaurants.
