 The Lead
Sterling Equity Opportunities: The Lead, "What do you do and why is it different?"

Equity Opportunities Group portfolios seek to give clients the “chance to outperform” an index with below average risk.
The quest to outperform, by its nature, results in periods of outperformance and underperformance.  Institutions and advisors gain confidence that when our approach is temporarily out of favor, underperforming stocks tend to be high quality names.
This quarter’s Financial Analysts Journal highlights how similar high Active Share and lower turnover portfolios outperform over time.
