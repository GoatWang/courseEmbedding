Jeff Standerski, Senior Vice President, People And Inclusion (Photo: Business Wire)






Business Wire




Apr 25, 2016 9:32 AM EDT













 




























































  Rockwell Collins today announced that Jeff Standerski has been named senior vice president, People and Inclusion. In this role, Standerski leads the global Human Resources function at Rockwell Collins, including Compensation and Benefits, Organization Development and Training, Diversity and Inclusion, Employee and Labor Relations, Talent Acquisition and Human Resources Delivery. This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160425005866/en/   Jeff Standerski, senior vice president, People and Inclusion (Photo: Business Wire)   He previously was senior vice president of the company's Information Management Services (IMS) business in Annapolis, Maryland. Standerski replaces Martha May, who announced her resignation in March for personal reasons.  Dave Nieuwsma, formerly vice president, Strategy and Business Development for the company's Government Systems business, will assume the role of senior vice president, IMS, replacing Standerski. Both appointments are effective immediately.  "Jeff's ability to effectively drive change, transform organizations and build a strong culture has been proven repeatedly in his various roles at the company,  especially guiding employees through the transition from ARINC to Rockwell Collins," said Rockwell Collins Chairman, President and CEO Kelly Ortberg. "His proactive leadership style, combined with his extensive experience across our business, will prove invaluable as we continue to advance our culture and evolve our people and inclusion strategies."  Regarding Nieuwsma's appointment Ortberg commented, "Dave brings a fresh perspective to our IMS organization as we look to further expand our information management services capabilities and offerings beyond its core commercial aviation business. His diverse background and global business development experience will serve us well as we focus on growing our IMS business."  Standerski has led the IMS organization since Rockwell Collins' acquisition of ARINC in December 2013. Previously, he served as vice president and general manager, Business and Regional Systems, as well as vice president and general manager, Air Transport Systems, and vice president, Strategy Development for Commercial Systems. Standerski joined Rockwell Collins in 1989.

Executive Profiles









Learn how a fascination with airplanes and advice from his grandfather helped shape Jeff Standerski’s career.

Jeff Standerski’s passion for aviation began during his childhood when he would gaze at the airplanes taking off and landing at the airport near his home in the south suburban Chicago town of Calumet City – a blue collar community located along the western shorelines of Lake Michigan.
It’s a passion that continued well into Standerski’s adolescence and one that ultimately sparked an interest in avionics engineering and a career with Rockwell Collins that has spanned more than 25 years.
“As a teenager, I spent my summers pumping gas at the local airport and I was always looking up in the sky,” recalled Standerski, now senior vice president of Information Management Services (IMS) at Rockwell Collins. “I was fascinated with airplanes.”
With his heart set on becoming a commercial aviation pilot, Standerski entered Parks College of Saint Louis University where he earned a degree in aeronautics and avionics. During college, he also received his pilot’s license and instrument rating. But somewhere along the way he realized that wasn’t the kind of long-term career he desired.
Instead, he interviewed with several aerospace and defense companies – including Lockheed Martin, McDonnell Douglas and Rockwell Collins – and ultimately decided to begin his career as a systems engineer at our company headquartered in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.
“There were several Parks College graduates who had joined Rockwell  Collins before me and they were always talking about what a great company it was,” said Standerski, whose first assignment found him working on the German Air Force C-160 Transall aircraft.
“When I came to Cedar Rapids, I knew right away that it was the right place for me,” he continued. “I felt very confident that the leader hiring me was going to help me transition into the workforce and also help me professionally and personally. In the end, I was right.”

Career takes flightDuring the next 15 years, Standerski began to carve out a name for himself within Government Systems as a marketing support specialist, programs manager, programs director, and senior director of Advanced Communications and Technology.
It was during those early years that he discovered the importance of mentoring and long-term career planning. He also found himself “hooked on the customer,” which he said was extremely beneficial upon his transition into Commercial Systems in 2004.
“As much as I enjoyed the technical nature of what we do, I really enjoyed working with customers,” said Standerski, who also held the roles of vice president of Strategy Development for Commercial Systems, vice president and general manager of Air Transport Systems, and vice president and general manager of Business and Regional Systems.
“The mentors I’ve had over the years have always reminded me that we are first and foremost an engineering company,” he continued. “We build innovative products and solutions. We support our customers. We meet our commitments.”

Learning a new businessToday, Standerski is the leader of our newly created IMS business, which is based in Annapolis, Maryland. It’s a position he was appointed to by CEO and President Kelly Ortberg in January 2014 following the December 2013 acquisition of ARINC Incorporated, which is now the core of our IMS business.
Like most corporate executives, Standerski admits his plate is overflowing. He’s learning the ins and outs of a new business that provides communications, systems integration and security solutions across the aviation, airport, rail and nuclear power markets. He now has responsibility for about 1,800 employees, and he’s familiarizing himself with new customers and a new community.
But despite his hectic schedule – which includes frequent business travel to various locations around the world – Standerski remains committed to preserving the leadership style he learned from the man who hired him into the company more than two decades ago. He’s also dedicated to maintaining the humility, loyalty and work ethic he learned from his maternal grandfather.
“My first engineering leader was an individual who truly cared about people both from a professional and personal growth perspective,” said Standerski. “He had an open door policy and was very approachable, and that’s something I’ve tried to emulate over the years.
“I also owe a great deal to my grandfather,” he continued. “I spent a lot of time with him when I was growing up and he taught me the importance of loyalty and the importance of working hard and always trying to go above and beyond what’s expected of you.”

Leading by exampleThose are lessons and traits that Standerski and his wife, Mary Beth, have worked to instill in their own three children: Samantha, Matthew and Katie. In fact, Standerski has always tried to lead by example and that begins with maintaining an appropriate work/life balance.
While each leadership position has required a great deal of business travel, Standerski has always found a way to stay engaged with what’s going on at home.
“The kids were raised with me traveling a lot so they are somewhat accustomed to that,” he said. “But, technology is an amazing thing. If I’m not home to hug or kiss them goodnight, we make sure we talk via FaceTime or Skype. That allows me to still see their emotions and remain engaged in their lives.”
In November 2014, Standerski and his wife will celebrate their 23rd wedding anniversary. While the couple is looking forward to discovering life together on the East Coast, the memory of how their married life began always prompts a laugh.
“When I proposed to Mary Beth she told me that she would marry me if I promised to move back to Chicagoland in a couple of years,” he said, laughing. “Of course, I agreed, and we’ve been married for more than 22 years – all in Cedar Rapids until now.
“She has made a lot of sacrifices over the years, but she’s done a wonderful job with our family and has been incredibly supportive of me,” continued Standerski. “I wouldn’t be where I am today without her.”
