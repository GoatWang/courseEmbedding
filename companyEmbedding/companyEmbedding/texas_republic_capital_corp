TRLIC — Texas Republic Capital






















































Texas Republic Life Insurance











 On August 1, 2016 the Texas Department of Insurance issued TRLIC its Certificate of Authority. This approval grants TRLIC the ability to begin its insurance operations. At this time management is developing TRLIC’s initial life insurance products. We are designing products to:        Provide both living and death benefits to policy holders;        Provide competitive insurance products throughout our great State;        Be attractive to individuals, banks, small businesses, groups, and associations; and        Produce an attractive return to our shareholders.The State of Texas represents the 10th largest insurance market in the world. According to the latest TDI report in 2013, over $31,000,000,000 in life and annuity premiums were paid by Texas residents. Sadly, over 90% of these premiums were paid to companies located in other states or in foreign countries. We see this as a tremendous marketing opportunity for TRLIC. We believe that, given the chance, Texans would prefer to do business with a Texas company.Our management team and board of directors have over 100 years of combined insurance experience. With the strength of our experienced leadership and the continued assistance of our shareholders, we are confident we can build a tremendously successful life insurance company in Texas, by Texans!

About Us — Texas Republic Capital
















































About Texas Republic Capital Texas Republic Capital Corporation (TRCC) is an insurance holding company located in Austin, Texas. TRCC completed an intrastate public stock offering on April 2, 2017. Today, the company is owned by some of the top business, professional, and agricultural leaders across every region of the state. The company was formed for the purpose of creating and funding the newest life insurance subsidiary here in Texas, Texas Republic Life Insurance Company (TRLIC).On August 1, 2016, the Texas Department of Insurance issued Texas Republic Life Insurance Company’s Certificate of Authority. In April of 2017, TRLIC began marketing products in Texas. TRLIC currently markets a modified whole life product with a flexible premium annuity rider and two single premium deferred annuities.On February 1, 2017, TRCC formed Texas Republic Life Solutions (TRLS) as an additional service to our shareholders. TRLS will search other insurers for insurance solutions that are beyond the current abilities of TRLIC. This provides solutions that fulfill the best interests of our shareholders and those that they introduce to the growing TRCC family. Please visit texasrepubliclife.com to see how TRLS may be of benefit to you.The State of Texas represents the 10th largest insurance market in the world. According to the latest TDI report in 2015, over $32 Billion in life and annuity premiums were paid by Texas residents. Sadly, over 90% of these premiums were paid to companies located in other states or foreign countries. We see this as a tremendous marketing opportunity for TRLIC. We believe that, given the choice, Texans would prefer to do business with a Texas company.

Texas Republic Capital Corporation Registers $25,000,000 Offering
In Texas, By Texans, For Texans 


    
    AUSTIN, TX, June 10, 2014 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Texas Republic Capital Corporation (TRCC), an Austin, Texas, based insurance holding company, has registered a $25,000,000 intrastate public stock offering with the Texas Securities Board. TRCC was established in 2012, and has successfully raised over $10,300,000 in private placements across Texas. The shares are available to Texas residents through its Prospectus. TRCC is currently owned by over 500 shareholders. The company desires to spread the ownership of TRCC throughout Texas, into every county based on population. The company's goal is to complete the offering with over 5,000 shareholders. 

Texas is one of the largest markets in the country for life insurance with premiums over $31 billion paid by Texas residents in life and annuity premiums each year. However, over 91% of the premiums paid by Texas residents are paid to companies domiciled outside the state of Texas. 

TRCC is offering its stock only by means of a public offering prospectus, which is available from the company and discusses the company's plan of business and terms of the offering. The prospectus also notes specific risks involved in an investment in the company's stock, including lack of a liquid public market for shareholders to resell the company's stock and a consequent need to hold the stock for an indefinite period, and risks associated with investments in start-up insurance companies.

TRCC's executive management team and board of directors have over 100 years of combined insurance and securities experience. Tim Miller, TRCC's President and CEO, and Gregg Zahn, TRCC's Chairman, have built companies in the past using the same strategy as TRCC. Most recently is First Trinity Financial Corporation (FTFC), a Tulsa, Oklahoma, based insurance holding company, which successfully completed private placement and public stock offerings in Oklahoma totaling $26,475,000. The board of TRCC includes: 

- Pat Green- Country Music Recording Artist of Fort Worth, Texas
- Joe Mitchell- Entrepreneur of Glen Rose, Texas
- Steve Braley- Former Senior Director PGA of America of Tyler, Texas
- Adrian McDonald- Insurance Professional of Bryan, Texas
- J. Pete Laney- Attorney of Austin, Texas
- David Cleavinger- Farmer of Wildorado, Texas
- Ken Davis- Farmer/Rancher of Grandview, Texas
- Eric Sandberg- Texas Bankers Association of Austin, Texas
- Randy Bailey- Oil and Gas of Dallas, Texas
- Vernon Wolke- Retired Insurance Professional of Dallas, Texas# # #
