Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Ohio:













Does L 3 Communications Cincinnati Electronics Corporation carry a valid contracting license?



Ohio does not require contractors to be licensed to perform residential construction. However, Ohio does require a contractor to be licensed for commercial construction. 











How important is contractor licensing in Ohio?



Commercial contractors must pass a trade exam and prove continuous trade experience in order to become licensed in Ohio. Continuing education is required to renew all commercial contracting licenses. 











Your liability risk when hiring L 3 Communications Cincinnati Electronics Corporation



Commercial contractors are required to carry a general liability insurance policy. Although there is no requirement for residential construction, it is always a good idea to only hire contractors with both general liability and workers' compensation insurance. Request a current insurance certificate for both general liability and workers' compensation before any works starts. 











What else should I know before hiring L 3 Communications Cincinnati Electronics Corporation



Commercially licensed contractors in Ohio must provide tax records for the previous 5 years to be eligible for a license. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Ohio, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.
