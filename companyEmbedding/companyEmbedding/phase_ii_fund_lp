Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/28/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Welcome to 










































THE LATEST!



              April, 2017
              

              The Phase II hardness tester group has added a new ultrasonic portable hardness tester series, the PHT-6000. This model replaces our MET series portable hardness testers. The PHT-6000 ultrasonic portable hardness testers offer not only more advanced features, but offer a more comprehensive hardness tester system, with greater variety of UCI probes. Manual UCI probes include a 1, 2 5 and 10kg load. In addition,  now motorized probes are available with 0.3, 0.8 and 1kg loads for very thin and ultra fine surface hardness testing. A complete Ultrasonic portable hardness tester system is now available for greater variety of hardness tester applications. Bench hardness testers have also been added. A new Load cell driven,  Rockwell hardness tester 900-367,  with dolphin nose design has made the cut. This Rockwell hardness tester has a detached color touchscreen for easy operation. This model also comes standard with usb output and software, for a complete turnkey system. Watch out for a big sister twin model, Rockwell/Superficial Rockwell hardness tester, 900-387. This hardness tester is around the corner. Our latest and greatest, the 900-388 twin Rockwell-Superficial Rockwell hardness tester comes with a dolphin nose design, but the best part is the new motorized auto Z axis, hardness testing system. Just place your workpiece on the anvil, press a button and all aspects of the test will be completed with an unrivaled level of accuracy and high precision. Phase II has updated all Vickers and micro Vickers hardness tester software.
              

              In the world of surface roughness testers, Phase II has upgraded the battery on the SRG-4600 surface roughness testers. Watch for new surface roughness tester models coming before the end of 2017.
              

              The ultrasonic thickness gauge group is in the process of seeing software updates, as well as an update for the UTG-2800 ultrasonic thickness gauges.
              

Coating thickness gauges have seen Phase II discontinue the PTG-3525 coating thickness gauge model.
              

              2017 will bring more product variety, and a higher level of technology to our line of Material Testing Instruments. Finally, don’t forget to check out our instructional videos and subscribe to our YOUTUBE page, so you don’t miss any.

 Use of Fidelity sites 
The Fidelity Sites are intended only for your personal, non-commercial use, unless you and Fidelity have agreed otherwise in writing.
 
 Fidelity sites and companies

A listing of all Fidelity Entities, that provide content on the Fidelity Sites, is listed below.
Portions of certain Fidelity Sites are published or selected by Fidelity Interactive Content Services LLC ("FICS"). FICS is a company with main offices in New York, NY. FICS seeks to present objective news, information, data and guidance on personal finance and investment topics drawn from a diverse collection of sources including affiliated and non-affiliated financial services publications. Content drawn from FICS affiliated entities is marked and labeled as such. FICS selected and published content is not intended to provide tax, legal, insurance or investment advice and should not be construed as an offer to sell, a solicitation of an offer to buy, or a recommendation for any security by any Fidelity Entity or any third party. Certain tools published by FICS may provide general information and guidance based upon your personalized input. Securities quotes are delayed unless otherwise noted. FICS is owned by FMR LLC and is an affiliate of Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC, among others.

These services provide discretionary money management for a fee.
 
 Mutual funds 
You could lose money by investing in a money market fund. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Fidelity Investments and its affiliates, the fund’s sponsor, have no legal obligation to provide financial support to money market funds and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the fund at any time.
Before investing, consider the funds' investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.
 
 Life insurance and variable annuities 

Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the fund or annuity and its investment options. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.

Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC, Member NYSE, SIPC and/or Fidelity Insurance Agency, Inc., distribute fixed and variable insurance products issued by Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company, Empire Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company, New York, NY, and certain third party insurance companies, which are not affiliated with Fidelity Investments.
 
 Workplace savings plans 
Some of the funds and services described on the Fidelity Sites may not be available or appropriate in a workplace savings plan. Check with your employer for information on any investment restrictions associated with your 401(k), 401(a), 403(b), or 457 savings plan, or nonqualified deferred compensation plan at work. Or, if your workplace savings plan is already with Fidelity, call your toll-free retirement benefits line or log on to Fidelity NetBenefits® to find out more about the investment options available to you in your workplace savings plan.
If you hold Fidelity Advisor Fund assets outside of your employer-sponsored retirement plan, accounts with such assets are not included in the list of Fidelity accounts.
Company Stock Funds are not mutual funds and are unmanaged, non-diversified investment options. The value of your investment in the Company Stock Fund is affected by the performance of the company and the overall stock market, as well as the amount and performance of any short term investments held by the fund.
Managed Income Funds, Commingled Pools and individually managed options, such as Strategies, are not mutual funds. Although individual investment contracts purchased for a managed income fund are backed by the issuer of the debt, units of the fund are not guaranteed by the manager, Plan sponsor or insured by the FDIC.
A summary of the benefits provided under a workplace savings plan is contained in the Summary Plan Description for the plan. Full details are provided in the official plan document, which governs the operation of the plan. In the event that the content of a Fidelity Site or any oral representations made by any person regarding the plan conflict with or are inconsistent with the provisions of the governing plan document, the provisions of the governing plan documents are controlling. The information presented on a Fidelity Site is not intended to create, nor is it to be construed to create, a contract between (1) an employer or a Fidelity Entity and (2) any one of the employer’s employees or other plan participants. Each employer reserves the right to amend, modify, suspend, replace or terminate any of its plans, policies or programs, in whole or in part, including any level or form of coverage, by appropriate company action, without the consent or concurrence of persons affected.

The UNIQUE College Investing Plan, U.Fund College Investing Plan®, Delaware College Investment Plan, and the Fidelity Arizona resident College Savings Plan are offered by the State of New Hampshire, MEFA, the State of Delaware, and the Arizona Commission for Postsecondary Education, respectively, and managed by Fidelity. If you or the designated beneficiary are not a New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Delaware, or Arizona resident, you may want to consider, before investing, whether your state or the designated beneficiarys home state offers its residents a plan with alternate state tax advantages or other benefits.
Units of the College Savings Plan Portfolios are municipal securities and may be subject to market volatility and fluctuation.
Please carefully consider the Plan's investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses before investing. For this and other information on any 529 College Savings Plan managed by Fidelity, contact Fidelity for a free Fact Kit, or view online. Read it carefully before you invest or send money.
 
 Information for foreign investors 
The Fidelity Sites are intended to be made available only to individuals in the United States, and the information on the Fidelity Sites is only for such persons.

THE LATEST!



              April, 2017
              

              The Phase II hardness tester group has added a new ultrasonic portable hardness tester series, the PHT-6000. This model replaces our MET series portable hardness testers. The PHT-6000 ultrasonic portable hardness testers offer not only more advanced features, but offer a more comprehensive hardness tester system, with greater variety of UCI probes. Manual UCI probes include a 1, 2 5 and 10kg load. In addition,  now motorized probes are available with 0.3, 0.8 and 1kg loads for very thin and ultra fine surface hardness testing. A complete Ultrasonic portable hardness tester system is now available for greater variety of hardness tester applications. Bench hardness testers have also been added. A new Load cell driven,  Rockwell hardness tester 900-367,  with dolphin nose design has made the cut. This Rockwell hardness tester has a detached color touchscreen for easy operation. This model also comes standard with usb output and software, for a complete turnkey system. Watch out for a big sister twin model, Rockwell/Superficial Rockwell hardness tester, 900-387. This hardness tester is around the corner. Our latest and greatest, the 900-388 twin Rockwell-Superficial Rockwell hardness tester comes with a dolphin nose design, but the best part is the new motorized auto Z axis, hardness testing system. Just place your workpiece on the anvil, press a button and all aspects of the test will be completed with an unrivaled level of accuracy and high precision.

Aviragen Therapeutics, Inc., a biopharmaceutical company, focuses on the discovery and development of direct-acting antivirals to treat infections that have limited therapeutic options and affect patients worldwide. Its product candidates that are in clinical development includes Vapendavir, a potent antiviral capsid binder that is in Phase IIb SPIRITUS trials for human rhinovirus upper respiratory infections in moderate-to-severe asthmatics; BTA585, an oral fusion protein inhibitor, which is in Phase II development for the treatment and prevention of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections; and BTA074, an antiviral treatment that is in Phase II development for condyloma caused by human papillomavirus types 6 and 11. The company also has a preclinical RSV non-fusion inhibitor program. It has a research and license agreement with GlaxoSmithKline for the development and commercialization of zanamivir, a neuraminidase inhibitor (NI) to prevent and treat influenza; and collaboration and license agreement with Daiichi-Sankyo for the development of Laninamivir octanoate, an NI for the treatment of influenza. The company was formerly known as Biota Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and changed its name to Aviragen Therapeutics, Inc. in April 2016 to reflect the strategic shift from the organization's prior focus on drug discovery and early-stage licensing to clinical development of next generation direct-acting antivirals to treat infections. Aviragen Therapeutics, Inc. is headquartered in Alpharetta, Georgia.

About Environmental, Social & Governance Summary (ESG)



GMI ESG Ratings


GMI AGR® Score & Rating






GMI ESG Ratings
Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Flags:  GMI Ratings publishes Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) ratings on over 6,000 companies worldwide. These ratings provide an independent assessment of the sustainable investment value of public companies.  The ESG Ratings model is based on a carefully crafted and applied list of KeyMetrics® that result in an overall ESG concern level as expressed by Red (High Concern), Yellow (Average Concern), and Green (Low Concern) flags.  Unlike traditional ESG risk models, GMI's rating methodology is designed to identify risks most likely to affect equity valuations. Specifically, these ratings reflect actual corporate behaviors rather than policies or affirmations of intent to adhere to best ESG practices. Further, unlike other models with evenly weighted metrics, we assign context-sensitive relative weightings to our key metrics, based on market, regional, ownership or sector differences.  Individual company scores are then assigned as a percentile rank, ranging from 1 (worst ranked) to 100 (best) on the basis of these KeyMetrics® and then converted to the Red, Yellow or Green flag designation.
Company Reports:  In addition to a company's overall risk rating, ESG reports also include an industry rating based on a comparison between the company's risk levels in each ESG component area relative to its industry peers.  Further, the ESG analysis serves as a summary of behavioral events that contributed to the company's overall risk level.

 More About GMI



GMI Accounting and Governance Risk (AGR) Score & Rating
The GMI Accounting and Governance Risk (AGR) Score & Rating is widely recognized as an indicator of the confidence level surrounding a company's management and reported financials.
Scores range from 0 to 100, and correspond to a risk classification for each company ranging from "Very Aggressive" to "Conservative." The AGR Score is a percentile ranking among the approximately 8,000 companies rated by GMI. Through continued back-testing, GMI has demonstrated a strong correlation between its quarterly AGR Score and the likelihood of adverse events, including securities class action litigation, financial restatements, regulatory enforcement actions, and stock price declines.
				Thus, a company's AGR Score can help investors looking to manage risk or enhance investment performance. GMI forensically analyzes the financial reporting and governance practices of over 8,000 North American-based publicly traded companies.
About GMI
GMI is an independent risk research firm which provides a statistically modeled assessment of corporate integrity. Founded in 2002 in direct response to the growing number of scandals, lawsuits and investor losses resulting from fraudulent corporate behavior, the firm identifies potential high-risk company accounting and governance activity, which in turn has been historically correlated to stock price declines, securities class-action litigation, and material financial restatements. The product of GMI's analysis is a unique risk measure - the AGR Score which can be used by investors as a way to more effectively manage corporate risk.

† The Equity Summary Score provided by Thomson Reuters StarMine is current as of the date specified.  There may be differences between the Equity Summary Score analyst count and the number of underlying analysts listed.  Due to the timing in receiving ratings changes into the Equity Summary Score model, the Equity Summary Score analyst count may lag the ratings count displayed by one or more days.  There may also be analyst count variations for symbols with multiple share classes and ADRs.  More details on Equity Summary Score calculation are included in the Understanding and Using the Equity Summary Score Methodology (PDF).As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.  Royalty trusts may have special tax treatment, so you should consult a tax advisor on the potential tax consequences of investing in them.News, commentary and events are from third-party sources unaffiliated with Fidelity.

We have practice groups specializing in various institutions, markets, and practices, which allows us to offer a multidisciplinary approach tailored to that particular sector’s needs. Furthermore, Partner provides each client a Relationship Manager and a Technical Project Manager who are 100% responsible for understanding that client’s nuanced goals and technical requirements.
