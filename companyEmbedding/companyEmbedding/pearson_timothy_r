Description

                    The New York Times and USA Today Bestseller! Reinvent your marketing to keep up with an ever-changing marketplace "A must-read for any business leader or marketer. It explains how brands must be true to their essence and be reinvented to remain relevant in this radically changed, information-rich, and Internet-oriented world." --Robert Hanson, President, Global Levi's(R) Brand, Levis Strauss & Co. "Pearson makes the clearest statement yet about the new world of marketing, as he makes the difficult and complex concepts of brands and reinvention understandable to everyone." --Bob Jeffrey, CEO, JWT "When it comes to global brands, Pearson has no peers. His understanding of how companies and enterprises that breakaway from their competitors and reinvent their businesses will inherit the next era of global commerce is revolutionary." --Michel Recalt, Director of Marketing and Brand Strategy, LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton "The Old Rules of Marketing are Dead presents a new reality: marketing must be reinvented if it is to remain relevant by placing a premium on business acumen, strategy and communications." --MaryLee Sachs, Chairman U.S., Hill & Knowlton "Pearson has distilled 27 years of business experience into a book that shows the old ways of marketing have been replaced by new more up-to-date approaches and concepts to reinvent businesses and brands--and drive profitable sales." --Stephen G. Butler, retired Chairman / CEO, KPMG International / KPMG LLP "Tim Pearson's name is synonymous with strategy, value-proposition development, and marketing. From now on, it will be synonymous with reinvention and the new 'do or die' rules of business." --Mark A. Emkes, retired Chairman, CEO and President, Bridgestone Americas "Every leader and company director must learn the fundamental rules and principles of reinvention that will bring marketing into the 21st century. Reinvention must be the byword for this post-Great Recession era and the changes it requires that will make companies and businesses of all sizes great." --R. David Hoover, Chairman, President and CEO, Ball Corporation About the Book:  Revolutionary new technologies developed over the past decade have completely changed the way humans communicate and transact business. Not exactly late-breaking news for most people of the world . . . except for those who are supposed to be marketing to them. While consumers, customers, and marketplaces have adapted to these new realities, most marketers have not. Renowned marketing expert Tim Pearson explains why you need to sever your ties to the comfortable old ways of marketing--and bring your company's marketing into the twenty-first century. Too many marketers still operate as if strategy necessarily depends upon predetermined budgets; advertising is the catch-all to every problem; and marketing results can't be measured. It all adds up to the age-old belief that marketing is an art, not a science--which couldn't be further from the truth. The Old Rules of Marketing Are Dead is a road map for breaking out of old, established--and increasingly ineffective--routines and reinventing your organization's marketing by:  Positioning marketing as a business partner--not as a tool for meeting a strategic objective Holding marketing accountable for results with the application of hard data-- not vague qualitative measurements Providing leadership within your organization--not following the direction of everyone else From research frameworks and concept development to planning, budgeting, media placement, and program implementation, marketers have not kept up--to the detriment of themselves and their companies. Completely revamping old-school marketing is the only way to drive profitable sales, create growing brands, and increase market share in today's post-Great Recession business landscape. Pearson calls for nothing short of a marketing revolution. You must throw out almost everything you hold dear and embrace technology, a new role in business, and real accountability. The Old Rules of Marketing Are Dead has what you need to reinvent your products, your services--and your future.show more

Title: 
               Company: Vrettos Pappas Consulting Engineers
Job Details
               Vrettos Pappas Consulting Engineers was founded in February of 2003, by Kosta J. Pappas, Nicholas C. Vrettos and Dino M. Pappas, with the purpose of providing consulting services to clients interested in constructing new buildings, renovating old buildings, up-fitting existing building and tenant spaces, upgrading existing engineered building systems or analyzing existing building systems. It is VP's primary goal to cultivate and grow relationships with its clients. This is achieved through quality work and communication. The most common complaints of clients are as follows: Project due dates are missed and lack of response by the Engineer. Vrettos Pappas Consulting Engineers' business ideology is developed with these two concerns in mind. The simple reason due dates are ever missed in the engineering field is the lack of realistic planning and communication. The engineer, the architect or the owner can all attribute to this. The goal of VP is for this to never be due to the lack of planning and communication by the engineer. For VP, it will be unacceptable for any project to be late. This ideology is believed by the three principals and is the foundation by which this company was founded. This same mentality will also transcend to customer relations. Clients require a quick response from their engineers. With this thought in mind, VP's principals will have intimate and hands on knowledge of every project. Unlike other engineering firms, the sealing engineer will actually design and engineer the systems. This will allow for any question about the design to be answered quickly and accurately. VP will not allow any question or concern of any client to go unanswered. Prompt and courteous service is always a necessity. Vrettos Pappas Consulting Engineers puts forth the extra effort required to meet the engineering goals and expectations of its clients, while maintaining its engineering ethics. It is the fundamental principle of VP to provide a good and competent design with great customer service.

The table below summarizes the publications plotted on the Map of Science. Each row corresponds to a 
(sub)discipline on the map

The # of pubs. column shows how many of the publications were mapped to each (sub)discipline. This count can be 
fractional because some publication venues are associated with more than one (sub)discipline. Each publication 
in such a venue contributes fractionally to all associated (sub)disciplines according to a weighting scheme.

The % of activity column shows what proportion of the publications were mapped to each (sub)discipline.



This visualization is based on the publications we were able to 'science locate' for Pearson, Timothy R., and 
therefore it may not be fully representative of the overall publication activity for Pearson, Timothy R..

The publication coverage of this visualization can be improved by including more publication data in the VIVO 
system, and by ensuring that each publication in the VIVO system is associated with a journal that the Map of 
Science recognizes (based on the holdings of Thomson's ISI database and Elsevier's Scopus database). Journal 
names containing typos or other idiosyncrasies may need to be cleaned up before they are recognized. You may 
contact a VIVO system administrator if publication coverage is a concern.

JOIN THE LISTClickFIND A STORENight Reflections: A True Story Of Friendship, Love, Cancer, And Survivalby Winn, Robert T., M.D./ Pearson, Timothy R. (Con)"Life was great for Dr. Robert Winn, medical director of Deer Valley and The Canyons in Park City, and his wife Nancy.  But when, seemingly out of the blue, Nancy was diagnosed with an aggressive form of Leukemia, their world went tumbling and careening out of control. Because Dr. Winn could not speak of Nancy's illness without beginning to cry, he started the daily ritual of sending emails to friends and family to provide updates on Nancy's condition. An elegant and introspective writer, and medical expert, these letters have been compiled and edited to create an inspirational story of treatment, courage, love, devotion, struggles, and ultimately triumph over this deadly disease. A story that will help cancer victims, their loved ones, caregivers, and the medical community alike find the courage fight the deadly disease of cancer"--Women's Health, CancerCondition: Used - GoodHPB condition ratingsNew: Item is brand new, unused and unmarked, in flawless condition.Fine/Like New (F): No defects, little usage.
