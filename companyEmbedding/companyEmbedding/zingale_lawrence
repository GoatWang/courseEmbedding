THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY. THIS AGREEMENT DESCRIBES THE BASIC LEGAL
AND ETHICAL RESPONSIBILITIES THAT YOU ARE REQUIRED TO OBSERVE AS AN
EXECUTIVE EXPOSED TO HIGHLY SENSITIVE TECHNOLOGY AND STRATEGIC
INFORMATION. CONSULT WITH YOUR LEGAL COUNSEL IF ALL THE TERMS AND
PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT ARE NOT FULLY UNDERSTOOD BY
YOU.


          THIS
AGREEMENT is made as of the 3rd day of January, 2006, by and
between SYKES ENTERPRISES, INCORPORATED, a Florida corporation (the
“Company”), and LAWRENCE ZINGALE (the
“Executive”).



W I T N E S S E T H
:


          WHEREAS,
the Company desires to assure itself of the Executive’s
continued employment in an executive capacity; and


          WHEREAS,
the Executive desires to be employed by the Company on the terms
and conditions hereinafter set forth.


          NOW,
THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements
of the parties contained herein, and other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby
acknowledged, the parties hereto covenant and agree as
follows:


     1. EMPLOYMENT
AND DUTIES . Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the Company shall employ the Executive during the Term
(as hereinafter defined) in such executive management capacities as
may be designated from time to time by the Company’s Chief
Executive Officer and/or the Chief Executive Officer’s
designee. The Executive accepts such employment and agrees to
devote his/her best efforts and entire business time, skill, labor,
and attention to the performance of such duties. The Executive
agrees to promptly provide a description of any other material
commercial duties or pursuits engaged in by the Executive to the
Company’s Chief Executive Officer. If the Company’s
Chief Executive Officer determines in good faith that such
activities conflict with the Executive’s performance of
his/her duties hereunder, the Chief Executive Officer shall notify
Executive within thirty (30) days and the Executive shall
promptly cease such activities to the extent as directed by the
Chief Executive Officer. If the Chief Executive Officer does not
provide such notice, Executive shall be free to engage in such
commercial duties or pursuits. It is acknowledged and agreed that
such description shall be made regarding any such activities in
which the Executive owns more than 5% of the ownership of the
organization or which may be in violation of Section 5 hereof,
and that the intentional failure of the Executive to provide any
such description shall enable the Company to terminate the
Executive for Cause (as provided in Section 7(c) hereof). The
Company agrees to hold any such information provided by the
Executive confidential and not disclose the same to any person
other than a person to whom disclosure is reasonably necessary or
appropriate in light of the circumstances. In addition, the
Executive agrees to serve without

compensation if elected or appointed to any office or position,
including as a director, of the Company or any subsidiary or
affiliate of the Company; provided, however, that the Executive

Company in connection with such service.


     2. 
TERM . Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, including, but not limited to, the provisions for
termination set forth in Section 7 hereof, the employment of
the Executive under this Agreement shall commence on the effective
date hereof and shall continue until terminated as provided herein
(such term shall herein be defined as the “Term”). The
Executive agrees that some portions of this Agreement, including
the Sections entitled “Confidential Information,”
“Covenant Not-To-Compete And No Solicitation,”
“Termination,” and “Arbitration of
Disputes,” will remain in force after the termination of this
Agreement.

and Bonus. As compensation for the Executive’s services under
this Agreement, the Executive shall receive and the Company shall
pay a weekly base salary set forth on Exhibit “A”. Such
base salary may be increased but not decreased during the Term in
the Company’s discretion based upon the Executive’s
performance and any other factors the Company deems relevant. Such
base salary shall be payable in accordance with the policy then
prevailing for the Company’s executives. In addition to such
base salary, the Executive shall be entitled during the Term to a
performance bonus and shall be eligible to participate in and
receive payments or awards from all other bonus and other incentive
compensation, stock option and restricted stock plans as may be
adopted by the Company, all as determined by the Compensation

on Exhibit “B” attached hereto.


     (b) Payments. All
amounts paid pursuant to this Agreement shall be subject to

if any, and comparable laws and regulations.


     (c) Other
Benefits. The Executive shall be reimbursed by the Company for all
reasonable and customary travel and other business expenses
incurred by the Executive in the performance of the
Executive’s duties hereunder in accordance with the
Company’s standard policy regarding expense verification
practices. The Executive shall be entitled to that number of weeks
paid vacation per year that is available to other executive

as may be set forth on Exhibit “A” and shall be
eligible to participate in such pension, life insurance, health
insurance, disability insurance, and other executive benefits

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.


     (a) The Executive

without limitation, confidential information with respect to the
Company’s technical data, research and development projects,
methods, products, software, financial data, business plans,
financial plans, customer lists, business methodology, processes,
production methods and techniques, promotional materials and
information, and other similar matters treated by the Company as
confidential (the “Confidential Information”).
Accordingly, the Executive covenants and agrees that during the
Executive’s employment by the Company (whether during the
Term hereof or otherwise) and thereafter, the Executive shall not,
without the prior written consent of the Company, disclose to any
person, other than a person to whom disclosure is reasonably
necessary or appropriate in connection with the performance by the
Executive of the Executive’s duties hereunder, any
Confidential Information obtained by the Executive while in the
employ of the Company.


     (b) The Executive
agrees that all memoranda; notes; records; papers or other
documents; computer disks; computer, video or audio tapes; CD-ROMs;
all other media and all copies thereof relating to the
Company’s operations or business, some of which may be
prepared by the Executive; and all objects associated therewith in
any way obtained by the Executive shall be the Company’s
property. This shall include, but is not limited to, documents;
computer disks; computer, video and audio tapes; CD-ROMs; all other
media and objects concerning any technical data, methods, products,
software, research and development projects, financial data,
financial plans, business plans, customer lists, contracts, price
lists, manuals, mailing lists, advertising materials; and all other
materials and records of any kind that may be in the
Executive’s possession or under the Executive’s
control. The Executive shall not, except for the Company’s
use, copy or duplicate any of the aforementioned documents or
objects, nor remove them from the Company’s facilities, nor
use any information concerning them except for the Company’s
benefit, either during the Executive’s employment or
thereafter. The Executive covenants and agrees that the Executive
will deliver all of the aforementioned documents and objects, if
any, that may be in the Executive’s possession to the Company
upon termination of the Executive’s employment, or at any
other time at the Company’s request.


     (c) In any action
to enforce or challenge these Confidential Information provisions,
the prevailing party is entitled to recover his or its reasonable
attorney’s fees and costs.


     5. 
COVENANT NOT-TO-COMPETE AND NO SOLICITATION. Executive
recognizes that the Company is in the business of employing
individuals to provide specialized and technical services to the
Company’s Clients. The purpose of these Covenant
Not-to-Compete and No Solicitation provisions are to protect the
relationship which exists between the Company and its Clients while
Executive is employed and after Executive leaves the employ of the
Company. The consideration for these Covenant Not-to-Compete and No
Solicitation provisions is the Executive’s employment with
the Company.

An employment agreement is a document which delineates the terms of the relationship between an employer and employee. If you are hiring a new employee, this document can help form a solid foundation for your business relationship. The document will specify expectations for both parties and may include items such as terms of conduct, employee benefits, vacation time, medical leave, hours, and other issues that may be up for consideration, depending on the business' needs.

An employment agreement might also incorporate arbitration conditions, confidentiality terms and non-compete clauses, provided that separate documents do not address these issues. Some employers may include a progressive disciplinary policy section in the agreement, wherein conditions and repercussions for employee misconduct are explained.

Once signed, an employment agreement is a legally binding contract that can be enforced in a court of law. Often an employer or company makes their offer of employment contingent on an employee signing the agreement.
