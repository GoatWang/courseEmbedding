Scroll to TopThe Exchange ETP Insights | ETFsHartford Funds' Ted Lucas and Darek WojnarDiscuss Exchange Traded FundsInterview Highlights
TED LUCASHead of Systematic Strategies and ETFsHartford Funds
Why is today an important day for Hartford Funds and its clients?It’s an important day. We’re actually gathered here today to recognize the launch of the 5th installment of a series of smart beta ETFs, which is risk-optimized US REITs - RORE.We think that this strategy complements the strategies that we’ve already launched that cover the global equity opportunity set and provide a new tool for investors and clients of Hartford Funds to access real estate in a risk-first way.
Tell us about Hartford Funds’ ETF platform.Hartford Funds already has a great line up of high active share strategies for its clients, delivered in mutual fund form.The idea here is to provide clients of Hartford Funds a wider set of tools to adapt to their portfolios for particular outcome objectives that they have.The strategic beta ETF, the one that’s launching today, the ones that already exist – again – expand the array of solutions that advisors can access through Hartford Funds.
What is distinctive about Hartford Funds' ETFs?Hartford Funds ETFs use a multi-factor approach and provide a variety of different solutions pinpointing a multi-factor discipline to cover different markets.What we believe makes our ETFs unique is that we take a risk-first approach to constructing the strategies themselves.So not only are we seeking to have enhanced return potential by having risk factors expressed, but also we seek to embody defensive characteristics by having greater diversification on multiple levels in the portfolio.
Can you tell us about the strategy around launching?I’d love to. Risk-optimized real estate is a strategy that invests in a wide universe of REITs that are available in the U.S. When you’re looking at the market, there are about 150 companies that are investable. But what we typically find in most REIT strategies and REIT capitalization-weighted indexes is high concentration in a handful of individual REITs.So this strategy seeks to enhance diversification and access the broader opportunity set while at the same time, focus on deploying capital to companies that have a combination of attractive attributes in terms of their valuation, their quality and growth characteristics, and their momentum.We’re very excited to be at the New York Stock Exchange – it’s a great institution. And of course, being the first ETF launch since we’ve become part of the Hartford Funds family is also very special.
What are your plans for the future in regards to your strategic beta ETF capabilities?We’re very excited to be part of the Hartford Funds family as of about two months ago…so right now the existing solution set covering all equity markets, as well as real estate, that’s really the departure point to bring those solutions to a wider set of clients.



DAREK WOJNAR
  Head of Exchange-Traded Funds
  Hartford Funds
Why is today an important day for Hartford Funds and its clients?
  This is the first time we’re introducing a new ETF to the marketplace under the Hartford Funds umbrella after being acquired two months ago.
And we’re looking forward to serving clients with a broader set up of investment products.
Tell us about Hartford Funds’ ETF platform.
ETFs in general are transparent and certainly bring to investors many benefits, starting with transparency, cost benefits and tax advantages.
But in particular strategic beta ETFs bring to investors opportunities to participate in growth in an environment that is challenging.  And we’re very excited to contribute good solutions to clients.
What is distinctive about Hartford Funds’ ETFs?
  Hartford Funds ETFs start with risk as a first consideration, then afterwards we select securities based on valuation characteristics, momentum and quality characteristics.
All of those contribute to a multi-factor design that considers risk, and that’s a very unique, distinct element.
What are your plans for the future in regards to your strategic beta ETF capabilities?
We’re very excited and look forward to the opportunity to serve more clients better. We take the view of ultimately believing that we can design products only when we have in mind the ultimate goal which is the objectives of clients to build their portfolios with risk considerations that they appreciate.
We’re going to focus on that and we’re going to continue serving our clients.VideoHartford Funds on the Trading FloorListen to Ted Lucas and Darek Wojnar of Hartford Funds Discuss Exchange Traded FundsWatch Now

Pursuant to rule 0-5 under the Act, hearing requests should state the nature of the writer's interest, any facts bearing upon the desirability of a hearing on the matter, the reason for the request, and the issues contested. Persons who wish to be notified of a hearing may request notification by writing to the Commission's Secretary.

Any order granting the requested relief would be subject to the terms and conditions stated in the application.
2. Each Fund will consist of a portfolio of securities and other assets and investment positions (“Portfolio Instruments”). Each Fund will disclose on its Web site the identities and quantities of the Portfolio Instruments that will form the basis for the Fund's calculation of NAV at the end of the day.
3. Shares will be purchased and redeemed in Creation Units and generally on an in-kind basis. Except where the purchase or redemption will include cash under the limited circumstances specified in the application, purchasers will be required to purchase Creation Units by depositing specified instruments (“Deposit Instruments”), and shareholders redeeming their shares will receive specified instruments (“Redemption Instruments”). The Deposit Instruments and the Redemption Instruments will each correspond pro rata to the positions in the Fund's portfolio (including cash positions) except as specified in the application.
4. Because shares will not be individually redeemable, applicants request an exemption from section 5(a)(1) and section 2(a)(32) of the Act that would permit the Funds to register as open-end management investment companies and issue shares that are redeemable in Creation Units only.
5. Applicants also request an exemption from section 22(d) of the Act and rule 22c-1 under the Act as secondary market trading in shares will take place at negotiated prices, not at a current offering price described in a Fund's prospectus, and not at a price based on NAV. Applicants state that (a) secondary market trading in shares does not involve a Fund as a party and will not result in dilution of an investment in shares, and (b) to the extent different prices exist during a given trading day, or from day to day, such variances occur as a result of third-party market forces, such as supply and demand. Therefore, applicants assert that secondary market transactions in shares will not lead to discrimination or preferential treatment among purchasers. Finally, applicants represent that share market prices will be disciplined by arbitrage opportunities, which should prevent shares from trading at a material discount or premium from NAV.
6. With respect to Funds that hold non-U.S. Portfolio Instruments and that effect creations and redemptions of Creation Units in kind, applicants request relief from the requirement imposed by section 22(e) in order to allow such Funds to pay redemption proceeds within fifteen calendar days following the tender of Creation Units for redemption. Applicants assert that the requested relief would not be inconsistent with the spirit and intent of section 22(e) to prevent unreasonable, undisclosed or unforeseen delays in the actual payment of redemption proceeds.
7. Applicants request an exemption to permit Funds of Funds to acquire Fund Start Printed Page 3058shares beyond the limits of section 12(d)(1)(A) of the Act; and the Funds, and any principal underwriter for the Funds, and/or any broker or dealer registered under the Exchange Act, to sell shares to Funds of Funds beyond the limits of section 12(d)(1)(B) of the Act. The application's terms and conditions are designed to, among other things, help prevent any potential (i) undue influence over a Fund through control or voting power, or in connection with certain services, transactions, and underwritings, (ii) excessive layering of fees, and (iii) overly complex fund structures, which are the concerns underlying the limits in sections 12(d)(1)(A) and (B) of the Act.
8. Applicants request an exemption from sections 17(a)(1) and 17(a)(2) of the Act to permit persons that are Affiliated Persons, or Second-Tier Affiliates, of the Funds, solely by virtue of certain ownership interests, to effectuate purchases and redemptions in-kind. The deposit procedures for in-kind purchases of Creation Units and the redemption procedures for in-kind redemptions of Creation Units will be the same for all purchases and redemptions and Deposit Instruments and Redemption Instruments will be valued in the same manner as those Portfolio Instruments currently held by the Funds. Applicants also seek relief from the prohibitions on affiliated transactions in section 17(a) to permit a Fund to sell its shares to and redeem its shares from a Fund of Funds, and to engage in the accompanying in-kind transactions with the Fund of Funds.[2] 
           The purchase of Creation Units by a Fund of Funds directly from a Fund will be accomplished in accordance with the policies of the Fund of Funds and will be based on the NAVs of the Funds.
9. Applicants also request relief to permit a Feeder Fund to acquire shares of another registered investment company managed by the Adviser having substantially the same investment objectives as the Feeder Fund (“Master Fund”) beyond the limitations in section 12(d)(1)(A) and permit the Master Fund, and any principal underwriter for the Master Fund, to sell shares of the Master Fund to the Feeder Fund beyond the limitations in section 12(d)(1)(B).
10. Section 6(c) of the Act permits the Commission to exempt any persons or transactions from any provision of the Act if such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Section 12(d)(1)(J) of the Act provides that the Commission may exempt any person, security, or transaction, or any class or classes of persons, securities, or transactions, from any provision of section 12(d)(1) if the exemption is consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors. Section 17(b) of the Act authorizes the Commission to grant an order permitting a transaction otherwise prohibited by section 17(a) if it finds that (a) the terms of the proposed transaction are fair and reasonable and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned; (b) the proposed transaction is consistent with the policies of each registered investment company involved; and (c) the proposed transaction is consistent with the general purposes of the Act.

1.
     Applicants request that the order apply to the initial Fund, as well as to future series of the Trust and any future open-end management investment companies or series thereof (each, included in the term “Fund”), each of which will operate as an actively-managed ETF. Any Fund will (a) be advised by the Initial Adviser or an entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Initial Adviser (each, an “Adviser”) and (b) comply with the terms and conditions of the application.

2.
     The requested relief would apply to direct sales of shares in Creation Units by a Fund to a Fund of Funds and redemptions of those shares. Applicants, moreover, are not seeking relief from section 17(a) for, and the requested relief will not apply to, transactions where a Fund could be deemed an Affiliated Person, or a Second-Tier Affiliate, of a Fund of Funds because an Adviser or an entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with an Adviser provides investment advisory services to that Fund of Funds.

Hartford Funds Launches US-Focused Real Estate ETF












Hartford Funds Launches US-Focused Real Estate ETF













Media Contact:
 Robin Pertusi
 (212) 279-3115 x254
rpertusi@prosek.com































Radnor, Penn. – October 4, 2016 – Hartford Funds today has expanded its suite of strategic beta* exchange-traded funds ("ETFs") with the launch of the industry’s first US-focused real estate investment trust ("REIT") ETF to apply the innovations of risk-first investment design with a multifactor approach (Ticker: RORE). RORE seeks to provide investment results that, before fees and expenses, correspond to the total return performance of the Lattice Risk-Optimized Real Estate Strategy Index (Bloomberg Ticker: LROREX), which tracks the performance of publicly traded real estate investment trusts.
"The launch of RORE is a natural extension of Hartford Funds’ strategic beta ETF platform," said Darek Wojnar, Head of Exchange-Traded Funds at Hartford Funds. "The strategy focuses exclusively on REITs and may be a compelling solution for investors interested in taking advantage of the growing opportunities in the real estate sector."
RORE seeks to track an index which is designed to capture the income and growth potential of investing within the U.S. REIT universe. The strategy selects equity securities of REITs exhibiting a favorable combination of factor characteristics, including quality, momentum, and value. RORE is the first ETF launched by Hartford Funds since the firm acquired Lattice Strategies just over 60 days ago.
"Hartford Funds’ latest strategic beta ETF allows us to offer even broader options for building investment portfolios that reflects clients’ needs, risk tolerances and life goals," said Vern Meyer, Chief Investment Officer of Hartford Funds. "Our expanded capabilities cater to investors interested in a mix of high-active share mutual funds and complementary strategic beta ETFs."
Hartford Funds will ring the closing bell on the NYSE today to commence the launch of its newest offering.
*Strategic beta refers to investment strategies that emphasize the use of alternative weighting schemes to traditional market capitalization-based indexes.





About Hartford Funds
Founded in 1996, Hartford Funds is a leading provider of mutual funds and 529 college savings plans. Using its human-centric investing approach, Hartford Funds creates strategies and tools designed to address the needs and wants of investors. Leveraging partnerships with MIT AgeLab and leading practice management experts, Hartford Funds delivers insight into the latest demographic trends and investor behavior.
As of October 4, 2016, the firm’s line-up includes more than 45 mutual funds in a variety of styles and asset classes, and five strategic beta ETFs. Its mutual funds (with the exception of certain fund of funds) are sub-advised by Wellington Management, one of the nation’s oldest and largest institutional fund management groups. The strategic beta ETFs offered by Hartford Funds are designed to help address investors’ evolving needs by leveraging a unique risk-optimized approach, which identifies risks within each asset class and then deliberately and systematically re-allocates capital toward risks more likely to enhance return potential. Hartford Funds has mutual fund assets under management of $74.9 billion as of June 30, 2016 (excluding assets used in certain annuity products). For more information about our investment family, visit www.hartfordfunds.com.











 
The MIT AgeLab is not an affiliate or subsidiary of Hartford Funds. 
All investments are subject to risk, including the possible loss of principal. One cannot invest directly in an index. 
A concentration in real estate securities, such as REITs, may subject the Fund to risks associated with the direct ownership of real estate as well as the risks related to the way real estate companies are organized and operated. Real estate is sensitive to changes in interest rates and general and local economic conditions and developments. A non-diversified fund may be more exposed to the risks associated with single issuers than a diversified fund. 
Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of a fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the fund’s prospectus, which should be read carefully before investing. To obtain a mutual fund prospectus or summary prospectus, please call 888-843-7824 (retail) or 800-279-1541 (institutional); ETF prospectuses can be obtained by calling 415-315-6600.
Hartford Funds refers to Hartford Funds Management Group, Inc., and its subsidiaries, including the mutual funds’ investment manager, Hartford Funds Management Company, LLC (“HFMC”) and the mutual funds’ distributor, Hartford Funds Distributors, LLC, as well as Lattice Strategies LLC (“Lattice”), a wholly owned subsidiary of HFMC effective July 29, 2016. Lattice is the investment adviser to the exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The ETFs are distributed by ALPS Distributors, Inc., which is not affiliated with Lattice or Hartford Funds. “The Hartford” is The Hartford Financial Services Group Inc. and its subsidiaries. Hartford Funds Distributors, LLC is a subsidiary of The Hartford Financial Services Group Inc.
