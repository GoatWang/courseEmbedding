History[edit]
In 2009, Mak Kwai-pui, formerly a chef of three-Michelin-starred restaurant Lung King Heen, opened a 20-seater dim sum restaurant in Mongkok.[3][4] Tim Ho Wan would eventually earn a Michelin star of its own in the 2010 Hong Kong and Macau Guide, a distinction which some have stated was a move in response to the criticism that the Michelin Guide was "elitist" and "out of touch with local tastes."[5] In 2015, its Sham Shui Po, North Point and Tai Kok Tsui branches had all received one Michelin star.[6] Since then, the restaurant has been dubbed as "the world's cheapest Michelin-star restaurant."[7][8]
Expansion[edit]
From its original Mongkok location, five additional branches were opened in Hong Kong; Sham Shui Po, Central, North Point, Tai Kok Tsui and Tseung Kwan O. In 2013, the original Mongkok branch relocated to Olympian City due to an increase in rent.[4]

Tim Ho Wan began expanding overseas in 2013, with the opening of its first international location in Singapore's Plaza Singapura.[9] It also expanded to the Philippines in 2014 with the opening of a branch at SM Megamall in Metro Manila[10] and in Australia the following year with the opening of a branch in Chatswood and subsequently in Westfield Sydney and 580 George Street. Another branch opened in Jakarta at the end of March 2015. The chain also has branches in Taipei, Kaohsiung, Taichung, Hanoi and Kuala Lumpur,[11] Bangkok (opened in August 2015), Nakorn Ratchasima (opened December 2016), and New York City (opened December 2016).[12][13]

2012 Press ReleasesRealNetworks Names Tim Wan as Chief Financial Officer
Seattle, WA—April 2, 2012—RealNetworks Inc. (Nasdaq: RNWK) today announced the appointment of Tim M. Wan as Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, effective April 18, 2012. Wan, a 12-year veteran of RealNetworks, most recently served as the company's vice president of finance. He replaces Michael Eggers, who announced his resignation earlier this year.
"After a thorough internal and external search, we are very pleased to promote Tim — a seasoned RealNetworks veteran — to the position of Chief Financial Officer," said Thomas Nielsen, chief executive officer and president of RealNetworks. "He knows RealNetworks' business inside and out, has demonstrated superb leadership in driving our strategic planning and has developed a world-class finance organization. We are indeed fortunate to have him step into this role as we continue on our path toward creating RealNetworks 2.0."
As vice president of finance, Wan, 41, was responsible for budgeting, financial planning and analysis, SEC reporting and accounting. In addition, Tim has been involved in numerous transactions from the acquisition of WiderThan to the formation and separation of Rhapsody. Before joining the finance organization, he served as general manager of business planning for RealNetworks' consumer division, helping launch RealNetworks SuperPass as well as its music and games businesses.
Prior to joining RealNetworks, Tim was with JP Morgan Chase as a management development associate and later as a relationship manager in the Private Banking Group. He has a B.A. in Economics from University of California, Los Angeles, and a MBA from the University of Southern California.

CIM Products


CIM Industries´ high performance coatings and linings form a continuous elastomeric coating able to withstand water and most chemical solutions.
Two liquid components are mixed on a job site just prior to cold application by squeegee, roller, trowel or sprayer and the liquid cures quickly to form a seamless polyurethane coating with tremendous strength and flexibility. Developed by Chevron in the early 1970’s, these remarkable materials are manufactured by C.I.M. Industries Inc. using the same industrial proven technology.

Hi,AFAIK, you can go to www.cisco.com and chose "Register" link (upper right corner on the main page).Then you fill the form (including chosing your login ID and password) and get a basic access to the Cisco web pages.You should ask your Cisco reseller to provide you with a PICA code.Then you can update your user profile  "Register for Additional Access" section and get additional rights (download IOS, e.g.).BR,Milan

The Partner should actually provide you with a smartnet ID if you bought a service contractr along with the router.With this ID you can get additional access like IOS downloads etc in CCONarayan

Is Tim Ho Wan the best dim sum in the world?!




 





Asia Comfort Food First World Topics Restaurant Reviews Taipei Taiwan World RegionJuly 19, 2017Is Tim Ho Wan the best dim sum in the world?!By To Live And Dine 




Tim Ho Wan is the best dim sum restaurant in the world.  It has a Michelin star in Hong Kong, but this is the Taipei location without a Michelin star.  



The only other Chinese “brunch” restaurant with a Michelin star is Din Tai Fung.  However, the Tim Ho Wan and Din Tai Fung Taipei locations aren’t rated by the Michelin Guide.  Who really gives a flying fuck though?   What true foodies want to know is whether the food is consistent and good?  Right?
Restaurant sign
By chance, I stumbled upon Taipei’s Tim Ho Wan.  I wanted to eat at Fuhang Doujiang, but they were closed, so I opted for Tim Ho Wan.  I hopped on the MTA then hopped off at the Taipei Main Station.  Tim Ho Wan was across the street.  I didn’t realized it was the same Tim Ho Wan in Hong Kong until I sat down and looked at the menu.  I guess I had a little food serendipity then the weight gain began.
Tim Ho Wan is a steal relative to other Michelin starred restaurants.  It was much cheaper than Din Tai Fung.  They keep it simple with their limited menu.  Furthermore, the food is freshly made and it’s not pushed around in those clunky steal carts.  The clunky steal carts that usually bang against your elbows.  Yes, those damn things.
Like my original Din Tai Fung meal, I ordered all the traditional dim sum items with a few other not so traditional.  Furthermore, Shiu  Mai and Har Gow were two must order dim sum dishes.  Here were my absolute favorite items:

Shiu Mai – The typical crab roe was topping was missing on each dumpling.  However, it didn’t stop the flavor.  Each shiu mai had an amazingly plump and juicy taste to them.  The shiu mai’s soft golden wrapping was delicate yet strong enough to hold everything together.  It was succulent, tasty, full of flavor, and a little sweet.  It was on par with the Tim Ho Wan in Hong Kong.  It makes me want to leave my wife and kids then move to Hong Kong for the dim sum.

Har Gow – The minced shrimp was wrapped with a translucent wheat and tapioca starch.  It was taunting me to eat it, so I gobbled it up.  The wrapper stuck to my chopsticks but it broke away as I took a bite.  The morsels were succulent and flavorful.  It was fantastic.  However, it was slightly below its Hong Kong counterpart.
Har Gow
Pork Bun – This is one of the reason Tim Ho Wan is famous.  The crispy yet buttery outer shell came apart easily as I bit into the warm pork bun.  The sweet barbecue pork was amazing.  If this is gluttony, I’m going to be sinning all day.  Gym can kiss my ass cause he’s the biggest jerk in town.

Lastly, Tim Ho Wan is the best dim sum I’ve ever had in my life.  Easily.  My second favorite dim sum restaurant would be Hong Kong’s One Dim Sum.  Luckily for the world, Tim Ho Wan is slowly expanding around the world with its latest location in New York.  However, I would expect to pay my soul for the meal like how I did with Ichiran’s Brooklyn branch.  Capitalism at its finest.  Bastards.

Summary
Tim Ho Wan is the best dim sum restaurant in the world.  It has a Michelin star in Hong Kong, but this is the Taipei location without a Michelin star.  Tim Ho Wan is the best dim sum I've ever had in my life.  Easily.  My second favorite dim sum restaurant would be Hong Kong's One Dim Sum.  


7.2/10

To Live And Dine
They say I have a vivid imagination but my grammar is horrible.  They say I need to avoid using profanity in my writing.  They say a lot of things.  I say there's a difference between they're, there and their.
