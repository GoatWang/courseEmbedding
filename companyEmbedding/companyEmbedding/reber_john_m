					An unpublished opinion of the North Carolina Court of Appeals does not constitute controlling legal authority. Citation is disfavored, but may be permitted in accordance with the provisions of Rule 30(e)(3) of the North Carolina Rules of Appellate Procedure.  NO. COA11-1294 NORTH CAROLINA COURT OF APPEALS Filed:  21 August 2012  JOHN M. REBER Plaintiff, v.  N.C. Industrial Commission I.C. No. TA-18483  N. C. DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTION, Defendant.  Appeal by plaintiff from Decision and Order entered 14 July 2011  by  the  Industrial  Commission.  Heard  in  the  Court  of  Appeals 11 June 2012. The Vincent Law Firm, P.C., by Branch W. Vincent, III, for the plaintiff-appellant. Roy Cooper, Attorney General, by Adrian Dellinger, Associate Attorney General, for the defendant-appellee. THIGPEN, Judge. John Reber (    plaintiff    ) was an inmate at the Pasquotank Correctional plaintiff  Institution  filed  a  on  negligence  18  May  action  2001. with  On the  17  May  North  2004,  Carolina  Industrial Commission (    the Commission    ) pursuant to the Tort Claims  Act.  Plaintiff  alleged  defendant,  by  and  through      Officer Todd and Officers Respass, Jordan and Coppersmith,     was   -2negligent and as a result plaintiff was assaulted by another inmate. A hearing was held before Deputy Commissioner James Gillen on 22 September 2010.  On 7 December 2010, Deputy Commissioner  Gillen filed a Decision and Order denying plaintiff    s claim. Plaintiff filed notice of appeal to the Full Commission.  The  Full Commission reviewed the matter and filed a Decision and Order on 14 July 2011 which contained the following findings of fact: 1. At approximately 10:00 p.m. on May 18, 2001, Plaintiff, an inmate in N.C. Department of Correction    s (hereafter DOC) custody at Pasquotank Correctional Institution, was stabbed in the eye with a pencil by inmate Larry Stanfield. Inmate Stanfield attacked Plaintiff apparently because Stanfield was mentally unstable and had racist beliefs. Stanfield was a validated member of the     Five Percenter     and/or     Security Threat Group     gangs. These gangs hold tenants [sic] that include a very negative view of Caucasian people. Plaintiff, who is Caucasian, was in an HVAC class with Stanfield. In approximately March 2001 Stanfield did not like the way Plaintiff talked to the HVAC class instructor. In the HVAC class, Stanfield subsequently called Plaintiff a     wizard     and threatened Plaintiff in a general way. 2. Although Plaintiff reported Stanfield    s remarks to the HVAC instructor and Plaintiff    s unit manager, Plaintiff did not request protective custody or convey a belief that an attack was imminent.   -33. Stanfield    s cell neighbored Plaintiff    s cell. On the evening of May 18, 2001 Plaintiff was attacked by Stanfield and two other inmates in Plaintiff    s cell. The three men beat Plaintiff nearly unconscious and stabbed Plaintiff in the left eye with a pencil. The optic nerve in Plaintiff    s left eye was crushed by the pencil. 4. Plaintiff alleges that defendant was negligent in failing to prevent inmate Stanfield    s May 18, 2001 attack on Plaintiff. 5. The May 18, 2001 incident was investigated by prison personnel. Plaintiff was charged with     provoking an assault     in connection to the assault. Furthermore, the report compiled regarding the May 18, 2001 incident resolved that horseplay led to the incident. 6. Defendant had no reasonable way to predict and/or prevent inmate Stanfield    s assault. Notwithstanding Stanfield    s words to Plaintiff approximately two months previous, until the attack was underway, inmate Stanfield was not believed to be a threat to assault or injure Plaintiff. The Full Commission finds Plaintiff    s assault from inmate Stanfield was not reasonably foreseeable based on the evidence presented. 7. The Full Commission finds that Plaintiff did not present sufficient evidence to establish negligence of any named DOC employee. The Commission concluded: 7. Given that no duty owed to Plaintiff was breached by any named defendant, Plaintiff has failed to prove any negligence on the   -4part of any named officer, employee, involuntary servant, or agent of the State while acting within the scope of his or her office, employment, service, agency, or authority that proximately caused Plaintiff an injury. N.C. Gen. Stat. § 143-291 et seq. Consequently, plaintiff    s claim was denied. On  appeal,  plaintiff  argues  the  Plaintiff appealed. Commission  committed  reversible error when it found as fact and concluded as a matter of law that the evidence was insufficient to show that defendant was negligent.      Appellate review is limited to two questions of  law: (1) whether there was any competent evidence before the Commission to support its findings of fact; and (2) whether the findings of fact of the Commission justify its legal conclusion and decision.     N.C.  App.  omitted).  446,  Taylor v. North Carolina Dep't of Correction, 88 448,  363  S.E.2d  868,  869  (1988)  (citation      The Industrial Commission    s findings of fact are  conclusive on appeal when supported by competent evidence, even though there is evidence which would support findings to the contrary.      Id. To prevail on a claim of negligence under the Tort Claims Act, the plaintiff must establish:     (1) that defendant owed plaintiff a duty of care under the circumstances; (2) that actions or omissions by at least one of the named employees of defendant constituted a breach of that duty; (3) that the breach was the actual and   -5proximate cause of plaintiff    s injury; and (4) that plaintiff suffered damages.     Simmons v. Columbus County Bd. of Educ., 171 N.C. App. 725, 730, 615 S.E.2d 69, 74 (2005) (quoting Davidson v. Univ. of N.C. at Chapel  Hill,  142  N.C.  App.  544,  553,  543  S.E.2d  920,  926  (2001)). It is clear from the record that the Commission    s findings of  fact  are  testified instructor,  supported  that and  he  by  competent  informed  Officer  Todd  Mr.  evidence.  Partika,  that  inmate  plaintiff that the way plaintiff talked Stanfield want to maim plaintiff.  the  Plaintiff HVAC  Stanfield  class told  to Mr. Partika made  However, he also testified  that after this statement was made by inmate Stanfield he did not request protective custody or communicate a belief that an attack was imminent. The findings of fact indicate:  1) The threat was general  and defendant     had no reasonable way to predict     an assault; 2) inmate Stanfield    s words to plaintiff were made     approximately two months     prior to the incident; and 3)     [p]laintiff did not request protective custody or convey a belief that an attack was imminent.         [D]efendant had a duty of reasonable care to protect the plaintiff from reasonably foreseeable harm.      Taylor, 88 N.C.   -6App. at 451, 363 S.E.2d at 871.  Here, inmate Stanfield    s threat  was made approximately two months prior to the assault on 18 May 2001.  No evidence was presented to suggest that an attack by  inmate  Stanfield  protective  was  imminent  custody.  and  Accordingly,  plaintiff  did  not  we  the  Commission    s  find  request  findings support the conclusion that no duty owed to Plaintiff was breached prove  by  defendant,  negligence.  Thus,  and that plaintiff has failed to the  Decision  and  Commission is affirmed. AFFIRMED. Chief Judge Martin and Judge Steelman concur. Report per Rule 30(e).  Order  of  the

Biographies from Historical and Biographical Annals by Morton Montgomery





Biographies from Historical and Biographical Annals by Morton Montgomery

BRADLEY, JOHN
C.
p. 1363
Surnames: BRADLEY, BELL, BROOKE, UMSTEAD, MOGEL, DIETRICH,
SASSAMAN, GILMER, SMITH, WERLEY 

John C. Bradley, one of the best known citizens of Birdsboro, Pa.,
has been connected with public affairs in Berks county for many
years, is a prominent factor in Democratic politics, and is now
serving as high sheriff of Berks county, to which office he was
elected Nov. 5, 1907. He was born Aug. 30, 1857, at Birdsboro, Pa.,
and is a son of James and Charlotte (Bell) Bradley. 
 James Bradley, his father, was born in 1814, in
County Donegal, Ireland, and in 1844 came to America, settling at
Spring Grove, Lancaster county, Pa. Some years later he removed to
Birdsboro, Berks county, where for twenty-six year he served as
gardener for Edward Brooke, and through industry and economy
succeeded in accumulating some means and property. He died April 6,
1875, and was buried in the St. Paul's Catholic cemetery,
Douglasville, Pa., of which church the town until the day of his
death. He married Charlotte Bell, born Feb. 14, 1825, who survives
her husband preserved in mind and body, notwithstanding her
advanced age, enjoys good health, and is able to read and sew
without the aid of glasses. There were born to Mr. and Mrs. James
Bradley five children: Clara, who married L. B. Umstead, a coal
merchant of Birdsboro, Pa.; James, who died at the age of seven
years; Edward, a foreman car inspector for the Pennsylvania
Railroad Company at Wilmington, Del.; John C., the subject of this
sketch, and Thomas, who died in infancy. 
 John C. Bradley was educated in the common
schools of Birdsboro, Pa., and early in life began working at the
E. & G. Brooke Iron Company mills in his native borough. After
some years employment at various occupations with this company, he
became a nailer in their cut nail factory, a vocation which he
pursued for many years. He was in the continuous service of the
Brooke concern for a period of twenty-seven years. 
 In the year 1890 he engaged in the coal business
in Birdsboro, Pa., conducting it for seven years and then disposing
of it to his brother in law, L. B. Umstead. 
 In politics Sheriff Bradley is a stanch
Democrat, and has for many years been active in the ranks of his
party. His first political office was that of committeeman, which
he held without interruption from 1881 until 1907 and at the time
of his withdrawal therefrom, held the committee in point of
service. In the year 1892 he was appointed deputy coroner of
Birdsboro, and served acceptably until 1908, when he resigned owing
to press of other duties. Sheriff Mogel, in 1901 appointed him a
deputy sheriff, and three years later he was reappointed to the
same position by Sheriff Jacob Sassaman. On June 1, 1907, after a
spirited contest, he was made the nominee of the Democratic party
of Berks county, for the office of sheriff receiving at the
primaries 3,995 votes, while his next highest opponent, Thomas G.
Werley received 2,655 votes. On Nov. 5th, of the same year, he was
elected over his Republican opponent, George R. Dietrich, by a
majority of 4, 011 votes. 
 Mr. Bradley is very popular throughout the
county, and is well known in many parts of the State. He is honest,
intelligent, kind-hearted, companionable and has many warm friends.
In society organizations he maintains membership in but one, the
Fraternal Order of Eagles, and is in good standing in Aerie No. 66,
of Reading. He was reared in the Catholic Faith and was a member of
St. Paul's Church, Douglasville, until the services there were
discontinued some years ago, when he transferred his membership to
St. Peter's Church, South Fifth street, Reading. 
 In the administration of the office of sheriff
he has shown marked ability, characterized by fairness to all
parties concerned and thus far has given great satisfaction to his
superiors in State and County and received the praise of all with
whom he has had business relations in the performance of his
duties. 
 On Feb. 28, 1880, Mr. Bradley was married to
Serena F. Smith, who was born in 1864, a daughter of Joseph and
Barbara (Gilmer) Smith, farming people of Caernarvon township,
Berks county, Pa. These children have been born to the couple:
Isabelle F., Clara H., Joseph S. (who died young), Mary A.,
Katharine H., John, Jr., Agnes L., Alice F., Serena F. (who died
young). 


BRANT, IRVIN
S.
p. 1056
Surnames: BRANT, STETTLER, BOOS, LINDMAN, TRUCKMILLER, SCHEFFEY,
AHRENS, RICHARDS, GEIST 

Irvin S. Brant, a prosperous produce commission merchant of
Reading, Pa., was born in Sanatoga, Montgomery Co., Pa., Dec. 9,
1869, son of Washington R. and Sarah (Stettler) Brant. 
 As far as is known, the family is of German
descent. The grandfather of Irvin S. Brant was Samuel M. Brant, a
farmer of Montgomery county, the farm on which he operated still
being in possession of the family, as it has been for one hundred
years. The children of Samuel M. Brant and his wife were: Elizabeth
m. Henry Boos; Susannah m. Henry Lindman; Mary m. Isaac
Truckmiller; Hannah became Mr. Truckmiller's second wife; Joseph;
Nathan; Frederick; Samuel, Jr.; and Washington R. In religious
belief the family were members of the Dutch Reformed Church. 
 Washington R. Brant received his education in
the schools of Montgomery county, and when a youth learned the
milling business. With his brother, Nathan, he conducted a general
store for several years, later selling out his interest to engage
in farming on the old homestead. Mr. Brant was very prominently
connected in Sanatoga, Montgomery county. He and his wife became
the parents of eight children, six living; Mary and Rebecca died at
ages of nine and eleven years, respectively; Frank is secretary of
the North American, Philadelphia; Samuel S. is a farmer of
Sanatoga; Newton C. is at home, engaged in farming; Irvin S.; Annie
m. Edward Scheffey; and Kate is at home. The family are members of
the Reformed Church, although the mother is a Lutheran. Washington
R. Brant died in February, 1909, the last of the family of his
generation. 
 Irvin S. Brant left home when twenty-one years
of age, having received his education in the common schools of his
native locality, and started out first as a salesman for the
Philadelphia Press, with which concern he remained but a short
time. He then secured a clerkship in a grocery store in
Philadelphia, but on account of failing health returned to his
home, remaining one year. In 1893 he came to Reading, accepting a
position a clerk with the Reading Cold Storage Company, and, after
being with the firm for one year, was promoted to the position of
bookkeeper the second year. He then became public circulating agent
of the Public Ledger, bur, after remaining with that organization
three years, returned to Reading, being elected Secretary and
superintendent of the Reading Cold Storage Company. Fifteen months
later, Mr. Brant resigned this position and formed a partnership
with Ahrens & Richards, commission merchants, and after one
year purchased the two partners interest in the business. He has
been successful in his venture, handling eggs and butter
principally, and he distributes about two tons of the latter and
fifty crates of the former per week. Mr. Brant buys the entire
output of two creameries and the partial product of five others,
this being in addition to what he purchases from the farmers.

 In 1899 Mr. Brant married Miss Elizabeth Geist,
of Pottstown, Pa., and the one child born to this union died in
August 1908. In political matters, Mr. Brant is a Democrat.

Christian Braucher, the ancestor of the Brauchers in Berks and
Lehigh counties, settled in Berks county about the time of the
founding of the county, in 1752. The records have it that he was
assessed as "a poor man," which meant that he paid but three
shillings tax. Information concerning the filing of his will
indicates that by thrift and economy he changed conditions somewhat
during his life. On the date of making his will, June 13, 1792, he
disposed of a large estate, among other items bequeathing to his
wife Margaret, bonds and a hotel, "as long as she remains a widow."
The will was signed in legible German, "Stoffel Braucher," and was
witnessed by George Poh and George Braucher, the latter a brother
of the testator. He and his wife are buried in the New Bethel
churchyard, two sandstones, with almost illegible inscriptions,
marking their graves. It appears he was born in 1729 and died in
1793, while his wife's birth is noted as December 22, 1732, and her
death 1797, aged sixty-five years. Their children numbered
thirteen, as follows: Christian; Jacob; John; Peter; Conrad;
Michael; Anna Maria, who married Michael Albright; Barbara, who
married George Kessler; Catherine (left an heir Jacob Ditzius);
Anna Elizabeth; Anna Magdalena, who married Jacob Zimmerman;
Christina; and Frederick. 
 Christian Braucher, next in line, date of birth
not given, died in 1804, his will being on record in Book A, page
486. He bequeathed to his wife the plantation on which they lived.
Peter Braucher and Frederick Leiby were the executors, and the
witnesses were Conrad Braucher and Conrad Spohn. The children were
named as follows; Catharine, married Peter Zimmerman; Johannes;
Christine, married Jacob Wildtraut; Jacob; Magdalene; Peter;
Daniel; and Conrad. 
 Peter Braucher, grandson of the pioneer, and the
great-grandfather of Albert C. Braucher, was born and died in
Albany, buying in 1815, and through life cultivation, the farm on
which his great-grandson now resides. This farm passed from Peter
to his son Christian in 1838, then to his son Daniel in 1864. In
1886 Albert C. bought it from his father. Peter Braucher's wife's
first name was Maria, and their issue was as follows; Mary, married
Wm. Seaman, and lived at Milton, Pa.; Annie Bartholomew; Christian;
Abraham (1796-1828), died in Albany from smallpox. (His children
were -- Jacob, of Philadelphia, Michael, of Lockport, N. Y., and
William, of Philadelphia); Reuben, settled near Moselem, Pa., where
his descendants and those of his son, Peter, still reside. 
 Christian Braucher's Bible record reads: "Born
November 27, 1800, died October 31, 1874, aged seventy-three years,
eleven months, and four days." He tilled the old homestead, and was
a man of parts in his time, was a Democrat, and held local township
and school offices. He and his family were Lutherans, with
membership at New Bethel Church. His wife was Catherine Kremer,
daughter of Henry, her record showing that she was born April 15,
1804, and died March 5, 1875, aged seventy years, ten months, and
twenty days. There were but three children; Matilda, who married
Benneville Dietrich; Priscilla, married Benneville Smith; and
Daniel. 
 Daniel Braucher, father of Albert C., passed his
life of seventy-nine years on the old homestead, having been born
April 7, 1829, and died January 24, 1909. He was twice married. His
widow, who was Mrs. Sarah (Reinhart) Schwoyer, now resides near New
Bethel Church. Mr. Braucher's first wife was Maria Magdalena Lutz.
She was born October 26, 1828, and died November 7, 1871, and to
her were born nine children; Cornelia married Charles Ernst; Mary
married William Greenawald; James, of Wanamaker, Pa.; Sarah married
Daniel Schlenker; Amanda married William Baer; William, of
Kutztown; Albert C.; Kate married George Zettelmoyer; Emma
(deceased) married Chas. Hamm. 
 Albert C. Bauscher, the representative of the
family holding the old homestead, was born July 7, 1862. He was
reared on the farm of his father, and came into its possession in
1886, since which time he has continued its cultivation. The old
homestead, familiarly referred to as "Braucher's Dale," consists of
111 acres of land near New Bethel Church, Albany township. The
present house was built in 1808 by Peter Braucher. It was of the
substantial "loghouse" variety, built to withstand the elements,
and did service without change until Daniel's time. That member of
the family remodeled it, making it a two-story house. Since Albert
C.'s incumbency it has been again remodeled. A large Swiss barn was
built in 1877, and other improvements have been made until the old
place presents an appearance of thrift and neatness. 
 Mrs. Braucher, prior to their marriage, April
22, 1882, was Miss Jane L., daughter of Joel and Maria Magdalena
(Lutz) Sechler. To her were born five children, four of whom died
in infancy. 
 Harvey M. Braucher, the son, born August 27,
1883, graduated from the township schools at thirteen years of age.
Entering the Keystone State Normal School some time later, he was
graduated at nineteen, having won class and society honors during
that period. He then taught the home school acceptably for two
years, studying mean time, and in 1904, was awarded "Master's
Diploma." In the fall of 1904 he entered Pennsylvania State
College, where for four years he pursued the course of electrical
engineering, taking his degree of B. S. in E. E. in 1908. Here
especially distinguishing himself in public speaking and debate, he
there became a Phi Kappa Phi man, a great honor in itself. In 1905
he married Miss Gertrude Hattie Faust. They have a daughter, Pela
Fay. Harvey M. Braucher is now assistant principal of the
Boyertown, Pa., schools and lives in Boyertown.

The ancestor of this old and numerous family of Berks county was
Stephen Brecht, a native of Germany, where he was born Feb. 17,
1692. He was one of the emigrants from the Palatinate who landed at
New York about 1720. These emigrants first settled at Schoharie, N.
Y., but because of the unbearable treatment they received at the
hands of Governor Hunter, of the Province of New York, sought
refuge elsewhere. Hearing of the justice accorded the settlers in
Penn's Province, by the proprietors, and the fertility of the soil,
excellent water and other advantages, many of them came into this
district. Among them was (I) Stephen Brecht, who desired a tract of
good land for himself and three sons. His land was granted him by
John, Thomas and Richard Penn, lawful heirs of William Penn, on
Nov. 27, 1745 [Recorded in Patent Book A., Vol. 12, page 349]. On
this tract he made his home and died Sept. 24, 1747. His remains
were interred in the North Heidelberg cemetery among the Moravians.
His grave stone lies flat upon the ground, and is the oldest stone
that can be found there. The inscription is in good condition. His
will was made Jan. 6, 1746, by which his land was divided among his
three sons: David, Hans Wendel and George Adam. To George Adam was
given the homestead (now owned by Adam Dundore, of Obold), and the
division of land between David and Hans Wendel was made soon after
this date, and is recorded at Reading April 17, 1754, in Book A.
Vol. 1, page 68. 

(II) David Brecht, son of Stephen, was born Sept. 8, 1719. He was a
resident of Bern (now Penn) township long before the organization
of the county in 1752. He was the owner of valuable land near
Bernville and exercised no small influence among the people of his
neighborhood. In 1771 he was elected county commissioner, and
served as such until 1774. By his will on file in the Register's
office, after providing for his wife Sarah, and the slave to whom
he had given freedom, he devises to his only son John his large
plantation of 500 acres. He also gives to each of his seven
daughters the sum of 900 pounds, which was almost a fortune in that
early day. This amount was, however, to be paid by his son John, in
part, as well as a copper kettle to each sister. Sarah, wife of
David Brecht, was born Jan. 8, 1727, and died Jan. 22, 1798. They
were the parents of eleven children, three of whom died in infancy
or childhood. The names of those reaching mature years were: John;
Margaret m. Philip Himmelberger; Elizabeth m. Jacob Strauss;
Catharine m. Philip Adam Riegel; Barbara m. John Michael Geiss;
Susanna m. John Wenrich; Magdalena and Sarah. David Brecht and
wife, as also their son John and his wife are buried in the private
burial ground on the original Bright farm. The inscriptions are
difficult to read after the action of the elements upon the
sandstones. Hier Ruhet Der Leib von David Brecht erist geboren D 8

(III) John Brecht, only son of David that grew to manhood, passed
his entire life in farming on the homestead. His resting place was
found on the farm. Hier ruhet die gebeine von Johannes Brecht Er

 John and Anna Maria Brecht were the parents of
eleven children -- seven girls and four boys. The girls were named
after their seven aunts: Susanna m. George Geiss; Catharine m.
Philip Filbert; Barbara m. Phillip Filbert; Magdalena m. Conrad
Reber; Mary m. Joseph Bucks. John (m. Hannah Klahr) and David (m.
Susanna Reber) settled near Basil, Fairfield Co., Ohio, and their
children are in possession of the land that was bought about 1800
by the first John Brecht and is considered among the best in the
community. Peter married Maria Magdalena Stamm and lived near
Bernville where some of the descendants now live. Jacob is
mentioned below. 

(IV) Jacob Brecht, son of John and Anna Maria, was born March 23,
1791, and died Aug. 26, 1876, at the age of eighty-five years, five
months and three days. He was married to Anna Maria Moser. By the
will of his father he was to receive the homestead, but was to give
certain amounts to each one of his sisters, and the records show
that he was faithful in the discharge of this provision. From this
union we find thirteen children; eleven grew to maturity while
twins died in infancy. The children were: Anna Maria. David Leiss;
Henrietta m. Isaac Leiss; Sarah m. (first) John Kalbach and
(second) Daniel Faust; Elizabeth m. Isaac Kalbach; Catharine m.
Elias Staudt; Rachel m. Adam Dundore; Rebecca m. (first) Jonathan
Dundore and (second) Joseph I. Greth; Isabella m. William Klopp;
John M. m. (first) Lydia Koenig and (second) Lydia Anna Grime;
Aaron M. and Amendon. 

(V) Amendon Bright, son of Jacob, was born Jan. 15, 1830. His
entire active life was devoted to farming. He lived upon and owned
the old Bright homestead of 234 acres of the most fertile section
of Penn township, and at death owned several other farms in
neighboring townships as well as in Penn. He was very prominent in
public affairs, and took an active interest in the success of the
Democratic party. He was school director of his township, for many
years committeeman of his district, for three years prison
inspector in Berks county. In 1894 he was elected treasurer of the
county, conducting the business of the office most satisfactorily
for three years. He married Clara Hain, born March 3, 1833,
daughter of John D. Hain. Their children were: Ellen, m. to Jacob
M. Bordner, of Bernville, who is now county commissioner; William,
a small farmer near Bernville, m. to Mary Hine; Sallie, m. to Frank
Schaeffer, of Tulpehocken; Harry, a druggist, who died aged
twenty-four years; Annie, m. to Jacob Gruber, of Obold; Albert H.;
Rev. Edwin D., pastor of the Reformed Church at Derry, Pa, who is
also engaged as a genealogist and historian, having in preparation
a complete record of the descendants of Stephen Brecht; and three
who died young. Amendon Bright passed away May 21, 1897, respected
by all who knew him. 

(VI) Albert H. Bright, son of Amendon Bright, is a prosperous young
plumber and gas fitter at West Reading. He was born on the old
Bright homestead in Penn township Aug. 25, 1872. He received a good
education in the country school and the Bernville high school.
Until he was twenty-four years of age he was engaged in work on his
father's farm. He then learned the plumbing trade under the careful
tuition of Benjamin Yeich, of Reading. having mastered the trade he
established himself in business in 1900, at West Reading. He was
thus the first qualified plumber in West Reading. He has now built
up a good trade and satisfies his customers. He also has a Reading
license, and does much work in the city. 
 In his political principles Mr. Bright is an
active and firm Democrat, and is keenly interested in the success
of his party. His social connections are with Unamis Tribe of Red
Men, No. 330, of Reading; and the Royal Arcanum. He is a member of
the Reformed Church at Bernville. 
 Mr. Bright married Cora S. Riegel, daughter of
John Riegel. She was born May 18, 1876, and died Dec. 29, 1902. Two
children were born of this union, namely: Roy Amendon, born April
18, 1897, and died Jan. 14, 1902; and Charles Adam, born Aug. 19,
1900. 

 (V) Aaron M. Bright, son of Jacob and Anna Maria, was born in Penn
township, Berks county, March 21, 1832, and died at Bernville Aug.
29, 1869, and is buried there. He conducted a general store at
Bernville from the time of his marriage until his death. He was
active in church life and like all his family belonged to the
Reformed denomination. In 1854 he married Mary Kilmer, daughter of
John and Catharine (Leiss) Kilmer, of Marion township. Five
children were born to this union: Darius K., of Mahanoy City, Pa.,
m. to Julia Catharine Moyer; Emma K., deceased wife of William
Yocum, of Reading; Lehman I; Albert R., of Reading; and Lizzie B.
wife of George M. Zellers, of Stouchburg, Pennsylvania. 

 (VI) Lehman I. Bright, treasurer of Yocum Brothers, cigar
manufacturers, Reading is a native of Bernville, where he was born
May 6, 1859, son of Aaron M. and Mary (Kilmer). He was educated in
the township schools, the Bernville high school, and later in the
Keystone State Normal School, at Kutztown, graduating from the
latter institution in 1881. He taught school when only eighteen
years of age in Penn township, and after his graduation he taught
five terms, two at Myerstown and three in the grammar school at
West Leesport. In 1886 he came to Reading, and accepted the
position of bookkeeper with Yocum Brother, cigar manufacturers,
which position he faithfully filled for seventeen years, when James
Yocum a member of the firm died, and the company was incorporated
under the name of Yocum Brothers. Mr. Bright became its treasurer,
an office he has since filled. He is a director of the corporation,
and was also for one year its secretary. He has given his work
great attention, and has devoted his energies to making the
corporation a success. They employ on an average 400 people, and
their product is know all over the country. Mr. Bright is very
prominent in fraternal organizations. He is a member of Progressive
Lodge, No. 470, I.O.O.F., and was its efficient secretary for
fifteen consecutive years, declining further service on the ground

George John Breedy, of No. 235 South Twelfth street, who is known
to the people of Reading, Pa., as a professional musician and
teacher of music, was born in this city, May 4, 1878, son of
Theodore and Mary E. (Moyer) Breedy. 
 John Breedy, the grandfather of George J., was
born in 1803, was a native of Antwerp, Belgium, and founded the
family in this country in 1836. After coming to America the rest of
his life was spent in Reading, where he died at the age of
eighty-three years. Mr. Breedy was a stone mason by trade, and was
a gifted musician, teaching all of his children music. He married
Emma Keen, who was also born in his Fatherland, and to them were
born children as follows: Theodore; John, a bricklayer of reading;
Mary, single, resides in Reading; Emma, deceased, was the wife of
Charles Manegold of Reading; and Lizzie, who married George Young
of this city. Of these children Emma and Barbara were talented
vocalists, and sang in church choirs throughout Reading. 
 Theodore Breedy was born Jan. 8, 1855, in
reading, where he was educated in the public schools, and then
learned the upholstering trade at Herbein's furniture store, which
he followed until Mr. Herbein's death. From his youth he had shown
remarkable talent in music, and at the age of eighteen years played
with the celebrated old Ringgold Band of Reading, with which he was
connected until the organization of the Germania Band, when he
became a member of that body. This was later reorganized and again
took the name of the Ringgold Band. Mr. Breedy also played at the
Academy of Music for a number of years. In political matters he is
a Democrat. Mr. Breedy married Mary E. Moyer, born in February,
1855, daughter of George M. and Amanda (Petree) Moyer, and to this
union there were born four children: George J.; Charles and Edward,
who died in boyhood; and Paul J., a student at the High School.

 George John Breedy obtained his education in the
public schools of Reading, leaving after the completion of his
grammar school course, and when fourteen years of age secured a
position as clerk, in J. H. Obold & Company's hardware store.
There he remained for a period of two years, and in 1894 he began
the study of music under Professors Joseph Rowe and George Holcombe
of New York. For one year he played the drums at the Academy of
Music, Reading, and in 1899 with his father joined the famous
Ringling Brothers' Shows, with which organization they traveled in
every State and territory in the Union. Their pleasant stay in
California and the exciting times experienced by them throughout
the Southern States will be events ever clear in their memories.
After the close of the show season in 1900, Mr. George J. Breedy
returned to Reading, and was for some years a member of the Bijou
Theatre orchestra, and is now at the Orpheum Theatre, also teaching

Charles Breneiser, Sr.,
manufacturer of cigars and tobacco at Reading for sixty years, was
born at Reading March 24, 1828. He attended one of the first public
schools opened at Reading in 1834, but he was not permitted to
obtain more than a limited common education, because he was obliged
to turn his attention, while still a boy, toward assisting in the
support of the family. He first engaged as a helper in laying
bricks and then gradually learned the trade, but after some years
in this laborious employment he changed to cigar-making, and after
serving a regular apprenticeship followed the trade until he was
twenty years of age, when he engaged in the business of
cigar-making for himself. This was in 1847, and he continued at the
business with increasing success in the vicinity of Seventh and
Penn streets until his death, a period covering more than sixty
years. At first he was in partnership with William Harman for
several years. He engaged in the manufacture of cigars exclusively
until 1861, and then became a manufacturer and dealer in smoking
and chewing tobacco, both wholesale and retail; and he ever
afterward carried on the two together. As his sons grew to manhood
they were led to learn and follow the same business, each being
admitted to partnership with him. In this way he had four sons
associated in the firm (Thomas, Charles, Jr., Edgar and Milton),
and trading under the name of Charles Breneiser & Sons. The two
sons last named retired from the firm in 1898 to engage in the
cigar and tobacco business, wholesale and retail, for themselves,
and since then they have traded under the name of Breneiser
Brothers, locating on the northeast corner of Eighth and Penn
streets in April, 1907. The father's firm manufactures many
superior and popular brands of cigars which have a large sale
throughout the country. This firm has fitted up the most costly and
attractive cigar stand in Reading. 
 Mr. Breneiser, in connection with his increasing
business and property interests, assisted in organizing the Union
Bank in 1857, and the Reading Trust Company in 1886, and he served
as a director of these two prominent institutions until his death.
He represented the Southeast ward of Reading in the common branch
of the city councils in 1862 and 1863; and the Eighth ward in the
select branch from 1869 to 1872. He also assisted in organizing the
Oley Turnpike Company in 1862, and the Maxatawny Mutual Fire &
Storm Insurance Company in 1893, serving as a director and also
officiating as the president of each for many years. 
 As a humanitarian Mr. Breneiser was prominently
before the community for many years. Soon after the local board of
public charities was established in 1874 he was selected by the
State authorities as one of the three commissioners, and he filled
the appointment until he died. His duties required him to visit the
public institutions of the county and to make report of their
management and condition to the State. He was one of the first
subscribers of the stock in the establishment of the Reading
Library Company in 1868, and he always continued to show a
practical interest in the library. In 1897 he was one of a party of
liberal citizens who raised a fund to extinguish the debt on the
library building and make the institution free to the public. He
was actively identified with the Reading Benevolent Society from
1870, and with the Reading relief Society and the Reading Hospital
from their inception. He was one of the few public-spirited
individuals of the Third and Eighth wards who took the first steps
toward converting the open commons at the head of Penn street, and
along Perkiomen avenue to Hill road, from an offensive depository
for all kinds of objectionable materials to an attractive park, by
contributing annually toward the expenses for a number of years
before 1887, when it came to be recognized as a park and a part of
the park system of Reading. He was selected one of the board of
trustees of the Charles Evans Cemetery Company in 1893, and served
in that capacity until his death. 
 In 1848 Mr. Breneiser married Mary Ann Neihart,
daughter of Jacob and Catherine (Goodman) Neihart, of Reading, and
by her had twelve children; Emma m. George W. Dauth; Adaline m.
Chester Grim; Thomas m. Mary F. Brotevant; Charles m. Fannie K.
Spang; Edgar m. Sarah Lenhart; Robert Milton m. Eva Umble; Harry
died in 1904, aged thirty-seven years; five other died in infancy.
The mother died in 1897. Mr. Breneiser died June 30, 1909. 
 Emmanuel Breneiser, the father of Charles
Breneiser, Sr., was born in 1874, in Lancaster, Pa., and there
learned the trade of saddler. Locating at Reading about the time he
became of age, he carried on this business for about fifty years,
and then lived in retirement until his death, in 1865, on the day
Lee surrendered to Grant in the Civil war. He m. Christina Swartz,
daughter of George Swartz, of Oley, who removed to Reading when a

BREYFOGEL, SYLVANUS (REV.)

Surnames: BREYFOGEL, BREYFOGLE, BREYVOGEL, ELY, WILSON, DRIEBELBIS,
GROSS, HINTERLEITER, BALDY, LAUTENSLAGER, CUTLER, REYNOLDS, DIXON,
JOHNSON, COCHRAN, LEMMON 

Rev. Sylvanus Charles Breyfogel, D. D., L. L. D., one of the four
bishops of the Evangelical Association is a member of an early
settled Berks county family, and was born July 20, 1851, near
Pleasantville, Oley township, son of Rev. Seneca and Sarah (Ely)
Breyfogel. 
 The Breyfogel (sometimes Breyfogle and
Breyvogel) family history has not been definitely traced beyond the
shores of the New World. There are two traditions concerning the
origin of the family--one giving the early home in France, and the
other in Holland. The general appearance of the family, with the
dark complexion black hair and eyes of the Latin races, gives great
weight to the former, for the blue eyes and flaxen hair of the
Dutch are noticeably lacking. The two traditions can be reconciled,
however, and both, to a certain extent, be considered correct, as
at the time of the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes many from
France fled for refuge into Holland. Breyfogles living in Germany
state that from Holland one branch went to America and one to
Germany. Of the latter branch representatives are found in
Goppingen and in Worms, and also one family in Westhofen. These
families, however on investigation, are unaware of any relationship
with, or direct knowledge of, each other. Of the Westhofen
Breyvogels was Wilhelm Immanuel Breyvogel, who in 1843, was sent to
Wisconsin as a Roman Catholic (the religion of this branch)
missionary, and there died in January, 1907. 

(I) Among the passengers on the ship "Phoenix," from Rotterdam,
William Wilson, master, qualified at Philadelphia Oct. 20, 1744,
was one John Peter Breyvogel, who must have been at that time over
sixteen years of age, passengers under that age not being obliged
to qualify. he had no family with him. On the Breyvogel farm near
Kutztown was once the grave of Peter Breyvogel, marked by a
headstone, but the land has been put under the plow, and the waving
fields of grain cover the once hallowed spot. At the court-house in
Reading is the record of Jacob Breyvogel, administrator of Peter
Breyvogel, June 17, 1789, by bond of George Breyvogel, 50, filed
Oct. 17, 1796. As near as can be gleaned from early records the
children of John Peter Breyvogel were: George, mentioned below;
Peter, born Dec. 5, 1746, who died Dec. 7, 1819; Jacob, who had two
children, Charles and Joshua; Solomon; and a daughter who married a
Row. Some records indicate a son John in place of Solomon, but as
there is nothing recorded other then the name he probably died
young. 

(II) George Breyvogel, son of John Peter, was born Feb. 4, 1747,
and died Oct. 6, 1827. He married Catharine (Dreibelbeis) Ely, born
Dec. 5, 1745, died Dec. 7, 1819. By her first husband Catharine had
two children, a son and a daughter, who both went West. To George
and Catharine were born children as follows: Jacob D.; Solomon,
born Jan. 22, 1780; died Nov. 11, 1817; George, born Sept. 2, 1782,
died May 5, 1875; Catharine, born Oct. 20, 1784, m. Jacob Gross,*
and died Oct. 21, 1881; Esther m. Jacob Hinterleiter. George
Breyvogel's will made June 25, 1822, was probated Oct. 26, 1827. He
mentions his sons Jacob D. and George, gives 350 to be divided
equally among the children of his deceased son Solomon, gives 500
to daughter Catharine, and 373 to daughter Esther. 
[*Note: Per Judy, Catharine m. Joseph Gross, not Jacob Gross.]

(III) Jacob D. Breyvogel, son of George and Catharine, married
Susanne Baldy, who for her second husband married a Lautenslager, a
relative of her daughter's husband. They lived at Lockport, N.Y. To
Jacob and Susanne Breyvogel was born: Catharine, who m. a
Lautenslager (on May 18, 1901, he was still living, then over
ninety years of age), and their daughter, Mrs. Cutler, lives at
Waterloo, Iowa; Joshua D., born Sept. 17, 1806; Charles, who went
to California in 1849, and found and lost the "Breyfogel Mine,"
still searched for (his wife's name was Hannah); Mariah, m. to John
Lemmon; Harriet, who died unmarried; Jacob (no heirs); Josiah,
formerly of Lockport, N. Y., who died in Chicago and Lucas C.
formerly of Lockport. 

(IV) Joshua D. Breyvogel, son of Jacob D. and Susanne, was born at
Lockport, N. Y., Sept. 17, 1806, and moved to Delaware, Ohio. He
died Jan. 28, 1868. On July 28, 1838, he married Mary Reynolds who
made her home at No. 582 South Limestone street, Springfield, Ohio.
Their children were: Imogene, born May 6, 1839, died April 16,
1866; Roland C. born Sept. 16, 1842, was a captain in the Union
army in he Civil war, and died from the effects of wounds July 28,
1870; William D., Born Feb. 26, 1845, died April 30, 1865, from
wounds received in he Civil War (he was thanked by General Hancock
for conspicuous bravery at the battle of Gettysburg); Joshua, born

died Dec. 1, 1861, Mary R., born Oct. 24, 1853, died Jan. 16, 1907.


(V) Joshua Breyvogel, son of Joshua D. was born May 12, 1848. He
served three years in the Civil war. On Jan. 17, 1870, he married
Mary E. Dixon and they became the parents of six children, namely:
