Capital One® Secured Mastercard®


                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time. I've been really satisfied for the most part. They report quickly and accurately, remind me when my bill is due, and the customer service has been kind and thorough....show more

Academy Bank


                                            They cancelled my secured credit card without informing me.  Did not refund the money from secured card without me calling,. Guess they thought I might forget.  Will be closing all accounts with them today.  Worst customer service of any bank I've dealt with

Alfa Insurance


                                            I have (had) been with Alfa for 23 years. Over the course of the last few years, my premiums kept going up. $20 here, $30 there - well, this last time it went up over $200 with the new renewal. I have a perfect driving record- no tickets, no wrecks- and yet my insurance jumps up...show more

PenFed Credit Union


                                            HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! They do not work with you at all to satisfy the customer. Other credit unions help you ESPECIALLY if you have great credit. This CU doesn't tell you everything so verify everything with two other reps. Total Nightmare!

ST. LOUIS, May 25, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Plancorp, a St. Louis, MO-based, fee-only wealth management firm which manages $3.6 billion in assets, and Prumentum Group, a WealthTech company based in Silicon Valley, today announced a strategic partnership to launch a direct-to-consumer Hybrid-Robo financial planning platform. As part of this partnership, Prumentum acquired a significant equity stake in Plancorp.








The platform, which is a wholly-owned Prumentum subsidiary called BrightPlan, evaluates a user's entire financial picture to create a comprehensive and customized set of financial objectives. Together with Plancorp's personalized financial guidance, this technology is aimed at inspiring clients to create and pursue their financial life goals while tracking progress every step of the way via the inclusive capabilities of a digital and interactive planning tool.
"For many years, we at Plancorp have been actively pursuing an innovative digital solution that extends beyond simply focusing on investments," said Chris Kerckhoff, president of Plancorp. "This partnership enables us to provide the hybrid solution we've been seeking with a firm, Prumentum, that shares our values and fiduciary commitment to clients. We're excited to offer BrightPlan to our clients and deliver the future of financial planning for investors."
Unlike other robo solutions, mostly focused on investment advice, BrightPlan's Hybrid-Robo solution is centered on a goals-based financial planning approach. Users track their goals in conjunction with their assets in real time, creating a solution that is both comprehensive and actionable. This provides clients with access to an innovative digital platform, as well as to an experienced financial life advocate when they feel that their situation requires it—offering a true human-tech integrated solution.
"By combining the proven wealth management expertise of Plancorp with the advanced technology of BrightPlan, we are uniquely positioned to deliver an exceptional service that inspires people to set life and financial goals, and easily implement and track their plan for success," said Marthin De Beer, CEO of Prumentum.
BrightPlan will be launching later this year and is currently accepting requests for early access at http://brightplan.com.

Prumentum Group combines transformational digital capabilities and proven wealth management solutions with access to financial advisors, enabling more people to realize their dreams and aspirations.

Exit Strategy Advisors
After all the work you put into growing your business, selling it may be the last thing on your mind. But whether you’re looking to transition ownership now or in the future, it’s never too soon to start thinking about your approach.
Plancorp can help you develop a comprehensive transition strategy. Then, we’ll assemble and coordinate a team of trusted professionals to execute that plan.
Our process covers four key phases:
1) Data Collection. Through one-on-one consultations and in-depth questionnaires, we gain an understanding of your goals for life after exiting your business.
2) Valuation and Analysis. We evaluate possible exit options and potential risks of each. Then, we prepare a comprehensive financial analysis to see if your projected resources will meet your income needs.
3) Recommendations. We assist in developing a strategy to maximize the value of your business during the transition. Our action plans ensure you, your family and all entities involved are ready.
4) Implementation. Once the road map is prepared, we help assemble the right team of appropriate advisors and collaborate with them as we execute your plan.
To learn more about how we can help you transition your business, contact Larry Guess at lguess@plancorp.com or call 314-392-4686.

If you are nervous about the market, you are better off reviewing the underlying assumptions in your financial plan than making changes to your portfolio. That way you spend less time predicting and more focused on things you can control.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
