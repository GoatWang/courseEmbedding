 Please retain both parts of this Prospectus for future reference.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THE FUND
   This series of Van Kampen Unit Trusts, Municipal Series (the "Fund") consists
of underlying separate unit investment trusts described above. The Trust        
consists of an insured portfolio of interest-bearing obligations (the "Bonds" or
"Securities") issued by or on behalf of municipalities and other governmental   
authorities, the interest on which is, in the opinion of recognized bond counsel
to the issuing governmental authority, exempt from all Federal income taxes     
under existing law. In addition, the interest income of each State Trust is, in 
the opinion of counsel, exempt to the extent indicated from state and local     
taxes, when held by residents of the state where the issuers of Bonds in such   
Trust are located.                                                              

 PUBLIC OFFERING PRICE
 The Public Offering Price of the Units of each Trust includes the aggregate
bid price of the Securities in such Trust, an applicable sales charge, cash, if 
any, in the Principal Account held or owned by such Trust, and accrued interest,
if any. See "Summary of Essential Financial Information".                       

 ESTIMATED CURRENT AND LONG-TERM RETURNS
Estimated Current and Long-Term Returns to Unitholders are indicated under
"Summary of Essential Financial Information". The methods of calculating        
Estimated Current Returns and Estimated Long-Term Return are set forth in Part  
II of this Prospectus.                                                          

THESE SECURITIES HAVE NOT BEEN APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED BY THE SECURITIES AND
EXCHANGE COMMISSION NOR HAS THE COMMISSION PASSED UPON THE ACCURACY OR ADEQUACY 
OF THIS PROSPECTUS. ANY REPRESENTATION TO THE CONTRARY IS A CRIMINAL OFFENSE.

Summary of Essential Financial Information
As of August 9, 2006
Sponsor: Van Kampen Funds Inc.
 Evaluator: Standard & Poor's Securities Evaluations, Inc.
 Supervisor: Van Kampen Asset Management (4)
 Trustee: The Bank of New York

The income, expense and distribution data set forth below have been       
calculated for Unitholders electing to receive monthly distributions.           
Unitholders choosing a different distribution plan (if available) will receive a
slightly higher net annual interest income because of the lower Trustee's fees  
and expenses under such plan.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors of Van Kampen Funds Inc. and the Unitholders of Van   
Kampen Unit Trusts, Municipal Series 512:                                       
We have audited the accompanying statement of condition (including the    
analysis of net assets) and the related portfolio schedule of Van Kampen Unit   
Trusts, Municipal Series 512 (Colorado IM-IT Trust) as of June 30, 2006, and the
related statements of operations and changes in net assets for the period from  
July 15, 2004 (date of deposit) through June 30, 2005 and for the year ended    
June 30, 2006. These statements are the responsibility of the Trustee and the   
Sponsor. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on such statements based on
our audits.                                                                     
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public    
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the 
financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Trust is not        
required to have, nor were we engaged to perform an audit of its internal       
control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal 
control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that 
are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an  
opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over financial     
reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes      
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in  
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and          
significant estimates made by the Trustee and Sponsor, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation  
of obligations owned at June 30, 2006 by correspondence with the Trustee. We    
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.             
   In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Van Kampen Unit Trusts,        
Municipal Series 512 (Colorado IM-IT Trust) as of June 30, 2006, and the results
of operations and changes in net assets for the period from July 15, 2004 (date 
of deposit) through June 30, 2005 and for the year ended June 30, 2006, in      
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America.

VAN KAMPEN UNIT TRUSTS, MUNICIPAL SERIES 512
 Notes to Financial Statements
June 30, 2005 and 2006

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES                             
  Security Valuation - Tax-exempt municipal securities are stated at the value
determined by the Evaluator. The Evaluator may determine the value of the Bonds 
(1) on the basis of current bid prices of the Bonds obtained from dealers or    
brokers who customarily deal in Bonds comparable to those held by each of the   
Trusts, (2) on the basis of bid prices for comparable Bonds, (3) by determining 
the value of the Bonds by appraisal or (4) by any combination of the above.     

  Security Cost - The original cost to the Trust (Colorado IM-IT) was based on
the determination by J.J. Kenny Co. of the offering prices of the Bonds on the  
date of deposit (July 15, 2004). Since the valuation is based upon the bid      
prices, the Trust (Colorado IM-IT) recognized a downward adjustment of $19,115  
on the date of deposit resulting from the difference between the bid and        
offering prices. This downward adjustment was included in the aggregate amount  
of unrealized depreciation reported in the financial statements for the Trust   
for the period ended June 30, 2005.                                             

  Unit Valuation - The redemption price per Unit is the pro rata share of each
Unit in each Trust based upon (1) the cash on hand in such Trust or monies in   
the process of being collected, (2) the Bonds in such Trust based on the value  
determined by the Evaluator and (3) interest accrued thereon, less accrued      
expenses of the Trust, if any.                                                  

 Federal Income Taxes - The Trust is not a taxable entity for Federal income
tax purposes. Each Unitholder is considered to be the owner of a pro rata       
portion of such Trust and, accordingly, no provision has been made for Federal  
income taxes.                                                                   

Other - The financial statements are presented on the accrual basis of    
accounting. Any realized gains or losses from securities transactions are       
reported on an identified cost basis.                                           

NOTE 2 - PORTFOLIO                                                              
 Ratings - The source of all ratings, exclusive of those designated N/R or *
is Standard & Poor's, A Division of the McGraw-Hill Companies. Ratings marked * 
are by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. as these Bonds are not rated by Standard 
& Poor's, A Division of the McGraw-Hill Companies. N/R indicates that the Bond  
is not rated by Standard & Poor's, A Division of the McGraw-Hill Companies or   
Moody's Investors Service, Inc. The ratings shown represent the latest published
ratings of the Bonds. For a brief description of rating symbols and their       
related meanings, see "Description of Securities Ratings" in the Information    
Supplement.                                                                     

   Redemption Feature - There is shown under this heading the year in which each
issue of Bonds is initially or currently callable and the call price for that   
year. Each issue of Bonds continues to be callable at declining prices          
thereafter (but not below par value) except for original issue discount Bonds   
which are redeemable at prices based on the issue price plus the amount of      
original issue discount accreted to redemption date plus, if applicable, some   
premium, the amount of which will decline in subsequent years. "S.F." indicates 
a sinking fund is established with respect to an issue of Bonds. "P.R."         
indicates a bond has been prerefunded. Redemption pursuant to call provisions   
generally will, and redemption pursuant to sinking fund provisions may, occur at
times when the redeemed Bonds have an offering side evaluation which represents 
a premium over par. To the extent that the Bonds were deposited in the Trust at 
a price higher than the price at which they are redeemed, this will represent a 
loss of capital when compared with the original Public Offering Price of the    
Units. Conversely, to the extent that the Bonds were acquired at a price lower  
than the redemption price, this will represent an increase in capital when      
compared with the original Public Offering Price of the Units. Distributions    
will generally be reduced by the amount of the income which would otherwise have
been paid with respect to redeemed Bonds and there will be distributed to       
Unitholders the principal amount in excess of $1 per Unit semi-annually and any 
premium received on such redemption. However, should the amount available for   
distribution in the Principal Account exceed $10.00 per Unit, the Trustee will  
make a special distribution from the Principal Account on the next succeeding   
monthly distribution date to holders of record on the related monthly record    
date. The Estimated Current Return in this event may be affected by such        
redemptions. For the Federal tax effect on Unitholders of such redemptions and  
resultant distributions, see "Federal Tax Status" in Part II.                   

 Insurance - Insurance coverage providing for the timely payment when due of
all principal and interest on the Bonds in the Colorado IM-IT Trust has been    
obtained by the Trust or by one of the Preinsured Bond Insurers (as indicated in
the Bond name). Such insurance does not guarantee the market value of the Bonds 
or the value of the Units. For Bonds covered under the Trust's insurance policy 
the insurance is effective only while Bonds thus insured are held in the Trust  
and the insurance premium, which is a Trust obligation, is paid on a monthly    
basis. The premium for insurance which has been obtained from various insurance 
companies by the issuer of the Bond involved is payable by the issuer.          

NOTE 2 - PORTFOLIO (continued)                                                  
An Accounting and Auditing Guide issued by the American Institute of      
Certified Public Accountants states that, for financial reporting purposes,     
insurance coverage of the type acquired by the Trust does not have any          
measurable value in the absence of default of the underlying Bonds or indication
of the probability of such default. In the opinion of the Evaluator, there is no
indication of a probable default of Bonds in the portfolio as of the date of    
these financial statements.                                                     

Unrealized Appreciation and Depreciation - An analysis of net unrealized  
appreciation (depreciation) at June 30, 2006 is as follows:                     

Unrealized Appreciation         $    52,841                               
Unrealized Depreciation              (4,796)

 $    48,045

NOTE 3 - OTHER                                                                  
   Marketability - Although it is not obligated to do so, the Sponsor intends to
maintain a market for Units and to continuously offer to purchase Units at      
prices, subject to change at any time, based upon the aggregate bid price of the
Bonds in the portfolio of the Trust, plus interest accrued to the date of       
settlement. If the supply of Units exceeds demand, or for other business        
reasons, the Sponsor may discontinue purchases of Units at such prices. In the  
event that a market is not maintained for the Units, a Unitholder desiring to   
dispose of his Units may be able to do so only by tendering such Units to the   
Trustee for redemption at the redemption price.                                 

Cost to Investors - The cost to original investors was based on the       
Evaluator's determination of the aggregate offering price of the Bonds per Unit 
on the date of an investor's purchase, plus a sales charge of 4.9% of the public
offering price which is equivalent to 5.152% of the aggregate offering price of 
the Bonds. The secondary market cost to investors is based on the Evaluator's   
determination of the aggregate bid price of the Bonds per Unit on the date of an
investor's purchase plus a sales charge based upon the years to average maturity
of the Bonds in the portfolio. The sales charge ranges from 1.0% of the public  
offering price (1.010% of the aggregate bid price of the Bonds) for a Trust with
a portfolio with less than two years to average maturity to 5.40% of the public 
offering price (5.708% of the aggregate bid price of the Bonds) for a Trust with
a portfolio with twenty-one or more years to average maturity.                  

  Compensation of Evaluator and Supervisor - The Supervisor receives a fee for
providing portfolio supervisory services for the Trust ($.25 per Unit, not to   
exceed the aggregate cost of the Supervisor for providing such services to the  
Trust). In addition, the Evaluator receives an annual fee for regularly         
evaluating each of the Trust's portfolios. Both fees may be adjusted for        
increases under the category "All Services Less Rent of Shelter" in the Consumer
Price Index.                                                                    

NOTE 4 - REDEMPTION OF UNITS

THE TRUSTS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Fund. Your Trust is one of several unit investment trusts created
under the name Insured Municipals Income Trust, Insured Municipals Income Trust 
and Investors' Quality Tax-Exempt Trust, Van Kampen Focus Portfolios, Municipal 
Series or Van Kampen Unit Trusts, Municipal Series (the "Fund"). The Fund was   
created under the laws of the State of New York pursuant to a Trust Indenture   
and Agreement (the "Trust Agreement"), dated the Date of Deposit among Van      
Kampen Funds Inc., as Sponsor, Standard & Poor's Securities Evaluations, Inc.,  
as Evaluator, Van Kampen Asset Management, as Supervisor, and The Bank of New   
York, as Trustee, or their predecessors.                                        

The Fund consists of separate portfolios of interest-bearing  
obligations issued by or on behalf of states and territories of the United      
States, and political subdivisions and authorities thereof, the interest on     
which is, in the opinion of recognized bond counsel to the issuing authorities, 
excludable from gross income for Federal income tax purposes under existing law.
All issuers of bonds in a State Trust are located in the state for which the    
Trust is named or in United States territories or possessions and their public  
authorities; consequently, in the opinion of recognized bond counsel to the bond
issuers, the interest earned on the bonds is exempt to the extent indicated     
herein from state and local taxes. Further, in the opinion of bond counsel to   
the respective issuers, the interest income of each bond in a U.S. Territorial  
IM-IT Trust is exempt from state, Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and local income  
taxation. Interest on certain bonds in a National Quality AMTTrust may be a     
preference item for purposes of the alternative minimum tax. Accordingly, a     
National Quality AMTTrust may be appropriate only for investors who are not     
subject to the alternative minimum tax. Trusts that hold only insured bonds or  
bonds that are insured under a portfolio insurance policy are referred to herein
as "Insured Trusts". "Long-Term Trust" refers to IM-IT, Investment Grade        
Municipal, U.S. Territorial IM-IT, Long-Term State and National Quality Trusts. 
"Intermediate-Term Trust" refers to Strategic Municipal Trust Intermediate      
Series, State Intermediate Trusts and State Intermediate Laddered Maturity      
Trusts. Trusts that are named for a particular state are referred to herein as  
"State Trusts". "State Intermediate Trust" refers to a State Trust which is     
designated as an "intermediate series" in the name of such Trust. "State        
Intermediate Laddered Maturity Trust" refers to a State Trust which is          
designated as an "intermediate laddered maturity series" in the name of such    
Trust. State Trusts, other than State Intermediate Laddered Maturity Trusts or  
State Intermediate Trusts, are referred to herein as "Long-Term State Trusts".  

  On the Date of Deposit, the Sponsor deposited the bonds with the
Trustee. The bonds initially consisted of delivery statements relating to       
contracts for their purchase and cash, cash equivalents and/or irrevocable      
letters of credit issued by a financial institution. Thereafter, the Trustee, in
exchange for the bonds, delivered to the Sponsor evidence of ownership of the   
Units.                                                                          

         The portfolio of any IM-IT, Investment Grade Municipal, IM-IT Discount,
U.S. Territorial IM-IT, Long-Term State or National Quality Trust consists of   
bonds maturing approximately 15 to 40 years from the Date of Deposit. The       
approximate range of maturities from the Date of Deposit for bonds in any IM-IT 
Laddered Series, IM-IT Limited Maturity Trust, IM-IT Intermediate Trust,        
Strategic Municipal Trust Intermediate Series, State Intermediate Laddered      
Maturity Trust and IM-IT Short Intermediate Trust is 10 to 30 years, 12 to 15   
years, 5 to 15 years, 5 to 15 years, 5 to 10 years and 3 to 7 years,            
respectively. The portfolio of any IM-IT Laddered Series is structured so that  
approximately 20% of the bonds will mature every five years, beginning in       
approximately the tenth year of the Trust, entitling each Unitholder to return  
of principal. The portfolio of any State Intermediate Laddered Maturity Trust is
structured so that approximately 20% of the bonds will mature each year,        
beginning in approximately the fifth year of the Trust, entitling each          
Unitholder to a return of principal. This return of principal may offer         
Unitholders the opportunity to respond to changing economic conditions and to   
specific financial needs that may arise during the periods of scheduled         
maturities. However, the flexibility provided by the return of principal may    
also eliminate a Unitholder's ability to reinvest at a rate as high as the yield
on the bonds which matured.                                                     

       Each Unit represents a fractional undivided interest in the principal
and net income of a Trust. To the extent that any Units are redeemed by the     
Trustee, the fractional undivided interest in a Trust represented by each Unit  
will increase, although the actual interest in the Trust will remain unchanged. 
Units will remain outstanding until redeemed by Unitholders or until the        
termination of the Trust Agreement.                                             

Objectives and Bond Selection. The objectives of a Trust are income
exempt from Federal income taxation and, in the case of a State Trust, Federal  
and state income taxation and conservation of capital through an investment in  
diversified portfolios of Federal and state tax-exempt obligations. A State     
Intermediate Laddered Maturity Trust has additional objectives of providing     
protection against changes in interest rates and investment flexibility through 
an investment in a laddered portfolio of intermediate-term interest-bearing     
obligations with maturities ranging from approximately 5 to 10 years in which   
roughly 20% of the bonds mature each year beginning in approximately the fifth  
year of the Trust. There is, of course, no guarantee that the Trusts will       
achieve their objectives. A Trust may be an appropriate investment vehicle for  
investors who desire to participate in a portfolio of tax-exempt fixed income   
bonds with greater diversification than they might be able to acquire           
individually. Insurance guaranteeing the timely payment, when due, of all       
principal and interest on the bonds in each Insured Trust has been obtained from
a municipal bond insurance company. For information relating to insurance on the
bonds, see "Insurance on the Bonds in the Insured Trusts". In addition, these   
bonds are often not available in small amounts.                                 

         In selecting bonds for the Trusts, the Sponsor considered the following
factors, among others: (a) with respect to Insured Trusts, the bonds must be    
insured with a Standard & Poor's rating of AAA or a Moody's Investor Service,   
Inc. ("Moody's") rating of Aaa, with respect to all Quality Trusts, the bonds   
must have a Standard & Poor's rating of at least "A-", a Moody's rating of at   
least "A3" or, if not rated, credit characteristics sufficiently similar to     
those of comparable bonds that were so rated as to be acceptable for acquisition
by a Trust in the opinion of the Sponsor, and with respect to all other Trusts, 
either the Standard & Poor's rating of the bonds was not less than "BBB-", or   
the Moody's rating of the bonds was not less than "Baa3", including provisional 
or conditional ratings, respectively, (or, if not rated, the bonds had credit   
characteristics sufficiently similar to the credit characteristics of           
interest-bearing tax-exempt bonds that were so rated as to be acceptable for    
acquisition by a Trust in the opinion of the Sponsor), (b) the prices of the    
bonds relative to other bonds of comparable quality and maturity, (c) the       
current income provided by the bonds, (d) the diversification of bonds as to    
purpose of issue and location of issuer and (e) the probability of early return 
of principal or high legal or event risk. After the Date of Deposit, a bond may 
cease to be rated or its rating may be reduced below the minimum required as of 
the Date of Deposit. Neither event requires elimination of a bond from a Trust  
but may be considered in the Sponsor's determination as to whether or not to    
direct the Trustee to dispose of the bond (see "Trust Administration--Portfolio
Administration"). In particular, the ratings of the bonds in an Investment Grade
Municipal Trust could fall below "investment grade" (i.e., below "BBB-" or      
"Baa3") during the Trust's life and the Trust could continue to hold the bonds. 
See "The Trusts--Risk Factors".                                                 

The Bonds. Your Trust invests in municipal bonds. States,     
municipalities and public authorities issue these bonds to raise money for a    
variety of purposes. In selecting bonds, we seek to diversify your portfolio by 
bond purpose. This section briefly describes different bond types to help you   
better understand your investment. These bonds are described in greater detail  
in the Information Supplement. See "Additional Information".                    

        General obligation bonds are backed by the general taxing power of the
issuer. The issuer secures these bonds by pledging its faith, credit and        
unlimited taxing power for the payment of principal and interest.               

       Revenue bonds are payable only from the revenue of a specific project
or authority. They are not supported by the issuer's general power to levy      
taxes. The risk of default in payment of interest or principal increases if the 
income of the related project falters because that income is the only source of 
payment. All of the following bonds are revenue bonds:                          

         Airport bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate airports.
The ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds primarily depends on  
the ability of airlines to meet their obligations under use agreements. Due to  
increased competition, deregulation, increased fuel costs and other factors,    
some airlines may have difficulty meeting these obligations.                    

      Bond banks are vehicles that pool various municipal obligations into
larger offerings. This reduces the cost of borrowing for the municipalities. The
types of financing projects that these obligations support vary.                

       Certificates of participation are generally a type of municipal lease
obligation. Lease payments of a governmental entity secure payments on these    
bonds. These payments depend on the governmental entity budgeting appropriations
for the lease payments. A governmental body cannot obligate future governments  
to appropriate for or make lease payments, but governments typically promise to 
take action necessary to include lease payments in their budgets. If a          
government fails to budget for or make lease payments, sufficient funds may not 
exist to pay interest or principal on these bonds.                              

       Health care bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenue from
hospitals and hospital systems. The ability of these issuers to make payments on
bonds depends on factors such as facility occupancy levels, demand for services,
competition resulting from hospital mergers and affiliations, the need to reduce
costs, government regulation, costs of malpractice insurance and claims, and    
government financial assistance (such as Medicare and Medicaid).                

Higher education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate
universities and colleges. These issuers derive revenues from tuition,          
dormitories, grants and endowments. These issuers face problems related to      
declines in the number of college-age individuals, possible inability to raise  
tuitions and fees, uncertainty of continued federal grants, state funding or    
donations, and government legislation or regulation.                            

     Industrial revenue bonds finance the cost of acquiring, building or
improving industrial projects. Private corporations usually operate these       
projects. The ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds depends on  
factors such as the creditworthiness of the corporation operating the project,  
revenues generated by the project, expenses of the project and environmental or 
other regulatory restrictions.                                                  

   Multi-family housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive
revenues from mortgage loans on multiple family residences, retirement housing  
or housing projects for low to moderate-income families. These bonds are        
generally pre-payable at any time. It is likely that their life will be less    
than their stated maturity. The ability of these issuers to make payments on    
bonds depends on such factors as rental income, occupancy levels, operating     
expenses, mortgage default rates, taxes, government regulations and             
appropriation of subsidies.                                                     

     Other care bonds include obligations of issuers that derive revenue
from mental health facilities, nursing homes and intermediate care facilities.  
These bonds are similar to health care bonds and the issuers face the same      
general risks.                                                                  

        Public building bonds finance the cost of acquiring, leasing, building
or improving public buildings such as offices, recreation facilities, convention
centers, police stations, correctional institutions and parking garages. The    
ability of the issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such  
as the government budgeting sufficient funds to make lease or mortgage payments 
on the facility, user fees or rents, costs of maintenance and decreases in use  
of the facility.                                                                

        Public education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate primary
and secondary schools. The ability of these issuers to make payments on these   
bonds depends primarily on ad valorem taxes. These issuers may also face        
problems related to litigation contesting state constitutionality of public     
education financing.                                                            

     Retail electric/gas/telephone bonds are obligations of issuers that
derive revenues from the retail sale of utilities to customers. The ability of  
these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the    
rates and demand for these utilities, competition, government regulation and    
rate approvals, overhead expenses and the cost of fuels.                        

    Single family housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive
revenues from mortgage loans on single family residences. Single family         
residences generally include one to four-family dwellings. These bonds are      
similar to multi-family housing bonds and the issuers face the same general     
risks.                                                                          

        Tax district bonds are obligations secured by a pledge of taxing power
by a municipality, such as tax increment financing or tax allocation bonds.     
These bonds are similar to general obligation bonds. Unlike general obligation  
bonds, however, the municipality does not pledge its unlimited taxing power to  
pay these bonds. Instead, the municipality pledges revenues from a specific tax 
to pay these bonds. If the tax cannot support payment of interest and principal,
a municipality may need to raise the related tax to pay these bonds. An         
inability to raise the tax could have an adverse affect on these bonds.         

      Transportation bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate
public transit systems, ports, highways, turnpikes, bridges and other           
transportation systems. The ability of these issuers to make payments on these  
bonds depends on variations in use, the degree of government subsidization,     
competition from other forms of transportation and increased costs. Port        
authorities derive revenues primarily from fees imposed on ships using the port 
facilities. These fees can fluctuate depending on the local economy and         
competition from air, rail and truck transportation. Increased fuel costs,      
alternative transportation modes and competition from toll-free bridges and     
roads will impact revenues of issuers that operate bridges, roads or tunnels.   

      Waste disposal bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues
from resource recovery facilities. These facilities process solid waste,        
generate steam and convert steam to electricity. These issuers face problems    
such as costs and delays due to environmental concerns, effects of conservation 
and recycling, destruction or condemnation of a project, void or unenforceable  
contracts, changes in the economic availability of raw materials, operating     
supplies or facilities, and other unavoidable changes that adversely affect     
operation of a project.                                                         

       Water and sewer bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues
from user fees from the sale of water and sewerage services. These issuers face 
problems such as the ability to obtain rate increases, population declines,     
difficulties in obtaining new fresh water supplies and "no-growth" zoning       
ordinances. These issuers also face many of the same problems of waste disposal 
issuers.                                                                        

 Wholesale electric bonds are obligations of issuers that derive
revenues from selling electricity to other utilities. The ability of these      
issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the rates and
demand for electric utilities, competition, overhead expenses and government    
regulation and rate approvals.                                                  

    More About the Bonds. In addition to describing the purpose of the
bonds, other information about the bonds is also listed in the "Portfolio" in   
Prospectus Part I. This information relates to other characteristics of the     
bonds. This section briefly describes some of these characteristics.            

      Original issue discount bonds were initially issued at a price below
their face (or par) value. These bonds typically pay a lower interest rate than 
comparable bonds that were issued at or above their par value. In a stable      
interest rate environment, the market value of these bonds tends to increase    
more slowly in early years and in greater increments as the bonds approach      
maturity. The issuers of these bonds may be able to call or redeem a bond before
its stated maturity date and at a price less than the bond's par value.         

     Zero coupon bonds are a type of original issue discount bond. These
bonds do not pay any current interest during their life. If an investor own this
type of bond, the investor has the right to receive a final payment of the      
bond's par value at maturity. The price of these bonds often fluctuates greatly 
during periods of changing market interest rates compared to bonds that make    
current interest payments. The issuers of these bonds may be able to call or    
redeem a bond before its stated maturity date and at a price less than the      
bond's par value.                                                               

     "When, as and if issued" bonds are bonds that trade before they are
actually issued. This means that the Sponsor can only deliver them to your Trust
"when, as and if" the bonds are actually issued. Delivery of these bonds may be 
delayed or may not occur. Interest on these bonds does not begin accruing to    
your Trust until the Sponsor delivers the bond to the Trust. You may have to    
adjust your tax basis if the Sponsor delivers any of these bonds after the      
expected delivery date. Any adjustment would reflect interest that accrued      
between the time you purchased your Units and the delivery of the bonds to your 
Trust. This could lower your first year estimated current return. You may       
experience gains or losses on these bonds from the time you purchase Units even 
though your Trust has not yet received them.                                    

Risk Factors. All investments involve risk. This section describes the
main risks that can impact the value of bonds in your Trust. You should         
understand these risks before you invest. If the value of the bonds falls, the  
value of your Units will also fall. You can lose money by investing in a Trust. 
No one can guarantee that your Trust will achieve its objective or that your    
investment return will be positive over any period. The Information Supplement  
contains a more detailed discussion of risks related to your investment.        

        Market risk is the risk that the value of the bonds in your Trust will
fluctuate. This could cause the value of your Units to fall below your original 
purchase price or below the par value. Market value fluctuates in response to   
various factors. These can include changes in interest rates, inflation, the    
financial condition of a bond's issuer or insurer, perceptions of the issuer or 
insurer, or ratings on a bond. Even though the Supervisor supervises your       
portfolio, you should remember that no one manages your portfolio. Your Trust   
will not sell a bond solely because the market value falls as is possible in a  
managed fund.                                                                   

     Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of bonds will fall if
interest rates increase. Bonds typically fall in value when interest rates rise 
and rise in value when interest rates fall. Bonds with longer periods before    
maturity are often more sensitive to interest rate changes.                     

      Credit risk is the risk that a bond's issuer or insurer is unable to
meet its obligation to pay principal or interest on the bond.                   

        Call risk is the risk that the issuer prepays or "calls" a bond before
its stated maturity. An issuer might call a bond if interest rates fall and the 
bond pays a higher interest rate or if it no longer needs the money for the     
original purpose. If an issuer calls a bond, your Trust will distribute the     
principal to you but your future interest distributions will fall. You might not
be able to reinvest this principal at as high a yield. A bond's call price could
be less than the price your Trust paid for the bond and could be below the      
bond's par value. This means that you could receive less than the amount you    
paid for your units. If enough bonds in your Trust are called, your Trust could 
terminate early. The first date that the issuer can call each bond in the       
portfolio is listed in Prospectus Part I along with the price the issuer would  
have to pay.                                                                    

   Bond quality risk is the risk that a bond will fall in value if a
rating agency decreases the bond's rating. Bond concentration risk is the risk  
that your Trust is less diversified because it concentrates in a particular type
of bond. When a certain type of bond makes up 25% or more of a Trust, the Trust 
is considered to be "concentrated" in that bond type. The different bond types  
are described under "The Bonds".                                                

      Reduced diversification risk is the risk that your Trust will become
smaller and less diversified as bonds are sold, are called or mature. This could
increase your risk of loss and increase your share of Trust expenses.           

  Liquidity risk is the risk that the value of a bond will fall if
trading in the bond is limited or absent. No one can guarantee that a liquid    
trading market will exist for any bond because these bonds generally trade in   
the over-the-counter market (they are not listed on a securities exchange).     

       Litigation and legislation risk is the risk that future litigation or
legislation could affect the value of your Trust. For example, future           
legislation could reduce tax rates, impose a flat tax, exempt all investment    
income from tax or change the tax status of the bonds. Litigation could         
challenge an issuer's authority to issue or make payments on bonds.             

        No FDIC Guarantee. An investment in your Trust is not a deposit of any
bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance          
Corporation or any other government agency.                                     

ESTIMATED CURRENT AND LONG-TERM RETURNS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

       The Estimated Current Returns and the Estimated Long-Term Returns are
set forth in the Prospectus Part I. Estimated Current Return is calculated by   
dividing the estimated net annual interest income per Unit by the Public        
Offering Price. The estimated net annual interest income per Unit will vary with
changes in fees and expenses of the Trust and with the principal prepayment,    
redemption, maturity, exchange or sale of bonds. The Public Offering Price will 
vary with changes in the price of the bonds. Accordingly, there is no assurance 
that the present Estimated Current Return will be realized in the future.       
Estimated Long-Term Return is calculated using a formula which (1) takes into   
consideration, and determines and factors in the relative weightings of, the    
market values, yields (which takes into account the amortization of premiums and
the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirements of the bonds and (2) takes
into account the expenses and sales charge associated with Units. Since the     
value and estimated retirements of the bonds and the expenses of a Trust will   
change, there is no assurance that the present Estimated Long-Term Return will  
be realized in the future. The Estimated Current Return and Estimated Long-Term 
Return are expected to differ because the calculation of Estimated Long-Term    
Return reflects the estimated date and amount of principal returned while the   
Estimated Current Return calculation includes only net annual interest income   
and Public Offering Price.                                                      

PUBLIC OFFERING 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

General. Units are offered at the Public Offering Price. The secondary
market public offering price is based on the bid prices of the bonds, the sales 
charge described below, cash, if any, in the Principal Account and accrued      
interest, if any. The minimum purchase is one Unit. Certain broker-dealers or   
selling firms may charge an order handling fee for processing Unit purchases.   

   The secondary market sales charge is computed as described in the
following table based upon the estimated long-term return life (ELTR Life) of a 
Trust's portfolio:

 1                       1.010%      8                        3.627%      15                       5.042%

       The ELTR Life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trusts'
portfolio as determined for purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return. 
See "Estimated Current and Long-Term Returns". The sales charges in the above   
table are expressed as a percentage of the aggregate bid prices of the bonds.   

      Reducing Your Sales Charge. The Sponsor offers a variety of ways for
you to reduce the sales charge that you pay. It is your financial professional's
responsibility to alert the Sponsor of any discount when you purchase Units.    
Before you purchase Units you must also inform your broker-dealer of your       
qualification for any discount or of any combined purchases to be eligible for a
reduced sales charge.                                                           

Fee Accounts. A portion of the sales charge is waived for certain
accounts described in this paragraph. Purchases by these accounts are subject   
only to the portion of the sales charge that is retained by the Sponsor. Please 
refer to the section called "Fee Accounts" for additional information on these  
purchases. Units may be purchased in the primary or secondary market at the     
Public Offering Price less the concession the Sponsor typically allows to       
brokers and dealers for purchases by investors who purchase Units through       
registered investment advisers, certified financial planners and registered     
broker-dealers who in each case either charge periodic fees for brokerage       
services, financial planning, investment advisory or asset management services, 
or provide such services in connection with the establishment of an investment  
account for which a comprehensive "wrap fee" charge is imposed ("Fee Accounts").
The Sponsor reserves the right to limit or deny purchases of Units described in 
this paragraph by investors or selling firms whose frequent trading activity is 
determined to be detrimental to a Trust.                                        

       Employees. Employees, officers and directors (including their spouses
and children under 21 living in the same household, and trustees, custodians or 
fiduciaries for the benefit of such persons) of Van Kampen Funds Inc. and its   
affiliates and dealers and their affiliates may purchase Units at the Public    
Offering Price less the applicable dealer concession, when permitted.           

Offering Price. The Public Offering Price of Units will vary from the
amounts stated under "Summary of Essential Financial Information" in Prospectus 
Part I in accordance with fluctuations in the prices of the bonds. The          
"Evaluation Time" is the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange on each
day that the Exchange is open for trading. Orders received by the Trustee or    
Sponsor for purchases, sales or redemptions after that time, or on a day when   
the New York Stock Exchange is closed, will be held until the next determination
of price. The secondary market Public Offering Price per Unit will be equal to  
the aggregate bid price of the bonds plus the applicable secondary market sales 
charge and dividing the sum by the number of Units outstanding. For secondary   
market purposes, this computation will be made by the Evaluator as of the       
Evaluation Time for each day on which any Unit is tendered for redemption and as
necessary. The offering price of bonds may be expected to average approximately 
0.5%-1% more than the bid price.                                                

    The aggregate price of the bonds is determined on the basis of bid
prices (a) on the basis of current market prices obtained from dealers or       
brokers who customarily deal in bonds comparable to those held by the Fund; (b) 
if these prices are not available, on the basis of current market prices for    
comparable bonds; (c) by causing the value of the bonds to be determined by     
others engaged in the practice of evaluation, quoting or appraising comparable  
bonds; or (d) by any combination of the above. Market prices of the bonds will  
generally fluctuate with changes in market interest rates. Unless bonds are in  
default in payment of principal or interest or in significant risk of default,  
the Evaluator will not attribute any value to the insurance obtained by an      
Insured Trust, if any.                                                          

     The Evaluator will consider in its evaluation of bonds which are in
default in payment of principal or interest or, in the Sponsor's opinion, in    
significant risk of default (the "Defaulted Bonds") the value of any insurance  
guaranteeing interest and principal payments. The value of the insurance will be
equal to the difference between (i) the market value of Defaulted Bonds assuming
the exercise of the right to obtain Permanent Insurance (less the insurance     
premiums and related expenses attributable to the purchase of Permanent         
Insurance) and (ii) the market value of Defaulted Bonds not covered by Permanent
Insurance. In addition, the Evaluator will consider the ability of a Portfolio  
Insurer to meet its commitments under any insurance policy, including           
commitments to issue Permanent Insurance. No value has been ascribed to         
insurance obtained by an Insured Trust, if any, as of the date of this          
prospectus.                                                                     

   A person will become the owner of Units on the date of settlement
provided payment has been received. Cash, if any, made available to the Sponsor 
prior to the date of settlement for the purchase of Units may be used in the    
Sponsor's business and may be deemed to be a benefit to the Sponsor, subject to 
the limitations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.                         

Accrued Interest                                              

         Accrued Interest (Accrued Interest to Carry). Accrued interest to carry
is added to the Public Offering Price for Insured Municipals Income Trust, 151st
Insured Multi-Series and prior series and Insured Municipals Income Trust and   
Investors' Quality Tax-Exempt Trust, Multi-Series 212 and prior series. Accrued 
interest to carry consists of two elements. The first element arises as a result
of accrued interest which is the accumulation of unpaid interest on a bond from 
the last day on which interest thereon was paid. Interest on Securities in each 
Trust is actually paid either monthly, quarterly, if applicable, or             
semi-annually to such Trust. However, interest on the Securities in each Trust  
is accounted for daily on an accrual basis. Because of this, each Trust always  
has an amount of interest earned but not yet collected by the Trustee because of
coupons that are not yet due. For this reason, the Public Offering Price will   
have added to it the proportionate share of accrued and undistributed interest  
to the date of settlement.                                                      

       The second element of accrued interest to carry arises because of the
structure of the Interest Account. The Trustee has no cash for distribution to  
Unitholders of a Trust until it receives interest payments on the Securities in 
such Trust. The Trustee is obligated to provide its own funds, at times, in     
order to advance interest distributions. The Trustee will recover these         
advancements when such interest is received. Interest Account balances are      
established so that it will not be necessary on a regular basis for the Trustee 
to advance its own funds in connection with such interest distributions. The    
Interest Account balances are also structured so that there will generally be   
positive cash balances and since the funds held by the Trustee may be used by it
to earn interest thereon, it benefits thereby. If a Unitholder sells or redeems 
all or a portion of his Units or if the bonds in a Trust are sold or otherwise  
removed or if a Trust is liquidated, he will receive at that time his           
proportionate share of the accrued interest to carry computed to the settlement 
date in the case of sale or liquidation and to the date of tender in the case of
redemption.                                                                     

        Purchased and Accrued Interest. Added to the Public Offering Price for
Insured Municipals Income Trust, 152nd-173rd Insured Multi-Series and Insured   
Municipals Income Trust and Investors' Quality Tax-Exempt Trust, Multi-Series   
213-246 is Purchased Interest and accrued interest. Included in the Public      
Offering Price for Insured Municipals Income Trust, 174th Insured Multi-Series  
and subsequent series and Insured Municipals Income Trust and Investors' Quality
Tax-Exempt Trust, Multi-Series 247 and subsequent series is accrued interest    
only. References to "accrued interest" in this prospectus include both Purchased
Interest and accrued interest as described in this section.                     

    Purchased Interest - Purchased Interest is a portion of the unpaid
interest that has accrued on the Securities from the later of the last payment  
date on the Securities or the date of issuance thereof through the First        
Settlement Date and is included in the calculation of the Public Offering Price.
Purchased Interest will be distributed to Unitholders as Units are redeemed or  
Securities mature or are called. See "Summary of Essential Financial            
Information" in this Prospectus Part I for the amount of Purchased Interest per 
Unit for each Trust. Purchased Interest is an element of the price Unitholders  
will receive in connection with the sale or redemption of Units prior to the    
termination of a Trust.                                                         

  Accrued Interest - Accrued Interest is an accumulation of unpaid
interest on securities which generally is paid semi-annually, although a Trust  
accrues such interest daily. Because of this, a Trust always has an amount of   
interest earned but not yet collected by the Trustee. For this reason, with     
respect to sales settling after the First Settlement Date, the proportionate    
share of accrued interest to the settlement date is added to the Public Offering
Price of Units. Unitholders will receive on the next distribution date of a     
Trust the amount, if any, of accrued interest paid on their Units. As indicated 
in "Purchased Interest", accrued interest as of the First Settlement Date       
includes Purchased Interest. In an effort to reduce the amount of Purchased     
Interest which would otherwise have to be paid by Unitholders, the Trustee may  
advance a portion of such accrued interest to the Sponsor as the Unitholder of  
record as of the First Settlement Date. Consequently, the accrued interest added
to the Public Offering Price of Units will include only accrued interest from   
the First Settlement Date to the date of settlement (other than the Purchased   
Interest already included therein), less any distributions from the Interest    
Account after the First Settlement Date. Because of the varying interest payment
dates of the bonds, accrued interest at any point in time will be greater than  
the amount of interest actually received by a Trust and distributed to          
Unitholders. If a Unitholder sells or redeems all or a portion of his Units, he 
will be entitled to receive his proportionate share of the Purchased Interest   
and accrued interest from the purchaser of his Units. Since the Trustee has the 
use of the funds (including Purchased Interest) held in the Interest Account for
distributions to Unitholders and since such Account is non-interest-bearing to  
Unitholders, the Trustee benefits thereby.                                      

Accrued Interest. Accrued interest is added to the Public Offering
Price for all Trusts not listed above. Accrued interest is an accumulation of   
unpaid interest on securities which generally is paid semi-annually, although   
each Trust accrues interest daily. Because of this, a Trust always has an amount
of interest earned but not yet collected by the Trustee. For this reason, with  
respect to sales settling after the First Settlement Date, the proportionate    
share of accrued interest as described in this paragraph to the settlement date 
is added to the Public Offering Price of Units for all Trusts not mentioned     
above. Unitholders will receive the amount of accrued interest paid on their    
Units on the next distribution date. In an effort to reduce the accrued interest
which would have to be paid by Unitholders, the Trustee will advance the amount 
of accrued interest to the Sponsor as the Unitholder of record as of the First  
Settlement Date. Consequently, the accrued interest added to the Public Offering
Price of Units will include only accrued interest from the First Settlement Date
to the date of settlement, less any distributions from the Interest Account     
after the First Settlement Date. Because of the varying interest payment dates  
of the bonds, accrued interest at any point in time will be greater than the    
amount of interest actually received by a Trust and distributed to Unitholders. 
If a Unitholder sells or redeems all or a portion of his Units, he will be      
entitled to receive his proportionate share of the accrued interest from the    
purchaser of his Units.                                                         

Unit Distribution. Units will be distributed to the public by 
broker-dealers and others at the Public Offering Price, plus accrued interest.  
The Sponsor intends to qualify Units for sale in a number of states.            
Broker-dealers or others will be allowed a concession or agency commission in   
connection with the distribution of Units equal to 80% of the sales charge      
applicable to the transaction provided that the Units are acquired from the     
Sponsor. Certain commercial banks may be making Units available to their        
customers on an agency basis. A portion of the sales charge paid by these       
customers (equal to the agency commission referred to above) is retained by or  
remitted to the banks. Any discount provided to investors will be borne by the  
selling dealer or agent. The Sponsor reserves the right to reject, in whole or  
in part, any order for the purchase of Units and to change the amount of the    
concession or agency commission to dealers and others up to the entire amount of
the sales charge.                                                               

         Sponsor Compensation. The Sponsor will receive a gross sales commission
equal to the sales charge applicable to the transaction involved. See "Public
Offering--General". In addition, the Sponsor realized a profit or loss, as a    
result of the difference between the price paid for the bonds by the Sponsor and
the cost of the bonds to a Trust. The Sponsor has not participated as sole      
underwriter or as manager or as a member of the underwriting syndicates from    
which the bonds in the Trusts were acquired. The Sponsor may further realize    
profit or loss as a result of possible fluctuations in the market value of the  
bonds since all proceeds received from purchasers of Units (excluding dealer    
concessions or agency commissions allowed, if any) will be retained by the      
Sponsor. The Sponsor will also realize profits or losses in the amount of any   
difference between the price at which Units are purchased and the price at which
Units are resold in connection with maintaining a secondary market for Units and
will also realize profits or losses resulting from a redemption of repurchased  
Units at a price above or below the purchase price.                             

   Broker-dealers of the Trusts, banks and/or others are eligible to
participate in a program in which such firms receive from the Sponsor a nominal 
award for each of their representatives who have sold a minimum number of units 
of unit investment trusts created by the Sponsor during a specified time period.
In addition, at various times the Sponsor may implement other programs under    
which the sales forces of such firms may be eligible to win other nominal awards
for certain sales efforts, or under which the Sponsor will reallow to any such  
firms that sponsor sales contests or recognition programs conforming to criteria
established by the Sponsor, or participate in sales programs sponsored by the   
Sponsor, an amount not exceeding the total applicable sales charges on the sales
generated by such persons at the public offering price during such programs.    
Also, the Sponsor in its discretion may from time to time pursuant to objective 
criteria established by the Sponsor pay fees to qualifying firms for certain    
services or activities which are primarily intended to result in sales of Units 
of the Trusts. Such payments are made by the Sponsor out of its own assets, and 
not out of the assets of the Trusts. These programs will not change the price   
Unitholders pay for their Units or the amount that the Trusts will receive from 
the Units sold. Approximately every eighteen months the Sponsor holds a business
seminar which is open to certain Underwriters that sell units of trusts it      
sponsors. The Sponsor pays substantially all costs associated with the seminar, 
excluding travel costs. These Underwriters are invited to send a certain number 
of representatives based on the gross number of units such firm underwrites     
during a designated time period.                                                

        Market for Units. Although not obligated to do so, the Sponsor intends
to maintain a market for Units and offer to purchase Units at prices, subject to
change at any time, based upon the aggregate bid prices of the bonds plus       
accrued interest and any principal cash on hand, less any amounts representing  
taxes or other governmental charges payable out of the Trust and less any       
accrued Trust expenses. If the supply of Units exceeds demand or if some other  
business reason warrants it, the Sponsor may either discontinue all purchases of
Units or discontinue purchases of Units at these prices. If a market is not     
maintained and the Unitholder cannot find another purchaser, a Unitholder will  
be able to dispose of Units by tendering them to the Trustee for redemption at  
the Redemption Price. See "Rights of Unitholders--Redemption of Units". A       
Unitholder who wishes to dispose of his Units should inquire of his broker as to
current market prices in order to determine whether there is in any price in    
excess of the Redemption Price and, if so, the amount thereof. The Trustee will 
notify the Sponsor of any tender of Units for redemption. If the Sponsor's bid  
in the secondary market at that time equals or exceeds the Redemption Price per 
Unit, it may purchase the Units not later than the day on which the Units would 
otherwise have been redeemed by the Trustee.                                    

RIGHTS OF UNITHOLDERS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Distributions of Interest and Principal. Interest received by a Trust,
pro rated on an annual basis, will be distributed monthly unless a Unitholder   
elects to receive quarterly or semi-annual distributions. Certain Trusts offer  
only monthly distribution options while others offer only monthly and           
semi-annual distribution options. The distribution options applicable to a Trust
are described in Prospectus Part I. The plan of distribution selected by a      
Unitholder will remain in effect until changed. Unitholders who purchase Units  
in the secondary market will receive distributions in accordance with the       
election of the prior owner. Unitholders may change their distribution plan by  
indicating the change on a card which may be obtained from the Trustee and      
return the card to the Trustee with their certificates and other documentation  
required by the Trustee. Certificates should be sent by registered or certified 
mail to avoid their being lost or stolen. If the card and certificate are       
properly presented to the Trustee, the change will become effective on the first
day after the next semi-annual record date and will remain effective until      
changed.                                                                        

      Interest received by a Trust, including that part of the proceeds of
any disposition of bonds which represents accrued interest, is credited by the  
Trustee to the Interest Account. Other receipts are credited to the Principal   
Account. After deduction of amounts sufficient to reimburse the Trustee, without
interest, for any amounts advanced and paid to the Sponsor as the Unitholder of 
record as of the First Settlement Date, interest received will be distributed on
each distribution date to Unitholders of record as of the preceding record date.
All distributions will be net of estimated expenses. Funds in the Principal     
Account will be distributed on each semi-annual distribution date to Unitholders
of record as of the preceding semi-annual record date. The Trustee is not       
required to pay interest on funds held in the Principal or Interest Account (but
may itself earn interest thereon and therefore benefits from the use of these   
funds) nor to make a distribution from the Principal Account unless the amount  
available for distribution therein shall equal at least $1.00 per Unit. However,
should the amount available for distribution in the Principal Account equal or  
exceed $10.00 per Unit, the Trustee will make a special distribution from the   
Principal Account on the next monthly distribution date to Unitholders of record
on the related monthly record date.                                             

     Because interest payments are not received by a Trust at a constant
rate throughout the year, interest distributions may be more or less than the   
amount credited to the Interest Account as of the record date. For the purpose  
of minimizing fluctuations in interest distributions, the Trustee is authorized 
to advance amounts necessary to provide interest distributions of approximately 
equal amounts. The Trustee is reimbursed for these advances from funds in the   
Interest Account on the next record date. Persons who purchase Units between a  
record date and a distribution date will receive their first distribution on the
second distribution date after the purchase, under the applicable plan of       
distribution.                                                                   

     Reinvestment Option. Unitholders may elect to have distributions on
their Units automatically reinvested in shares of certain Van Kampen mutual     
funds which are registered in the Unitholder's state of residence (the          
"Reinvestment Funds"). Each Reinvestment Fund has investment objectives that    
differ from those of the Trusts. The prospectus relating to each Reinvestment   
Fund describes its investment policies and the procedures to follow to begin    
reinvestment. A Unitholder may obtain a prospectus for the Reinvestment Funds   
from the Sponsor.                                                               

 After becoming a participant in a reinvestment plan, each Trust
distribution will automatically be applied on the applicable distribution date  
to purchase shares of the applicable Reinvestment Fund at a net asset value     
computed on such date. Unitholders with an existing Planned Reinvestment Option 
(PRO) Program account (whereby a sales charge is imposed on distribution        
reinvestments) may transfer their existing account into a new PRO account which 
allows purchases of Reinvestment Fund shares at net asset value. Confirmations  
of all reinvestments will be mailed to the Unitholder by the Reinvestment Fund. 
A participant may elect to terminate his or her reinvestment plan and receive   
future distributions in cash by notifying the Trustee in writing at least five  
days before the next distribution date. Each Reinvestment Fund, its sponsor and 
investment adviser have the right to terminate its reinvestment plan at any     
time. Unitholders of New York Trusts who are New York residents may elect to    
have distributions reinvested in shares of First Investors New York Insured Tax 
Free Fund, Inc. subject to a sales charge of $1.50 per $100 reinvested (paid to 
First Investors Management Company, Inc.).                                      

Redemption of Units. A Unitholder may redeem all or a portion of his
Units by tender to the Trustee at Unit Investment Trust Division, 101 Barclay   
Street, 20th Floor, New York, New York 10286, of the certificates representing  
the Units to be redeemed, duly endorsed or accompanied by proper instruments of 
transfer with signature guaranteed (or by providing satisfactory indemnity, such
as in connection with lost, stolen or destroyed certificates) and by payment of 
applicable governmental charges, if any. Redemption of Units cannot occur until 
certificates representing the Units or satisfactory indemnity have been received
by the Trustee. No later than seven calendar days following satisfactory tender,
the Unitholder will receive an amount for each Unit equal to the Redemption     
Price per Unit next computed after receipt by the Trustee of the tender of      
Units. The "date of tender" is deemed to be the date on which Units are received
by the Trustee, except that as regards Units received after the Evaluation Time 
on days of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the date of tender is the    
next day on which that Exchange is open and the Units will be deemed to have    
been tendered to the Trustee on that day for redemption at the Redemption Price.
Redemption requests received by authorized financial professionals prior to the 
Evaluation Time that are properly transmitted to the Trustee by the time        
designated by the Trustee, are priced based on the date of receipt. Redemption  
requests received by the Trustee after the Evaluation Time, and redemption      
requests received by authorized financial professionals after the Evaluation    
Time or redemption requests received by such persons that are not transmitted to
the Trustee until after the time designated by the Trustee, are priced based on 
the date of the next determined redemption price provided they are received     
timely by the Trustee on such date. It is the responsibility of authorized      
financial professionals to transmit redemption requests received by them to the 
Trustee so they will be received in a timely manner. Certain broker-dealers or  
selling firms may charge an order handling fee for processing redemption        
requests. Units redeemed directly through the Trustee are not subject to such   
fees.                                                                           

        Under Internal Revenue Service regulations, the Trustee is required to
withhold a specified percentage of a Unit redemption if the Trustee has not     
received the Unitholder's tax identification number as required by such         
regulations. Any amount withheld is transmitted to the Internal Revenue Service 
and may be recovered by the Unitholder only when filing a return. Under normal  
circumstances the Trustee obtains the Unitholder's tax identification number    
from the selling broker. However, at any time a Unitholder elects to tender     
Units for redemption, the Unitholder should provide a tax identification number 
to the Trustee in order to avoid this possible "back-up withholding".           

       The Redemption Price per Unit (as well as the secondary market Public
Offering Price) will be determined on the basis of the bid price of the bonds as
of the Evaluation Time on days of trading on the New York Stock Exchange on the 
date any such determination is made. The Evaluator determines the Redemption    
Price per Unit on days Units are tendered for redemption. The Redemption Price  
per Unit is the pro rata share of each Unit on the basis of (i) the cash on hand
in the Trust or moneys in the process of being collected, (ii) the value of the 
bonds based on the bid prices of the bonds, except for cases in which the value 
of insurance has been included, (iii) accrued interest, less (a) amounts        
representing taxes or other governmental charges and (b) the accrued Trust      
expenses. The Evaluator may determine the value of the bonds by employing any of
the methods set forth in "Public Offering--Offering Price". In determining the  
Redemption Price per Unit no value will be assigned to the portfolio insurance  
maintained on the bonds in an Insured Trust unless the bonds are in default in  
payment of principal or interest or in significant risk of default. For a       
description of the situations in which the Evaluator may value the insurance    
obtained by the Insured Trusts, see "Public Offering--Offering Price". Accrued  
interest paid on redemption shall be withdrawn from the Interest Account or, if 
the balance therein is insufficient, from the Principal Account. All other      
amounts will be withdrawn from the Principal Account. Units so redeemed shall be
cancelled.                                                                      

       The price at which Units may be redeemed could be less than the price
paid by the Unitholder and may be less than the par value of the bonds          
represented by the Units redeemed. The Trustee may sell bonds to cover          
redemptions. When bonds are sold, the size and diversity of the Trust will be   
reduced. Sales may be required at a time when bonds would not otherwise be sold 
and might result in lower prices than might otherwise be realized.              

        The right of redemption may be suspended and payment postponed for any
period during which the New York Stock Exchange is closed, other than for       
customary weekend and holiday closings, or during which the SEC determines that 
trading on that Exchange is restricted or an emergency exists, as a result of   
which disposal or evaluation of the bonds is not reasonably practicable, or for 
other periods as the SEC may by order permit. Under certain extreme             
circumstances the Sponsor may apply to the SEC for an order permitting a full or
partial suspension of the right of Unitholders to redeem their Units.           

    Units. Ownership of Units is evidenced in book-entry form unless a
Unitholder makes a written request to the Trustee that ownership be in          
certificate form. Units are transferable by making a written request to the     
Trustee and, in the case of Units in certificate form, by presentation and      
surrender of the certificate to the Trustee properly endorsed or accompanied by 
a written instrument or instruments of transfer. A Unitholder must sign the     
written request, or certificate transfer instrument, exactly as his name appears
on the records of the Trustee and on the face of any certificate with the       
signature guaranteed by a participant in the Securities Transfer Agents         
Medallion Program ("STAMP") or a signature guaranty program accepted by the     
Trustee. The Trustee may require additional documents such as, but not limited  
to, trust instruments, certificates of death, appointments as executor or       
administrator or certificates of corporate authority. Certificates will be      
issued in denominations of one Unit or any multiple thereof. Although no such   
charge is now made, the Trustee may require a Unitholder to pay a reasonable fee
for each certificate re-issued or transferred and to pay any governmental charge
that may be imposed in connection with each transfer or interchange. Destroyed, 
stolen, mutilated or lost certificates will be replaced upon delivery to the    
Trustee of satisfactory indemnity, evidence of ownership and payment of expenses
incurred. Mutilated certificates must be surrendered to the Trustee for         
replacement.                                                                    

        Reports Provided. Unitholders will receive a statement of interest and
other receipts received for each distribution. For as long as the Sponsor deems 
it to be in the best interest of Unitholders, the accounts of each Trust will be
audited annually by independent registered public accounting firm and the report
of the accountants will be furnished to Unitholders upon request. Within a      
reasonable period of time after the end of each year, the Trustee will furnish  
to each person who was a registered Unitholder during that year a statement     
describing the interest and principal received on the bonds, actual Trust       
distributions, Trust expenses, a list of the bonds and other Trust information. 
Unitholders will be furnished the Evaluator's evaluations of the bonds upon     
request to the Trustee. If you have questions regarding your account or your    
Trust, please contact your financial advisor or the Trustee. The Sponsor does   
not have access to individual account information.                              

INSURANCE ON THE BONDS IN THE INSURED TRUSTS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

         Insurance has been obtained guaranteeing prompt payment of interest and
principal, when due, in respect of the bonds in each Insured Trust. An insurance
policy obtained by an Insured Trust, if any, is non-cancelable and will continue
in force so long as the Trust is in existence, the respective Portfolio Insurer 
is still in business and the bonds described in the policy continue to be held  
by the Trust. Any portfolio insurance premium for an Insured Trust is paid by   
the Trust on a monthly basis. The premium for any Preinsured Bond insurance has 
been paid by the issuer, by a prior owner of the bonds or the Sponsor and any   
policy is non-cancelable and will continue in force so long as the bonds so     
insured are outstanding and the Preinsured Bond Insurer remains in business. The
Portfolio Insurers and the Preinsured Bond Insurers are described in "Portfolio"
and the notes thereto in Prospectus Part I. More detailed information regarding 
insurance on the bonds and the Preinsured Bond and Portfolio Insurers is        
included in the Information Supplement. See "Additional Information".           

The portfolio insurance obtained by an Insured Trust, if any, 
guarantees the timely payment of principal and interest on the bonds when they  
fall due. For this purpose, "when due" generally means the stated payment or    
maturity date for the payment of principal and interest. However, in the event  
(a) an issuer defaults in the payment of principal or interest, (b) an issuer   
enters into a bankruptcy proceeding or (c) the maturity of the bond is          
accelerated, the affected Portfolio Insurer has the option to pay the           
outstanding principal amount of the bond plus accrued interest to the date of   
payment and thereby retire the bond from the Trust prior to the bond's stated   
maturity date. The insurance does not guarantee the market value of the bonds or
the value of the Units. The Trustee, upon the sale of a bond covered under a    
portfolio insurance policy has the right to obtain permanent insurance with     
respect to the bond (i.e., insurance to maturity of the bond regardless of the  
identity of the holder) (the "Permanent Insurance") upon the payment of a single
predetermined insurance premium and expenses from the proceeds of the sale of   
the bond. It is expected that the Trustee would exercise the right to obtain    
Permanent Insurance only if upon exercise the Trust would receive net proceeds  
in excess of the sale proceeds if the bonds were sold on an uninsured basis.    

      Each Portfolio Insurer is subject to regulation by the department of
insurance in the state in which it is qualified to do business. Such regulation,
however, is no guarantee that each Portfolio Insurer will be able to perform on 
its contract of insurance in the event a claim should be made. At the date      
hereof, it is reported that no claims have been submitted or are expected to be 
submitted to any of the Portfolio Insurers which would materially impair the    
ability of any such company to meet its commitment pursuant to any contract of  
insurance. The information relating to each Portfolio Insurer has been furnished
by such companies. The financial information with respect to each Portfolio     
Insurer appears in reports filed with state insurance regulatory authorities and
is subject to audit and review by such authorities. No representation is made   
herein as to the accuracy or adequacy of such information or as to the absence  
of material adverse changes in such information subsequent to the dates thereof.

    Van Kampen Funds Inc. and your Trust have adopted a code of ethics
requiring Van Kampen's employees who have access to information on Trust        
transactions to report personal securities transactions. The purpose of the code
is to avoid potential conflicts of interest and to prevent fraud, deception or  
misconduct with respect to your Trust. The Information Supplement contains      
additional information about the Sponsor.                                       

        If the Sponsor shall fail to perform any of its duties under the Trust
Agreement or become incapable of acting or shall become bankrupt or its affairs 
are taken over by public authorities, then the Trustee may (i) appoint a        
successor Sponsor at rates of compensation deemed by the Trustee to be          
reasonable and not exceeding amounts prescribed by the Securities and Exchange  
Commission, (ii) terminate the Trust Agreement and liquidate the Trusts as      
provided therein or (iii) continue to act as Trustee without terminating the    
Trust Agreement.                                                                

         Trustee. The Trustee is The Bank of New York, a trust company organized
under the laws of New York. The Bank of New York has its principal unit         
investment trust division offices at 2 Hanson Place, 12th Floor, Brooklyn, New
York 11217, telephone (800) 221-7668. If you have any questions regarding your  
account or your Trust, please contact the Trustee at its principal unit         
investment trust division offices or your financial advisor. The Sponsor does   
not have access to individual account information. The Bank of New York is      
subject to supervision and examination by the Superintendent of Banks of the    
State of New York and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and 
its deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to the    
extent permitted by law. Additional information regarding the Trustee is set    
forth in the Information Supplement, including the Trustee's qualifications and 
duties, its ability to resign, the effect of a merger involving the Trustee and 
the Sponsor's ability to remove and replace the Trustee. See "Additional
Information".                                                                   

Portfolio Administration. The Trusts are not managed funds and, except
as provided in the Trust Agreement, bonds generally will not be sold or         
replaced. The Sponsor may, however, direct that bonds be sold in certain limited
situations to protect the Trust based on advice from the Supervisor. These      
situations may include default in interest or principal payments on the bonds or
other obligations of an issuer, an advanced refunding or institution of certain 
legal proceedings. In addition, the Trustee may sell bonds designated by the    
Supervisor for purposes of redeeming Units or payment of expenses. The          
Supervisor will consider a variety of factors in designating bonds to be sold   
including interest rates, market value and marketability. Except in limited     
circumstances, the Trustee must reject any offer by an issuer to issue bonds in 
exchange or substitution for the bonds (such as a refunding or refinancing      
plan). The Trustee will promptly notify Unitholders of any exchange or          
substitution. The Information Supplement contains a more detailed description of
circumstances in which bonds may be sold or replaced. See "Additional
Information".                                                                   

Replacement Bonds. No assurance can be given that a Trust will retain
its present size or composition because bonds may be sold, redeemed or mature   
from time to time and the proceeds will be distributed to Unitholders and will  
not be reinvested. In the event of a failure to deliver any bond that has been  
purchased under a contract ("Failed Bonds"), the Sponsor is authorized under the
Trust Agreement to direct the Trustee to acquire other bonds ("Replacement
Bonds") to make up the original portfolio of a Trust. Replacement Bonds must be 
purchased within 20 days after delivery of the notice of the failed contract and
the purchase price (exclusive of accrued interest) may not exceed the amount of 
funds reserved for the purchase of the Failed Bonds. The Replacement Bonds must 
be substantially identical to the Failed Bonds in terms of (i) the exemption    
from federal and state taxation, (ii) maturity, (iii) yield to maturity and     
current return, (iv) Standard & Poor's or Moody's ratings, and (v) insurance in 
an Insured Trust. The Trustee shall notify all Unitholders of a Trust within    
five days after the acquisition of a Replacement Bond and shall make a pro rata 
distribution of the amount, if any, by which the cost of the Failed Bond        
exceeded the cost of the Replacement Bond plus accrued interest. If Failed Bonds
are not replaced, the Sponsor will refund the sales charge attributable to the  
Failed Bonds to all Unitholders of the Trust and distribute the principal and   
accrued interest (at the coupon rate of the Failed Bonds to the date of removal 
from the Trust) attributable to the Failed Bonds within 30 days after removal.  
All interest paid to a Unitholder which accrued after the expected date of      
settlement for Units will be paid by the Sponsor and accordingly will not be    
treated as tax-exempt income. If Failed Bonds are not replaced, the Estimated   
Net Annual Interest Income per Unit would be reduced and the Estimated Current  
Return and Estimated Long-Term Return might be lowered. Unitholders may not be  
able to reinvest their proceeds in other securities at a yield equal to or in   
excess of the yield of the Failed Bonds.                                        

         Amendment of Trust Agreement. The Sponsor and the Trustee may amend the
Trust Agreement without the consent of Unitholders to correct any provision     
which may be defective or to make other provisions that will not adversely      
affect the interest of the Unitholders (as determined in good faith by the      
Sponsor and the Trustee). The Trust Agreement may not be amended to increase the
number of Units or to permit the acquisition of bonds in addition to or in      
substitution for any of the bonds initially deposited in the Trust, except for  
the substitution of certain refunding bonds. The Trustee will notify Unitholders
of any amendment.                                                               

Termination of Trust Agreement. A Trust will terminate upon the
redemption, sale or other disposition of the last bond held in the Trust. A     
Trust may also be terminated at any time by consent of Unitholders of 51% of the
Units then outstanding or by the Trustee when the value of the Trust is less    
than 20% of the original principal amount of bonds. The Trustee will notify each
Unitholder of any termination within a reasonable time and will then liquidate  
any remaining bonds. The sale of bonds upon termination may result in a lower   
amount than might otherwise be realized if the sale was not required at that    
time. For this reason, among others, the amount realized by a Unitholder upon   
termination may be less than the principal amount of bonds per Unit or value at 
the time of purchase. The Trustee will distribute to each Unitholder his share  
of the balance of the Interest and Principal Accounts after deduction of costs, 
expenses or indemnities. The Unitholder will receive a final distribution       
statement with this distribution. When the Trustee in its sole discretion       
determines that any amounts held in reserve are no longer necessary, it will    
distribute these amounts to Unitholders. The Information Supplement contains    
further information regarding termination of a Trust. See "Additional
Information".                                                                   

   Limitation on Liabilities. The Sponsor, Supervisor, Evaluator and
Trustee shall be under no liability to Unitholders for taking any action or for 
refraining from taking any action in good faith pursuant to the Trust Agreement,
or for errors in judgment, but shall be liable only for their own willful       
misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence (negligence in the case of the       
Trustee) in the performance of their duties or by reason of their reckless      
disregard of their obligations and duties hereunder. The Trustee shall not be   
liable for depreciation or loss incurred by reason of the sale by the Trustee of
any of the bonds. In the event of the failure of the Sponsor to act under the   
Trust Agreement, the Trustee may act thereunder and shall not be liable for any 
action taken by it in good faith under the Trust Agreement. The Trustee is not  
liable for any taxes or governmental charges imposed on the bonds, on it as     
Trustee under the Trust Agreement or on the Fund which the Trustee may be       
required to pay under any present or future law of the United States of America 
or of any other taxing authority having jurisdiction. In addition, the Trust    
Agreement contains other customary provisions limiting the liability of the     
Trustee. The Trustee and Sponsor may rely on any evaluation furnished by the    
Evaluator and have no responsibility for the accuracy thereof. Determinations by
the Evaluator shall be made in good faith upon the basis of the best information
available to it; provided, however, that the Evaluator shall be under no        
liability to the Trustee, Sponsor or Unitholders for errors in judgment.        

FEDERAL TAX STATUS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  This section summarizes some of the main U.S. federal income tax
consequences of owning Units of a Trust. This section is current as of the date 
of this prospectus. Tax laws and interpretations change frequently, and these   
summaries do not describe all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers. For     
example, these summaries generally do not describe your situation if you are a  
corporation, a non-U.S. person, a broker/dealer, or other investor with special 
circumstances. In addition, this section does not describe your state, local or 
foreign tax consequences.                                                       

    This federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice and
opinion of counsel to the Sponsor. The Internal Revenue Service could disagree  
with any conclusions set forth in this section. In addition, our counsel was not
asked to review, and has not reached a conclusion with respect to the federal   
income tax treatment of the assets to be deposited in the Trust. This may not be
sufficient for you to use for the purpose of avoiding penalties under federal   
tax law.                                                                        

         As with any investment, you should seek advice based on your individual
circumstances from your own tax advisor. Assets of the Trust. The Trust will    
hold various debt obligations (the "Bonds") of state and local governmental     
entities that constitute debt the interest on which is excluded from gross      
income for federal income tax purposes. It is possible that the Trust will also 
hold other assets, including assets that are treated differently for federal    
income tax purposes from those described above, in which case you will have     
federal income tax consequences different from or in addition to those described
in this section. All of the assets held by the Trust constitute the "Trust      
Assets." Neither our counsel nor we have analyzed the proper federal income tax 
treatment of the Trust Assets and thus neither our counsel nor we have reached a
conclusion regarding the federal income tax treatment of the Trust Assets.      

        Trust Status. If the Trust is at all times operated in accordance with
the documents establishing the Trust and certain requirements of federal income 
tax law are met, the Trust will not be taxed as a corporation for federal income
tax purposes. As a Unit owner, you will be treated as the owner of a pro rata   
portion of each of the Trust Assets, and as such you will be considered to have 
received a pro rata share of income (e.g., interest, accruals of original issue 
discount and market discount, and capital gains, if any) from each Trust Asset  
when such income would be considered to be received by you if you directly owned
the Trust Assets. This is true even if you elect to have your distributions     
reinvested into additional Units. In addition, the income from Trust Assets that
you must take into account for federal income tax purposes is not reduced by    
amounts used to pay sales charges or Trust expenses.                            

     Exclusion from Gross Income of Interest. At the respective times of
issuance of the Bonds, opinions relating to the validity thereof and to the     
exclusion of interest thereon from Federal gross income were rendered by bond   
counsel to the respective issuing authorities, based on certain representations 
and subject to compliance with certain covenants. Neither the Sponsor nor its   
counsel, have made any special review for the Trust of the proceedings relating 
to the issuance of the Bonds, the bases for the bond counsel opinions, or       
compliance with the covenants required for tax-exemption. The Internal Revenue  
Service (the "Service") has an ongoing program of auditing tax-exempt           
obligations to determine whether, in the view of the Service, interest on such  
tax-exempt obligations is includible in the gross income of the owners thereof  
for federal income tax purposes. It cannot be predicted whether or not the      
Service will commence an audit of any of the Bonds. If an audit is commenced,   
under current procedures of the Service, Unit holders may have no right to      
participate in such procedure. If the interest on a Bond should be determined to
be taxable, the Bond would generally have to be sold at a substantial discount. 
In addition, investors could be required to pay income tax on interest received 
both prior to and after the date on which interest is determined to be taxable. 

         Your pro rata share of interest on the Bonds will be excluded from your
gross income for federal income tax purposes to the same extent that such       
interest would be excluded from your gross income if you directly owned the     
Bonds. However, such interest may be taken into account in computing the        
alternative minimum tax, and the branch profits tax imposed on certain foreign  
corporations.                                                                   

    Ownership of the Units may result in collateral federal income tax
consequences to certain Unit holders, including, without limitation,            
corporations subject to the branch profits tax, financial institutions, certain 
insurance companies, certain S corporations, individual recipients of Social    
Security or Railroad Retirement benefits and Unit holders who may be deemed to  
have incurred (or continued) indebtedness to purchase or carry tax-exempt       
obligations.                                                                    

     If you are a "substantial user" of the facilities financed with the
proceeds of certain Bonds, or a related person to a substantial user, you will  
not be able to exclude from your gross income interest with respect to these    
Bonds. "Substantial user" and "related person" are defined under federal income 
tax law.                                                                        

       For purposes of computing the alternative minimum tax for individuals
and corporations, interest on certain bonds is included as an item of tax       
preference.                                                                     

  In the case of certain corporations, the alternative minimum tax
depends upon the corporation's alternative minimum taxable income ("AMTI"),     
which is the corporation's taxable income with certain adjustments. One of the  
adjustment items used in computing AMTI of a corporation (excluding S           
Corporations, Regulated Investment Companies, Real Estate Investment Trusts,    
REMICs or FASITs) is an amount equal to 75% of the excess of such corporation's 
"adjusted current earnings" over an amount equal to its AMTI (before such       
adjustment item and the alternative tax net operating loss deduction. "Adjusted 
current earnings" includes all tax-exempt interest, including interest on all of
the Bonds in the Trust. In addition, a branch profits tax is levied on the      
"effectively connected earnings and profits" of certain foreign corporations,   
which include tax-exempt interest, such as interest on the Bonds in the Trust.  

   Your Tax Basis and Income or Loss upon Disposition. If your Trust
disposes of Trust Assets, you will generally recognize gain or loss. If you     
dispose of your Units or redeem your Units for cash, you will also generally    
recognize gain or loss. To determine the amount of this gain or loss, you must  
subtract your tax basis in the related Trust Assets from your share of the total
amount received in the transaction. You can generally determine your initial tax
basis in each Trust Asset by apportioning the cost of your Units, including     
sales charges, among the Trust Assets ratably according to their values on the  
date you acquire your Units. In certain circumstances, however, you may have to 
adjust your tax basis after you acquire your Units (for example, in the case of 
accruals of original issue discount, market discount, premium and accrued       
interest, as discussed below).                                                  

         If you are an individual, the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net
capital gain is generally 15% (generally 5% for certain taxpayers in the 10% and
15% tax brackets). These capital gains rates are generally effective for taxable
years beginning before January 1, 2011. For later periods, if you are an        
individual, the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net capital gain is       
generally 20% (10% for certain taxpayers in the 10% and 15% tax brackets). The  
20% rate is reduced to 18% and the 10% rate is reduced to 8% for long-term      
capital gains from most property acquired after December 31, 2000 with a holding
period of more than five years.                                                 

         Net capital gain equals net long-term capital gain minus net short-term
capital loss for the taxable year. Capital gain or loss is long-term if the     
holding period for the asset is more than one year and is short-term if the     
holding period for the asset is one year or less. You must exclude the date you 
purchase your Units to determine your holding period. The tax rates for capital 
gains realized from assets held for one year or less are generally the same as  
for ordinary income. The Internal Revenue Code, however, also treats certain    
capital gains as ordinary income in special situations.                         

      Discount, Accrued Interest and Premium on Bonds. Some Bonds may have
been issued with original issue discount. This generally means that the Bonds   
were originally issued at a price below their face (or par) value. Original     
issue discount accrues on a daily basis and generally is treated as interest    
income for federal income tax purposes. Thus, the accrual of original discount  
will be excluded from your gross income for federal income tax purposes to the  
same extent as interest on the Bonds, as discussed above. Your basis of each    
Bond that was issued with original issue discount must be increased as original 
issue discount accrues.                                                         

     Some Bonds may have been purchased by you or your Trust at a market
discount. Market discount is generally the excess of the stated redemption price
at maturity for the Bond over the purchase price of the Bond. Market discount   
can arise based on the price your Trust pays for a Bond or based on the price   
you pay for your Units. Market discount is taxed as ordinary income. You will   
recognize this income when your Trust receives principal payments on the Bond,  
when the Bond is disposed of or redeemed, or when you sell or redeem your Units.
Alternatively, you may elect to include market discount in taxable income as it 
accrues. Whether or not you make this election will affect how you calculate    
your basis and the timing of certain interest expense deductions.               

        Alternatively, some Bonds may have been purchased by you or your Trust
at a premium. Generally, if the tax basis of your pro rata portion of any Bond, 
generally including sales charges, exceeds the amount payable at maturity, such 
excess is considered premium. You must amortize bond premium on a constant yield
basis over the remaining term of the Bond in a manner that takes into account   
potential call dates and call prices. You cannot deduct amortized bond premium  
relating to a Bond. The amortized bond premium is treated as a reduction in the 
tax-exempt interest received. As bond premium is amortized, it reduces your     
basis in the Bond. The tax basis reduction requirement may result in your       
realizing a taxable gain when your Units are sold or redeemed for an amount     
equal to or less than your cost.                                                

     If the price of your Units includes accrued interest on a Bond, you
must include the accrued interest in your tax basis in that Bond. When your     
Trust receives this accrued interest, you must treat it as a return of capital  
and reduce your tax basis in the Bond.                                          

         This discussion provides only the general rules with respect to the tax
treatment of original issue discount, market discount and premium. The rules,   
however, are complex and special rules apply in certain circumstances. For      
example, the accrual of market discount or premium may differ from the          
discussion set forth above in the case of Bonds that were issued with original  
issue discount.                                                                 

      Exchanges. If you elect to have your proceeds from your Trust rolled
over into a future series of the Trust, it is considered a sale for federal     
income tax purposes and any gain on the sale will be treated as a capital gain, 
and any loss will be treated as a capital loss. However, any loss you incur in  
connection with the exchange of your Units of your Trusts for units of the next 
series will generally be disallowed with respect to this deemed sale and        
subsequent deemed repurchase, to the extent the two trusts have substantially   
identical Trust Assets under the wash sale provisions of the Internal Revenue   
Code.                                                                           

    Limitations on the Deductibility of Trust Expenses. Generally, for
federal income tax purposes, you must take into account your full pro rata share
of your Trust's income, even if some of that income is used to pay Trust        
expenses. You may deduct your pro rata share of each expense paid by your Trust 
to the same extent as if you directly paid the expense. You may be required to  
treat some or all of the expenses of your Trust as miscellaneous itemized       
deductions. Individuals may only deduct certain miscellaneous itemized          
deductions to the extent they exceed 2% of adjusted gross income. Your ability  
to deduct Trust expenses is also limited to the extent the expenses are         
allocable to tax-exempt interest from the Trust.                                

STATE TRUST RISK FACTORS AND TAX STATUS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

       Arizona Risk Factors. The financial condition of the State of Arizona
is affected by various national, economic, social and environmental policies and
conditions. Additionally, Constitutional and statutory limitations imposed on   
the State and its local governments concerning taxes, bond indebtedness and     
other matters may constrain the revenue-generating capacity of the State and its
local governments and, therefore, the ability of the issuers of the Bonds to    
satisfy their obligations.                                                      

 The economic vitality of the State and its various regions and,
therefore, the ability of the State and its local governments to satisfy the    
Bonds, are affected by numerous factors.                                        

         The State may be a party to numerous lawsuits in which an adverse final
decision could materially affect the State's governmental operations and        
consequently its ability to pay debt service on its obligations.                

     Further information concerning Arizona risk factors may be obtained
upon request to the Sponsor as described in "Additional Information".           

       Tax Status. At the time of the closing for each Arizona Trust,special
counsel to the Trust for Arizona tax matters rendered an opinion under then     
existing Arizona income tax law applicable to taxpayers whose income is subject 
to Arizona income taxation substantially to the effect that:                    

      The assets of the Trust will consist of interest-bearing obligations
issued by or on behalf of the State of Arizona (the "State"), its political     
subdivisions and authorities (the "Arizona Bonds") and certain bonds issued by  
Puerto Rico authorities (the "Possession Bonds") (collectively the Arizona Bonds
and Possession Bonds shall be referred to herein as the "Bonds"), provided the  
interest on such Bonds received by the Trust is exempt from State income taxes. 

     Neither the Sponsor nor its counsel have independently examined the
Bonds to be deposited in and held in the Trust. However, although no opinion is 
expressed herein regarding such matters, it is assumed that: (i) the Bonds were 
validly issued, (ii) the interest thereon is excludable from gross income for   
Federal income tax purposes and (iii) interest on the Bonds, if received        
directly by a Unitholder would be exempt from the Arizona income tax (the       
"Arizona Income Tax"). We have assumed that at the respective times of issuance 
of the Bonds, opinions relating to the validity thereof and to the exemption of 
interest thereon from Federal income tax were rendered by bond counsel to the   
respective issuing authorities. In addition, it is assumed that with respect to 
the Arizona Bonds, bond counsel to the issuing authorities rendered opinions    
that the interest on the Bonds is exempt from the Arizona Income Tax and, with  
respect to the Possession Bonds, bond counsel to the issuing authorities        
rendered opinions to the effect that the interest on the Possession Bonds is    
exempt from all state and local income taxation. Neither the Sponsor nor its    
counsel has made any review for the Trust of the proceedings relating to the    
issuance of the Bonds or of the bases for the opinions rendered in connection   
therewith.                                                                      

     In the opinion of special counsel to the Trust, under then existing
Arizona law, and based on the assumptions set forth above:                      

         For Arizona income tax purposes, each Unitholder will be treated as the
owner of a pro rata portion of the Arizona Trust, and the income of the Arizona 
Trust therefore will be treated as the income of the Unitholder under State law.

 For Arizona income tax purposes, interest on the Bonds which is
excludable from Federal gross income and which is exempt from Arizona income    
taxes when received by the Arizona Trust, and which would be excludable from    
Federal gross income and exempt from Arizona income taxes if received directly  
by a Unitholder, will retain its status as tax-exempt interest when received by 
the Arizona Trust and distributed to the Unitholders.                           

 To the extent that interest derived from the Arizona Trust by a
Unitholder with respect to the Arizona Bonds is excludable from Federal gross   
income, such interest will not be subject to Arizona income taxes.              

        Interest on the Possession Bonds which is excludable from gross income
for Federal tax purposes and is exempt from state and local taxation pursuant to
Federal law when received by the Arizona Trust will be exempt from Arizona      
income taxation and therefore will not be includible in the income of the       
Unitholders for income tax purposes when distributed by the Arizona Trust and   
received by the Unitholders.                                                    

      Each Unitholder will receive taxable gain or loss for Arizona income
tax purposes when Bonds held in the Arizona Trust are sold, exchanged, redeemed 
or paid at maturity, or when the Unitholder redeems or sells Units, at a price  
that differs from original cost as adjusted for accretion of Bond discount or   
amortization of premium and other basis adjustments, including any basis        
reduction that may be required to reflect a Unitholder's share of interest, if  
any, accruing on Bonds during the interval between the Unitholder's settlement  
date and the date such Bonds are delivered to the Arizona Trust, if later.      

   Amounts paid by the Insurer under an insurance policy or policies
issued to the Trust, if any, with respect to the Bonds in the Trust which       
represent maturing interest on defaulted Bonds held by the Trustee will be      
exempt from State income taxes if, and to the same extent as, such interest     
would have been so exempt if paid by the issuer of the defaulted Bonds provided 
that, at the time such policies are purchased, the amounts paid for such        
policies are reasonable, customary and consistent with the reasonable           
expectation that the issuer of the Bonds, rather than the insurer, will pay debt
service on the Bonds.                                                           

       Arizona law does not permit a deduction for interest paid or incurred
on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or carry Units in the Arizona 
Trust, the interest on which is exempt from Arizona income taxes. Special rules 
apply to financial institutions, and such institutions should consult their own 
tax advisors with respect to deductions of interest.                            

     Neither the Bonds nor the Units will be subject to Arizona property
taxes, sales tax or use tax.                                                    

 Counsel to the Sponsor has expressed no opinion with respect to
taxation under any other provision of Arizona law. Ownership of the Units may   
result in collateral Arizona tax consequences to certain taxpayers. Prospective 
investors should consult their tax advisors as to the applicability of any such 
collateral consequences.                                                        

         Arkansas Risk Factors. The financial condition of the State of Arkansas
is affected by various national, economic, social and environmental policies and
conditions. Additionally, Constitutional and statutory limitations imposed on   
the State and its local governments concerning taxes, bond indebtedness and     
other matters may constrain the revenue-generating capacity of the State and its
local governments and, therefore, the ability of the issuers of the Bonds to    
satisfy their obligations.                                                      

 The economic vitality of the State and its various regions and,
therefore, the ability of the State and its local governments to satisfy the    
Bonds, are affected by numerous factors.                                        

         The State may be a party to numerous lawsuits in which an adverse final
decision could materially affect the State's governmental operations and        
consequently its ability to pay debt service on its obligations.                

      Further information concerning Arkansas risk factors may be obtained
upon request to the Sponsor as described in "Additional Information".           

         Tax Status. At the time of the closing for each Arkansas Trust, Special
Counsel to each Arkansas Trust for Arkansas tax matters rendered an opinion     
under then existing Arkansas income tax law applicable to taxpayers whose income
is subject to Arkansas income taxation substantially to the effect that:        

      The Arkansas Trust is not an association taxable as a corporation or
otherwise for purposes of Arkansas income taxation; Each Arkansas Unitholder    
will be treated as the owner of a pro rata portion of the Arkansas Trust for    
Arkansas income tax purposes, and will have a taxable event when the Arkansas   
Trust disposes of a Bond or when the Unitholder sells, exchanges, redeems or    
otherwise disposes of his Units;                                                

     Any gains realized upon the sale, exchange, maturity, redemption or
other disposition of Bonds held by the Arkansas Trust resulting in the          
distribution of income to Arkansas Unitholders will be subject to Arkansas      
income taxation to the extent that such income would be subject to Arkansas     
income taxation if the Bonds were held, sold, exchanged, redeemed or otherwise  
disposed of by the Arkansas Unitholders; and                                    

        Interest on Bonds, issued by the State of Arkansas, or by or on behalf
of political subdivisions, thereof, that would be exempt from Federal income    
taxation when paid directly to an Arkansas Unitholder will be exempt from       
Arkansas income taxation when received by the Arkansas Trust and attributed to  
such Arkansas Unitholder and when distributed to such Arkansas Unitholder.      

  California Risk Factors. The financial condition of the State of
California is affected by various national, economic, social and environmental  
policies and conditions. Additionally, limitations imposed by constitutional    
amendments, legislative measures, or voter initiatives on the State and its     
local governments concerning taxes, bond indebtedness and other matters may     
constrain the revenue-generating capacity of the State and its local governments
and, therefore, the ability of the issuers of the Bonds to satisfy their        
obligations.                                                                    

 The economic vitality of the State and its various regions and,
therefore, the ability of the State and its local governments to satisfy the    
Bonds, are affected by numerous factors, such as natural disasters,             
complications with exports and industry deregulation.                           

         The State may be a party to numerous lawsuits in which an adverse final
decision could materially affect the State's governmental operations and        
consequently its ability to pay debt service on its obligations.                

        Further information concerning California risk factors may be obtained
upon request to the Sponsor as described in "Additional Information".           

  Tax Status. At the time of the closing for the California Trust,
special counsel to the Trust for California tax matters rendered an opinion     
under then existing California income tax law applicable to taxpayers whose     
income is subject to California income taxation substantially to the effect     
that:                                                                           

    We have examined the income tax laws of the State of California to
determine its applicability to the Trust and to the holders of Units in the     
Trust who are full-time residents of the State of California ("California       
Unitholders"). The assets of the Trust will consist of bonds issued by the State
of California or a local government of California (the "California Bonds") or by
the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or its authority (the "Possession Bonds")       
(collectively, the "Bonds"). For purposes of the following opinions, it is      
assumed that each asset of the Trust is debt, the interest on which is excluded 
from gross income for Federal income tax purposes.                              

     Neither the Sponsor nor its counsel have independently examined the
Bonds to be deposited in and held in the Trust. However, although Chapman and   
Cutler LLP expresses no opinion with respect to the issuance of the Bonds, in   
rendering its opinion expressed herein, it has assumed that: (i) the Bonds were 
validly issued; (ii) the interest thereon is excludable from gross income for   
Federal income tax purposes; and (iii) interest on the Bonds, if received       
directly by a California Unitholder, would be exempt from the income tax imposed
by the State of California that is applicable to individuals, trusts and estates
(the "California Personal Income Tax"). This opinion does not address the       
taxation of persons other than full time residents of California. We have       
assumed that, at the respective times of issuance of the Bonds, opinions that   
the Bonds were validly issued and that interest on the Bonds is excluded from   
gross income for Federal income tax purposes were rendered by bond counsel to   
the respective issuing authorities. In addition, we have assumed that, with     
respect to the California Bonds, bond counsel to the issuing authorities        
rendered opinions that the interest on the California Bonds is exempt from the  
California Personal Income Tax and, with respect to the Possession Bonds, bond  
counsel to the issuing authorities rendered opinions that the Possession Bonds  
and the interest thereon is exempt from all state and local income taxation.    
Neither the Sponsor nor its counsel has made any review for the Trust of the    
proceedings relating to the issuance of the Bonds or of the basis for the       
opinions rendered in connection therewith.                                      

        Based upon the foregoing, and upon an investigation of such matters of
law as special counsel to the Trust considered to be applicable special counsel 
to the Trust is of the opinion that, under then existing California law:        

 1. The Trust is not an association taxable as a corporation for
purposes of the California Corporation Tax Law, and each California Unitholder  
will be treated as the owner of a pro rata portion of the Trust, and the income 
of such portion of the Trust will be treated as the income of the California    
Unitholders under the California Personal Income Tax.                           

        2. Interest on the Bonds which is exempt from tax under the California
Personal Income Tax when received by the Trust and which would be excludable    
from California taxable income for purposes of the California Personal Income   
Tax if received directly by a California Unitholder, will be excludable from    
California taxable income for purposes of the California Personal Income Tax    
when received by the Trust and distributed to a California Unitholder.          

     3. Each California Unitholder of the Trust will generally recognize
gain or loss for California Personal Income Tax purposes if the Trustee disposes
of a Bond (whether by redemption, sale or otherwise) or when the California     
Unitholder redeems or sells Units of the Trust, to the extent that such a       
transaction results in a recognized gain or loss to such California Unitholder  
for Federal income tax purposes. However, there are certain differences between 
the recognition of gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes and for         
California Personal Income Tax purposes, and California Unitholders are advised 
to consult their own tax advisors. Tax basis reduction requirements relating to 
amortization of bond premium may, under some circumstances, result in a         
California Unitholder realizing taxable gain for California Personal Income Tax 
purposes when a Unit is sold or redeemed for an amount equal to or less than its
original cost.                                                                  

       4. Under the California Personal Income Tax, interest on indebtedness
incurred or continued by a California Unitholder to purchase Units in the Trust 
is not deductible for purposes of the California Personal Income Tax.           

    This opinion relates only to California Unitholders subject to the
California Personal Income Tax. No opinion is expressed with respect to the     
taxation of California Unitholders subject to the California Corporation Tax Law
and such California Unitholders are advised to consult their own tax advisors.  
Please note, however, that interest on the underlying Bonds attributed to a     
California Unitholder that is subject to the California Corporation Tax Law may 
be includible in its gross income for purposes of determining its California    
franchise tax. We have not examined any of the Bonds to be deposited and held in
the Trust or the proceedings for the issuance thereof or the opinions of bond   
counsel with respect thereto, and we express no opinion with respect to taxation
under any other provisions of California law. Ownership of the Units may result 
in collateral California tax consequences to certain taxpayers. Prospective     
investors should consult their tax advisors as to the applicability of any such 
collateral consequences.                                                        

         Colorado Risk Factors. The financial condition of the State of Colorado
is affected by various national, economic, social and environmental policies and
conditions. Additionally, Constitutional and statutory limitations imposed on   
the State and its local governments concerning taxes, bond indebtedness and     
other matters may constrain the revenue-generating capacity of the State and its
local governments and, therefore, the ability of the issuers of the Bonds to    
satisfy their obligations.                                                      

 The economic vitality of the State and its various regions and,
therefore, the ability of the State and its local governments to satisfy the    
Bonds, are affected by numerous factors.                                        

         The State may be a party to numerous lawsuits in which an adverse final
decision could materially affect the State's governmental operations and        
consequently its ability to pay debt service on its obligations.                

      Further information concerning Colorado risk factors may be obtained
upon request to the Sponsor as described in "Additional Information".           

         Tax Status. At the time of the closing for each Colorado Trust, counsel
to the Fund for Colorado tax matters rendered an opinion under then existing    
Colorado income tax law applicable to taxpayers whose income is subject to      
Colorado income taxation substantially to the effect that:                      

   The assets of the Colorado Trust will consist of interest-bearing
obligations issued by or on behalf of the State of Colorado ("Colorado") or     
counties, municipalities, authorities or political subdivisions thereof (the    
"Colorado Bonds") or by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (the "Puerto Rico       
Bonds") (collectively, the "Bonds") the interest on which is expected to qualify
as exempt from Colorado income taxes.                                           

     Neither the Sponsor nor its counsel have independently examined the
Bonds to be deposited in and held in the Trust. However, although counsel to the
Fund expresses no opinion with respect to the issuance of the Bonds, in         
rendering its opinion expressed herein, it has assumed that: (i) the Bonds were 
validly issued, (ii) the interest thereon is excludable from gross income for   
Federal income tax purposes, and (iii) interest on the Bonds, if received       
directly by a Unitholder, would be exempt from the income tax imposed by the    
State that is applicable to individuals and corporations (the"State Income      
Tax").                                                                          

       It is assumed that, at the respective times of issuance of the Bonds:
(i) opinions relating to the validity thereof and to the exemption of interest  
thereon from Federal income tax were rendered by bond counsel to the respective 
issuing authorities; (ii) with respect to the Colorado Bonds, bond counsel to   
the issuing authorities rendered opinions that the interest on the Colorado     
Bonds is exempt from the State Income Tax (the "State Income Tax") and, (iii)   
with respect to the Possession Bonds, bond counsel to the issuing authorities   
rendered opinions that the interest on the Puerto Rico Bonds is exempt from all 
state and local income taxation. Neither the Sponsor nor its counsel has made   
any review for the Colorado Trust of the proceedings relating to the issuance of
the Bonds or of the bases for the opinions rendered in connection therewith.    
This opinion does not address the taxation of persons other than full time      
residents of Colorado.                                                          

  In the opinion of counsel to the Fund, in summary under existing
Colorado law:                                                                   

       1. Because Colorado income tax law is based upon the Federal law, the
Colorado Trust is not an association taxable as a corporation for purposes of   
Colorado income taxation.                                                       

      2. With respect to Colorado Unitholders, in view of the relationship
between Federal and Colorado tax computations described above:                  

         (i) Each Colorado Unitholder will be treated as owning a pro rata share
of each asset of the Colorado Trust for Colorado income tax purposes in the     
proportion that the number of Units of such Trust held by the Unitholder bears  
to the total number of outstanding Units of the Colorado Trust, and the income  
of the Colorado Trust will therefore be treated as the income of each Colorado  
Unitholder under Colorado law in the proportion described and an item of income 
of the Colorado Trust will have the same character in the hands of a Colorado   
Unitholder as it would have if the Colorado Unitholder directly owned the assets
of the Colorado Trust;                                                          

   (ii) Interest on Bonds that would not be includible in income for
Colorado income tax purposes when paid directly to a Colorado Unitholder will be
exempt from Colorado income taxation when received by the Colorado Trust and    
attributed to such Colorado Unitholder and when distributed to such Colorado    
Unitholder;                                                                     

    (iii) To the extent that interest income derived from the Colorado
Trust by a Unitholder with respect to Puerto Rico Bonds is exempt from state    
taxation pursuant to 48 U.S.C. 745, such interest will not be subject to the    
Colorado State Income Tax.                                                      

       (iv) Any proceeds paid under an insurance policy or policies. if any,
issued to the Colorado Trust with respect to the Bonds in the Colorado Trust    
which represent maturing interest on defaulted Bonds held by the Trustee will be
excludable from Colorado adjusted gross income if, and to the same extent as,   
such interest is so excludable for Federal income tax purposes if paid in the   
normal course by the issuer notwithstanding that the source of payment is from  
insurance proceeds provided that, at the time such policies are purchased, the  
amounts paid for such policies are reasonable, customary and consistent with the
reasonable expectation that the issuer of the Bonds, rather than the insurer,   
will pay debt service on the Bonds.                                             

         (v) Each Colorado Unitholder will realize taxable gain or loss when the
Colorado Trust disposes of a Bond (whether by sale, exchange, redemption, or    
payment at maturity) or when the Colorado Unitholder redeems or sells Units at a
price that differs from original cost as adjusted for amortization of bond      
discount or premium and other basis adjustments (including any basis reduction  
that may be required to reflect a Colorado Unitholder's share of interest, if   
any, accruing on Bonds during the interval between the Colorado Unitholder's    
settlement date and the date such Bonds are delivered to the Colorado Trust, if 
later);                                                                         

        (vi) Tax basis reduction requirements relating to amortization of bond
premium may, under some circumstances, result in Colorado Unitholders realizing 
taxable gain when their Units are sold or redeemed for an amount equal to or    
less than their original cost; and                                              

       (vii) If interest on indebtedness incurred or continued by a Colorado
Unitholder to purchase Units in the Colorado Trust is not deductible for Federal
income tax purposes, it also will be non-deductible for Colorado income tax     
purposes.                                                                       

     Unitholders should be aware that all tax-exempt interest, including
their share of interest on the Bonds paid to the Colorado Trust, is taken into  
account for purposes of determining eligibility for the Colorado Property       
Tax/Rent/Heat Rebate.                                                           

       Counsel to the Fund has expressed no opinion with respect to taxation
under any other provision of Colorado law. Ownership of the Units may result in 
collateral Colorado tax consequences to certain taxpayers. Prospective investors
should consult their tax advisors as to the applicability of any such collateral
consequences.                                                                   

   Connecticut Risk Factors. The financial condition of the State of
Connecticut is affected by various national, economic, social and environmental 
policies and conditions. Additionally, Constitutional and statutory limitations 
imposed on the State and its local governments concerning taxes, bond           
indebtedness and other matters may constrain the revenue-generating capacity of 
the State and its local governments and, therefore, the ability of the issuers  
of the Bonds to satisfy their obligations.                                      

 The economic vitality of the State and its various regions and,
therefore, the ability of the State and its local governments to satisfy the    
Bonds, are affected by numerous factors.                                        

         The State may be a party to numerous lawsuits in which an adverse final
decision could materially affect the State's governmental operations and        
consequently its ability to pay debt service on its obligations.                

         Further information concerning Connecticut risk factors may be obtained
upon request to the Sponsor as described in "Additional Information" .          

    Tax Status. At the time of the closing for each Connecticut Trust,
special counsel to the Fund for Connecticut tax matters rendered an opinion     
under then existing Connecticut income tax law applicable to taxpayers whose    
income is subject to Connecticut income taxation substantially to the effect    
that:                                                                           

    The assets of the Trust will consist of obligations (the "Bonds");
certain of the Bonds have been issued by or on behalf of the State of           
Connecticut or its political subdivisions or other public instrumentalities,    
state or local authorities, districts, or similar public entities created under 
the laws of the State of Connecticut ("Connecticut Bonds"); the balance of the  
Bonds have been issued by or on behalf of entities classified for the relevant  
purposes as territories or possessions of the United States, including one or   
more of Puerto Rico, Guam, or the Virgin Islands, the interest on the           
obligations of which Federal law would prohibit Connecticut from taxing if      
received directly by the Unitholders. Certain Connecticut Bonds in the Trust    
were issued prior to the enactment of the Connecticut income tax on the         
Connecticut taxable income of individuals, trusts, and estates (the "Connecticut
Income Tax"); therefore, bond counsel to the issuers of such Bonds did not opine
as to the exemption of the interest on such Bonds from such tax. However, the   
Sponsor and special counsel to the Trust for Connecticut tax matters believe    
that such interest will be so exempt. Interest on other Bonds in the Trust, if  
any, is, in the opinion of bond counsel to such issuers, exempt from state      
taxation.                                                                       

        In the opinion of Day, Berry & Howard LLP, special counsel to the Fund
for Connecticut tax matters, which relies explicitly on the opinion of Chapman  
and Cutler LLP regarding Federal income tax matters, in summary under existing  
Connecticut law:                                                                

  The Trust is not liable for any tax on or measured by net income
imposed by the State of Connecticut;                                            

        Interest income of the Trust from a Bond issued by or on behalf of the
State of Connecticut, any political subdivision thereof, or public              
instrumentality, state or local authority, district, or similar public entity   
created under the laws of the State of Connecticut (a "Connecticut Bond"), or   
from a Bond issued by United States territories or possessions the interest on  
which Federal law would prohibit Connecticut from taxing if received directly by
a Unitholder from the issuer thereof, is not taxable under the Connecticut tax  
on the Connecticut taxable income of individuals, trusts, and estates (the      
"Connecticut Income Tax"), when any such interest is received by the Trust or   
distributed by it to such a Unitholder;                                         

         Insurance proceeds received by the Trust representing maturing interest
on defaulted Bonds held by the Trust are not taxable under the Connecticut      
Income Tax if, and to the same extent as, such interest would not be taxable    
thereunder if paid directly to the Trust by the issuer of such Bonds;           

    Gains and losses recognized by a Unitholder for Federal income tax
purposes upon the maturity, redemption, sale, or other disposition by the Trust 
of a Bond held by the Trust or upon the redemption, sale, or other disposition  
of a Unit of the Trust held by a Unitholder are taken into account as gains or  
losses, respectively, for purposes of the Connecticut Income Tax, except that,  
in the case of a Unitholder holding a Unit of the Trust as a capital asset, such
gains and losses recognized upon the maturity, redemption, sale, or exchange of 
a Connecticut Bond held by the Trust are excluded from gains and losses taken   
into account for purposes of such tax, and no opinion is expressed as to the    
treatment for purposes of such tax of gains and losses recognized, to the extent
attributable to Connecticut Bonds, upon the redemption, sale, or other          
disposition by a Unitholder of a Unit of the Trust held by him;                 

         The portion of any interest income or capital gain of the Trust that is
allocable to a Unitholder that is subject to the Connecticut corporation        
business tax is includible in the gross income of such Unitholder for purposes  
of such tax; and                                                                

        An interest in a Unit of the Trust that is owned by or attributable to
a Connecticut resident at the time of his death is includible in his gross      
estate for purposes of the Connecticut succession tax and the Connecticut estate
tax.                                                                            

     Generally, a Unitholder recognizes gain or loss for purposes of the
Connecticut Income Tax to the same extent as the Unitholder recognizes gain or  
loss for Federal income tax purposes. Ordinarily this would mean that gain or   
loss would be recognized by a Unitholder upon the maturity, redemption, sale, or
other disposition by the Trust of a Bond held by it, or upon the redemption,    
sale or other disposition of a Unit of the Trust held by the Unitholder.        
However, gains and losses from the sale or exchange of Connecticut Bonds held as
capital assets are not taken into account for purposes of this tax. Regulations 
indicate that this rule would apply to gain or loss recognized by a Unitholder  
holding a Unit of the Trust as a capital asset upon the maturity, redemption,   
sale, or other disposition of a Connecticut Bond held by the Trust. However, it 
is not clear whether this rule would also apply, to the extent attributable to  
Connecticut Bonds held by the Trust, to gain or loss recognized by a Unitholder 
upon the redemption, sale, or other disposition of a Unit of the Trust held by  
such Unitholder. Unitholders are urged to consult their own tax advisors        
concerning these matters.                                                       

       Florida Risk Factors. The financial condition of the State of Florida
is affected by various national, economic, social and environmental policies and
conditions. Additionally, Constitutional and statutory limitations imposed on   
the State and its local governments concerning taxes, bond indebtedness and     
other matters may constrain the revenue-generating capacity of the State and its
local governments and, therefore, the ability of the issuers of the Bonds to    
satisfy their obligations.                                                      

 The economic vitality of the State and its various regions and,
therefore, the ability of the State and its local governments to satisfy the    
Bonds, are affected by numerous factors.                                        

         The State may be a party to numerous lawsuits in which an adverse final
decision could materially affect the State's governmental operations and        
consequently its ability to pay debt service on its obligations.                

     Further information concerning Florida risk factors may be obtained
upon request to the Sponsor as described in "Additional Information".           

        Tax Status. At the time of the closing for each Florida Trust, special
counsel to the Trust for Florida tax matters rendered an opinion under then     
existing Florida income tax law applicable to taxpayers whose income is subject 
to Florida income taxation substantially to the effect that:                    

        The bonds issued by the State of Florida or its political subdivisions
(the "Florida Bonds") were accompanied by opinions of bond counsel to the       
respective issuers thereof to the effect that the Florida Bonds were exempt from
the Florida intangibles tax. The bonds issued by Puerto Rico or its authority   
(the Puerto Rico Bonds, and together with the Florida Bonds, "Bonds") were      
accompanied by opinions of bond counsel to the respective issuers thereof to the
effect that the Puerto Rico Bonds and the interest thereon is exempt from all   
state and local income taxation.                                                

      Neither the Sponsor nor its counsel have independently reviewed such
opinions or examined the Bonds to be deposited in and held by the Florida IM-IT 
Trust and they have assumed the correctness as of the date of deposit of the    
opinions of bond counsel and that the Bonds are and will continue to be exempt  
from such taxes. It is assumed for purposes of the opinion below that the Bonds 
constitute debt for Federal income tax purposes.                                

    "Non-Corporate Unitholder" means a Unitholder of the Florida IM-IT
Trust who is an individual not subject to the Florida state income tax on       
corporations under Chapter 220, Florida Statutes and "Corporate Unitholder"     
means a Unitholder of the Florida IM-IT Trust that is a corporation, bank or    
savings association or other entity subject to Florida state income tax on      
corporations or franchise tax imposed on banks or savings associations under    
Chapter 220, Florida Statutes.                                                  

       In the opinion of special counsel to the Trust, in summary under then
existing Florida law:                                                           

         For Florida state income tax purposes, the Florida IM-IT Trust will not
be subject to the Florida income tax imposed by Chapter 220, Florida Statutes.  

Because Florida does not impose an income tax on individuals, 
Non-Corporate Unitholders residing in Florida will not be subject to any Florida
income taxation on income realized by the Florida IM-IT Trust. Any amounts paid 
to the Florida IM-IT Trust or to Non-Corporate Unitholders under an insurance   
policy issued to the Florida IM-IT Trust or the Sponsor which represent maturing
interest on defaulted obligations held by the Trustee will not be subject to the
Florida income tax imposed by Chapter 220, Florida Statutes.                    

    Corporate Unitholders with commercial domiciles in Florida will be
subject to Florida income or franchise taxation on income realized by the       
Florida IM-IT Trust and on payments of interest pursuant to any insurance policy
to the extent such income constitutes "non business income" as defined by       
Chapter 220, Florida Statutes or is otherwise allocable to Florida under Chapter
220, Florida Statutes. Other Corporate Unitholders will be subject to Florida   
income or franchise taxation on income realized by the Florida IM-IT Trust (or  
on payments of interest pursuant to any insurance policy) only to the extent    
that the income realized does not constitute "non-business income" as defined by
Chapter 220, Florida Statutes and if such income is otherwise allocable to      
Florida under Chapter 220, Florida Statutes. However, no opinion is expressed   
with respect to the treatment under Chapter 220, Florida Statutes of any such   
income that is attributable to the Puerto Rico Bonds.                           

     Units will be subject to Florida estate tax only if held by Florida
residents. However, the Florida estate tax is limited to the amount of the      
credit for state death taxes provided for in Section 2011 of the Internal       
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.                                               

   Neither the Bonds nor the Units will be subject to the Florida ad
valorem property tax, the Florida intangible personal property tax or the       
Florida sales or use tax.                                                       

 Chapman and Cutler LLP has expressed no opinion with respect to
taxation under any other provision of Florida law. Ownership of the Units may   
result in collateral Florida tax consequences to certain taxpayers. Prospective 
investors should consult their tax advisors as to the applicability of any such 
collateral consequences.                                                        

       Georgia Risk Factors. The financial condition of the State of Georgia
is affected by various national, economic, social and environmental policies and
conditions. Additionally, Constitutional and statutory limitations imposed on   
the State and its local governments concerning taxes, bond indebtedness and     
other matters may constrain the revenue-generating capacity of the State and its
local governments and, therefore, the ability of the issuers of the Bonds to    
satisfy their obligations. Historically, the State has experienced significant  
revenue shortfalls.                                                             

 The economic vitality of the State and its various regions and,
therefore, the ability of the State and its local governments to satisfy the    
Bonds, are affected by numerous factors. Weather conditions may have a          
significant impact on Georgia's agricultural sector. In the past, widespread    
flooding in central and southern Georgia has caused extensive damage and        
destruction of farmland, private residences, businesses and local and state     
government facilities.                                                          

         The State may be a party to numerous lawsuits in which an adverse final
decision could materially affect the State's governmental operations and        
consequently its ability to pay debt service on its obligations.                

     Further information concerning Georgia risk factors may be obtained
upon request to the Sponsor as described in "Additional Information".           

        Tax Status. At the time of the closing for each Georgia Trust, special
counsel to the Trust for Georgia tax matters rendered an opinion under then     
existing Georgia income tax law applicable to taxpayers whose income is subject 
to Georgia income taxation substantially to the effect that:                    

        The assets of the Georgia IM-IT Trust will consist of interest-bearing
obligations issued by or on behalf of the State of Georgia or counties,         
municipalities, authorities or political subdivisions thereof (the "Georgia     
Bonds") and certain bonds issued by Puerto Rico authorities (the "Possession    
Bonds," and collectively with the Georgia Bonds, the "Bonds").                  

     Neither the Sponsor nor its counsel have independently examined the
Bonds to be deposited in and held in the Georgia IM-IT Trust. However, although 
no opinion is expressed herein regarding such matters, it is assumed that (i)   
the Bonds were validly issued, (ii) the interest thereon is excludable from     
gross income for federal income tax purposes and (iii) interest on the Bonds, if
received directly by a Unitholder would be exempt from the Georgia income tax   
(the "Georgia Income Tax"). We have assumed that at the respective times of     
issuance of the Bonds, opinions relating to the validity thereof and to the     
exemption of interest thereon from Federal income tax were rendered by bond     
counsel to the respective issuing authorities. In addition, we have assumed that
with respect to the Georgia Bonds, bond counsel to the issuing authorities      
rendered opinions that interest on the Georgia Bonds is exempt from the Georgia 
Income Tax and, with respect to the Possession Bonds, bond counsel to the       
issuing authorities rendered opinions that the Possession Bonds and the interest
thereon is exempt from all state and local income taxation. Neither the Sponsor 
nor its counsel has made any review for the Georgia IM-IT Trust of the          
proceedings relating to the issuance of the Bonds or of the bases for the       
opinions rendered in connection therewith.                                      

     In the opinion of special counsel to the Trust, under then existing
Georgia law, and based upon the assumptions set forth above:                    

        (1) For Georgia income tax purposes, the Georgia IM-IT Trust is not an
association taxable as a corporation, and the income of the Georgia IM-IT Trust 
will be treated as the income of the Unitholders. Interest on the Georgia Bonds 
which is exempt from Georgia income tax when received by the Georgia IM-IT      
Trust, and which would be exempt from Georgia income tax if received directly by
a Unitholder, will retain its status as a tax-exempt interest when distributed  
by the Georgia IM-IT Trust and received by the Unitholders. Interest on the     
Possession Bonds which is excludable from gross income for Federal income tax   
purposes and is exempt from state and local taxation pursuant to Federal law    
when received by the Georgia IM-IT Trust will be exempt from Georgia income     
taxation and therefore will not be includible in the income of the Unitholder   
for Georgia income tax purposes when distributed by the Georgia IM-IT Trust and 
received by the Unitholders.                                                    

   (2) If the Trustee disposes of a Bond (whether by sale, exchange,
payment on maturity, retirement or otherwise) or if a Unitholder redeems or     
sells his Unit, the Unitholder will recognize gain or loss for Georgia income   
tax purposes to the same extent that gain or loss would be recognized for       
Federal income tax purposes (except in the case of Bonds issued before March 11,
1987 issued with original issue discount owned by the Georgia IM-IT Trust in    
which case gain or loss for Georgia income tax purposes may differ from the     
amount recognized for Federal income tax purposes because original issue        
discount on such Bonds may be determined by accruing said original issue        
discount on a ratable basis). Due to the amortization of bond premium and other 
basis adjustments required by the Internal Revenue Code, a Unitholder, under    
some circumstances, may realize taxable gain when his or her Units are sold or  
redeemed for an amount less than or equal to their original cost.               

      (3) Amounts paid under an insurance policy or policies issued to the
Georgia IM-IT Trust, if any, with respect to the Bonds in the Georgia IM-IT     
Trust which represent maturing interest on defaulted obligations held by the    
Trustee will be exempt from State income taxes if, and to the extent as, such   
interest would have been so exempt if paid by the issuer of the defaulted       
obligations provided that, at the time such policies are purchased, the amounts 
paid for such policies are reasonable, customary and consistent with the        
reasonable expectation that the issuer of the obligations, rather than the      
insurer, will pay debt service on the obligations.                              

         (4) Neither the Bonds nor the Units will be subject to Georgia sales or
use tax.                                                                        

 Chapman and Cutler LLP has expressed no opinion with respect to
taxation under any other provision of Georgia law. Ownership of the Units may   
result in collateral Georgia tax consequences to certain taxpayers. Prospective 
investors should consult their tax advisors as to the applicability of any such 
collateral consequences.                                                        

        Kansas Risk Factors. The financial condition of the State of Kansas is
affected by various national, economic, social and environmental policies and   
conditions. Additionally, Constitutional and statutory limitations imposed on   
the State and its local governments concerning taxes, bond indebtedness and     
other matters may constrain the revenue-generating capacity of the State and its
local governments and, therefore, the ability of the issuers of the Bonds to    
satisfy their obligations.                                                      

 The economic vitality of the State and its various regions and,
therefore, the ability of the State and its local governments to satisfy the    
Bonds, are affected by numerous factors. The Kansas economy is composed of      
manufacturing, trade, services and agriculture. Severe weather conditions could 
have a significant impact on the Kansas economy.                                

         The State may be a party to numerous lawsuits in which an adverse final
decision could materially affect the State's governmental operations and        
consequently its ability to pay debt service on its obligations.                

         Further information concerning Kansas risk factors may be obtained upon
request to the Sponsor as described in "Additional Information".                

       Tax Status. At the time of the closing for each Kansas Trust, special
counsel to the Trust for Kansas tax matters, rendered an opinion under then     
existing Kansas income tax law applicable to taxpayers whose income is subject  
to Kansas income taxation, assuming interest on the Bonds is excludable from    
gross income under Section 103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
substantially to the effect that:                                               

     The Kansas Trust is not an association taxable as a corporation for
Kansas income tax purposes;                                                     

       Each Unitholder of the Kansas Trust will be treated as the owner of a
pro rata portion of the Kansas Trust, and the income and deductions of the      
Kansas Trust will therefore be treated as income (and deductions) of the        
Unitholder under Kansas law;                                                    

         Interest on Bonds issued after December 31, 1987 by the State of Kansas
or any of its political subdivisions will be exempt from income taxation imposed
on individuals, corporations and fiduciaries (other than banks, trust companies 
or savings and loan associations). However, interest on Bonds issued prior to   
January 1, 1988 by the State of Kansas or any of its political subdivisions will
not be exempt from income taxation imposed on individuals, corporations and     
fiduciaries (other than banks, trust companies or savings and loan associations)
unless the laws of the State of Kansas authorizing the issuance of such Bonds   
specifically exempt the interest on the Bonds from income taxation by the State 
of Kansas;                                                                      

         Interest on Bonds issued by the State of Kansas or any of its political
subdivisions will be subject to the tax imposed on banks, trust companies and   
savings and loan associations under Article 11, Chapter 79 of the Kansas        
statutes;                                                                       

        Interest on the Bonds which is exempt from Kansas income taxation when
received by the Kansas Trust will continue to be exempt when distributed to a   
Unitholder (other than a bank, trust company or savings and loan association);  

     Each Unitholder of the Kansas Trust will recognize gain or loss for
Kansas income tax purposes if the Trustee disposes of a Bond (whether by sale,  
exchange, payment on maturity, retirement or otherwise) or if the Unitholder    
redeems or sells Units of the Kansas Trust to the extent that such transaction  
results in a recognized gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes;           

   Interest received by the Kansas Trust on the Bonds is exempt from
intangibles taxation imposed by any counties, cities and townships pursuant to  
present Kansas law; and                                                         

      No opinion is expressed regarding whether the gross earnings derived
from the Units is subject to intangibles taxation imposed by any counties,      
cities and townships pursuant to present Kansas law. Chapman and Cutler LLP has 
expressed no opinion with respect to taxation under any other provision of      
Kansas law. Ownership of the Units may result in collateral Kansas tax          
consequences to certain taxpayers. Prospective investors should consult their   
tax advisors as to the applicability of any such collateral consequences.       

         Kentucky Risk Factors. The financial condition of the State of Kentucky
is affected by various national, economic, social and environmental policies and
conditions. Additionally, Constitutional and statutory limitations imposed on   
the State and its local governments concerning taxes, bond indebtedness and     
other matters may constrain the revenue-generating capacity of the State and its
local governments and, therefore, the ability of the issuers of the Bonds to    
satisfy their obligations.                                                      

 The economic vitality of the State and its various regions and,
therefore, the ability of the State and its local governments to satisfy the    
Bonds, are affected by numerous factors.                                        

         The State may be a party to numerous lawsuits in which an adverse final
decision could materially affect the State's governmental operations and        
consequently its ability to pay debt service on its obligations.                

      Further information concerning Kentucky risk factors may be obtained
upon request to the Sponsor as described in "Additional Information".           

     Tax Status. At the time of the closing for each Kentucky Trust, the
respective counsel to the Kentucky Trusts for Kentucky tax matters rendered an  
opinion under then existing Kentucky income tax law applicable to taxpayers     
whose income is subject to Kentucky income taxation substantially to the effect 
that:                                                                           

   The assets of the Kentucky Trust will consist of interest-bearing
obligations issued by or on behalf of the Commonwealth of Kentucky (the "State")
or counties, municipalities, authorities or political subdivisions thereof (the 
"Kentucky Bonds") and by an authority of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (the   
"Possession Bonds") (collectively, the "Bonds").                                

       Although we express no opinion herein regarding such matters, we have
assumed that: (i) the Bonds were validly issued, (ii) the interest thereon is   
excludable from gross income for Federal income tax purposes, (iii) interest on 
the Bonds, if received directly by a Unitholder, would be exempt from the income
tax imposed by the Commonwealth of Kentucky that is applicable to individuals   
and corporations (the "Kentucky State Income Tax"); and (iv) the Bonds are      
exempt from the ad valorem tax imposed by the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Neither 
the Sponsor nor its counsel has made any review of the proceedings relating to  
the issuance of the Bonds or of the bases for the opinions, if any, rendered in 
connection therewith. This opinion does not address the taxation of persons     
other than full time residents of Kentucky.                                     

         In the opinion of Chapman and Cutler LLP, counsel to the Sponsor, under
existing Kentucky income tax law as of the date of this prospectus and based    
upon the assumptions above:                                                     

       (i) The Kentucky Trust is not an association taxable as a corporation
and each Kentucky Unitholder will be treated as the owner of a pro rata portion 
of the Kentucky Trust, and the income of such portion of the Kentucky Trust will
therefore be treated as the income of the Kentucky Unitholder for Kentucky      
Income Tax purposes;                                                            

    (ii) For Kentucky State Income Tax purposes, interest on the Bonds
which is excludable from Federal gross income and which is also exempt from     
taxation under the Kentucky State Income Tax when received by the Kentucky      
Trust, and which would be excludable from Federal gross income and also exempt  
from Kentucky State Income Tax if received directly by a Unitholder, will retain
its status as tax-exempt interest when received by the Kentucky Trust and       
distributed to the Unitholders.                                                 

     (iii) Each Kentucky Unitholder of the Kentucky Trust will recognize
gain or loss for Kentucky State Income Tax purposes if the Trustee disposes of a
Bond (whether by redemption, sale or otherwise) or if the Kentucky Unitholder   
redeems or sells Units of the Kentucky Trust to the extent that such a          
transaction results in a recognized gain or loss to such Unitholder for Federal 
income tax purposes;                                                            

  (iv) Tax reduction requirements relating to amortization of bond
premium may, under some circumstances, result in Kentucky Unitholders realizing 
taxable gain for Kentucky State Income Tax purposes when their Units are sold or
redeemed for an amount equal to or less than their original cost;               

         (v) State law does not permit a deduction for interest paid or incurred
on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or carry Units in the Kentucky
Trust, the interest on which is exempt from State income taxes.                 

   (vi) Units of the Kentucky Trust, but only to the extent the same
represent an ownership in obligations of the Commonwealth of Kentucky or        
governmental units of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, the interest on which is    
excludable from gross income for federal and Kentucky State Income Tax purposes 
will not be subject to ad valorem taxation by the Commonwealth of Kentucky or   
any political subdivision thereof; and                                          

  (vii) Proceeds, if any, paid under individual insurance policies
obtained by issuers of Bonds that represent maturing interest on defaulted      
obligations held by the Trustee will not be subject to Kentucky State Income Tax
if, and to the same extent as, such interest would not have been subject to     
Kentucky State Income Tax if paid in the normal course by the issuer of the     
defaulted obligation provided that, at the time such policies are purchased, the
amounts paid for such policies were reasonable, customary and consistent with   
the reasonable expectation that the issuer of the Bonds, rather than the        
insurer, will pay debt service on the Bonds.                                    

      Chapman and Cutler LLP expresses no opinion with respect to taxation
under any other provision of Kentucky law. Ownership of the Units may result in 
collateral Kentucky tax consequences to certain taxpayers. Prospective investors
should consult their tax advisors as to the applicability of any such collateral
consequences.                                                                   

 Louisiana Risk Factors. The financial condition of the State of
Louisiana is affected by various national, economic, social and environmental   
policies and conditions. Additionally, Constitutional and statutory limitations 
imposed on the State and its local governments concerning taxes, bond           
indebtedness and other matters may constrain the revenue-generating capacity of 
the State and its local governments and, therefore, the ability of the issuers  
of the Bonds to satisfy their obligations.                                      

 The economic vitality of the State and its various regions and,
therefore, the ability of the State and its local governments to satisfy the    
Bonds, are affected by numerous factors.                                        

         The State may be a party to numerous lawsuits in which an adverse final
decision could materially affect the State's governmental operations and        
consequently its ability to pay debt service on its obligations.                

       Further information concerning Louisiana risk factors may be obtained
upon request to the Sponsor as described in "Additional Information".           

  Tax Status. At the time of the closing for each Louisiana Trust,
Special Counsel to each Louisiana Trust for Louisiana tax matters rendered an   
opinion under then existing Louisiana income tax law applicable to taxpayers    
whose income is subject to Louisiana income taxation substantially to the effect
that:                                                                           

         (1) The Louisiana Trust will be treated as a trust for Louisiana income
tax purposes and not as an association taxable as a corporation.                

      (2) The Louisiana income tax on resident individuals is imposed upon
the "tax table income" of resident individuals. The calculation of the "tax     
table income" of a resident individual begins with Federal adjusted gross       
income. Certain modifications are specified, but no such modification requires  
the addition of interest on obligations of the State of Louisiana and its       
political subdivisions, public corporations created by them and constitutional  
authorities thereof authorized to issue obligations on their behalf.            
Accordingly, amounts representing interest excludable from gross income for     
Federal income tax purposes received by the Louisiana Trust with respect to such
obligations will not be taxed to the Louisiana Trust, or, except as provided    
below, to the resident individual Unitholder, for Louisiana income tax purposes.
In addition to the foregoing, interest on the respective Securities may also be 
exempt from Louisiana income taxes pursuant to the statutes authorizing their   
issuance.                                                                       

(3) To the extent that gain from the sale, exchange or other  
disposition of obligations held by the Louisiana Trust (whether as a result of a
sale or exchange of such obligations by the Louisiana Trust or as a result of a 
sale or exchange of a Unit by a Unitholder) is includible in the Federal        
adjusted gross income of a resident individual, such gain will be included in   
the calculation of the Unitholder's Louisiana taxable income; and               

      (4) Gain or loss on the Unit or as to underlying bonds for Louisiana
income tax purposes would be determined by taking into account the basis        
adjustments for Federal income tax purposes described in this Prospectus.       

        As no opinion is expressed regarding the Louisiana tax consequences of
Unitholders other than individuals who are Louisiana residents, tax counsel     
should be consulted by other prospective Unitholders. The Internal Revenue Code 
of 1986, as amended (the "1986 Code"), contains provisions relating to investing
in tax-exempt obligations (including, for example, corporate minimum tax        
provisions which treat certain tax-exempt interest and corporate book income    
which may include tax-exempt interest, as tax preference items, provisions      
affecting the deductibility of interest expense by financial institutions) which
could have a corresponding effect on the Louisiana tax liability of the         
Unitholders.                                                                    

        In rendering the opinions expressed above, counsel has relied upon the
opinion of Counsel to the Sponsor that the Louisiana Trust is not an association
taxable as corporation for Federal income tax purposes, that each Unitholder of 
the Louisiana Trust will be treated as the owner of a pro rata portion of such  
Louisiana Trust under the 1986 Code and that the income of the Louisiana Trust  
will be treated as income of the Unitholders under the 1986 Code.               

Tax counsel should be consulted as to the other Louisiana tax 
consequences not specifically considered herein, and as to the Louisiana Tax    
Status of taxpayers other than Louisiana resident individuals who are           
Unitholders in the Louisiana Trust. In addition, no opinion is being rendered as
to Louisiana tax consequences resulting from any proposed or future Federal or  
state tax legislation.                                                          

      Maine Risk Factors. The financial condition of the State of Maine is
affected by various national, economic, social and environmental policies and   
conditions. Additionally, Constitutional and statutory limitations imposed on   
the State and its local governments concerning taxes, bond indebtedness and     
other matters may constrain the revenue-generating capacity of the State and its
local governments and, therefore, the ability of the issuers of the Bonds to    
satisfy their obligations.                                                      

 The economic vitality of the State and its various regions and,
therefore, the ability of the State and its local governments to satisfy the    
Bonds, are affected by numerous factors. Maine's economy consists of services,  
trade, government and manufacturing.                                            

         The State may be a party to numerous lawsuits in which an adverse final
decision could materially affect the State's governmental operations and        
consequently its ability to pay debt service on its obligations.                

        Further information concerning Maine risk factors may be obtained upon
request to the Sponsor as described in "Additional Information".                

      Tax Status. At the time of the closing for each Maine Trust, special
counsel to the Trust for Maine tax matters rendered an opinion under then       
existing Maine income tax law applicable to taxpayers whose income is subject to
Maine income taxation substantially to the effect that:                         

The assets of the Maine Trust will consist of interest-bearing
obligations issued by or on behalf of the State of Maine (the "State") or       
counties, municipalities, authorities or political subdivisions thereof (the    
"Maine Bonds") or by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam and the United States
Virgin Islands (the "Possession Bonds") (collectively, the "Bonds").            

     Neither the Sponsor nor its counsel have independently examined the
Bonds to be deposited in and held in the Maine Trust. However, although no      
opinion is expressed herein regarding such matters, it is assumed that: (i) the 
Bonds were validly issued, (ii) the interest thereon is excludable from gross   
income for Federal income tax purposes, (iii) interest on the Maine Bonds, if   
received directly by a Unitholder, would be exempt from the Maine income tax    
applicable to individuals, trusts and estates and corporations ("Maine Income   
Tax"), and (iv) interest on the Bonds will not be taken into account by         
individuals and corporations in computing an additional tax ("Maine Minimum     
Tax") imposed under the Maine Income Tax or in the case of corporations, a      
surcharge ("Maine Corporate Income Tax Surcharge") enacted in 1991 and scheduled
to apply to tax years beginning in 1991 and 1992. The opinion set forth below   
does not address the taxation of persons other than full time residents of      
Maine.                                                                          

    In the opinion of special counsel to the Trust under then existing
Maine law, and based upon the assumptions set forth above: (1) the Maine Trust  
is not an association taxable as a corporation, thus each Unitholder of the     
Trust will be essentially treated as the owner of a pro rata portion of the     
Maine Trust and the income of such portion of the Maine Trust will be treated as
the income of the Unitholder for Maine Income Tax purposes;                     

     (2) Interest on the Bonds which is exempt from the Maine Income Tax
when received by the Maine Trust, and which would be exempt from the Maine      
Income Tax and the Maine Minimum Tax if received directly by a Unitholder, will 
retain its status as exempt from the Maine Income Tax and the Maine Minimum Tax 
when received by the Maine Trust and distributed to the Unitholder;             

   (3) to the extent that interest derived from the Maine Trust by a
Unitholder with respect to the Possession Bonds is excludable from gross income 
for Federal income tax purposes pursuant to 48 U.S.C. Section 745, 48 U.S.C.    
Section 1423a and 48 U.S.C. Section 1403, such interest will not be subject to  
the Maine Income Tax;                                                           

        (4) each Unitholder of the Maine Trust will recognize gain or loss for
Maine Income Tax purposes if the Trustee disposes of a bond (whether by         
redemption, sale or otherwise) or if the Unitholder redeems or sells Units of   
the Maine Trust to the extent that such a transaction results in a recognized   
gain or loss to such Unitholder for Federal income tax purposes; and            

       (5) the Maine Income Tax does not permit a deduction of interest paid
or incurred on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or carry Units in 
the Maine Trust, the interest on which is exempt from the Tax.                  

     Prospective purchasers subject to the Maine Franchise Tax should be
advised that for purposes of the Maine Franchise Tax, interest on the Bonds     
received by the Trust and distributed to a Unitholder subject to such tax will  
be added to the Unitholder's Federal taxable income and therefore will be       
taxable. Chapman and Cutler LLP has expressed no opinion with respect to        
taxation under any other provision of Maine law. Ownership of the Units may     
result in collateral Maine tax consequences to certain taxpayers. Prospective   
investors should consult their tax advisors as to the applicability of any such 
consequences.                                                                   

         Maryland Risk Factors. The financial condition of the State of Maryland
is affected by various national, economic, social and environmental policies and
conditions. Additionally, Constitutional and statutory limitations imposed on   
the State and its local governments concerning taxes, bond indebtedness and     
other matters may constrain the revenue-generating capacity of the State and its
local governments and, therefore, the ability of the issuers of the Bonds to    
satisfy their obligations.                                                      

 The economic vitality of the State and its various regions and,
therefore, the ability of the State and its local governments to satisfy the    
Bonds, are affected by numerous factors.                                        

         The State may be a party to numerous lawsuits in which an adverse final
decision could materially affect the State's governmental operations and        
consequently its ability to pay debt service on its obligations.

upon request to the Sponsor as described in "Additional Information".           

         Tax Status. For a discussion of the Federal tax status of income earned
on Maryland Quality Trust Units, see "Federal Tax Status" in Prospectus Part II.

 In the opinion of special counsel to the Trust for Maryland tax
matters, in summary under existing Maryland income tax law applicable to        
taxpayers whose income is subject to Maryland income taxation:                  

    (1) For Maryland State and local income tax purposes, the Maryland
Quality Trust will not be recognized as an association taxable as a corporation,
but rather as a fiduciary whose income will not be subject to Maryland state and
local income taxation.                                                          

     (2) To the extent that interest and accrued original issue discount
derived from the Maryland Quality Trust by a Unitholder with respect to the     
bonds in the Trust is excludable from Federal gross income, such interest will  
not be subject to Maryland State or local income taxes. Interest paid to a      
"financial institution" will be subject to the Maryland Franchise Tax.          

      (3) In the case of taxpayers who are individuals, Maryland presently
imposes an income tax on items of tax preference with reference to such items as
defined in the Internal Revenue Code, as amended from time to time, for purposes
of calculating the Federal alternative minimum tax. Interest paid on certain    
private activity bonds constitutes a tax preference item for the purpose of     
calculating the Federal alternative minimum tax. Accordingly, if the Maryland   
Quality Trust holds such bonds, 50% of the interest on such bonds in excess of a
threshold amount is taxable in Maryland.                                        

    (4) Capital gain, including gain realized by a Unitholder from the
redemption, sale or other disposition of a Unit, will be included in the taxable
base of Unitholders for Maryland state and local income taxation purposes.      
However, Maryland defines the taxable net income of individuals as Federal      
adjusted gross income with certain modifications. Likewise, the Maryland taxable
net income of corporations is Federal taxable income with certain modifications.
There is available to Maryland income taxpayers a modification which allows     
those taxpayers to subtract from the Maryland taxable base the gain included in 
Federal adjusted gross income or Federal taxable income, as the case may be,    
which is realized from the disposition of obligations issued by the State of    
Maryland or its political subdivisions by the Maryland Quality Trust.           
Consequently, by making that modification, a Unitholder who is entitled to make 
the subtraction modification will not be subject to Maryland state or local     
income tax with respect to gain realized upon the disposition of obligations    
issued by the State of Maryland and its political subdivisions by the Maryland  
Quality Trust. Profit realized by a "financial institution" from the sale or    
exchange of bonds will be subject to the Maryland Franchise Tax.                

     These opinions relate only to the treatment of the Maryland Quality
Trust and the Units under the Maryland State and local income tax laws and      
Maryland franchise tax laws. Unitholders should consult tax counsel as to other 
Maryland tax consequences not specifically considered in these opinions. For    
example, no opinion is expressed as to the treatment of the Units under the     
Maryland inheritance and estate tax laws.                                       

         Massachusetts Risk Factors. The financial condition of the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts is affected by various national, economic, social and          
environmental policies and conditions. Additionally, limitations imposed by     
statute and voter initiative upon the Commonwealth and its local governments    
concerning taxes, bond indebtedness and other matters may constrain the         
revenue-generating capacity of the Commonwealth and its local governments and,  
therefore, the ability of the issuers of the Bonds to satisfy their obligations.

 The economic vitality of the State and its various regions and,
therefore, the ability of the State and its local governments to satisfy the    
Bonds, are affected by numerous factors.                                        

  The Commonwealth may be a party to numerous lawsuits in which an
adverse final decision could materially affect the Commonwealth's governmental  
operations and consequently, its ability to pay debt service on its obligations.

obtained upon request to the Sponsor as described in "Additional Information".  

      Tax Status. At the time of the closing for each Massachusetts Trust,
Special Counsel to each Massachusetts Trust for Massachusetts tax matters       
rendered an opinion under then existing Massachusetts income tax law applicable 
to taxpayers whose income is subject to Massachusetts income taxation           
substantially to the effect that:                                               

In the opinion of special counsel to the Fund, under existing 
Massachusetts law:                                                              

         (1) For Massachusetts income tax purposes, the Trust will be treated as
a corporate trust under Section 8 of Chapter 62 of the Massachusetts General    
Laws and not as a grantor trust under Section 10(e) of Chapter 62 of the        
Massachusetts General Laws.                                                     

(2) The Trust will not be held to be engaging in business in  
Massachusetts within the meaning of said Section 8 and will not, therefore, be  
subject to Massachusetts income tax.                                            

       (3) Massachusetts Unitholders who are subject to Massachusetts income
taxation under Chapter 62 of the Massachusetts General Laws will not be required
to include their respective shares of the earnings of or distributions from the 
Trust in their Massachusetts gross income to the extent that such earnings or   
distributions represent tax-exempt interest for Federal income tax purposes     
received by the Trust on obligations issued by Massachusetts, its counties,     
municipalities, authorities, political subdivisions or instrumentalities or by  
United States territories or possessions ("Bonds").                             

       (4) Massachusetts Unitholders who are subject to Massachusetts income
taxation under Chapter 62 of the Massachusetts General Laws will not be required
to include their respective shares of the earnings of or distributions from the 
Trust in their Massachusetts gross income to the extent that such earnings or   
distributions are derived from proceeds of insurance obtained by the Trust or by
the Sponsor or by the issuer or underwriter of an Bond held by the Trust that   
represent maturing interest on defaulted Bonds held by the Trust, if, and to the
same extent that, such earnings or distributions would have been excludable from
their gross income if derived from interest paid by the issuer of the defaulted 
Bond.                                                                           

   (5) The Trust's capital gains and/or capital losses realized upon
disposition of Bonds held by it will be included pro rata as capital gains      
and/or losses in the gross income of Massachusetts Unitholders who are subject  
to Massachusetts income taxation under Chapter 62 of the Massachusetts General  
Laws, except where capital gain is specifically exempted from income taxation   
under acts authorizing issuance of said Bonds.                                  

  (6) Gains or losses realized on sales or redemptions of Units by
Massachusetts Unitholders who are subject to Massachusetts income taxation under
Chapter 62 of the Massachusetts General Laws will be includible in their        
Massachusetts gross income. In determining such gain or loss Massachusetts      
Unitholders will, to the same extent required for Federal tax purposes, be      
required to adjust the tax basis for their Units for accrued interest received, 
if any, on Bonds delivered to the Trustee after the Massachusetts Unitholders   
pay for their Units, and for amortization of premiums, if any, on the Bonds held
by the Trust.                                                                   

       (7) The Units of the Trust are not subject to any property tax levied
by Massachusetts or any political subdivision thereof, nor to any income tax    
levied by any such political subdivision. They are includible in the gross      
estate of a deceased Massachusetts Unitholder who is a resident of Massachusetts
for purposes of the Massachusetts Estate Tax.                                   

         Michigan Risk Factors. The financial condition of the State of Michigan
is affected by various national, economic, social and environmental policies and
conditions. Additionally, Constitutional and statutory limitations imposed on   
the State and its local governments concerning taxes, bond indebtedness and     
other matters may constrain the revenue-generating capacity of the State and its
local governments and, therefore, the ability of the issuers of the Bonds to    
satisfy their obligations.                                                      

 The economic vitality of the State and its various regions and,
therefore, the ability of the State and its local governments to satisfy the    
Bonds, are affected by numerous factors.                                        

         The State may be a party to numerous lawsuits in which an adverse final
decision could materially affect the State's governmental operations and        
consequently its ability to pay debt service on its obligations.                

      Further information concerning Michigan risk factors may be obtained
upon request to the Sponsor as described in "Additional Information".           

         Tax Status. In the opinion of special counsel to the Trust for Michigan
tax matters, in summary under existing Michigan law, the Michigan IM-IT Trust   
and the owners of Units will be treated for purposes of the Michigan income tax 
laws and the Single Business Tax in substantially the same manner as they are   
for purposes of the Federal income tax laws, as currently enacted. Accordingly, 
we have relied upon the opinion of Messrs. Chapman and Cutler LLP as to the     
applicability of Federal income tax under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to  
the Michigan IM-IT Trust and the Unitholders.                                   

        Under the income tax laws of the State of Michigan, the Michigan IM-IT
Trust is not an association taxable as a corporation; the income of the Michigan
IM-IT Trust will be treated as the income of the Unitholders and be deemed to   
have been received by them when received by the Michigan IM-IT Trust. Interest  
on the underlying bonds which is exempt from tax under these laws when received 
by Michigan IM-IT Trust will retain its status as tax exempt interest to the    
Unitholders.                                                                    

       For purposes of the foregoing Michigan tax laws, each Unitholder will
be considered to have received his pro rata share of bond interest when it is   
received by the Michigan IM-IT Trust, and each Unitholder will have a taxable   
event when the Michigan IM-IT Trust disposes of a bond (whether by sale,        
exchange, redemption or payment at maturity) or when the Unitholder redeems or  
sells his Certificate to the extent the transaction constitutes a taxable event 
for Federal income tax purposes. The tax cost of each unit to a Unitholder will 
be established and allocated for purposes of these Michigan tax laws in the same
manner as such cost is established and allocated for Federal income tax         
purposes.                                                                       

        The Michigan Intangibles Tax was totally repealed effective January 1,
1998.                                                                           

    The Michigan Single Business Tax replaced the tax on corporate and
financial institution income under the Michigan Income Tax, and the Intangible  
Tax with respect to those intangibles of persons subject to the Single Business 
Tax the income from which would be considered in computing the Single Business  
Tax. Persons are subject to the Single Business Tax only if they are engaged in 
"business activity", as defined in the Act. Under the Single Business Tax, both 
interest received by the Michigan IM-IT Trust on the underlying bonds and any   
amount distributed from the Michigan IM-IT Trust to a Unitholder, if not        
included in determining taxable income for Federal income tax purposes, is also 
not included in the adjusted tax base upon which the Single Business Tax is     
computed, of either the Michigan IM-IT Trust or the Unitholders. If the Michigan
IM-IT Trust or the Unitholders have a taxable event for Federal income tax      
purposes when the Michigan IM-IT Trust disposes of a bond (whether by sale,     
exchange, redemption or payment at maturity) or the Unitholder redeems or sells 
his Certificate, an amount equal to any gain realized from such taxable event   
which was included in the computation of taxable income for Federal income tax  
purposes (plus an amount equal to any capital gain of an individual realized in 
connection with such event but excluded in computing that individual's Federal  
taxable income) will be included in the tax base against which, after           
allocation, apportionment and other adjustments, the Single Business Tax is     
computed. The tax base will be reduced by an amount equal to any capital loss   
realized from such a taxable event, whether or not the capital loss was deducted
in computing Federal taxable income in the year the loss occurred. Unitholders  
should consult their tax advisor as to their status under Michigan law. The     
Single Business Tax is being phased-out, with total repeal after December 31,
2009.                                                                           

      Any proceeds paid under an insurance policy issued to the Trustee of
the Trust, or paid under individual policies obtained by issuers of bonds,      
which, when received by the Unitholders, represent maturing interest on         
defaulted obligations held by the Trustee, will be excludable from the Michigan 
income tax laws and the Single Business Tax if, and to the same extent as, such 
interest would have been so excludable if paid by the issuer of the defaulted   
obligations. While treatment under the Michigan Intangibles Tax is not premised 
upon the characterization of such proceeds under the Internal Revenue Code, the 
Michigan Department of Treasury should adopt the same approach as under the     
Michigan income tax laws and the Single Business Tax.                           

         As the Tax Reform Act of 1986 eliminated the capital gain deduction for
tax years beginning after December 31, 1986, the Federal adjusted gross income, 
the computation base for the Michigan Income Tax, of a Unitholder will be       
increased accordingly to the extent such capital gains are realized when the    
Michigan IM-IT Trust disposes of a bond or when the Unitholder redeems or sells 
a Unit, to the extent such transaction constitutes a taxable event for Federal  
income tax purposes.                                                            

 Minnesota Risk Factors. The financial condition of the State of
Minnesota is affected by various national, economic, social and environmental   
policies and conditions. Additionally, Constitutional and statutory limitations 
imposed on the State and its local governments concerning taxes, bond           
indebtedness and other matters may constrain the revenue-generating capacity of 
the State and its local governments and, therefore, the ability of the issuers  
of the Bonds to satisfy their obligations.                                      

 The economic vitality of the State and its various regions and,
therefore, the ability of the State and its local governments to satisfy the    
Bonds, are affected by numerous factors.                                        

         The State may be a party to numerous lawsuits in which an adverse final
decision could materially affect the State's governmental operations and        
consequently its ability to pay debt service on its obligations.

  Tax Status. At the time of the closing for each Minnesota Trust,
special counsel to the Trust for Minnesota tax matters rendered an opinion under
then existing Minnesota income tax law applicable to taxpayers whose income is  
subject to Minnesota income taxation substantially to the effect that:          

         We understand that the Minnesota Trust will only have income consisting
of (i) interest from bonds issued by the State of Minnesota and its political   
and governmental subdivisions, municipalities and governmental agencies and     
instrumentalities (the "Minnesota Bonds") and bonds issued by possessions of the
United States, including bonds issued by Puerto Rico authorities (the           
"Possession Bonds" and, collectively with the Minnesota Bonds, the "Bonds")     
which would be exempt from Federal and Minnesota income taxation when paid      
directly to an individual, trust or estate, (ii) gain on the disposition of such
Bonds, and (iii) proceeds paid under certain insurance policies issued to the   
Trustee or to the issuers of the Bonds which represent maturing interest or     
principal payments on defaulted Bonds held by the Trustee.                      

     Neither the Sponsor nor its counsel have independently examined the
Bonds to be deposited in and held in the Trust. However, although no opinion is 
expressed herein regarding such matters, it is assumed that: (i) the Bonds were 
validly issued, (ii) the interest thereon is excludable from gross income for   
Federal income tax purposes and (iii) the interest thereon is exempt from the   
income tax imposed by Minnesota that is applicable to individuals, trusts and   
estates (the "Minnesota Income Tax"). It should be noted that interest on the   
Minnesota Bonds is subject to tax in the case of corporations subject to the    
Minnesota Corporate Franchise Tax or the Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax and  
is a factor in the computation of the Minimum Fee applicable to financial       
institutions. The opinion set forth below does not address the taxation of      
persons other than full time residents of Minnesota. We have assumed that at the
respective times of issuance of the Bonds, opinions relating to the validity    
thereof and to the exemption of interest thereon from Federal income tax were   
rendered by bond counsel to the respective issuing authorities. In addition, we 
have assumed that with respect to the Minnesota Bonds, bond counsel to the      
issuing authorities rendered opinions that the interest on the Minnesota Bonds  
is exempt from the Minnesota Income Tax and, with respect to the Possession     
Bonds, bond counsel to the issuing authorities rendered opinions that the       
Possession Bonds and the interest thereon is exempt from all state and local    
income taxation. Neither the Sponsor nor its counsel has made any review for the
Minnesota Trust of the proceedings relating to the issuance of the Bonds or of  
the bases for the opinions rendered in connection therewith.                    

        Although Minnesota state law provides that interest on Minnesota Bonds
is exempt from Minnesota state income taxation, the Minnesota state legislature 
has enacted a statement of intent that interest on the Minnesota Bonds should be
subject to Minnesota state income taxation if it is judicially determined that  
the exemption discriminates against interstate commerce, effective for the      
calendar year in which such a decision becomes final. It cannot be predicted    
whether a court would render such a decision or whether, as a result thereof,   
interest on Minnesota Bonds and therefore distributions by the Minnesota Trust  
would become subject to Minnesota state income taxation.                        

     In the opinion of special counsel to the Trust, under then existing
Minnesota law, and based upon the assumptions set forth above:                  

         (1) The Minnesota Trust is not an association taxable as a corporation;

    (2) Income on the Bonds which is excludable from Minnesota taxable
income for purposes of the Minnesota Income Tax when received by the Minnesota  
Trust and which would be excludable from Minnesota taxable income for purposes  
of the Minnesota Income Tax if received directly by a Unitholder will be        
excludable from Minnesota taxable income for purposes of the Minnesota Income   
Tax when received by the Minnesota Trust and distributed to such Unitholder;    

       (3) To the extent that interest on certain Bonds (except with respect
to Possession Bonds, as to which no opinion is expressed), if any, is includible
in the computation of "alternative minimum taxable income" for Federal income   
tax purposes, such interest will also be includible in the computation of       
"alternative minimum taxable income" for purposes of the Minnesota Alternative  
Minimum Tax imposed on individuals, estates and trusts;                         

        (4) Each Unitholder of the Minnesota Trust will recognize gain or loss
for Minnesota Income Tax purposes if the Trustee disposes of a Bond (whether by 
redemption, sale or otherwise) or if the Unitholder redeems or sells Units of   
the Minnesota Trust to the extent that such a transaction results in a          
recognized gain or loss to such Unitholder for Federal income tax purposes;     

       (5) Tax basis reduction requirements relating to amortization of bond
premium may, under some circumstances, result in Unitholders realizing taxable  
gain for Minnesota Income Tax purposes when their Units are sold or redeemed for
an amount equal to or less than their original cost;                            

         (6) Proceeds, if any, paid under individual insurance policies obtained
by issuers of Bonds or the Trustee which represent maturing interest on         
defaulted obligations held by the Trustee will be excludible from Minnesota net 
income if, and to the same extent as, such interest would have been so          
excludible from Minnesota net income if paid in the normal course by the issuer 
of the defaulted obligation provided that, at the time such policies are        
purchased, the amounts paid for such policies are reasonable, customary and     
consistent with the reasonable expectation that the issuer of the bonds, rather 
than the insurer, will pay debt service on the bonds; and                       

       (7) To the extent that interest derived from the Minnesota Trust by a
Unitholder with respect to any Possession Bonds would be excludible from gross  
income for Federal income tax purposes and would be exempt from state and local 
taxation pursuant to Federal law if the Unitholder directly owned the Possession
Bonds, such interest will not be subject to the Minnesota Income Tax when       
distributed by the Minnesota Trust and received by the Unitholders. As noted    
above, we have expressed no opinion as to the treatment of interest on the      
Possession Bonds for purposes of the Minnesota Corporate Franchise Tax or the   
Alternative Minimum Tax or whether it is a factor in the computation of the     
Minimum Fee applicable to financial institutions. Although a Federal statute    
currently provides that bonds issued by the Government of Puerto Rico, or by its
authority, are exempt from all state and local taxation, the Supreme Court of   
Minnesota has held that interest earned on bonds issued by the Government of    
Puerto Rico may be included in taxable net income for purposes of computing the 
Minnesota bank excise tax. The State of Minnesota could apply the same reasoning
in determining whether interest on the Possession Bonds is subject to the taxes 
listed above on which we express no opinion.                                    

       We have not examined any of the Bonds to be deposited and held in the
Minnesota Trust or the proceedings for the issuance thereof or the opinions of  
bond counsel with respect thereto, and therefore express no opinions to the     
exemption from State income taxes of interest on the Bonds if received directly 
by a Unitholder. Chapman and Cutler LLP has expressed no opinion with respect to
taxation under any other provision of Minnesota law. Ownership of the Units may 
result in collateral Minnesota tax consequences to certain taxpayers.           
Prospective investors should consult their tax advisors as to the applicability 
of any such collateral consequences.                                            

         Missouri Risk Factors. The financial condition of the State of Missouri
is affected by various national, economic, social and environmental policies and
conditions. Additionally, Constitutional and statutory limitations imposed on   
the state and its local governments concerning taxes, bond indebtedness and     
other matters may constrain the revenue-generating capacity of the State and its
local governments and, therefore, the ability of the issuers of the Bonds to    
satisfy their obligations.                                                      

 The economic vitality of the State and its various regions and,
therefore, the ability of the State and its local governments to satisfy the    
Bonds, are affected by numerous factors.                                        

         The State may be a party to numerous lawsuits in which an adverse final
decision could materially affect the State's governmental operations and        
consequently its ability to pay debt service on its obligations.                

      Further information concerning Missouri risk factors may be obtained
upon request to the Sponsor as described in "Additional Information".           

         Tax Status. At the time of the closing for each Missouri Trust, special
counsel to the Trust for Missouri tax matters rendered an opinion under then    
existing Missouri income tax law applicable to taxpayers whose income is subject
to Missouri income taxation substantially to the effect that:                   

         The assets of the Missouri IM-IT Trust will consist of debt obligations
issued by or on behalf of the State of Missouri (the "State") or counties,      
municipalities, authorities or political subdivisions thereof (the "Missouri    
Bonds") or by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or an authority thereof (the      
"Possession Bonds") (collectively, the "Bonds").                                

     Neither the Sponsor nor its counsel have independently examined the
Bonds to be deposited in and held in the Missouri IM-IT Trust. However, although
no opinion is expressed herein regarding such matters, it is assumed that: (i)  
the Bonds were validly issued, (ii) the interest thereon is excludable from     
gross income for Federal income tax purposes and (iii) interest on the Bonds, if
received directly by a Unitholder, would be exempt from the Missouri income tax 
applicable to individuals and corporations ("Missouri State Income Tax"). It is 
assumed that, at the respective times of issuance of the Bonds, opinions that   
the Bonds were validly issued and that interest on the Bonds is excluded from   
gross income for Federal income tax purposes were rendered by bond counsel to   
the respective issuing authorities. In addition, with respect to the Missouri   
Bonds, bond counsel to the issuing authorities rendered opinions that the       
interest on the Missouri Bonds is exempt from the Missouri State Income Tax and,
with respect to the Possession Bonds, bond counsel to the issuing authorities   
rendered opinions that the Possession Bonds and the interest thereon is exempt  
from all state and local income taxation. Neither the Sponsor nor its counsel   
has made any review for the Missouri IM-IT Trust of the proceedings relating to 
the issuance of the Bonds or the bases for the opinions rendered in connection  
therewith. The opinion set forth below does not address the taxation of persons 
other than full time residents of Missouri.                                     

     In the opinion of special counsel to the Trust, under then existing
Missouri law, and based on the assumptions set forth above:                     

 (1) The Missouri IM-IT Trust is not an association taxable as a
corporation for Missouri income tax purposes, and each Unitholder of the        
Missouri IM-IT Trust will be treated as the owner of a pro rata portion of the  
Missouri IM-IT Trust and the income of such portion of the Missouri IM-IT Trust 
will be treated as the income of the Unitholder for Missouri State Income Tax   
purposes.                                                                       

     (2) Interest paid and original issue discount, if any, on the Bonds
which would be exempt from the Missouri State Income Tax if received directly by
a Unitholder will be exempt from the Missouri State Income Tax when received by 
the Missouri IM-IT Trust and distributed to such Unitholder; however, no opinion
is expressed herein regarding taxation of interest paid and original issue      
discount, if any, on the Bonds received by the Missouri IM-IT Trust and         
distributed to Unitholders under any other tax imposed pursuant to Missouri law,
including but not limited to the franchise tax imposed on financial institutions
pursuant to Chapter 148 of the Missouri Statutes.                               

        (3) Each Unitholder of the Missouri IM-IT Trust will recognize gain or
loss for Missouri State Income Tax purposes if the Trustee disposes of a Bond   
(whether by redemption, sale, payment at maturity or otherwise) or if the       
Unitholder redeems or sells Units of the Missouri IM-IT Trust to the extent that
such a transaction results in a recognized gain or loss to such Unitholder for  
Federal income tax purposes. Due to the amortization of bond premium and other  
basis adjustments required by the Internal Revenue Code, a Unitholder under some
circumstances, may realize taxable gain when his or her Units are sold or       
redeemed for an amount less than or equal to their original cost.               

         (4) Any insurance proceeds paid under policies which represent maturing
interest on defaulted obligations which are excludable from gross income for    
Federal income tax purposes will be excludable from the Missouri State Income   
Tax to the same extent as such interest would have been so excludible if paid by
the issuer of such Bonds held by the Missouri IM-IT Trust; however, no opinion  
is expressed herein regarding taxation of interest paid and original issue      
discount, if any, on the Bonds received by the Missouri IM-IT Trust and         
distributed to Unitholders under any other tax imposed pursuant to Missouri law,
including but not limited to the franchise tax imposed on financial institutions
pursuant to Chapter 148 of the Missouri Statutes.                               

  (5) The Missouri State Income Tax does not permit a deduction of
interest paid or incurred on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or  
carry Units in the Trust, the interest on which is exempt from such tax.        

      (6) The Missouri IM-IT Trust will not be subject to the Kansas City,
Missouri Earnings and Profits Tax and each Unitholder's share of income of the  
Bonds held by the Missouri IM-IT Trust will not generally be subject to the     
Kansas City, Missouri Earnings and Profits Tax or the City of St. Louis Earnings
Tax (except that no opinion is expressed in the case of certain Unitholders,    
including corporations, otherwise subject to the St. Louis City Earnings Tax).  

 Chapman and Cutler LLP has expressed no opinion with respect to
taxation under any other provision of Missouri law. Ownership of the Units may  
result in collateral Missouri tax consequences to certain taxpayers. Prospective
investors should consult their tax advisors as to the applicability of any such 
collateral consequences.                                                        

         Nebraska Risk Factors. The financial condition of the State of Nebraska
is affected by various national, economic, social and environmental policies and
conditions. Additionally, Constitutional and statutory limitations imposed on   
the State and its local governments concerning taxes, bond indebtedness and     
other matters may constrain the revenue-generating capacity of the State and its
local governments and, therefore, the ability of the issuers of the Bonds to    
satisfy their obligations.                                                      

 The economic vitality of the State and its various regions and,
therefore, the ability of the State and its local governments to satisfy the    
Bonds, are affected by numerous factors.                                        

         The State may be a party to numerous lawsuits in which an adverse final
decision could materially affect the State's governmental operations and        
consequently its ability to pay debt service on its obligations.                

      Further information concerning Nebraska risk factors may be obtained
upon request to the Sponsor as described in "Additional Information".           

         Tax Status. At the time of the closing for each Nebraska Trust, special
counsel to the Trust for Nebraska tax matters rendered an opinion under then    
existing Nebraska income tax law applicable to taxpayers whose income is subject
to Nebraska income taxation substantially to the effect that:                   

   The assets of the Nebraska Trust will consist of interest-bearing
obligations issued by or on behalf of the State of Nebraska (the "State") or    
counties, municipalities, authorities or political subdivisions thereof (the    
"Nebraska Bonds") or by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam and the United    
States Virgin Islands (the "Possession Bonds") (collectively, the "Bonds").     

     Neither the Sponsor nor its counsel have independently examined the
Bonds to be deposited in and held in the Nebraska Trust. With respect to certain
Nebraska Bonds which may be held by the Nebraska Trust, the opinions of bond    
counsel to the issuing authorities for such Bonds have indicated that the       
interest on such Bonds is included in computing the Nebraska Alternative Minimum
Tax imposed by Section 77-2715 (2) of the Revised Nebraska Statutes (the        
"Nebraska Minimum Taxes") (the "Nebraska AMT Bonds"). However, although no      
opinion is expressed herein regarding such matters, it is assumed that: (i) the 
Bonds were validly issued, (ii) the interest thereon is excludable from gross   
income for Federal income tax purposes, (iii) none of the Bonds (other than the 
Nebraska AMT Bonds, if any) are "specified private activity bonds" the interest 
on which is included as an item of tax preference in the computation of the     
Alternative Minimum Tax for federal income tax purposes, (iv) interest on the   
Nebraska Bonds (other than the Nebraska AMT Bonds, if any), if received directly
by a Unitholder, would be exempt from both the Nebraska income tax, imposed by  
Section 77-2714 et seq. of the Revised Nebraska Statutes (other than the        
Nebraska Minimum Tax) (the "Nebraska State Income Tax") and the Nebraska Minimum
Tax imposed by Section 77-2715 (2) of the Revised Nebraska Statutes (the        
"Nebraska Minimum Tax"), and (v) interest on the Nebraska AMT Bonds, if any, if 
received directly by a Unitholder, would be exempt from the Nebraska State      
Income Tax. The opinion set forth below does not address the taxation of persons
other than full time residents of Nebraska.                                     

     In the opinion of special counsel to the Trust, under then existing
Nebraska law and based upon the assumptions set forth above:                    

        (1) The Nebraska Trust is not an association taxable as a corporation,
each Unitholder of the Nebraska Trust will be treated as the owner of a pro rata
portion of the Nebraska Trust, and the income of such portion of the Nebraska   
Trust will therefore be treated as the income of the Unitholder for both        
Nebraska State Income Tax and Nebraska Minimum Tax purposes;                    

        (2) Interest on the Bonds which is exempt from both the Nebraska State
Income Tax and the Nebraska Minimum Tax when received by the Nebraska Trust, and
which would be exempt from both the Nebraska State Income Tax and the Nebraska  
Minimum Tax if received directly by a Unitholder, will retain its status as     
exempt from such taxes when received by the Nebraska Trust and distributed to a 
Unitholder;                                                                     

      (3) Interest on the Nebraska AMT Bonds, if any, which is exempt from
the Nebraska State Income Tax but is included in the computation of the Nebraska
Minimum Tax when received by the Nebraska Trust, and which would be exempt from 
the Nebraska State Income Tax but would be included in the computation of the   
Nebraska Minimum Tax if received directly by a Unitholder, will retain its      
status as exempt from the Nebraska State Income Tax but included in the         
computation of the Nebraska Minimum Tax when received by the Nebraska Trust and 
distributed to a Unitholder;                                                    

      (4) To the extent that interest derived from the Nebraska Trust by a
Unitholder with respect to the Possession Bonds is excludable from gross income 
for Federal income tax purposes pursuant to 48 U.S.C. Section 745, 48 U.S.C.    
Section 1423a and 48 U.S.C. Section 1403, such interest will not be subject to  
either the Nebraska State Income Tax or the Nebraska Minimum Tax;               

       (5) Each Unitholder of the Nebraska Trust will recognize gain or loss
for both Nebraska State Income Tax and Nebraska Minimum Tax purposes if the     
Trustee disposes of a Bond (whether by redemption, sale or otherwise) or if the 
Unitholder redeems or sells Units of the Nebraska Trust to the extent that such 
a transaction results in a recognized gain or loss to such Unitholder for       
Federal income tax purposes;                                                    

   (6) The Nebraska State Income Tax does not permit a deduction for
interest paid or incurred on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or  
carry Units in the Nebraska Trust, the interest on which is exempt from such    
tax; and                                                                        

(7) In the case of a Unitholder subject to the State financial
institutions franchise tax, the income derived by such Unitholder from his pro  
rata portion of the Bonds held by the Nebraska Trust may affect the             
determination of such Unitholder's maximum franchise tax.                       

       We have not examined any of the Bonds to be deposited and held in the
Nebraska Trust or the proceedings for the issuance thereof or the opinions of   
bond counsel with respect thereto, and therefore express no opinion as to the   
exemption from either the Nebraska State Income Tax or the Nebraska Minimum Tax 
of interest on the Nebraska Bonds if received directly by a Unitholder.         

 Chapman and Cutler LLP has expressed no opinion with respect to
taxation under any other provision of Nebraska law. Ownership of the Units may  
result in collateral Nebraska tax consequences to certain taxpayers. Prospective
investors should consult their own tax advisors as to the applicability of any  
such collateral consequences.                                                   

      New Jersey Risk Factors. The financial condition of the State of New
Jersey is affected by various national, economic, social and environmental      
policies and conditions. Additionally, Constitutional and statutory limitations 
imposed on the State and its local governments concerning taxes, bond           
indebtedness and other matters may constrain the revenue-generating capacity of 
the State and its local governments and, therefore, the ability of the issuers  
of the Bonds to satisfy their obligations.                                      

 The economic vitality of the State and its various regions and,
therefore, the ability of the State and its local governments to satisfy the    
Bonds, are affected by numerous factors. The State's economic base is           
diversified, consisting of manufacturing, construction and service industries,  
supplemented by rural areas with selective commercial agriculture.              

         The State may be a party to numerous lawsuits in which an adverse final
decision could materially affect the State's governmental operations and        
consequently its ability to pay debt service on its obligations.                

        Further information concerning New Jersey risk factors may be obtained
upon request to the Sponsor as described in "Additional Information".           

         Tax Status. For a discussion of the Federal tax status of income earned
on New Jersey IM-IT Trust Units, see "Federal Tax Status" in Prospectus Part II 
as supplemented by the section entitled "Federal Tax Status" below.             

   In the opinion of special counsel to the Trust for New Jersey tax
matters, in summary under existing law:                                         

         (1) The New Jersey IM-IT Trust will be recognized as a trust and not an
association taxable as a corporation. The New Jersey IM-IT Trust will not be    
subject to the New Jersey Corporation Business Tax or the New Jersey Corporation
Income Tax.                                                                     

        (2) With respect to the non-corporate Unitholders who are residents of
New Jersey, the income of the New Jersey IM-IT Trust which is allocable to each 
such Unitholder will be treated as the income of such Unitholder under the New  
Jersey Gross Income Tax. Interest on the underlying bonds which would be exempt 
from New Jersey Gross Income Tax if directly received by such Unitholder will   
retain its status as tax-exempt interest when received by the New Jersey IM-IT  
Trust and distributed to such Unitholder. Any proceeds paid under the insurance 
policy issued to the Trustee of the New Jersey IM-IT Trust with respect to the  
bonds or under individual policies obtained by issuers of bonds which represent 
maturing interest on defaulted obligations held by the Trustee will be exempt   
from New Jersey Gross Income Tax if, and to the same extent as, such interest   
would have been so exempt if paid by the issuer of the defaulted obligations.   

      (3) A non-corporate Unitholder will not be subject to the New Jersey
Gross Income Tax on any gain realized either when the New Jersey IM-IT Trust    
disposes of a bond (whether by sale, exchange, redemption, or payment at        
maturity), when the Unitholder redeems or sells his Units or upon payment of any
proceeds under the insurance policy issued to the Trustee of the New Jersey     
IM-IT Trust with respect to the bonds or under individual policies obtained by  
issuers of bonds which represent maturing principal on defaulted obligations    
held by the Trustee. Any loss realized on such disposition may not be utilized  
to offset gains realized by such Unitholder on the disposition of assets the    
gain on which is subject to the New Jersey Gross Income Tax.                    

        (4) Units of the New Jersey IM-IT Trust may be taxable on the death of
a Unitholder under the New Jersey Transfer Inheritance Tax Law or the New Jersey
Estate Tax Law.                                                                 

(5) If a Unitholder is a corporation subject to the New Jersey
Corporation Business Tax or New Jersey Corporation Income Tax, interest from the
bonds in the New Jersey IM-IT Trust which is allocable to such corporation will 
be includible in its entire net income for purposes of the New Jersey           
Corporation Business Tax or New Jersey Corporation Income Tax, less any interest
expense incurred to carry such investment to the extent such interest expense   
has not been deducted in computing Federal taxable income. Net gains derived by 
such corporation on the disposition of the bonds by the New Jersey IM-IT Trust  
or on the disposition of its Units will be included in its entire net income for
purposes of the New Jersey Corporation Business Tax or New Jersey Corporation   
Income Tax. Any proceeds paid under the insurance policy issued to the Trustee  
of the New Jersey IM-IT Trust with respect to the bonds or under individual     
policies obtained by issuers of bonds which represent maturing interest or      
maturing principal on defaulted obligations held by the Trustee will be included
in its entire net income for purposes of the New Jersey Corporation Business Tax
or New Jersey Corporation Income Tax if, and to the same extent as, such        
interest or proceeds would have been so included if paid by the issuer of the   
defaulted obligations.                                                          

      New Mexico Risk Factors. The financial condition of the State of New
Mexico is affected by various national, economic, social and environmental      
policies and conditions. Additionally, Constitutional and statutory limitations 
imposed on the State and its local governments concerning taxes, bond           
indebtedness and other matters may constrain the revenue-generating capacity of 
the State and its local governments and, therefore, the ability of the issuers  
of the Bonds to satisfy their obligations.                                      

 The economic vitality of the State and its various regions and,
therefore, the ability of the State and its local governments to satisfy the    
Bonds, are affected by numerous factors. The State's economy is composed of     
energy resources, services, construction and trade. These industries tend to be 
highly cyclical. Tourism is also one of the State's important industries.       
Because many international travelers visit New Mexico, an increase in the value 
of the U.S. dollar adversely affects this industry. Moreover, New Mexico could  
be impacted by problems in the agricultural sector, including crop failures,    
severe weather conditions or other agricultural-related problems.               

         The State may be a party to numerous lawsuits in which an adverse final
decision could materially affect the State's governmental operations and        
consequently its ability to pay debt service on its obligations.                

        Further information concerning New Mexico risk factors may be obtained
upon request to the Sponsor as described in "Additional Information".           

   Tax Status. At the time of the closing for each New Mexico Trust,
special counsel to the Trust for New Mexico tax matters rendered an opinion     
under then existing New Mexico income tax law applicable to taxpayers whose     
income is subject to New Mexico income taxation substantially to the effect     
that:                                                                           

     The assets of the New Mexico Trust will consist of interest-bearing
obligations issued by or on behalf of the State of New Mexico ("New Mexico") or 
counties, municipalities, authorities or political subdivisions thereof (the    
"New Mexico Bonds"), and by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, or the Virgin
Islands (collectively the "Possession Bonds") (collectively the New Mexico Bonds
and the Possession Bonds shall be referred to herein as the "Bonds") the        
interest on which is expected to qualify as exempt from New Mexico income taxes.

     Neither the Sponsor nor its counsel have independently examined the
Bonds to be deposited in and held in the New Mexico Trust. However, although no 
opinion is expressed herein regarding such matters, it is assumed that: (i) the 
Bonds were validly issued, (ii) the interest thereon is excludable from gross   
income for Federal income tax purposes and (iii) interest on the Bonds, if      
received directly by a Unitholder, would be exempt from the New Mexico income   
taxes applicable to individuals and corporations (collectively, the "New Mexico 
State Income Tax"). At the respective times of issuance of the Bonds, opinions  
relating to the validity thereof and to the exemption of interest thereon from  
Federal income tax were rendered by bond counsel to the respective issuing      
authorities. In addition, with respect to the New Mexico Bonds, bond counsel to 
the issuing authorities rendered opinions as to the exemption of interest from  
the New Mexico State Income Tax and, with respect to the Possession Bonds, bond 
counsel to the issuing authorities rendered opinions as to the exemption from   
all state and local income taxation. Neither the Sponsor nor its counsel has    
made any review for the New Mexico Trust of the proceedings relating to the     
issuance of the Bonds or of the bases for the opinions rendered in connection   
therewith. The opinion set forth below does not address the taxation of persons 
other than full time residents of New Mexico.                                   

   In the opinion of special counsel to the Trust for New Mexico tax
matters under then existing New Mexico law and based upon the assumptions set   
forth above:                                                                    

   (1) The New Mexico Trust will not be subject to tax under the New
Mexico State Income Tax.                                                        

     (2) Interest on the Bonds which is exempt from the New Mexico State
Income Tax when received by the New Mexico Trust, and which would be exempt from
the New Mexico State Income Tax if received directly by a Unitholder, will      
retain its status as exempt from such tax when received by the New Mexico Trust 
and distributed to such Unitholder provided that the New Mexico Trust complies  
with the reporting requirements contained in the New Mexico State Income Tax    
regulations.                                                                    

    (3) To the extent that interest income derived from the New Mexico
Trust by a Unitholder with respect to Possession Bonds is excludable from gross 
income for Federal income tax purposes pursuant to 48 U.S.C. Section 745, 48    
U.S.C. Section 1423a or 48 U.S.C. Section 1403, such interest income will not be
subject to New Mexico State Income Tax.                                         

       (4) Each Unitholder will recognize gain or loss for New Mexico Income
Tax purposes if the Trustee disposes of a bond (whether by redemption, sale or  
otherwise) or if the Unitholder redeems or sells Units of the New Mexico Trust  
to the extent that such a transaction results in a recognized gain or loss to   
such Unitholder for Federal income tax purposes.                                

    (5) The New Mexico State Income Tax does not permit a deduction of
interest paid on indebtedness or other expenses incurred (or continued) in      
connection with the purchase or carrying of Units in the New Mexico Trust to the
extent that interest income related to the ownership of Units is exempt from the
New Mexico State Income Tax.                                                    

 Chapman and Cutler LLP has expressed no opinion with respect to
taxation under any other provisions of New Mexico law. We have assumed that at  
the respective times of issuance of the Bonds, opinions relating to the validity
thereof and to the exemption of interest thereon from Federal income tax were   
rendered by bond counsel to the respective issuing authorities. Investors should
consult their tax advisors regarding collateral tax consequences under New      
Mexico law relating to the ownership of the Units, including, but not limited   
to, the inclusion of income attributable to ownership of the Units in "modified 
gross income" for purposes of determining eligibility for and the amount of the 
low income comprehensive tax rebate, the child day care credit, and the elderly 
taxpayers' property tax rebate, and the applicability of other New Mexico taxes,
such as the New Mexico estate tax.                                              

         New York Risk Factors. The financial condition of the State of New York
is affected by various national, economic, social and environmental policies and
conditions. Additionally, Constitutional and statutory limitations imposed on   
the State and its local governments concerning taxes, bond indebtedness and     
other matters may constrain the revenue-generating capacity of the State and its
local governments and, therefore, the ability of the issuers of the Bonds to    
satisfy their obligations.                                                      

 The economic vitality of the State and its various regions and,
therefore, the ability of the State and its local governments to satisfy the    
Bonds, are affected by numerous factors. The economy of the State continues to  
be influenced by the financial health of the City of New York, which, due to the
terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, has been     
weakened. The burden of State and local taxation, in combination with the many  
other causes of regional economic dislocation, may have contributed to the      
decisions of some businesses and individuals to relocate outside, or not locate 
within, the State.                                                              

       The State may be party to numerous lawsuits in which an adverse final
decision could materially affect the State's governmental operations and        
consequently its ability to pay debt service on its obligations.                

      Further information concerning New York risk factors may be obtained
upon request to the Sponsor as described in "Additional Information".           

         Tax Status. In the opinion of special counsel to the Trust for New York
tax matters, in summary under existing New York law, the New York IM-IT Trust is
not an association taxable as a corporation and the income of the New York IM-IT
Trust will be treated as the income of the Unitholders under the income tax laws
of the State and City of New York. Individuals who reside in New York State or  
City will not be subject to State and City tax on interest income which is      
exempt from Federal income tax under section 103 of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986 and derived from obligations of New York State or a political subdivision  
thereof or of the Government of Puerto Rico or a political subdivision thereof  
or of the Government of Guam or its authorities, although they will be subject  
to New York State and City tax with respect to any gains realized when such     
obligations are sold, redeemed or paid at maturity or when any such Units are   
sold or redeemed.                                                               

      North Carolina Risk Factors. The financial condition of the State of
North Carolina is affected by various national, economic, social and            
environmental policies and conditions. Additionally, Constitutional and         
statutory limitations imposed on the State and its local governments concerning 
taxes, bond indebtedness and other matters may constrain the revenue-generating 
capacity of the State and its local governments and, therefore, the ability of  
the issuers of the Bonds to satisfy their obligations.                          

 The economic vitality of the State and its various regions and,
therefore, the ability of the State and its local governments to satisfy the    
Bonds, are affected by numerous factors. The State's economic base is           
diversified, consisting of manufacturing, construction and service industries,  
supplemented by rural areas with selective commercial agriculture. The State has
a relatively high wage labor market which has resulted in the State's business  
sector becoming more vulnerable to competitive pressures.                       

         The State may be a party to numerous lawsuits in which an adverse final
decision could materially affect the State's governmental operations and        
consequently its ability to pay debt service on its obligations.                

   Further information concerning North Carolina risk factors may be

        Tax Status. The portfolio of the North Carolina Quality Trust consists
of bonds issued by the State of North Carolina or municipalities, authorities or
political subdivisions thereof (the "North Carolina Bonds") or by territories or
possessions of the United States. We have assumed for the purposes of this      
opinion that the issuers of bonds other than North Carolina Bonds will be       
limited to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands or 
Guam, or their respective public authorities (collectively, the "Possession     
Bonds") (the North Carolina Bonds and the Possession Bonds are sometimes        
referred to herein as the "Bonds").                                             

      In the opinion of special counsel to the Fund for North Carolina tax
matters, in summary under existing North Carolina law, upon the establishing of 
the North Carolina Quality Trust and the Units thereunder:                      

         (1) The North Carolina Quality Trust is not an "association" taxable as
a corporation under North Carolina law with the result that income of the North 
Carolina Quality Trust will be deemed to be income of the Unitholders.          

         (2) Interest on the Bonds that is exempt from North Carolina income tax
when received by the North Carolina Quality Trust will retain its tax-exempt    
status when received by the Unitholders.                                        

      (3) Unitholders will realize a taxable event when the North Carolina
Quality Trust disposes of a Bond (whether by sale, exchange, redemption or      
payment at maturity) or when a Unitholder redeems or sells his Units (or any of 
them), and taxable gains for Federal income tax purposes may result in gain     
taxable as ordinary income for North Carolina income tax purposes. However, when
a Bond has been issued under an act of the North Carolina General Assembly that 
provides that all income from such Bond, including any profit made from the sale
thereof, shall be free from all taxation by the State of North Carolina, any    
such profit received by the North Carolina Quality Trust will retain its        
tax-exempt status in the hands of the Unitholders.                              

         (4) Unitholders must amortize their proportionate shares of any premium
on a Bond. Amortization for each taxable year is accomplished by lowering the   
Unitholder's basis (as adjusted) in his Units with no deduction against gross   
income for the year.                                                            

     The opinion of special counsel is based, in part, on the opinion of
Chapman and Cutler LLP regarding Federal tax status.                            

    Ohio Risk Factors. The financial condition of the State of Ohio is
affected by various national, economic, social and environmental policies and   
conditions. Additionally, Constitutional and statutory limitations imposed on   
the State and its local governments concerning taxes, bond indebtedness and     
other matters may constrain the revenue-generating capacity of the State and its
local governments and, therefore, the ability of the issuers of the Bonds to    
satisfy their obligations. The State operates on the basis of a fiscal biennium 
for its appropriations and expenditures, and is precluded by law from ending its
fiscal year or fiscal biennium in a deficit position.                           

 The economic vitality of the State and its various regions and,
therefore, the ability of the State and its local governments to satisfy the    
Bonds, are affected by numerous factors. The Ohio economy continues to rely in  
part on durable goods manufacturing, largely concentrated in motor vehicles and 
equipment, steel, rubber products and household appliances. Yet, the Ohio       
economy has become more diversified with expansion into the service and other   
non-manufacturing sectors.                                                      

         The State may be a party to numerous lawsuits in which an adverse final
decision could materially affect the State governmental operations and          
consequently its ability to pay debt service on its obligations.                

       Further information concerning Ohio risk factors may be obtained upon
request to the Sponsor as described in "Additional Information".                

         For a discussion of the Federal tax status of income earned on tax Ohio
Trust Units, see "Federal Tax Status" in Prospectus Part II as supplemented by  
the section entitled "Federal Tax Status" below.                                

      In the opinion of special counsel to the Trust for Ohio tax matters,
assuming the Ohio IM-IT continues to qualify as a grantor trust under Section   
676(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and that  
at all times at least fifty percent (50%) of the total assets of the Ohio IM-IT 
will consist of interest-bearing Obligations of the State of Ohio or its        
political subdivisions or similar obligations of other states or their political
subdivisions under existing law:                                                

       (1) The Ohio IM-IT Trust is not taxable as a corporation or otherwise
for purposes of the Ohio personal income tax, school district or municipal      
income taxes in Ohio, the Ohio corporation franchise tax, or the Ohio dealers in
intangibles tax.                                                                

 (2) Distributions with respect to Units of the Ohio IM-IT Trust
("Distributions") will be treated as the income of the Unitholders for purposes 
of the Ohio personal income tax, and school district and municipal income taxes 
in Ohio and the Ohio corporation franchise tax in proportion to the respective  
interest therein of each Unitholder.                                            

    (3) Distributions properly attributable to interest on obligations
issued by or on behalf of the State of Ohio, political subdivisions thereof, or 
agencies or instrumentalities thereof ("Ohio Obligations") held by the Trust are
exempt from the Ohio personal income tax, school district and municipal income  
taxes in Ohio, and are excluded from the net income base of the Ohio corporation
franchise tax when distributed or deemed distributed to Unitholders.            

    (4) Distributions properly attributable to interest on obligations
issued by the governments of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands or Guam            
("Territorial Obligations") held by the Ohio IM-IT Trust the interest on which  
is exempt from state income taxes under the laws of the United States are exempt
from the Ohio personal income tax, and municipal and school district income     
taxes in Ohio and, provided such interest is excluded from gross income for     
Federal income tax purposes, are excluded from the net income base of the Ohio  
corporation franchise tax when distributed or deemed distributed to Unitholders.

       (5) Distributions properly attributable to proceeds of insurance paid
to the Ohio IM-IT Trust that represent maturing or matured interest on defaulted
obligations held by the Ohio IM-IT Trust and that are excluded from gross income
for Federal income tax purposes will be exempt from Ohio personal income tax,   
and school district and municipal income taxes in Ohio and the net income base  
of the Ohio corporation franchise tax.                                          

 (6) Distributions of profit made on the sale, exchange or other
disposition by the Ohio IM-IT Trust of Ohio Obligations, including distributions
of "capital gain dividends" as defined in Section 852(b)(3)(C) of the Code,     
properly attributable to the sale, exchange or other disposition of Ohio        
Obligations are exempt from Ohio personal income tax, and school district and   
municipal income taxes in Ohio, and are excluded from the net income base of the
Ohio corporation franchise tax.                                                 

         Oklahoma Risk Factors. The financial condition of the State of Oklahoma
is affected by various national, economic, social and environmental policies and
conditions. Additionally, Constitutional and statutory limitations imposed on   
the State and its local governments concerning taxes, bond indebtedness and     
other matters may constrain the revenue-generating capacity of the State and its
local governments and, therefore, the ability of the issuers of the Bonds to    
satisfy their obligations.                                                      

 The economic vitality of the State and its various regions and,
therefore, the ability of the State and its local governments to satisfy the    
Bonds, are affected by numerous factors. Oklahoma has broadened its economic    
base to rely less on petroleum and agriculture and has expanded in              
manufacturing. These industries tend to be highly cyclical and there is no      
assurance that Oklahoma's current expansionary phase will continue.             

         The State may be a party to numerous lawsuits in which an adverse final
decision could materially affect the State's governmental operations and        
consequently its ability to pay debt service on its obligations.                

      Further information concerning Oklahoma risk factors may be obtained
upon request to the Sponsor as described in "Additional Information".           

         Tax Status. At the time of the closing for each Oklahoma Trust, special
counsel to the Trust for Oklahoma tax matters rendered an opinion under then    
existing Oklahoma income tax law applicable to taxpayers whose income is subject
to Oklahoma income taxation substantially to the effect that:                   

   The assets of the Oklahoma Trust will consist of interest-bearing
obligations issued by or on behalf of the State of Oklahoma (the "State") or    
counties, municipalities, authorities or political subdivisions thereof (the    
"Oklahoma Bonds") or by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam and the United    
States Virgin Islands (the "Possession Bonds") (collectively, the "Bonds"). At  
the respective times of issuance of the Oklahoma Bonds, certain, but not        
necessarily all, of the issues of the Oklahoma Bonds may have been accompanied  
by an opinion of bond counsel to the respective issuing authorities that        
interest on such Oklahoma Bonds (the "Oklahoma Tax-Exempt Bonds") are exempt    
from the income tax imposed by the State of Oklahoma that is applicable to      
individuals and corporations (the "Oklahoma State Income Tax"). The Oklahoma    
Trust may include Oklahoma Bonds the interest on which is subject to the        
Oklahoma State Income Tax (the "Oklahoma Taxable Bonds"). See "Portfolio" which 
indicates by footnote which Oklahoma Bonds are Oklahoma Tax-Exempt Bonds (all   
other Oklahoma Bonds included in the portfolio are Oklahoma Taxable Bonds).     

    Neither the Sponsor nor its counsel has independently examined the
Bonds to be deposited in and held in the Oklahoma Trust. However, although no   
opinion is expressed herein regarding such matters, it is assumed that: (i) the 
Bonds were validly issued, (ii) the interest thereon is excludable from gross   
income for Federal income tax purposes and (iii) interest on the Oklahoma       
Tax-Exempt Bonds and the Possession Bonds, if received directly by a Unitholder,
would be exempt from the Oklahoma State Income Tax. At the respective times of  
issuance of the Bonds, opinions relating to the validity thereof and to the     
exemption of interest thereon from Federal income tax were rendered by bond     
counsel to the respective issuing authorities. In addition, with respect to the 
Oklahoma Tax-Exempt Bonds, bond counsel to the issuing authorities rendered     
opinions as to the exemption of interest from the Oklahoma State Income Tax and,
with respect to the Possession Bonds, bond counsel to the issuing authorities   
rendered opinions as to the exemption from all state and local income taxation. 
Neither the Sponsor nor its counsel has made any review for the Oklahoma Trust  
of the proceedings relating to the issuance of the Bonds or of the bases for the
opinions rendered in connection therewith. The opinion set forth below does not 
address the taxation of persons other than full time residents of Oklahoma.     

 In the opinion of special counsel to the Trust for Oklahoma tax
matters, under then existing Oklahoma law and based upon the assumptions set    
forth above:                                                                    

       (1) For Oklahoma State Income Tax purposes, the Oklahoma Trust is not
an association taxable as a corporation, each Unitholder of the Trust will be   
treated as the owner of a pro rata portion of the Oklahoma Trust and the income 
of such portion of the Oklahoma Trust will be treated as the income of the      
Unitholder.                                                                     

     (2) Interest paid and original issue discount, if any, on the Bonds
which would be exempt from the Oklahoma State Income Tax if received directly by
a Unitholder will be exempt from the Oklahoma State Income Tax when received by 
the Trust and distributed to such Unitholder. A Unitholder's pro rata portion of
any interest paid and original issue discount, if any, on the Bonds which would 
be subject to the Oklahoma State Income Tax if received directly by a           
Unitholder, including, for example interest paid and original issue discount, if
any, on the Oklahoma Taxable Bonds, will be taxable to such Unitholder for      
Oklahoma State Income Tax purposes when received by the Oklahoma Trust.         

      (3) To the extent that interest paid and original issue discount, if
any, derived from the Oklahoma Trust by a Unitholder with respect to Possession 
Bonds is excludable from gross income for Federal income tax purposes pursuant  
to 48 U.S.C. Section 745, 48 U.S.C. Section 1423a, and 48 U.S.C. Section 1403,  
such interest paid and original issue discount, if any, will not be subject to  
the Oklahoma State Income Tax.                                                  

       (4) Each Unitholder of the Oklahoma Trust will recognize gain or loss
for Oklahoma State Income Tax purposes if the Trustee disposes of a Bond        
(whether by redemption, sale, payment at maturity or otherwise) or if the       
Unitholder redeems or sells Units of the Oklahoma Trust to the extent that such 
a transaction results in a recognized gain or loss to such Unitholder for       
Federal income tax purposes. Due to the amortization of bond premium and other  
basis adjustments required by the Internal Revenue Code, a Unitholder, under    
some circumstances, may realize taxable gain when his or her Units are sold or  
redeemed for an amount equal to their original cost.                            

      (5) Although no opinion is expressed herein, we have been informally
advised by the Oklahoma Tax Commission that any insurance proceeds paid under   
policies which represent maturing interest on defaulted obligations which are   
excludable from gross income for Federal income tax purposes should be          
excludable from the Oklahoma State Income Tax to the same extent as such        
interest would have been if paid by the issuer of such Bonds held by the        
Oklahoma Trust provided that, at the time such policies are purchased, the      
amounts paid for such policies are reasonable, customary and consistent with the
reasonable expectation that the issuer of the obligations, rather than the      
insurer, will pay debt service on the obligations.                              

  (6) The Oklahoma State Income Tax does not permit a deduction of
interest paid or incurred on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or  
carry Units in the Oklahoma Trust, the interest on which is exempt from such tax
if such interest is not deductible for Federal income tax purposes. Special     
rules apply in the case of certain banks and financial institutions.            

    Title 68 Section 1201 of the Oklahoma Statutes Annotated imposes a
franchise tax on "corporations" and certain other organizations organized under 
the laws of or qualified to do or doing business in, the State of Oklahoma.     
Recent Oklahoma administrative guidance has indicated that a Federal grantor    
trust (a fixed investment trust) is characterized as a business trust and thus a
corporation for estate tax purposes. Accordingly, the Oklahoma Tax Commission   
may hold that all fixed unit investment trusts are corporations subject to the  
Oklahoma franchise tax. Although Chapman and Cutler LLP expresses no opinion    
with respect to taxation of the Oklahoma Trust for Oklahoma franchise tax       
purposes, there is a reasonable basis to conclude that the Oklahoma Trust is not
subject to the Oklahoma franchise tax because the Trust would not be considered 
as "doing business" within the State. The Oklahoma franchise tax is equal to    
$1.25 per $1,000 of the capital used, invested or employed in the State of      
Oklahoma not to exceed $20,000 per year.                                        

         Under recently enacted Oklahoma legislation, a pass-through entity must
withhold income tax at a rate of five percent of the Oklahoma share of income of
the entity distributed to each nonresident member. A "pass-through entity" is   
defined to include a trust that is not taxed as a corporation for Federal income
tax purposes and a "member" is defined to include a beneficiary of a trust.     
Special counsel has expressed no opinion as to the applicability of this        
provision to amounts distributed by the Oklahoma Trust.                         

         The scope of this opinion is expressly limited to the matters set forth
herein, and we express no other opinions of law with respect to the state or    
local taxation of the Oklahoma Trust, the purchase, ownership or disposition of 
Units or the Unitholders under Oklahoma law. We have assumed that at the        
respective times of issuance of the Bonds, opinions relating to the validity    
thereof and to the exemption of interest thereon from Federal income tax were   
rendered by bond counsel to the respective issuing authorities. In addition, we 
have assumed that, with respect to the Oklahoma Bonds, bond counsel to the      
issuing authorities rendered opinions as to the exemption of interest from the  
Oklahoma Income Tax and, with respect to the Possession Bonds, bond counsel to  
the issuing authorities rendered opinions as to the exemption from all state and
local income taxation of the Possession Bonds and the interest thereon. Neither 
the Sponsor nor its counsel has made any review for the Oklahoma Trust of the   
proceedings relating to the issuance of the Bonds or of the bases for the       
opinions rendered in connection therewith.                                      

        Oregon Risk Factors. The financial condition of the State of Oregon is
affected by various national, economic, social and environmental policies and   
conditions. Additionally, Constitutional and statutory limitations imposed on   
the State and its local governments concerning taxes, bond indebtedness and     
other matters may constrain the revenue-generating capacity of the State and its
local governments and, therefore, the ability of the issuers of the Bonds to    
satisfy their obligations.                                                      

 The economic vitality of the State and its various regions and,
therefore, the ability of the State and its local governments to satisfy the    
Bonds, are affected by numerous factors.                                        

         The State may be a party to numerous lawsuits in which an adverse final
decision could materially affect the State's governmental operations and        
consequently its ability to pay debt service on its obligations.                

         Further information concerning Oregon risk factors may be obtained upon
request to the Sponsor as described in "Additional Information".                

       Tax Status. At the time of the closing for each Oregon Trust, special
counsel to the Trust for Oregon tax matters rendered an opinion under then      
existing Oregon income tax law applicable to taxpayers whose income is subject  
to Oregon income taxation substantially to the effect that:                     

 The assets of the Oregon Trust will consist of interest-bearing
obligations issued by or on behalf of the State of Oregon (the "State") or      
counties, municipalities, authorities or political subdivisions thereof (the    
"Oregon Bonds") or by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam and the United      
States Virgin Islands (the "Possession Bonds") (collectively, the "Bonds").     
Neither the Sponsor nor its counsel have independently examined the Bonds to be 
deposited in and held in the Oregon Trust. Although no opinion is expressed     
herein regarding such matters, it is assumed that: (i) the Bonds were validly   
issued; (ii) the interest thereon is excludable from gross income for Federal   
income tax purposes; and (iii) interest on the Bonds, if received directly by an
Oregon Unitholder, would be exempt from the Oregon income tax applicable to     
individuals (the "Oregon Personal Income Tax").                                 

        In the opinion of counsel to the Trust, under then existing Oregon law
and based on the assumptions set forth above: The Oregon Trust is not an        
association taxable as a corporation and based upon an administrative rule of   
the Oregon State Department of Revenue, each Oregon Unitholder of the Oregon    
Trust will be essentially treated as the owner of a pro rata portion of the     
Oregon Trust and the income of such portion of the Oregon Trust will be treated 
as the income of the Oregon Unitholder for Oregon Personal Income Tax purposes; 

       Interest on the Bonds which is exempt from the Oregon Personal Income
Tax when received by the Oregon Trust, and which would be exempt from the Oregon
Personal Income Tax if received directly by an Oregon Unitholder, will retain   
its status as exempt from such tax when received by the Oregon Trust and        
distributed to an Oregon Unitholder;                                            

        To the extent that interest derived from the Oregon Trust by an Oregon
Unitholder with respect to the Possession Bonds is excludable from gross income 
for Federal income tax purposes pursuant to 48 U.S.C. Section 745, 48 U.S.C.    
Section 1423a and 48 U.S.C. Section 1403, such interest will not be subject to  
the Oregon Personal Income Tax;                                                 

        Each Oregon Unitholder of the Oregon Trust will recognize gain or loss
for Oregon Personal Income Tax purposes if the Trustee disposes of a bond       
(whether by redemption, sale, payment at maturity or otherwise) or if the Oregon
Unitholder redeems or sells Units of the Oregon Trust to the extent that such a 
transaction results in a recognized gain or loss to such Oregon Unitholder for  
Federal income tax purposes; and                                                

        The Oregon Personal Income Tax does not permit a deduction of interest
paid or incurred on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or carry     
Units in the Oregon Trust, the interest on which is exempt from such tax.       

 Chapman and Cutler LLP has expressed no opinion with respect to
taxation under any other provision of Oregon Law. Ownership of the Units may    
result in collateral Oregon tax consequences to certain tax payers.             

Counsel to the Sponsor has not examined any of the Bonds to be
deposited and held in the Oregon Trust or the proceedings for the issuance      
thereof or the opinions of bond counsel with respect thereto and therefore it   
expresses no opinion as to the exemption from the Oregon Personal Income Tax of 
interest on the Bonds if received directly by an Oregon Unitholder. In addition,
prospective purchasers subject to the Oregon corporate income tax should be     
advised that for purposes of the Oregon Corporate Income (Excise) Tax, interest 
on the Bonds received by the Oregon Trust and distributed to an Oregon          
Unitholder subject to such tax will be added to the corporate Oregon            
Unitholder's Federal taxable income and therefore will be taxable. No opinion is
expressed regarding the Oregon taxation of foreign or domestic insurance        
companies. We have assumed that at the respective times of issuance of the      
Bonds, opinions relating to the validity thereof and to the exemption of        
interest thereon from Federal income tax were rendered by bond counsel to the   
respective issuing authorities. In addition, we have assumed that, with respect 
to the Oregon Bonds, bond counsel to the issuing authorities rendered opinions  
as to the exemption of interest from the Oregon Income Tax and, with respect to 
the Possession Bonds, bond counsel to the issuing authorities rendered opinions 
as to the exemption from all state and local income taxation of the Possession  
Bonds and the interest thereon. Neither the Sponsor nor its counsel has made any
review for the Oregon Trust of the proceedings relating to the issuance of the  
Bonds or of the bases for the opinions rendered in connection therewith.        

        Pennsylvania Risk Factors. The financial condition of the Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania is affected by various national, economic, social and           
environmental policies and conditions. Additionally, Constitutional and         
statutory limitations imposed on the State and its local governments concerning 
taxes, bond indebtedness and other matters may constrain the revenue-generating 
capacity of the Commonwealth and its local governments and, therefore, the      
ability of the issuers of the Bonds to satisfy their obligations.               

 The economic vitality of the State and its various regions and,
therefore, the ability of the State and its local governments to satisfy the    
Bonds, are affected by numerous factors. Historically, the economy of the       
Commonwealth has been dependent on heavy industry and manufacturing. Growth in  
the Commonwealth economy has more recently been in the service sector, including
trade, health services and educational institutions. Growth in these sectors may
be affected by Federal funding and state legislation.                           

  The Commonwealth may be a party to numerous lawsuits in which an
adverse final decision could materially affect the Commonwealth's governmental  
operations and consequently its ability to pay debt service on its obligations. 

 Further information concerning Pennsylvania risk factors may be
obtained upon request to the Sponsor as described in "Additional Information".  

  Tax Status. We have examined certain laws of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania (the "Commonwealth") to determine their applicability to the       
Pennsylvania IM-IT Trust and to the holders of Units in the Pennsylvania IM-IT  
Trust who are residents of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (the "Unitholders").
The assets of the Pennsylvania IM-IT Trust will consist of interest-bearing     
obligations issued by or on behalf of the Commonwealth, any public authority,   
commission, board or other agency created by the Commonwealth or a political    
subdivision of the Commonwealth, or political subdivisions thereof (the         
"Pennsylvania Bonds") or by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (the "Puerto Rico   
Bonds", and, collectively with the Pennsylvania Bonds, the "Bonds").            
Distributions of income with respect to the Bonds received by the Pennsylvania  
IM-IT Trust will be made monthly.                                               

      At the time of the closing for the Pennsylvania IM-IT Trust, special
counsel for the Pennsylvania IM-IT Trust for Pennsylvania tax matters rendered  
an opinion under then existing Pennsylvania income tax law applicable to        
taxpayers whose income is subject to Pennsylvania income taxation substantially 
to the effect that:                                                             

       Although we express no opinion with respect thereto, in rendering the
opinion expressed herein, we have assumed that: (i) the Bonds were validly      
issued by the Commonwealth or its municipalities, or by the Commonwealth of     
Puerto Rico, as the case may be, (ii) the interest thereon is excludable from   
gross income for Federal income tax purposes, (iii) the interest thereon is     
exempt from Pennsylvania Commonwealth and local taxes and (iv) with respect to  
the Puerto Rico Bonds, the Puerto Rico Bonds and the interest thereon are exempt
from all state and local taxation. This opinion does not address the taxation of
persons other than full-time residents of Pennsylvania.                         

      In the opinion of special counsel for the Trust for Pennsylvania tax
matters, under then existing Pennsylvania law and based upon the assumptions set
forth above:                                                                    

 (1) The Pennsylvania IM-IT Trust will have no tax liability for
purposes of the personal income tax (the "Personal Income Tax"), the corporate  
income tax (the "Corporate Income Tax") and the capital stock-franchise tax (the
"Franchise Tax"), all of which are imposed under the Pennsylvania Tax Reform    
Code of 1971, or the Philadelphia School District Investment Net Income Tax (the
"Philadelphia School Tax") imposed under Section 19-1804 of the Philadelphia    
Code of Ordinances.                                                             

      (2) Interest on the Bonds, net of Pennsylvania IM-IT Trust expenses,
which is exempt from the Personal Income Tax and the Corporate Income Tax when  
received by the Pennsylvania IM-IT Trust and which would be exempt from such tax
if received directly by a Unitholder, will retain its status as exempt from such
taxes when received by the Pennsylvania IM-IT Trust and distributed to such     
Unitholder. Interest on the Pennsylvania Bonds which is exempt from the         
Philadelphia School Tax when received by the Pennsylvania IM-IT Trust and which 
would be exempt from such tax if received directly by a Unitholder, will retain 
its status as exempt from such tax when received by the Pennsylvania IM-IT Trust
and distributed to such Unitholder. We express no opinion with respect to the   
treatment of distributions from the Pennsylvania IM-IT Trust attributable to    
interest on the Puerto Rico Bonds under the Philadelphia School Tax.            

     (3) Distributions from the Pennsylvania IM-IT Trust attributable to
capital gains recognized by the Pennsylvania IM-IT Trust upon its disposition of
a Pennsylvania Bond issued on or after February 1, 1994 or a Puerto Rico Bond,  
will be taxable for purposes of the Personal Income Tax and the Corporate Income
Tax. No opinion is expressed with respect to the taxation of distributions from 
the Pennsylvania IM-IT Trust attributable to capital gains recognized by the    
Pennsylvania IM-IT Trust upon its disposition of a Pennsylvania Bond issued     
before February 1, 1994.                                                        

     (4) Distributions from the Pennsylvania IM-IT Trust attributable to
capital gains recognized by the Pennsylvania IM-IT Trust upon its disposition of
a Bond will be exempt from the Philadelphia School Tax if the Bond was held by  
the Pennsylvania IM-IT Trust for a period of more than six months and the       
Unitholder held his Unit for more than six months before the disposition of the 
Bond. If, however, the Bond was held by the Pennsylvania IM-IT Trust or the Unit
was held by the Unitholder for a period of less than six months, then           
distributions from the Pennsylvania IM-IT Trust attributable to capital gains   
recognized by the Pennsylvania IM-IT Trust upon its disposition of a            
Pennsylvania Bond issued on or after February 1, 1994 or a Puerto Rico Bond,    
will be taxable for purposes of the Philadelphia School Tax; no opinion is      
expressed with respect to the taxation of any such gains attributable to        
Pennsylvania Bonds issued before February 1, 1994.                              

     (5) Insurance proceeds paid under policies which represent maturing
interest on defaulted obligations will be exempt from the Corporate Income Tax  
to the same extent as such amounts are excluded from gross income for Federal   
income tax purposes. No opinion is expressed with respect to whether such       
insurance proceeds are exempt from the Personal Income Tax or the Philadelphia  
School Tax.                                                                     

       (6) Each Unitholder will recognize gain for purposes of the Corporate
Income Tax if the Unitholder redeems or sells Units of the Pennsylvania IM-IT   
Trust to the extent that such a transaction results in a recognized gain to such
Unitholder for Federal income tax purposes and such gain is attributable to     
Pennsylvania Bonds issued on or after February 1, 1994 or to Puerto Rico Bonds. 
No opinion is expressed with respect to the taxation of gains realized by a     
Unitholder on the sale or redemption of a Unit to the extent such gain is       
attributable to Pennsylvania Bonds issued prior to February 1, 1994.            

     (7) A Unitholder's gain on the sale or redemption of a Unit will be
subject to the Personal Income Tax, except that no opinion is expressed with    
respect to the taxation of any such gain to the extent it is attributable to    
Pennsylvania Bonds issued prior to February 1, 1994.                            

    (8) A Unitholder's gain upon a redemption or sale of Units will be
exempt from the Philadelphia School Tax if the Unitholder held his Unit for more
than six months and the gain is attributable to Bonds held by the Pennsylvania  
IM-IT Trust for a period of more than six months. If, however, the Unit was held
by the Unitholder for less than six months or the gain is attributable to Bonds 
held by the Pennsylvania IM-IT Trust for a period of less than six months, then 
the gains will be subject to the Philadelphia School Tax; except that no opinion
is expressed with respect to the taxation of any such gains attributable to     
Pennsylvania Bonds issued before February 1, 1994.                              

       Unitholders should be aware that, generally, interest on indebtedness
incurred or continued to purchase or carry Units is not deductible for purposes 
of the Personal Income Tax, the Corporate Income Tax or the Philadelphia School 
Tax.                                                                            

       We have not examined any of the Bonds to be deposited and held in the
Pennsylvania IM-IT Trust or the proceedings for the issuance thereof or the     
opinions of bond counsel with respect thereto, and therefore express no opinion 
as to the exemption from federal, state or local taxation of interest on the    
Bonds if interest thereon had been received directly by a Unitholder.           

 Chapman and Cutler LLP has expressed no opinion with respect to
taxation under any other provision of Pennsylvania law. Ownership of the Units  
may result in collateral Pennsylvania tax consequences to certain taxpayers.    
Prospective investors should consult their tax advisors as to the applicability 
of any such collateral consequences.                                            

         South Carolina Risk Factors. The state of South Carolina is affected by
various national, economic, social and environmental policies and conditions.   
Additionally, Constitutional and statutory limitations imposed on the State and 
its local governments concerning taxes, bond indebtedness and other matters may 
constrain the revenue-generating capacity of the State and its local governments
and, therefore, the ability of the issuers of the Bonds to satisfy their        
obligations.                                                                    

 The economic vitality of the State and its various regions and,
therefore, the ability of the State and its local governments to satisfy the    
Bonds, are affected by numerous factors. The State's economic base is           
diversified, consisting primarily of manufacturing, but expanding into the trade
and service industries, supplemented by rural areas with selective commercial   
agriculture.                                                                    

         The State may be a party to numerous lawsuits in which an adverse final
decision could materially affect the State's governmental operations and        
consequently its ability to pay debt service on its obligations.                

   Further information concerning South Carolina risk factors may be
obtained upon request to the Sponsor as described in "Additional Information".  

         Tax Status. For a discussion of the Federal tax status of income earned
on Units, see "Federal Tax Status" in Prospectus Part II as supplemented by the 
section entitled "Federal Tax Status" below.                                    

       In the opinion of special counsel to the Trust for South Carolina tax
matters, under existing South Carolina law: (1) By the provision of paragraph   
(j) of Section 3 of Article 10 of the South Carolina Constitution (revised 1977)
intangible personal property is specifically exempted from any and all ad       
valorem taxation.                                                               

       (2) Pursuant to the provisions of S.C. Code Ann. Section 12-7-430(b),
recodified as S.C. Code Ann. Section 12-6-1120(1), as interpreted by South      
Carolina Revenue Ruling #91-15, interest from obligations issued by the State of
South Carolina or any of its political subdivisions, as well as interest derived
from bonds issued by the Governments of Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin       
Islands which is exempt from Federal income taxes is exempt from income taxes   
and that the exemption so granted extends to all recipients of interest paid    
thereon through the Trust. (This opinion does not extend to so-called 63-20     
obligations.)                                                                   

(3) The income of the Trust would be treated as income to each
Unitholder of the Trust in the proportion that the number of Units of the Trust 
held by the Unitholder bears to the total number of Units of the Trust          
outstanding. For this reason, interest derived by the Trust that would not be   
includible in income for South Carolina income tax purposes when paid directly  
to a South Carolina Unitholder will be exempt from South Carolina income        
taxation when received by the Trust and attributed to such South Carolina       
Unitholder.                                                                     

    (4) Each Unitholder will recognize gain or loss for South Carolina
state income tax purposes if the Trustee disposes of a Bond (whether by sale,   
payment on maturity, retirement or otherwise) or if the Unitholder redeems or   
sells his Unit.                                                                 

        (5) The Trust would be regarded, under South Carolina law, as a common
trust fund and therefore not subject to taxation under any income tax law of    
South Carolina.                                                                 

         The above described opinion has been concurred in by an informal ruling
of the South Carolina Tax Commission pursuant to Section 12-3-170, recodified as
Section 12-4-320 of the South Carolina Code, except for the description of the  
South Carolina tax treatment of interest derived from bonds issued by Guam and  
the Virgin Islands in paragraph (2) listed above. While the informal ruling does
not address the South Carolina tax treatment of interest from securities issued 
by those two U.S. territories, South Carolina Revenue Ruling #91-15 specifically
directs that interest derived from bonds issued by the Governments of Guam and  
the Virgin Islands is exempt from South Carolina income taxes.                  

 Tennessee Risk Factors. The financial condition of the State of
Tennessee is affected by various national, economic, social and environmental   
policies and conditions. Additionally, Constitutional and statutory limitations 
imposed on the State and its local governments concerning taxes, bond           
indebtedness and other matters may constrain the revenue-generating capacity of 
the State and its local governments and, therefore, the ability of the issuers  
of the Bonds to satisfy their obligations.                                      

 The economic vitality of the State and its various regions and,
therefore, the ability of the State and its local governments to satisfy the    
Bonds, are affected by numerous factors. The State's economic base is           
diversified, consisting of manufacturing, construction and service industries,  
supplemented by a diverse agricultural sector. These sectors tend to be more    
cyclical than other sectors.                                                    

         The State may be a party to numerous lawsuits in which an adverse final
decision could materially affect the State's governmental operations and        
consequently its ability to pay debt service on its obligations.                

       Further information concerning Tennessee risk factors may be obtained
upon request to the Sponsor as described in "Additional Information".           

  Tax Status. At the time of the closing for each Tennessee Trust,
special counsel to the Trust for Tennessee tax matters rendered an opinion under
then existing Tennessee income tax law applicable to taxpayers whose income is  
subject to Tennessee income taxation substantially to the effect that:          

       The assets of the Tennessee Trust will consist of bonds issued by the
State of Tennessee (the "State") or any county or any municipality or political 
subdivision thereof, including any agency, board, authority or commission, the  
interest on which is exempt from the Hall Income Tax imposed by the State of    
Tennessee ("Tennessee Bonds") or by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (the "Puerto
Rico Bonds") (collectively, the "Bonds").                                       

         Under Tennessee law, a unit investment trust taxable as a grantor trust
for Federal income tax purposes is entitled to special Tennessee State tax      
treatment (as more fully described below) with respect to its proportionate     
share of interest income received or accrued with respect to the Tennessee      
Bonds. Tennessee law also provides an exemption for distributions made by a unit
investment trust or mutual fund that are attributable to "bonds or securities of
the United States government or any agency or instrumentality thereof" ("U.S.   
Government, Agency or Instrumentality Bonds"). If it were determined that the   
Tennessee Trust held assets other than Tennessee Bonds or U.S. Government,      
Agency or Instrumentality Bonds, a proportionate share of distributions from the
Tennessee Trust would be taxable to Unitholders for Tennessee Income Tax        
purposes.                                                                       

      Further, because this provision appears only to provide an exemption
for distributions that relate to interest income, distributions by the Trust    
that relate to capital gains realized from the sale or redemption of Tennessee  
Bonds or U.S. Government, Agency or Instrumentality Bonds are likely to be      
treated as taxable dividends for purposes of the Hall Income Tax. However,      
capital gains realized directly by a Unitholder when the Unitholder sells or    
redeems his Unit will not be subject to the Hall Income Tax. The opinion set    
forth below assumes that the interest on the Tennessee Bonds, if received       
directly by a Unitholder, would be exempt from the Hall Income Tax under        
Tennessee State law. This opinion does not address the taxation of persons other
than full-time residents of the State of Tennessee.                             

     Because this provision only provides an exemption for distributions
attributable to interest on Tennessee Bonds or U.S. Government, Agency or       
Instrumentality Bonds, it must be determined whether bonds issued by the        
Government of Puerto Rico qualify as U.S. Government, Agency or Instrumentality 
Bonds. For Hall Income Tax purposes, there is currently no published            
administrative interpretation or opinion of the Attorney General of Tennessee   
dealing with the status of distributions made by unit investment trusts such as 
the Tennessee Trust that are attributable to interest paid on bonds issued by   
the Government of Puerto Rico. However, in a letter dated August 14, 1992 (the  
"Commissioner's Letter"), the Commissioner of the State of Tennessee Department 
of Revenue advised that Puerto Rico would be an "instrumentality" of the U.S.   
Government and treated bonds issued by the Government of Puerto Rico as U.S.    
Government, Agency or Instrumentality Bonds. Based on this conclusion, the      
Commissioner advised that distributions from a mutual fund attributable to      
investments in Puerto Rico Bonds are exempt from the Hall Income Tax. Both the  
Sponsor and Chapman and Cutler LLP, for purposes of its opinion (as set forth   
below), have assumed, based on the Commissioner's Letter, that bonds issued by  
the Government of Puerto Rico are U.S. Government, Agency or Instrumentality    
Bonds. However, it should be noted that the position of the Commissioner is not 
binding, and is subject to change, even on a retroactive basis.                 

         The Sponsor cannot predict whether new legislation will be enacted into
law affecting the tax status of Tennessee Trusts. The occurrence of such an     
event could cause distributions of interest income from the Trust to be subject 
to the Hall Income Tax. Investors should consult their own tax advisors in this 
regard. It is assumed for purposes of the discussion and opinion below that the 
Bonds constitute debt for Federal income tax purposes.                          

     In the opinion of special counsel to the Trust, under then existing
Tennessee State law and based on the assumptions set forth above:               

       For purposes of the Hall Income Tax, the Tennessee Excise Tax imposed
by Section 67-4-2005 (the "State Corporate Income Tax"), and the Tennessee      
Franchise Tax imposed by Section 67-4-2105, the Tennessee Trust will not be     
subject to such taxes.                                                          

For Hall Income Tax purposes, a proportionate share of such   
distributions from the Tennessee Trust to Unitholders, to the extent            
attributable to interest on the Tennessee Bonds (based on the relative          
proportion of interest received or accrued attributable to Tennessee Bonds) will
be exempt from the Hall Income Tax when distributed to such Unitholders. Based  
on the Commissioner's Letter, distributions from the Tennessee Trust to         
Unitholders, to the extent attributable to interest on the Puerto Rico Bonds    
(based on the relative proportion of interest received or accrued attributable  
to the Puerto Rico Bonds) will be exempt from the Hall Income Tax when          
distributed to such Unitholders. A proportionate share of distributions from the
Tennessee Trust attributable to assets other than the Bonds would not, under    
current law, be exempt from the Hall Income Tax when distributed to Unitholders.

         For State Corporate Income Tax Purposes, Tennessee law does not provide
an exemption for interest on Tennessee Bonds and requires that all interest     
excludable from Federal gross income must be included in calculating "net       
earnings" subject to the State Corporate Income Tax. No opinion is expressed    
regarding whether such tax would be imposed on the earnings or distributions of 
the Tennessee Trust (including interest on the Bonds or gain realized upon the  
disposition of the Bonds by the Tennessee Trust) attributable to Unitholders    
subject to the State Corporate Income Tax. However, based upon prior written    
advice from the Tennessee Department of Revenue, earnings and distributions from
the Tennessee Trust (including interest on the Tennessee Bonds or gain realized 
upon the disposition of the Tennessee Bonds by the Tennessee Trust) attributable
to the Unitholders should be exempt from the State Corporate Income Tax. The    
position of the Tennessee Department of Revenue is not binding, and is subject  
to change, even on a retroactive basis.                                         

       Each Unitholder will realize taxable gain or loss for State Corporate
Income Tax purposes when the Unitholder redeems or sells his Units, at a price  
that differs from original cost as adjusted for accretion or any discount or    
amortization of any premium and other basis adjustments, including any basis    
reduction that may be required to reflect a Unitholder's share of interest, if  
any, accruing on Bonds during the interval between the Unitholder's settlement  
date and the date such Bonds are delivered to the Tennessee Trust, if later. Tax
basis reduction requirements relating to amortization of bond premium may, under
some circumstances, result in Unitholders realizing taxable gain when the Units 
are sold or redeemed for an amount equal to or less than their original cost.   

         For purposes of the Tennessee Property Tax, the Tennessee Trust will be
exempt from taxation with respect to the Bonds it holds. As for the taxation of 
the Units held by the Unitholders, although intangible personal property is not 
presently subject to Tennessee taxation, no opinion is expressed with regard to 
potential property taxation of the Unitholders with respect to the Units because
the determination of whether property is exempt from such tax is made on a      
county by county basis.                                                         

     No opinion is expressed herein regarding whether insurance proceeds
paid in lieu of interest on the Bonds held by the Tennessee Trust (including the
Tennessee Bonds) are exempt from the Hall Income Tax. Distributions of such     
proceeds to Unitholders may be subject to the Hall Income Tax.                  

       The Bonds and the Units held by the Unitholder will not be subject to
Tennessee sales and use taxes.                                                  

         Neither the Sponsor nor Chapman and Cutler LLP have examined any of the
Bonds to be deposited and held in the Tennessee Trust or the proceedings for the
issuance thereof or the opinions of bond counsel with respect thereto, and      
therefore express no opinion as to the exemption from State income taxes of     
interest on the Bonds if received directly by a Unitholder. It is assumed that  
at the respective times of issuance of the Bonds, opinions relating to the      
validity thereof and to the exemption of interest thereon from Federal income   
tax were rendered by bond counsel to the respective issuing authorities. In     
addition, it is assumed that, with respect to the Tennessee Bonds, bond counsel 
to the issuing authorities rendered opinions as to the exemption of interest    
from the Income taxes imposed and, with respect to the Puerto Rico Bonds, bond  
counsel to the issuing authorities rendered opinions as to the exemption from   
all state and local income taxation of the Puerto Rico Bonds and the interest   
thereon. Neither the Sponsor nor its counsel has made any review for the        
Tennessee Trust of the proceedings relating to the issuance of the Bonds or the 
bases for the opinions rendered in connection therewith.                        

 Chapman and Cutler LLP has expressed no opinion with respect to
taxation under any other provision of Tennessee law. Ownership of the Units may 
result in collateral Tennessee tax consequences to certain taxpayers.           
Prospective investors should consult their tax advisors as to the applicability 
of any such collateral consequences.                                            

      Texas Risk Factors. The financial condition of the State of Texas is
affected by various national, economic, social and environmental policies and   
conditions. Additionally, Constitutional and statutory limitations imposed on   
the State and its local governments concerning taxes, bond indebtedness and     
other matters may constrain the revenue-generating capacity of the State and its
local governments and, therefore, the ability of the issuers of the Bonds to    
satisfy their obligations.                                                      

 The economic vitality of the State and its various regions and,
therefore, the ability of the State and its local governments to satisfy the    
Bonds, are affected by numerous factors. The Texas labor force is concentrated  
in oil and gas extraction, pipelines and petroleum production. These industries 
tend to be highly cyclical. Texas's largest industries in terms of earnings have
traditionally been services, government and trade. There is no assurance that   
these industries will continue to grow.                                         

         The State may be a party to numerous lawsuits in which an adverse final
decision could materially affect the State's governmental operations and        
consequently its ability to pay debt service on its obligations.                

        Further information concerning Texas risk factors may be obtained upon
request to the Sponsor as described in "Additional Information".                

      Tax Status. At the time of the closing for each Texas Trust, Special
Counsel to the Fund for Texas tax matters rendered an opinion under then        
existing Texas income taw law applicable to taxpayers whose income is subject to
Texas income taxation substantially to the effect that:                         

  (1) Neither the State nor any political subdivision of the State
currently imposes an income tax on individuals. Therefore, no portion of any    
distribution received by an individual Unitholder of the Trust in respect of his
Units, including a distribution of the proceeds of insurance in respect of such 
Units, is subject to income taxation by the State or any political subdivision  
of the State;                                                                   

      (2) Except in the case of certain transportation businesses, savings
and loan associations and insurance companies, no Unit of the Trust is taxable  
under any property tax levied in the State;                                     

        (3) The "inheritance tax" of the State, imposed upon certain transfers
of property of a deceased resident individual Unitholder, may be measured in    
part upon the value of Units of the Trust included in the estate of such        
Unitholder; and                                                                 

  (4) With respect to any Unitholder which is subject to the State
corporate franchise tax, Units in the Trust held by such Unitholder, and        
distributions received therein, will be taken into account in computing the     
"taxable capital" of the Unitholder allocated to the State, one of the bases by 
which such franchise tax is currently measured (the other being a corporation's 
"net capital earned surplus," which is, generally, its net corporate income plus
officers and directors income).                                                 

      The opinion set forth in clause (2), above, is limited to the extent
that Units of the Trust may be subject to property taxes levied in the State if 
held on the relevant date: (i) by a transportation business described in        
V.T.C.A., Tax Code, Subchapter A, Chapter 24; (ii) by a savings and loan        
association formed under the laws of the State (but only to the extent described
in section 11.09 of the Texas Savings and Loan Act, Vernon's Ann. Civ. St. art. 
852a); or (iii), by an insurance company incorporated under the laws of the     
State (but only to the extent described in V.A.T.S., Insurance Code, Art. 4.01).
Each Unitholder described in the preceding sentence should consult its own tax  
advisor with respect to such matters.                                           

         Corporations subject to the State franchise tax should be aware that in
its first called 1991 session, the Texas Legislature adopted, and the Governor  
has signed into law, certain substantial amendments to the State corporate      
franchise tax, the effect of which may be to subject to taxation all or a       
portion of any gains realized by such a corporate Unitholder upon the sale,     
exchange or other disposition of a Unit. The amendments are applicable to       
taxable periods commencing January 1991, and to each taxable period thereafter. 
Because no authoritative judicial, legislative or administrative interpretation 
of these amendments has been issued, and there remain many unresolved questions 
regarding its potential effect on corporate franchise taxpayers, each           
corporation which is subject to the State franchise tax and which is considering
the purchase of Units should consult its tax advisor regarding the effect of    
these amendments.                                                               

       Virginia Risk Factors. The financial condition of the Commonwealth of
Virginia is affected by various national, economic, social and environmental    
policies and conditions. Constitutional and statutory limitations concerning    
taxes, bond indebtedness and other matters may constrain the revenue-generating 
capacity of the Commonwealth and its local governments and, therefore, the      
ability of the issuers of the Bonds to satisfy their obligations.               

        The economic vitality of the Commonwealth and its various regions and,
therefore, the ability of the Commonwealth and its local governments to satisfy 
the Bonds, are affected by numerous factors.                                    

  The Commonwealth may be a party to numerous lawsuits in which an
adverse final decision could materially affect the Commonwealth's governmental  
operations and consequently, its ability to pay debt service on its obligations.

      Further information concerning Virginia risk factors may be obtained
upon request to the Sponsor as described in "Additional Information".           

         Tax Status. At the time of the closing for each Virginia Trust, special
counsel to the Trust for Virginia tax matters rendered an opinion under then    
existing Virginia income tax law applicable to taxpayers whose income is subject
to Virginia income taxation substantially to the effect that:                   

      The assets of the Trust will consist of interest-bearing obligations
issued by or on behalf of the Commonwealth of Virginia or counties,             
municipalities, authorities or political subdivisions thereof (the "Virginia    
Bonds") and certain bonds issued by Puerto Rico authorities (the "Possession    
Bonds," and collectively with the Virginia Bonds, the "Bonds").                 

     Neither the Sponsor nor its counsel have independently examined the
Bonds to be deposited in and held in the Trust. However, although no opinion is 
expressed herein regarding such matters, it is assumed that: (i) opinions       
relating to the validity thereof and to the exemption of interest thereon from  
Federal income tax were rendered by bond counsel to the respective issuing      
authorities, (ii) the interest thereon is excludible from gross income for      
Federal income tax purposes and (iii) the interest thereon is exempt from income
tax imposed by Virginia that is applicable to individuals and corporations (the 
"Virginia Income Tax") and, with respect to the Possession Bonds, bond counsel  
to the issuing authorities rendered opinions as to the exemption from all state 
and local taxation. The opinion set forth below does not address the taxation of
persons other than full time residents of Virginia.                             

 In the opinion of special counsel to the Trust for Virginia tax
matters, under then existing law and based upon the assumptions set forth above:

       (1) The Virginia Trust is not an association taxable as a corporation
for purposes of the Virginia Income Tax and each Unitholder of the Trust will be
treated as the owner of a pro rata portion of each of the assets held by the    
Trust and the income of such portion of the Virginia Trust will be treated as   
income of the Unitholder for purposes of the Virginia Income Tax.               

         (2) Interest on the Virginia Bonds which is exempt from Virginia Income
Tax when received by the Virginia Trust, and which would be exempt from Virginia
Income Tax if received directly by a Unitholder, will retain its status as      
exempt from such tax when received by the Trust and distributed to such         
Unitholder.                                                                     

     (3) Interest on the Possession Bonds which is excludible from gross
income for Federal income tax purposes and is exempt from state and local       
taxation pursuant to Federal law when received by the Trust will be exempt from 
Virginia income taxation and therefore will not be includible in the income of  
the Unitholder for Virginia income tax purposes when distributed by the Trust   
and received by the Unitholders.                                                

         (4) The Virginia legislature has enacted a law, effective July 1, 1997,
that would exempt from the Virginia Income Tax income derived on the sale or    
exchange of obligations of the Commonwealth of Virginia or any political        
subdivision or instrumentality of the Commonwealth of Virginia. However,        
Virginia law does not address whether this exclusion would apply to gains       
recognized through entities such as the Virginia Trust. Accordingly, we express 
no opinion as to the treatment for Virginia Income Tax purposes of any gain or  
loss recognized by a Unitholder for Federal income tax purposes.                

     (5) The Virginia Income Tax does not permit a deduction of interest
paid on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or carry Units in the    
Virginia Trust to the extent that interest income related to the ownership of   
Units is exempt from the Virginia Income Tax.                                   

        In the case of Unitholders subject to the Virginia Bank Franchise Tax,
the income derived by such a Unitholder from his pro rata portion of the Bonds  
held by the Virginia Trust may affect the determination of such Unitholder's    
Bank Franchise Tax. Prospective investors subject to the Virginia Bank Franchise
Tax should consult their tax advisors. Chapman and Cutler LLP has expressed no  
opinion with respect to taxation under any other provisions of Virginia law.    
Ownership of the Units may result in collateral Virginia tax consequences to    
certain taxpayers. Prospective investors should consult their tax advisors to   
the applicability of any such collateral consequences.                          

     West Virginia Risk Factors. The financial condition of the State of
West Virginia is affected by various national, economic, social and             
environmental policies and conditions. Additionally, Constitutional and         
statutory limitations imposed on the State and its local governments concerning 
taxes, bond indebtedness and other matters may constrain the revenue-generating 
capacity of the State and its local governments and, therefore, the ability of  
the issuers of the Bonds to satisfy their obligations.                          

 The economic vitality of the State and its various regions and,
therefore, the ability of the State and its local governments to satisfy the    
Bonds, are affected by numerous factors. West Virginia's primary employment is  
in the services, trade and government. These sectors tend to be cyclical and can
cause problems for the economy. West Virginia has historically had a higher     
unemployment rate than the U.S. which also affects the economy.                 

         The State may be a party to numerous lawsuits in which an adverse final
decision could materially affect the State's governmental operations and        
consequently its ability to pay debt service on its obligations.                

  Further information concerning West Virginia risk factors may be
obtained upon request to the Sponsor as described in "Additional Information".  

   Tax Status. The assets of the West Virginia Trust will consist of
interest-bearing obligations issued by or on behalf of the State of West        
Virginia ("West Virginia") or counties, municipalities, authorities or political
subdivisions thereof the interest on which is expected to qualify as exempt from
West Virginia income taxes (the "West Virginia Bonds") or by the Commonwealth of
Puerto Rico, Guam or the United States Virgin Islands (the "Possession Bonds")  
(collectively, the "Bonds").                                                    

     Neither the Sponsor nor its counsel have independently examined the
Bonds to be deposited in and held in the West Virginia Trust. However, although 
no opinion is expressed herein regarding such matters, it is assumed that: (i)  
the Bonds were validly issued, (ii) the interest thereon is excludable from     
gross income for Federal income tax purposes and (iii) interest on the Bonds, if
received directly by a Unitholder would be exempt from the West Virginia        
personal income tax applicable to individuals (the "West Virginia Personal      
Income Tax"). At the respective times of issuance of the Bonds, opinions        
relating to the validity thereof and to the exemption of interest thereon from  
Federal income tax were rendered by bond counsel to the respective issuing      
authorities. In addition, with respect to the West Virginia Bonds, bond counsel 
to the issuing authorities rendered opinions as to the exemption of interest    
from the West Virginia Personal Income Tax and, with respect to the Possession  
Bonds, bond counsel to the issuing authorities rendered opinions as to the      
exemption from all state and local income taxation. Neither the Sponsor nor its 
counsel has made any review for the West Virginia Trust of the proceedings      
relating to the issuance of the Bonds or of the bases for the opinions rendered 
in connection therewith. The opinion set forth below does not address the       
taxation of persons other than full-time residents of West Virginia.            

         At the time of closing for each West Virginia Trust, Special Counsel to
the Fund for West Virginia tax matters rendered an opinion, based upon the      
assumptions set forth above, under then existing West Virginia law substantially
to the effect that:                                                             

       (1) The West Virginia Trust will not be subject to tax under the West
Virginia Corporation Net Income Tax, the West Virginia Business Franchise Tax,  
or the West Virginia Personal Income Tax.                                       

  (2) Interest on the Bonds which is exempt from the West Virginia
Personal Income Tax when received by the West Virginia Trust, and which would be
exempt from the West Virginia Personal Income Tax if received directly by a     
Unitholder, will retain its status as exempt from such tax when received by the 
West Virginia Trust and distributed to such Unitholder.                         

         (3) For Unitholders subject to the West Virginia Corporation Net Income
Tax, income of the West Virginia Trust received by them (except interest income 
with respect to Possession Bonds, as to which no opinion is expressed) is not   
exempt from the West Virginia Corporation Net Income Tax. However, such         
Unitholders may be entitled to a credit against the tax imposed under the West  
Virginia Corporation Net Income Tax Law based on their ownership of Units in the
West Virginia Trust. Unitholders should consult their own advisors regarding the
applicability and computation of any such credit.                               

   (4) Each Unitholder will recognize gain or loss for West Virginia
Personal Income Tax purposes if the Trustee disposes of a bond (whether by      
redemption, sale, payment at maturity or otherwise) or if the Unitholder redeems
or sells Units of the West Virginia Trust to the extent that such a transaction 
results in a recognized gain or loss to such Unitholder for Federal income tax  
purposes.                                                                       

     (5) Insurance proceeds paid under policies which represent maturing
interest on defaulted obligations which are excludable from gross income for    
Federal income tax purposes should be excludable from the West Virginia Personal
Income Tax to the same extent as such interest would have been if paid by the   
issuer of such Bonds held by the West Virginia Trust.                           

       (6) The West Virginia Personal Income Tax does not permit a deduction
of interest paid on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or carry     
Units in the West Virginia Trust to the extent that interest income related to  
the ownership of Units is exempt from the West Virginia Personal Income Tax.    

       We have not examined any of the Bonds to be deposited and held in the
West Virginia Trust or the proceedings for the issuance thereof or the opinions 
of bond counsel with respect thereto, and therefore express no opinion as to the
exemption from Federal or state income taxation of interest on the Bonds if     
interest thereon had been received directly by a Unitholder. We have assumed    
that at the respective times of issuance of the Bonds, opinions relating to the 
validity thereof and to the exemption of interest thereon from Federal income   
tax were rendered by bond counsel to the respective issuing authorities. In     
addition, we have assumed that, with respect to the West Virginia Bonds, bond   
counsel to the issuing authorities rendered opinions as to the exemption of     
interest from the West Virginia Income Tax and, with respect to the Possession  
Bonds, bond counsel to the issuing authorities rendered opinions as to the      
exemption from all state and local income taxation of the Possession Bonds and  
the interest thereon. Neither the Sponsor nor its counsel has made any review   
for the West Virginia Trust of the proceedings relating to the issuance of the  
Bonds or of the bases for the opinions rendered in connection therewith.        

 Counsel to the Sponsor has expressed no opinion with respect to
taxation under any other provision of West Virginia law. Ownership of the Units 
may result in collateral West Virginia tax consequences to certain taxpayers.   
Prospective investors should consult their tax advisors as to the applicability 
of any such collateral consequences.                                            

EXPENSES 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

General. The Trustee will periodically deduct from the Interest Account
and, to the extent funds are not sufficient therein, from the Principal Account,
amounts necessary to pay the expenses of the Trusts. The Trustee also may       
withdraw from these Accounts such amounts, if any, as it deems necessary to     
establish a reserve for any governmental charges payable out of the Trusts.     
Amounts so withdrawn shall not be considered a part of a Trust's assets until   
such time as the Trustee shall return all or any part of such amounts to the    
appropriate Accounts. All costs and expenses incurred in creating and           
establishing the Trusts, including the cost of the initial preparation, printing
and execution of the Trust Agreement and the certificates, legal and accounting 
expenses, advertising and selling expenses, expenses of the Trustee, initial    
evaluation fees and other out-of-pocket expenses have been borne by the Sponsor 
at no cost to the Trusts.                                                       

     Sponsor, Supervisor, Evaluator and Trustee. The Sponsor and the Supervisor,
which is an affiliate of the Sponsor, will receive the annual fees indicated    
under "Summary of Essential Financial Information" in Prospectus Part I for     
providing bookkeeping and administrative services and for providing portfolio   
supervisory services for the Trusts. These fees may exceed the actual costs of  
providing these services for a Trust but the total amount received for providing
these services to all Van Kampen unit investment trusts will not exceed the     
total cost of providing the services in any calendar year. The Evaluator will   
receive the annual evaluation fee indicated under "Summary of Essential         
Financial Information" in Prospectus Part I for evaluating each Trust's         
portfolio. For its services the Trustee will receive the fee indicated under    
"Summary of Essential Financial Information" in Prospectus Part I (which may be 
reduced as described therein). Part of the Trustee's compensation for its       
services is expected to result from the use of the funds being held in the      
Principal and Interest Accounts for future distributions, payment of expenses   
and redemptions since these Accounts are non-interest bearing to Unitholders.   
These fees are based on the outstanding principal amount of bonds and Units on  
the Date of Deposit for the first year and as of the close of business on       
January 1 for each year thereafter.                                             

 Insurance. Premiums for any portfolio insurance are obligations of each
Insured Trust and are payable monthly by the Trustee on behalf of the Trust. As 
bonds covered by a portfolio insurance policy in an Insured Trust are redeemed  
by their respective issuers or are sold by the Trustee, the amount of the       
premium will be reduced in respect of those bonds. If the Trustee exercises the 
right to obtain permanent insurance, the premiums payable for such permanent    
insurance will be paid solely from the proceeds of the sale of the related      
bonds.                                                                          

Miscellaneous Expenses. The following additional charges are or may be
incurred by the Trusts: (a) fees of the Trustee for extraordinary services, (b) 
expenses of the Trustee (including legal and auditing expenses) and of counsel  
designated by the Sponsor, (c) various governmental charges, (d) expenses and   
costs of any action taken by the Trustee to protect the Trusts and the rights   
and interests of Unitholders, (e) indemnification of the Trustee for any loss,  
liability or expenses incurred by it in the administration of the Trusts without
negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on its part, (f) any special        
custodial fees payable in connection with the sale of any of the bonds in a     
Trust, (g) expenditures incurred in contacting Unitholders upon termination of  
the Trusts and (h) costs incurred to reimburse the Trustee for advancing funds  
to the Trusts to meet scheduled distributions (which costs may be adjusted      
periodically in response to fluctuations in short-term interest rates). Each    
Trust will pay the costs associated with updating its registration statement    
each year. The fees and expenses set forth herein are payable out of the Trusts.
When such fees and expenses are paid by or owing to the Trustee, they are       
secured by a lien on the portfolio of the applicable Trust. If the balances in  
the Interest and Principal Accounts are insufficient to provide for amounts     
payable by a Trust, the Trustee has the power to sell bonds to pay such amounts.

 Municipal Bond Risk Factors

The Trusts include certain types of bonds described below. Accordingly, an
investment in a Trust should be made with an understanding of the               
characteristics of and risks associated with such bonds. The types of bonds     
included in each Trust are described under "Portfolio" in the related Prospectus
Part I. Neither the Sponsor nor the Trustee shall be liable in any way for any  
default, failure or defect in any of the bonds.                                 

   Certain of the bonds may be general obligations of a governmental entity that
are backed by the taxing power of such entity. All other bonds in the Trusts are
revenue bonds payable from the income of a specific project or authority and are
not supported by the issuer's power to levy taxes. General obligation bonds are 
secured by the issuer's pledge of its faith, credit and taxing power for the    
payment of principal and interest. Revenue bonds, on the other hand, are payable
only from the revenues derived from a particular facility or class of facilities
or, in some cases, from the proceeds of a special excise tax or other specific  
revenue source. There are, of course, variations in the security of the         
different bonds in a Trust, both within a particular classification and between 
classifications, depending on numerous factors.                                 

Certain of the bonds may be obligations which derive their payments from  
mortgage loans. Certain of such housing bonds may be FHA insured or may be      
single family mortgage revenue bonds issued for the purpose of acquiring from   
originating financial institutions notes secured by mortgages on residences     
located within the issuer's boundaries and owned by persons of low or moderate  
income. Mortgage loans are generally partially or completely prepaid prior to   
their final maturities as a result of events such as sale of the mortgaged      
premises, default, condemnation or casualty loss. Because these bonds are       
subject to extraordinary mandatory redemption in whole or in part from such     
prepayments of mortgage loans, a substantial portion of such bonds will probably
be redeemed prior to their scheduled maturities or even prior to their ordinary 
call dates. Extraordinary mandatory redemption without premium could also result
from the failure of the originating financial institutions to make mortgage     
loans in sufficient amounts within a specified time period. Additionally,       
unusually high rates of default on the underlying mortgage loans may reduce     
revenues available for the payment of principal of or interest on such mortgage 
revenue bonds. These bonds were issued under Section 103A of the Internal       
Revenue Code, which Section contains certain requirements relating to the use of
the proceeds of such bonds in order for the interest on such bonds to retain its
tax-exempt status. In each case the issuer of the bonds has covenanted to comply
with applicable requirements and bond counsel to such issuer has issued an      
opinion that the interest on the bonds is exempt from Federal income tax under  
existing laws and regulations. Certain issuers of housing bonds have considered 
various ways to redeem bonds they have issued prior to the stated first         
redemption dates for such bonds. In connection with the housing bonds held by a 
Trust, the Sponsor at the Date of Deposit is not aware that any of the          
respective issuers of such bonds are actively considering the redemption of such
bonds prior to their respective stated initial call dates.                      

Certain of the bonds may be health care revenue bonds. Ratings of bonds   
issued for health care facilities are often based on feasibility studies that   
contain projections of occupancy levels, revenues and expenses. A facility's    
gross receipts and net income available for debt service may be affected by     
future events and conditions including, among other things, demand for services 
and the ability of the facility to provide the services required, physicians'   
confidence in the facility, management capabilities, competition with other     
health care facilities, efforts by insurers and governmental agencies to limit  
rates, legislation establishing state rate-setting agencies, expenses, the cost 
and possible unavailability of malpractice insurance, the funding of Medicare,  
Medicaid and other similar third party payor programs, government regulation and
the termination or restriction of governmental financial assistance, including  
that associated with Medicare, Medicaid and other similar third party payor     
programs.                                                                       

  Certain of the bonds may be obligations of public utility issuers, including
those selling wholesale and retail electric power and gas. General problems of  
such issuers would include the difficulty in financing large construction       
programs in an inflationary period, the limitations on operations and increased 
costs and delays attributable to environmental considerations, the difficulty of
the capital market in absorbing utility debt, the difficulty in obtaining fuel  
at reasonable prices and the effect of energy conservation. In addition,        
Federal, state and municipal governmental authorities may from time to time     
review existing, and impose additional, regulations governing the licensing,    
construction and operation of nuclear power plants, which may adversely affect  
the ability of the issuers of certain of the bonds to make payments of principal
and/or interest on such bonds.                                                  

   Certain of the bonds may be obligations of issuers whose revenues are derived
from the sale of water and/or sewerage services. Such bonds are generally       
payable from user fees. The problems of such issuers include the ability to     
obtain timely and adequate rate increases, population decline resulting in      
decreased user fees, the difficulty of financing large construction programs,   
the limitations on operations and increased costs and delays attributable to    
environmental considerations, the increasing difficulty of obtaining or         
discovering new supplies of fresh water, the effect of conservation programs and
the impact of "no-growth" zoning ordinances.                                    

Certain of the bonds may be industrial revenue bonds ("IRBs"). IRBs have  
generally been issued under bond resolutions pursuant to which the revenues and 
receipts payable under the arrangements with the operator of a particular       
project have been assigned and pledged to purchasers. In some cases, a mortgage 
on the underlying project may have been granted as security for the IRBs.       
Regardless of the structure, payment of IRBs is solely dependent upon the       
creditworthiness of the corporate operator of the project or corporate          
guarantor. Corporate operators or guarantors may be affected by many factors    
which may have an adverse impact on the credit quality of the particular company
or industry. These include cyclicality of revenues and earnings, regulatory and 
environmental restrictions, litigation resulting from accidents or              
environmentally-caused illnesses, extensive competition and financial           
deterioration resulting from a corporate restructuring pursuant to a leveraged  
buy-out, takeover or otherwise. Such a restructuring may result in the operator 
of a project becoming highly leveraged which may impact on such operator's      
creditworthiness which in turn would have an adverse impact on the rating and/or
market value of such bonds. Further, the possibility of such a restructuring may
have an adverse impact on the market for and consequently the value of such     
bonds, even though no actual takeover or other action is ever contemplated or   
effected.                                                                       

   Certain of the bonds may be obligations that are secured by lease payments of
a governmental entity (hereinafter called "lease obligations"). Lease           
obligations are often in the form of certificates of participation. Although the
lease obligations do not constitute general obligations of the municipality for 
which the municipality's taxing power is pledged, a lease obligation is         
ordinarily backed by the municipality's covenant to appropriate for and make the
payments due under the lease obligation. However, certain lease obligations     
contain "non-appropriation" clauses which provide that the municipality has no  
obligation to make lease payments in future years unless money is appropriated  
for such purpose on a yearly basis. A governmental entity that enters into such 
a lease agreement cannot obligate future governments to appropriate for and make
lease payments but covenants to take such action as is necessary to include any 
lease payments due in its budgets and to make the appropriations therefor. A    
governmental entity's failure to appropriate for and to make payments under its 
lease obligation could result in insufficient funds available for payment of the
obligations secured thereby. Although "non-appropriation" lease obligations are 
secured by the leased property, disposition of the property in the event of     
foreclosure might prove difficult.                                              

   Certain of the bonds may be obligations of issuers which are, or which govern
the operation of, schools, colleges and universities and whose revenues are     
derived mainly from ad valorem taxes or for higher education systems, from      
tuition, dormitory revenues, grants and endowments. General problems relating to
school bonds include litigation contesting the state constitutionality of       
financing public education in part from ad valorem taxes, thereby creating a    
disparity in educational funds available to schools in wealthy areas and schools
in poor areas. Litigation or legislation on this issue may affect the sources of
funds available for the payment of school bonds in the Trusts. General problems 
relating to college and university obligations include the prospect of a        
declining percentage of the population consisting of "college" age individuals, 
possible inability to raise tuitions and fees sufficiently to cover increased   
operating costs, the uncertainty of continued receipt of Federal grants and     
state funding, and government legislation or regulations which may adversely    
affect the revenues or costs of such issuers.                                   

Certain of the bonds in certain of the Trusts may be obligations which are
payable from and secured by revenues derived from the ownership and operation of
facilities such as airports, bridges, turnpikes, port authorities, convention   
centers and arenas. The major portion of an airport's gross operating income is 
generally derived from fees received from signatory airlines pursuant to use    
agreements which consist of annual payments for leases, occupancy of certain    
terminal space and service fees. Airport operating income may therefore be      
affected by the ability of the airlines to meet their obligations under the use 
agreements. From time to time the air transport industry has experienced        
significant variations in earnings and traffic, due to increased competition,   
excess capacity, increased costs, deregulation, traffic constraints, acts of    
terrorism and other factors, and several airlines have experienced severe       
financial difficulties. Similarly, payment on bonds related to other facilities 
is dependent on revenues from the projects, such as user fees from ports, tolls 
on turnpikes and bridges and rents from buildings. Therefore, payment may be    
adversely affected by reduction in revenues due to such factors as increased    
cost of maintenance, decreased use of a facility, lower cost of alternative     
modes of transportation, scarcity of fuel and reduction or loss of rents.       

   Certain of the bonds may be obligations which are payable from and secured by
revenues derived from the operation of resource recovery facilities. Resource   
recovery facilities are designed to process solid waste, generate steam and     
convert steam to electricity. Resource recovery bonds may be subject to         
extraordinary optional redemption at par upon the occurrence of certain         
circumstances, including but not limited to: destruction or condemnation of a   
project; contracts relating to a project becoming void, unenforceable or        
impossible to perform; changes in the economic availability of raw materials,   
operating supplies or facilities necessary for the operation of a project or    
technological or other unavoidable changes adversely affecting the operation of 
a project; and administrative or judicial actions which render contracts        
relating to the projects void, unenforceable or impossible to perform or impose 
unreasonable burdens or excessive liabilities. The Sponsor cannot predict the   
causes or likelihood of the redemption of resource recovery bonds in a Trust    
prior to the stated maturity of the bonds.                                      

Certain of the bonds may have been acquired at a market discount from par 
value at maturity. The coupon interest rates on discount bonds at the time they 
were purchased and deposited in a Trust were lower than the current market      
interest rates for newly issued bonds of comparable rating and type. If such    
interest rates for newly issued comparable bonds increase, the market discount  
of previously issued bonds will become greater, and if such interest rates for  
newly issued comparable bonds decline, the market discount of previously issued 
bonds will be reduced, other things being equal. Investors should also note that
the value of bonds purchased at a market discount will increase in value faster 
than bonds purchased at a market premium if interest rates decrease. Conversely,
if interest rates increase, the value of bonds purchased at a market discount   
will decrease faster than bonds purchased at a market premium. In addition, if  
interest rates rise, the prepayment risk of higher yielding, premium Securities 
and the prepayment benefit for lower yielding, discount bonds will be reduced. A
bond purchased at a market discount and held to maturity will have a larger     
portion of its total return in the form of taxable income and capital gain and  
less in the form of tax-exempt interest income than a comparable bond newly     
issued at current market rates. See "Federal Tax Status" in Prospectus Part II. 
Market discount attributable to interest changes does not indicate a lack of    
market confidence in the issue.                                                 

Certain of the bonds may be "zero coupon" bonds. Zero coupon bonds are    
purchased at a deep discount because the buyer receives only the right to       
receive a final payment at the maturity of the bond and does not receive any    
periodic interest payments. The effect of owning deep discount bonds which do   
not make current interest payments (such as the zero coupon bonds) is that a    
fixed yield is earned not only on the original investment but also, in effect,  
on all discount earned during the life of such obligation. This implicit        
reinvestment of earnings at the same rate eliminates the risk of being unable to
reinvest the income on such obligation at a rate as high as the implicit yield  
on the discount obligation, but at the same time eliminates the holder's ability
to reinvest at higher rates in the future. For this reason, zero coupon bonds   
are subject to substantially greater price fluctuations during periods of       
changing market interest rates than are securities of comparable quality which  
pay interest.                                                                   

   Certain of the bonds may have been purchased on a "when, as and if issued" or
"delayed delivery" basis. The delivery of any such bonds may be delayed or may  
not occur. Interest on these bonds begins accruing to the benefit of Unitholders
on their respective dates of delivery. To the extent any bonds are actually     
delivered to the Fund after their respective expected dates of delivery,        
Unitholders who purchase their Units prior to the date such bonds are actually  
delivered to the Trustee would be required to adjust their tax basis in their   
Units for a portion of the interest accruing on such bonds during the interval  
between their purchase of Units and the actual delivery of such bonds. As a     
result of any such adjustment, the Estimated Current Returns during the first   
year would be slightly lower than those stated in the prospectus which would be 
the returns after the first year, assuming the portfolio of a Trust and         
estimated annual expenses other than that of the Trustee (which may be reduced  
in the first year only) do not vary from that set forth in Prospectus Part I.   
Unitholders will be "at risk" with respect to all bonds in the portfolios       
including "when, as and if issued" and "delayed delivery" bonds (i.e., may      
derive either gain or loss from fluctuations in the evaluation of such bonds)   
from the date they commit for Units.                                            

Certain of the bonds may be subject to redemption prior to their stated   
maturity date pursuant to sinking fund provisions, call provisions or           
extraordinary optional or mandatory redemption provisions or otherwise. A       
sinking fund is a reserve fund accumulated over a period of time for retirement 
of debt. A callable debt obligation is one which is subject to redemption or    
refunding prior to maturity at the option of the issuer. A refunding is a method
by which a debt obligation is redeemed, at or before maturity, by the proceeds  
of a new debt obligation. In general, call provisions are more likely to be     
exercised when the offering side valuation is at a premium over par than when it
is at a discount from par. The exercise of redemption or call provisions will   
(except to the extent the proceeds of the called bonds are used to pay for Unit 
redemptions) result in the distribution of principal and may result in a        
reduction in the amount of subsequent interest distributions; it may also affect
the current return on Units of the Trust involved. Each Trust portfolio contains
a listing of the sinking fund and call provisions, if any, with respect to each 
of the debt obligations. Extraordinary optional redemptions and mandatory       
redemptions result from the happening of certain events. Generally, events that 
may permit the extraordinary optional redemption of bonds or may require the    
mandatory redemption of bonds include, among others: a final determination that 
the interest on the bonds is taxable; the substantial damage or destruction by  
fire or other casualty of the project for which the proceeds of the bonds were  
used; an exercise by a local, state or Federal governmental unit of its power of
eminent domain to take all or substantially all of the project for which the    
proceeds of the bonds were used; changes in the economic availability of raw    
materials, operating supplies or facilities or technological or other changes   
which render the operation of the project for which the proceeds of the bonds   
were used uneconomic; changes in law or an administrative or judicial decree    
which renders the performance of the agreement under which the proceeds of the  
bonds were made available to finance the project impossible or which creates    
unreasonable burdens or which imposes excessive liabilities, such as taxes, not 
imposed on the date the bonds are issued on the issuer of the bonds or the user 
of the proceeds of the bonds; an administrative or judicial decree which        
requires the cessation of a substantial part of the operations of the project   
financed with the proceeds of the bonds; an overestimate of the costs of the    
project to be financed with the proceeds of the bonds resulting in excess       
proceeds of the bonds which may be applied to redeem bonds; or an underestimate 
of a source of funds securing the bonds resulting in excess funds which may be  
applied to redeem bonds. The issuer of certain bonds in a Trust may have sold or
reserved the right to sell, upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, to     
third parties all or any portion of its rights to call bonds in accordance with 
the stated redemption provisions of such bonds. In such a case the issuer no    
longer has the right to call the bonds for redemption unless it reacquires the  
rights from such third party. A third party pursuant to these rights may        
exercise the redemption provisions with respect to a bond at a time when the    
issuer of the bond might not have called a bond for redemption had it not sold  
such rights. The Sponsor is unable to predict all of the circumstances which may
result in such redemption of an issue of bonds. See also the discussion of      
single family mortgage and multi-family revenue bonds above for more information
on the call provisions of such bonds.                                           

To the best knowledge of the Sponsor, there is no litigation pending as of
the Date of Deposit in respect of any bonds which might reasonably be expected  
to have a material adverse effect upon the Fund or any of the Trusts. At any    
time after the Date of Deposit, litigation may be initiated on a variety of     
grounds with respect to bonds in a Trust. Such litigation, as, for example,     
suits challenging the issuance of pollution control revenue bonds under         
environmental protection statutes, may affect the validity of such bonds or the 
tax-free nature of the interest thereon. While the outcome of litigation of such
nature can never be entirely predicted, each Trust has received or will receive 
opinions of bond counsel to the issuing authorities of each bond on the date of 
issuance to the effect that such bonds have been validly issued and that the    
interest thereon is exempt from Federal income tax. In addition, other factors  
may arise from time to time which potentially may impair the ability of issuers 
to meet obligations undertaken with respect to the bonds.                       

Insurance on the Bonds in the Insured Trusts

  Insurance has been obtained by each Insured Trust, by the issuer of bonds in
an Insured Trust, by a prior owner of such bonds, or by the Sponsor prior to the
deposit of such bonds in a Trust guaranteeing prompt payment of interest and    
principal, when due, in respect of the bonds in such Trust. See "The
Trusts--Objectives and Bond Selection" in Prospectus Part II. The Portfolio     
Insurers and the Preinsured Bond Insurers are described under "Portfolio" and   
"Notes to Portfolio" in Prospectus Part I. The Portfolio Insurers, if any, are  
set forth in the prospectus. An insurance policy obtained by an Insured Trust,  
if any, is non-cancelable and will continue in force so long as such Trust is in
existence, the respective Portfolio Insurer is still in business and the bonds  
described in such policy continue to be held by such Trust (see "Portfolio" for 
the respective Insured Trust in Prospectus Part I). Any portfolio insurance     
premium for an Insured Trust, which is an obligation of such Trust, is paid by  
such Trust on a monthly basis. Non-payment of premiums on a policy obtained by  
an Insured Trust will not result in the cancellation of insurance but will force
the insurer to take action against the Trustee to recover premium payments due  
it. The Trustee in turn will be entitled to recover such payments from such     
Trust. Premium rates for each issue of bonds protected by a policy obtained by  
an Insured Trust, if any, are fixed for the life of the Trust. The premium for  
any Preinsured Bond insurance has been paid by such issuer, by a prior owner of 
such bonds or the Sponsor and any such policy or policies are non-cancelable and
will continue in force so long as the bonds so insured are outstanding and the  
respective Preinsured Bond Insurer remains in business. If the provider of an   
original issuance insurance policy is unable to meet its obligations under such 
policy or if the rating assigned to the claims-paying ability of any such       
insurer deteriorates, the Portfolio Insurers have no obligation to insure any   
issue adversely affected by either of the above described events.               

  The aforementioned portfolio insurance obtained by an Insured Trust, if any,
guarantees the timely payment of principal and interest on the bonds when they  
fall due. For the purposes of insurance obtained by an Insured Trust, "when due"
generally means the stated payment or maturity date for the payment of principal
and interest. However, in the event (a) an issuer of a bond defaults in the     
payment of principal or interest on such bond, (b) such issuer enters into a    
bankruptcy proceeding or (c) the maturity of such bond is accelerated, the      
affected Portfolio Insurer has the option, in its sole discretion, after        
receiving notice of the earliest to occur of such a default, bankruptcy         
proceeding or acceleration to pay the outstanding principal amount of such bond 
plus accrued interest to the date of such payment and thereby retire the bond   
from the affected Trust prior to such bond's stated maturity date. The insurance
does not guarantee the market value of the bonds or the value of the Units.     
Insurance obtained by an Insured Trust, if any, is only effective as to bonds   
owned by and held in such Trust. In the event of a sale of any such bond by the 
Trustee, such insurance terminates as to such bond on the date of sale.         

   Pursuant to an irrevocable commitment of the Portfolio Insurers, the Trustee,
upon the sale of a bond covered under a portfolio insurance policy obtained by  
an Insured Trust, has the right to obtain permanent insurance with respect to   
such bond (i.e., insurance to maturity of the bond regardless of the identity of
the holder thereof) (the "Permanent Insurance") upon the payment of a single    
predetermined insurance premium and any expenses related thereto from the       
proceeds of the sale of such bond. Accordingly, any bond in an Insured Trust is 
eligible to be sold on an insured basis. It is expected that the Trustee would  
exercise the right to obtain Permanent Insurance only if upon such exercise the 
affected Trust would receive net proceeds (sale of bond proceeds less the       
insurance premium and related expenses attributable to the Permanent Insurance) 
from such sale in excess of the sale proceeds if such bonds were sold on an     
uninsured basis. The insurance premium with respect to each bond eligible for   
Permanent Insurance would be determined based upon the insurability of each bond
as of the Date of Deposit and would not be increased or decreased for any change
in the creditworthiness of each bond.                                           

The Sponsor believes that the Permanent Insurance option provides an      
advantage to an Insured Trust in that each bond insured by a Trust insurance    
policy may be sold out of the affected Trust with the benefits of the insurance 
attaching thereto. Thus, the value of the insurance, if any, at the time of     
sale, can be realized in the market value of the bond so sold (which is not the 
case in connection with any value attributable to an Insured Trust's portfolio  
insurance). See "Public Offering--Offering Price" in Prospectus Part II. Because
any such insurance value may be realized in the market value of the bond upon   
the sale thereof upon exercise of the Permanent Insurance option, the Sponsor   
anticipates that (a) in the event an Insured Trust were to be comprised of a    
substantial percentage of bonds in default or significant risk of default, it is
much less likely that such Trust would need at some point in time to seek a     
suspension of redemptions of Units than if such Trust were to have no such      
option (see "Rights of Unitholders--Redemption of Units" in Prospectus Part II) 
and (b) at the time of termination of an Insured Trust, if such Trust were      
holding defaulted bonds or bonds in significant risk of default such Trust would
not need to hold such Securities until their respective maturities in order to  
realize the benefits of such Trust's portfolio insurance (see "Trust            
Administration--Termination of Trust Agreement" in Prospectus Part II).         

Except as indicated below, insurance obtained by an Insured Trust has no  
effect on the price or redemption value of Units. It is the present intention of
the Evaluator to attribute a value for such insurance (including the right to   
obtain Permanent Insurance) for the purpose of computing the price or redemption
value of Units if the bonds covered by such insurance are in default in payment 
of principal or interest or in significant risk of such default. The value of   
the insurance will be the difference between (i) the market value of a bond     
which is in default in payment of principal or interest or in significant risk  
of such default assuming the exercise of the right to obtain Permanent Insurance
(less the insurance premium and related expenses attributable to the purchase of
Permanent Insurance) and (ii) the market value of such bonds not covered by     
Permanent Insurance. See "Public Offering--Offering Price" in Prospectus Part   
II. It is also the present intention of the Trustee not to sell such bonds to   
effect redemptions or for any other reason but rather to retain them in the     
portfolio because value attributable to the insurance cannot be realized upon   
sale. See "Public Offering--Offering Price" in Prospectus Part II for a more    
complete description of an Insured Trust's method of valuing defaulted bonds and
bonds which have a significant risk of default. Insurance obtained by the issuer
of a bond is effective so long as such bond is outstanding. Therefore, any such 
insurance may be considered to represent an element of market value in regard to
the bonds thus insured, but the exact effect, if any, of this insurance on such 
market value cannot be predicted.                                               

 The portfolio insurance policy or policies obtained by an Insured Trust, if
any, with respect to the bonds in such Trust were issued by one or more of the  
Portfolio Insurers. Any other Preinsured Bond insurance policy (or commitment   
therefor) was issued by one of the Preinsured Bond Insurers. See "The
Trusts--Objectives and Bond Selection" in Prospectus Part II.                   

Ambac Assurance Corporation ("Ambac Assurance"). Effective July 14, 1997, 
AMBAC Indemnity Corporation changed its name to Ambac Assurance Corporation. Any
insurance policy of Ambac Assurance obtained by an Insured Trust is             
noncancelable and will continue in force for so long as the bonds described in  
the insurance policy are held by an Insured Trust. A monthly premium is paid by 
an Insured Trust for an insurance policy obtained by it. The Trustee will pay,  
when due, successively, the full amount of each installment of the insurance    
premium. Pursuant to a binding agreement with Ambac Assurance, in the event of a
sale of a bond covered by an Ambac Assurance insurance policy, the Trustee has  
the right to obtain permanent insurance for such bond upon payment of a single  
predetermined premium from the proceeds of the sale of such bond.               

  Under the terms of an insurance policy, Ambac Assurance agrees to pay to the
Trustee that portion of the principal of and interest on the bonds insured by   
Ambac Assurance which shall become due for payment but shall be unpaid by reason
of nonpayment by the issuer of the bonds. The term "due for payment" means, when
referring to the principal of a bond so insured, its stated maturity date or the
date on which it shall have been called for mandatory sinking fund redemption   
and does not refer to any earlier date on which payment is due by reason of call
for redemption (other than by mandatory sinking fund redemption), acceleration  
or other advancement of maturity and means, when referring to interest on a     
bond, the stated date for payment of interest.                                  

Ambac Assurance will make payment to the Trustee after notice from the    
Trustee is received by Ambac Assurance that a nonpayment of principal or of     
interest on a bond has occurred, but not earlier that the date on which the     
bonds are due for payment. Ambac Assurance will disburse to the Trustee the face
amount of principal and interest which is then due for payment but is unpaid by 
reason of nonpayment by the issuer in exchange for delivery of bonds, not less  
in face amount than the amount of the payment in bearer form, free and clear of 
all liens and encumbrances and uncancelled. In cases where bonds are issuable   
only in a form whereby principal is payable to registered holders or their      
assigns, Ambac Assurance shall pay principal only upon presentation and         
surrender of the unpaid bonds uncancelled and free of any adverse claim,        
together with an instrument of assignment in satisfactory form, so as to permit 
ownership of such bonds to be registered in the name of Ambac Assurance or its  
nominee. In cases where bonds are issuable only in a form whereby interest is   
payable to registered holders or their assigns, Ambac Assurance shall pay       
interest only upon presentation of proof that the claimant is the person        
entitled to the payment of interest of the bonds and delivery of an instrument  
of assignment, in satisfactory form, transferring to Ambac Assurance all right  
under such bonds to receive the interest of which the insurance payment was     
made.                                                                           

Ambac Assurance is a Wisconsin-domiciled stock insurance corporation      
regulated by the Office of the Commissioner of Insurance of the State of        
Wisconsin and licensed to do business in 50 states, the District of Columbia,   
the Territory of Guam, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin      
Islands, with admitted assets of approximately $9,417,000,000 (unaudited) and   
statutory capital of approximately $5,879,000,000 (unaudited) as of March 31,
2006. Statutory capital consists of Ambac Assurance's policyholders' surplus and
statutory contingency reserve. Standard & Poor's Credit Markets Services, a     
Division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Moody's Investors Service and Fitch      
Ratings have each assigned a triple-A financial strength rating to Ambac        
Assurance.                                                                      

The parent company of Ambac Assurance, Ambac Financial Group, Inc. ("Ambac
Company"), is subject to the informational requirements of the Securities       
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and in accordance        
therewith files reports, proxy statements and other information with the

financial guaranty insurance company incorporated under the laws of the State of
New York. XLCA is currently licensed to do insurance business in, and is subject
to the insurance regulation and supervision by, all 50 states, the District of  
Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Singapore.                   

XLCA is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of XL Capital Ltd., a Cayman  
Islands exempted company ("XL Capital Ltd."). Through its subsidiaries, XL      
Capital Ltd. is a leading provider of insurance and reinsurance coverages and   
financial products and services to industrial, commercial and professional      
service firms, insurance companies and other enterprises on a worldwide basis.  
The ordinary shares of XL Capital Ltd. are publicly traded in the United States 
and listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: XL). XL Capital Ltd. is not    
obligated to pay the debts of or claims against XLCA.                           

 XLCA was formerly known as The London Assurance of America Inc. ("London"),
which was incorporated on July 25, 1991 under the laws of the State of New York.
On February 22, 2001, XL Reinsurance America Inc. ("XL Re") acquired 100% of the
stock of London. XL Re merged its former financial guaranty subsidiary, known as
XL Capital Assurance Inc. (formed September 13, 1999) with and into London, with
London as the surviving entity. London immediately changed its name to XL       
Capital Assurance Inc. All previous business of London was 100% reinsured to    
Royal Indemnity Company, the previous owner at the time of acquisition.         

XL Capital Ltd. announced on April 7, 2006 that Security Capital Assurance
Ltd. ("SCA"), a newly-created holding company for XL Capital Ltd.'s financial   
guaranty insurance and reinsurance business conducted through XLCA and XL       
Financial Assurance Ltd. ("XLFA") had filed a registration statement or Form S-1
with the SEC relating to the proposed initial public offering of a portion of   
its common shares. Through its operating subsidiaries of XLCA and XLFA, SCA will
provide credit enhancement products to the public finance and structured finance
markets throughout the U.S. and internationally.                                

Under the registration statement, a portion of SCA's shares will be issued
and sold by SCA and a portion will be sold by SCA's parent, XL Insurance        
(Bermuda) Ltd., as selling shareholder. After the consummation of the offering, 
XL Capital Ltd. is expected to beneficially own approximately 65% of SCA's      
outstanding shares. SCA expects to use the proceeds it receives from the        
offering primarily for capital contributions to its financial guaranty          
subsidiaries to support future business growth. SCA intends to apply to have its
shares listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "SCA". A   
copy of the registration statement is available on the SEC's website at         
www.sec.gov under Filings & Forms (EDGAR)                                       

XLCA has entered into a facultative quota share reinsurance agreement with
XLFA, an insurance company organized under the laws of Bermuda, and an affiliate
of XLCA. Pursuant to this reinsurance agreement, XLCA expects to cede up to 90% 
of its business to XLFA. XLCA may also cede reinsurance to third parties on a   
transaction-specific basis, which cessions may be any or a combination of quota 
share, first loss or excess of loss. Such reinsurance is used by XLCA as a risk 
management device and to comply with statutory and rating agency requirements   
and does not alter or limit XLCA's obligations under any financial guaranty     
insurance policy. With respect to any transaction insured by XLCA, the          
percentage of risk ceded to XLFA may be less than 90% depending on certain      
factors including, without limitation, whether XLCA has obtained third party    
reinsurance covering the risk. As a result, there can be no assurance as to the 
percentage reinsured by XLFA of any given financial guaranty insurance policy   
issued by XLCA.                                                                 

Based on the audited financials of XLFA, as of December 31, 2005, XLFA had
total assets, liabilities, redeemable preferred shares and shareholders' equity 
of $1,394,081,000, $704,007,000, $39,000,000 and $651,074,000, respectively,    
determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the   
United States. XLFA's insurance financial strength is rated "Aaa" by Moody's and
"AAA" by S&P and Fitch Inc. In addition, XLFA has obtained a financial          
enhancement rating of "AAA" from S&P.                                           

The obligations of XLFA to XLCA under the reinsurance agreement described 
above are unconditionally guaranteed by XL Insurance (Bermuda) Ltd ("XLI"), a   
Bermuda company and one of the world's leading excess commercial insurers. XLI  
is a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of XL Capital Ltd. In addition to A.M.    
Best's financial strength rating of "A+" and issuer credit rating of "aaa-",    
XLI's insurance financial strength rating is "Aa3" (Stable Outlook) by Moody's, 
"A+" by Standard & Poor's and "AA-" (Outlook Stable) by Fitch.

Ltd. and various insurance operating subsidiaries of XL Capital Ltd., as        
described below. On November 22, 2005, Moody's downgraded the senior debt rating

XLCA's insurance financial strength is rated "Aaa" by Moody's and "AAA" by
Standard & Poor's and Fitch, Inc. ("Fitch"). In addition, XLCA has obtained a   
financial enhancement rating of "AAA" from Standard & Poor's. These ratings     
reflect Moody's, Standard & Poor's and Fitch's current assessment of XLCA's     
creditworthiness and claims-paying ability as well as the reinsurance           
arrangement with XLFA described above.

XLCA is regulated by the Superintendent of Insurance of the State of New  
York. In addition, XLCA is subject to regulation by the insurance laws and      
regulations of the other jurisdictions in which it is licensed. As a financial  
guaranty insurance company licensed in the State of New York, XLCA is subject to
Article 69 of the New York Insurance Law, which, among other things, limits the

prescribes minimum standards of solvency, including minimum capital             
requirements, establishes contingency, loss and unearned premium reserve

limits the aggregate amount of insurance which may be written and the maximum

The extent of state insurance regulation and supervision varies by        
jurisdiction, but New York and most other jurisdictions have laws and           
regulations prescribing permitted investments and governing the payment of      
dividends, transactions with affiliates, mergers, consolidations, acquisitions  
or sales of assets and incurrence of liabilities for borrowings.

CDC IXIS Financial Guaranty North America, Inc. ("CFIGNA") is a monoline  
financial guaranty insurance company incorporated under the laws of the State of
New York, with its principal place of business in New York City.                

The claims-paying ability (also referred to as its financial strength) of 
CIFGNA is rated "AAA" by Fitch, "Aaa" by Moody's, and "AAA" by Standard and     
Poor's, the highest rating assigned by each such rating agency. Each rating of  
CIFGNA should be evaluated independently. The ratings reflect the respective    
rating agency's current assessment of the creditworthiness of CIFGNA and its    
ability to pay claims on its policies of insurance based upon, among other      
factors, the adequacy of the net worth maintenance and reinsurance agreements   
provided by CIFGNA described below. Any further explanation as to the           
significance of the above ratings may be obtained only from the applicable      
rating agency. The above ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold   
CIFGNA insured bonds, and such ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal 
at any time by the Rating Agencies. Any downward revision or withdrawal of any  
of the above ratings may have an adverse effect on the market price of the      
CIFGNA insured bonds. CIFGNA does not guarantee the market price of bonds nor   
does it guaranty that the ratings on bonds will not be revised or withdrawn.    

CIFGNA is licensed and subject to regulation as a financial guaranty      
insurance corporation under the laws of the State of New York, its state of     
domicile, and is licensed to do business in over 40 jurisdictions. CIFGNA is    
subject to Article 69 of the New York Insurance Law which, among other things,  
limits the business of such insurers to financial guaranty insurance and related
lines, requires that each such insurer maintain a minimum surplus to            
policyholders, establishes contingency, loss and unearned premium reserve       
requirements for each such insurer, and limits the size of individual           
transactions ("single risks") and the volume of transactions ("aggregate risks")
that may be underwritten by such insurers. Other provisions of the New York     
Insurance Law applicable to non-life insurance companies such as CIFGNA         
regulate, among other things, permitted investments, payment of dividends,      
transactions with affiliates, mergers, consolidations, acquisitions or sales of 
assets and incurrence of liabilities for borrowings. CIFGNA is required to file 
quarterly and annual statutory financial statements with the New York State     
Insurance Department ("NYSID") and is subject to statutory restrictions         
concerning the types and quality of its investments and the filing and use of   
policy forms and premium rates. Additionally, CIFGNA's accounts and operations  
are subject to periodic examination by the NYSID.                               

THE INSURANCE PROVIDED BY CIFGNA IS NOT COVERED BY THE PROPERTY/CASUALTY  
INSURANCE SECURITY FUND SPECIFIED BY THE INSURANCE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW     
YORK.                                                                           

In addition to its capital and surplus as set forth below, CIFGNA is      
supported by a net worth maintenance agreement from its indirect parent, CDC    
IXIS Financial Guaranty, a French reinsurance corporation ("CIFG"). The net     
worth maintenance agreement provides that CIFG will maintain CIFGNA's U.S.      
statutory capital and surplus at no less than $80 million. In addition, through 
a facultative reinsurance agreement, CIFGNA may cede up to 90% of its exposure  
on each transaction to CIFG; however, the facultative reinsurance agreement does
not require that CIFG reinsure its exposure under any transaction. CIFG's       
claims-paying ability is rated "Aaa" by Moody's, "AAA" by Standard & Poor's and 
"AAA" by Fitch, the highest rating assigned by each such Rating Agency.         
Notwithstanding these net worth maintenance and reinsurance agreements, the     
holders of bonds insured by CIFGNA will have direct recourse against CIFGNA     
only, and neither CIFG nor any other affiliate of CIFGNA will be directly liable
to the holders of such bonds.

The extent of state insurance regulation and supervision varies by

In order to be in an Insured Trust, bonds must be insured by one of the   
Preinsured Bond Insurers or be eligible for the insurance being obtained by such
Trust. In determining eligibility for insurance, the Preinsured Bond Insurers   
and the Portfolio Insurers have applied their own standards which correspond    
generally to the standards they normally use in establishing the insurability of
new issues of municipal bonds and which are not necessarily the criteria used in
the selection of bonds by the Sponsor. To the extent the standards of the       
Preinsured Bond Insurers and the Portfolio Insurers are more restrictive than   
those of the Sponsor, the previously stated Trust investment criteria have been 
limited with respect to the bonds. This decision is made prior to the Date of   
Deposit, as debt obligations not eligible for insurance are not deposited in an 
Insured Trust. Thus, all of the bonds in the portfolios of the Insured Trusts   
are insured either by the respective Trust or by the issuer of the bonds, by a  
prior owner of such bonds or by the Sponsor prior to the deposit of such bonds  
in a Trust.                                                                     

   An objective of portfolio insurance obtained by an Insured Trust is to obtain
a higher yield on the portfolio of such Trust than would be available if all the
bonds in such portfolio had Standard & Poor's "AAA" rating and yet at the same  
time to have the protection of insurance of prompt payment of interest and      
principal, when due, on the bonds. There is, of course, no certainty that this  
result will be achieved. Preinsured Bonds in an Insured Trust (all of which are 
rated "AAA" by Standard & Poor's) may or may not have a higher yield than       
uninsured bonds rated "AAA" by Standard & Poor's. In selecting such bonds for an
Insured Trust, the Sponsor has applied the criteria hereinbefore described.     

  In the event of nonpayment of interest or principal, when due, in respect of
a bond, a Portfolio Insurer shall make such payment after the respective insurer
has been notified that such nonpayment has occurred or is threatened (but not   
earlier than the date such payment is due). The insurer, as regards any payment 
it may make, will succeed to the rights of the Trustee in respect thereof. All  
policies issued by the Portfolio Insurers and the Preinsured Bond Insurers are  
substantially identical insofar as obligations to an Insured Trust are          
concerned.                                                                      

   The Internal Revenue Service has issued a letter ruling which holds in effect
that insurance proceeds representing maturing interest on defaulted municipal   
obligations paid to holders of insured bonds, under policy provisions           
substantially identical to the policies described herein, will be excludable    
from Federal gross income under Section 103(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code  
to the same extent as if such payments were made by the issuer of the municipal 
obligations. Holders of Units in an Insured Trust should discuss with their tax 
advisers the degree of reliance which they may place on this letter ruling.     
However, Chapman and Cutler LLP, counsel for the Sponsor, has given an opinion  
to the effect such payment of proceeds would be excludable from Federal gross   
income to the extent described under "Federal Tax Status" in Prospectus Part II.

Each Portfolio Insurer is subject to regulation by the department of      
insurance in the state in which it is qualified to do business. Such regulation,
however, is no guarantee that each Portfolio Insurer will be able to perform on 
its contract of insurance in the event a claim should be made thereunder at some
time in the future. At the date hereof, it is reported that no claims have been 
submitted or are expected to be submitted to any of the Portfolio Insurers which
would materially impair the ability of any such company to meet its commitment  
pursuant to any contract of bond or portfolio insurance.                        

   The information relating to each Portfolio Insurer has been furnished by such
companies. The financial information with respect to each Portfolio Insurer     
appears in reports filed with state insurance regulatory authorities and is     
subject to audit and review by such authorities. No representation is made      
herein as to the accuracy or adequacy of such information or as to the absence  
of material adverse changes in such information subsequent to the dates thereof.

Portfolio Administration

   The Trustee is empowered to sell, for the purpose of redeeming Units tendered
by any Unitholder, and for the payment of expenses for which funds may not be   
available, such of the bonds designated by the Supervisor as the Trustee in its 
sole discretion may deem necessary. The Supervisor, in designating such bonds,  
will consider a variety of factors including (a) interest rates, (b) market     
value and (c) marketability. The Sponsor may direct the Trustee to dispose of   
bonds upon default in payment of principal or interest, institution of certain  
legal proceedings, default under other documents adversely affecting debt       
service, default in payment of principal or interest or other obligations of the
same issuer, decline in projected income pledged for debt service on revenue    
bonds or decline in price or the occurrence of other market or credit factors,  
including advance refunding (i.e., the issuance of refunding securities and the 
deposit of the proceeds thereof in trust or escrow to retire the refunded       
securities on their respective redemption dates), so that in the opinion of the 
Supervisor the retention of such bonds would be detrimental to the interest of  
the Unitholders. In connection with the Insured Trusts to the extent that bonds 
are sold which are current in payment of principal and interest in order to meet
redemption requests and defaulted bonds are retained in the portfolio in order  
to preserve the related insurance protection applicable to said bonds, the      
overall quality of the bonds remaining in such Trust's portfolio will tend to   
diminish. Except as described in this section and in certain other unusual      
circumstances for which it is determined by the Trustee to be in the best       
interests of the Unitholders or if there is no alternative, the Trustee is not  
empowered to sell bonds from an Insured Trust which are in default in payment of
principal or interest or in significant risk of such default and for which value
has been attributed for the insurance obtained by such Insured Trust. Because of
restrictions on the Trustee under certain circumstances, the Sponsor may seek a 
full or partial suspension of the right of Unitholders to redeem their Units in 
an Insured Trust. See "Rights of Unitholders--Redemption of Units" in Prospectus
Part II. The Sponsor is empowered, but not obligated, to direct the Trustee to  
dispose of bonds in the event of an advanced refunding.                         

 The Sponsor is required to instruct the Trustee to reject any offer made by
an issuer of any of the bonds to issue new obligations in exchange or           
substitution for any bond pursuant to a refunding or refinancing plan, except   
that the Sponsor may instruct the Trustee to accept or reject such an offer or  
to take any other action with respect thereto as the Sponsor may deem proper if 
(1) the issuer is in default with respect to such bond or (2) in the written    
opinion of the Sponsor the issuer will probably default with respect to such    
bond in the reasonably foreseeable future. Any obligation so received in        
exchange or substitution will be held by the Trustee subject to the terms and   
conditions of the Trust Agreement to the same extent as bonds originally        
deposited thereunder. Within five days after the deposit of obligations in      
exchange or substitution for underlying bonds, the Trustee is required to give  
notice thereof to each Unitholder of the Trust thereby affected, identifying the
bonds eliminated and the bonds substituted therefor. Except as stated herein and
under "Fund Administration--Replacement Bonds" in Prospectus Part II regarding  
the substitution of Replacement Bonds for Failed Bonds, the acquisition by a    
Trust of any securities other than the bonds initially deposited is not         
permitted.                                                                      

If any default in the payment of principal or interest on any bonds occurs
and no provision for payment is made therefor within 30 days, the Trustee is    
required to notify the Sponsor thereof. If the Sponsor fails to instruct the    
Trustee to sell or to hold such bonds within 30 days after notification by the  
Trustee to the Sponsor of such default, the Trustee may in its discretion sell  
the defaulted bond and not be liable for any depreciation or loss thereby       
incurred.

If the Sponsor shall fail to perform any of its duties under the Trust
Agreement or become incapable of acting or shall become bankrupt or its affairs 
are taken over by public authorities, then the Trustee may (i) appoint a        
successor Sponsor at rates of compensation deemed by the Trustee to be          
reasonable and not exceeding amounts prescribed by the Securities and Exchange  
Commission, (ii) terminate the Trust Agreement and liquidate the Trusts as      
provided therein or (iii) continue to act as Trustee without terminating the    
Trust Agreement.                                                                

 Trustee Information

   The Trustee is The Bank of New York, a trust company organized under the laws
of New York. The Bank of New York has its principal unit investment trust       
division offices at 2 Hanson Place, 12th Floor, Brooklyn, New York 11217,       
telephone (800) 221-7668. The Bank of New York is subject to supervision and    
examination by the Superintendent of Banks of the State of New York and the     
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and its deposits are insured  
by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to the extent permitted by law.    

The duties of the Trustee are primarily ministerial in nature. It did not 
participate in the selection of bonds for the portfolios of any of the Trusts.  
In accordance with the Trust Agreement, the Trustee shall keep proper books of  
record and account of all transactions at its office for the Trusts. Such       
records shall include the name and address of, and the certificates issued by   
the Trusts to, every Unitholder of the Trusts. Such books and records shall be  
open to inspection by any Unitholder at all reasonable times during the usual   
business hours. The Trustee shall make such annual or other reports as may from 
time to time be required under any applicable state or Federal statute, rule or 
regulation. The Trustee is required to keep a certified copy or duplicate       
original of the Trust Agreement on file in its office available for inspection  
at all reasonable times during the usual business hours by any Unitholder,      
together with a current list of the bonds held in the Trusts.                   

Under the Trust Agreement, the Trustee or any successor trustee may resign
and be discharged of the trusts created by the Trust Agreement by executing an  
instrument in writing and filing the same with the Sponsor. The Trustee or      
successor trustee must mail a copy of the notice of resignation to all          
Unitholders then of record, not less than 60 days before the date specified in  
such notice when such resignation is to take effect. The Sponsor upon receiving 
notice of such resignation is obligated to appoint a successor trustee promptly.
If, upon such resignation, no successor trustee has been appointed and has      
accepted the appointment within 30 days after notification, the retiring Trustee
may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a         
successor. The Sponsor may remove the Trustee and appoint a successor trustee as
provided in the Trust Agreement at any time with or without cause. Notice of    
such removal and appointment shall be mailed to each Unitholder by the Sponsor. 
Upon execution of a written acceptance of such appointment by such successor    
trustee, all the rights, powers, duties and obligations of the original trustee 
shall vest in the successor. The resignation or removal of a Trustee becomes    
effective only when the successor trustee accepts its appointment as such or    
when a court of competent jurisdiction appoints a successor trustee. Any        
corporation into which a Trustee may be merged or with which it may be          
consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger or consolidation to  
which a Trustee shall be a party, shall be the successor trustee. The Trustee   
must be a banking corporation organized under the laws of the United States or  
any state and having at all times an aggregate capital, surplus and undivided   
profits of not less than $5,000,000.                                            

Termination of the Trust Agreement

   A Trust may be terminated at any time by consent of Unitholders of 51% of the
Units of such Trust then outstanding or by the Trustee when the value of such   
Trust, as shown by any semi-annual evaluation, is less than 20% of the original 
principal amount of bonds. A Trust will be liquidated by the Trustee in the     
event that a sufficient number of Units not yet sold are tendered for redemption
by the Underwriters, including the Sponsor, so that the net worth of such Trust 
would be reduced to less than 40% of the initial principal amount of such Trust.
If a Trust is liquidated because of the redemption of unsold Units by the       
Underwriters, the Sponsor will refund to each purchaser of Units the entire     
sales charge paid by such purchaser. The Trust Agreement provides that each     
Trust shall terminate upon the redemption, sale or other disposition of the last
bond held in such Trust, but in no event shall it continue beyond the end of the
year preceding the fiftieth anniversary of the Trust Agreement in the case of an
IM-IT, Investment Grade Municipal, IM-IT Discount, a U.S. Territorial IM-IT, a  
Long-Term State or a National Quality Trust, or beyond the end of the year      
preceding the twentieth anniversary of the Trust Agreement in the case of       
Strategic Municipal, IM-IT Limited Maturity, IM-IT Intermediate, State          
Intermediate Laddered Maturity and IM-IT Short Intermediate Trusts. In the event
of termination of any Trust, written notice thereof will be sent by the Trustee 
to each Unitholder of such Trust at his address appearing on the registration   
books of the Fund maintained by the Trustee. Within a reasonable time thereafter
the Trustee shall liquidate any bond then held in such Trust and shall deduct   
from the funds of such Trust any accrued costs, expenses or indemnities provided
by the Trust Agreement, including estimated compensation of the Trustee and     
costs of liquidation and any amounts required as a reserve to provide for       
payment of any applicable taxes or other government charges. The sale of bonds  
in the Trust upon termination may result in a lower amount than might otherwise 
be realized if such sale were not required at such time. For this reason, among 
others, the amount realized by a Unitholder upon termination may be less than   
the principal amount or par amount of bonds represented by the Units held by    
such Unitholder. The Trustee shall then distribute to each Unitholder his share 
of the balance of the Interest and Principal Accounts. With such distribution   
the Unitholder shall be furnished a final distribution statement of the amount  
distributable. At such time as the Trustee in its sole discretion shall         
determine that any amounts held in reserve are no longer necessary, it shall    
make distribution thereof to Unitholders in the same manner.                    

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with final distributions to  
Unitholders of an Insured Trust, it should be noted that because the portfolio  
insurance obtained by an Insured Trust is applicable only while bonds so insured
are held by such Trust, the price to be received by such Trust upon the         
disposition of any such bond which is in default, by reason of nonpayment of    
principal or interest, will not reflect any value based on such insurance.      
Therefore, in connection with any liquidation, it shall not be necessary for the
Trustee to, and the Trustee does not currently intend to, dispose of any bond or
bonds if retention of such bond or bonds, until due, shall be deemed to be in   
the best interest of Unitholders, including, but not limited to, situations in  
which a bond or bonds so insured have deteriorated market prices resulting from 
a significant risk of default. Since the Preinsured Bonds will reflect the value
of the related insurance, it is the present intention of the Sponsor not to     
direct the Trustee to hold any of such Preinsured Bonds after the date of       
termination. All proceeds received, less applicable expenses, from insurance on 
defaulted bonds not disposed of at the date of termination will ultimately be   
distributed to Unitholders of record as of such date of termination as soon as  
practicable after the date such defaulted bond or bonds become due and          
applicable insurance proceeds have been received by the Trustee.                

Description of Ratings

Standard & Poor's, A Division of the McGraw-Hill Companies. A Standard &  
Poor's municipal bond rating is a current assessment of the creditworthiness of 
an obligor with respect to a specific debt bond. This assessment of             
creditworthiness may take into consideration obligors such as guarantors,       
insurers or lessees.                                                            

The bond rating is not a recommendation to purchase or sell a security,   
inasmuch as it does not comment as to market price. The ratings are based on    
current information furnished to Standard & Poor's by the issuer and obtained by
Standard & Poor's from other sources it considers reliable. The ratings may be  
changed, suspended or withdrawn as a result of changes in, or unavailability of,
such information.                                                               

 The ratings are based, in varying degrees, on the following considerations:

     I.   Likelihood of payment--capacity and willingness of the obligor to meet
          its financial commitment on an obligation in accordance with the terms
of the obligation.                                          

II.  Nature of and provisions of the obligation.                      

III. Protection afforded by, and relative position of, the bond in the
       event of bankruptcy, reorganization or other arrangements under the
  laws of bankruptcy and other laws affecting creditors' rights.

  AAA--This is the highest rating assigned by Standard & Poor's. The obligor's
capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is extremely strong.

  AA--An obligation rated "AA" differs from the highest-rated obligations only
in small degree. The obligor's capacity to meet its financial commitment on the 
obligation is very strong.                                                      

   A--An obligation rated "A" is somewhat more susceptible to adverse effects of
changes in circumstances and economic conditions than obligations in            
higher-rated categories. However, the obligor's capacity to meet its financial  
commitment on the obligation is still strong.                                   

BBB--An obligation rated "BBB" exhibits adequate protection parameters.   
However, adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely  
to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment  
on the obligation.                                                              

  Plus (+) or Minus (-): The ratings from "AA" to "BBB" may be modified by the
addition of a plus or minus sign to show relative standing within the major     
rating categories.                                                              

Provisional Ratings: A provisional rating ("p") assumes the successful    
completion of the project financed by the debt being rated and indicates that   
payment of debt service requirements is largely or entirely dependent upon the  
successful and timely completion of the project. This rating, however, while    
addressing credit quality subsequent to completion of the project, makes no     
comment on the likelihood of or the risk of default upon failure of such        
completion. The investor should exercise his own judgement with respect to such 
likelihood and risk.                                                            

   Moody's Investors Service, Inc. A brief description of the applicable Moody's
rating symbols and their meanings follows:                                      

  Aaa--Bonds which are rated Aaa are judged to be the best quality. They carry
the smallest degree of investment risk and are generally referred to as "gilt   
edge". Interest payments are protected by a large or by an exceptionally stable 
margin and principal is secure. While the various protective elements are likely
to change, such changes as can be visualized are most unlikely to impair the    
fundamentally strong position of such issues.                                   

Aa--Bonds which are rated Aa are judged to be of high quality by all      
standards. Together with the Aaa group they comprise what are generally known as
high grade bonds. They are rated lower than the best bonds because margins of   
protection may not be as large as in Aaa securities or fluctuations of          
protective elements may be of greater amplitude or there may be other elements  
present which make the long-term risks appear somewhat larger than in Aaa       
securities.                                                                     

 A--Bonds which are rated A possess many favorable investment attributes and
are to be considered as upper medium grade obligations. Factors giving security 
to principal and interest are considered adequate, but elements may be present  
which suggest a susceptibility to impairment sometime in the future.            

Baa--Bonds which are rated Baa are considered as medium grade obligations;
i.e., they are neither highly protected nor poorly secured. Interest payment and
principal security appear adequate for the present but certain protective       
elements may be lacking or may be characteristically unreliable over any great  
length of time. Such bonds lack outstanding investment characteristics and in   
fact have speculative characteristics as well.                                  

Moody's(R) applies numerical modifiers, 1, 2 and 3 in each generic rating 
classification from Aa through B in its corporate bond rating system. The       
modifier 1 indicates that the security ranks in the higher end of its generic   
rating category; the modifier 2 indicates a mid-range ranking; and the modifier 
3 indicates that the issue ranks in the lower end of its generic rating         
category.                                                                       

Arizona Risk Factors

Economic Condition and Outlook. In comparison to the original forecast    
released in April 2005, the economy in Arizona is projected to grow at a faster 
rate over the forecast period from 2004 to 2006. For 2005, the projected growth 
rate has been increased to 4.6 percent and, for 2006, the projected pace of     
expansion is 3.7 percent. The revised nonfarm job increase for 2004 to 2006 is  
202,200 jobs, in comparison to the original forecast, with a gain of 191,300    
jobs. Not only is the overall economy anticipated to grow at a faster rate, as  
demonstrated in the nonfarm job figures, but most industries are projected to   
grow at a more rapid pace.                                                      

The projections are being revised upwards because of stronger than        
anticipated strength in the Arizona economy. Strong population growth in the    
State has bolstered major industries such as construction, trade, financial     
activities, leisure and hospitality, educational and health services and        
government. Economic growth in the rest of the nation and other parts of the    
world has also helped to strengthen the State's economy. Productivity           
enhancements from automation and information technology have contributed to this
overall economic improvement. An improving domestic economy has persuaded       
businesses to increase their spending. This increased spending has also         
contributed to accelerating the economy. Rapid economic growth in other parts of
the world such as China has increased demand for many globally traded           
commodities such as copper and, therefore, has resulted in rising prices. Higher
copper prices have resulted in expansion in the metal ores sector of the natural
resources and mining industry. Continued U.S. military operations abroad have   
bolstered employment in the aerospace products and parts sector of durable goods
manufacturing. Strong construction activity has bolstered another durable goods 
manufacturing sector, fabricated metal products.                                

The economy will continue to grow over the forecast period despite rising 
costs for energy, health care and interest rates because incomes are expected to
increase at a faster rate than costs. Rising interest rates will make consumer  
debt service more expensive and home mortgages less affordable. The removal of  
equity from the refinancing of home mortgages with rising housing prices has    
placed more money in the hands of consumers and has contributed to continued    
growth of consumer spending. However, housing price growth is expected to slow  
as interest rates rise and, therefore, slow equity removal and mortgage         
refinance activity. Higher health care and energy costs will absorb consumer    
disposable income and leave less money to be spent on other goods and services. 
These rising costs will slow, rather than stop, the current economic expansion. 

The current economic expansion could potentially be halted if the costs of
interest rates, energy and health care increase past a certain point where they 
absorbed a majority of consumer disposable income while not leaving enough funds
to be spent on other items. Rising interest rates, a special concern, will make 
servicing high levels of consumer and federal government debt more expensive and
crowd out other types of spending.                                              

Construction is now projected to have an increase of 39,800 jobs over the 
forecast period. The revised projected growth rate for 2005 is 11 percent, which
slows to 9 percent for 2006. In contrast, the original set of projections had a 
gain of 24,800 jobs. Population growth and the corresponding need to expand     
infrastructure are expected to drive growth in construction.                    

Manufacturing is forecast to add 4,800 jobs for an expansion rate of 1.5  
percent for 2005 and 1.2 percent for 2006. The increasing pace of expansion is  
the result of an anticipated increase in defense contracts. In contrast, the    
original set of projections had a gain of 3,900 jobs. Natural resources and     
mining has a projected gain of 1,700 jobs, or a growth rate of 11 percent for   
2005 and 9 percent for 2006. The previous forecast called for a gain of 500     
jobs. Trade is forecast to have an increase of 37,000 jobs from 2004 to 2006    
with a growth rate of 5.6 percent for 2005 and 3.8 percent for 2006. Retail is  
anticipated to add 33,700 jobs while wholesale employment is projected to gain  
3,300 jobs. Financial activities is forecast to add 11,700 jobs in 2005 and 2006
for an expansion rate of 4 percent in 2005 and 3 percent in 2006. The original  
projections set called for an increase of 9,700 jobs. Transportation,           
warehousing and utilities is a part of the economy where rising energy costs    
have caused a downward revision to growth in comparison to the original         
forecast. The revised set of projections has this sector adding 2,400 jobs for a
growth rate of 1.8 percent in 2005 and 1.2 percent in 2006. However, the        
original forecast called for an increase of 2,800 jobs. The primary reason for  
the reduced growth rate, especially in transportation, is higher than originally
anticipated fuel prices. Information is following the trend of transportation,  
warehousing and utilities with downwardly revised forecast figures. The revised 
job losses have deepened to 4,300 jobs over the two-year period in contrast to a
much smaller loss of 200 jobs in the original forecast. The reason for the      
downward revision is a deeper and longer than anticipated consolidation process 
in the telecommunications sector. Professional and business services is expected
to add 37,300 jobs, an expansion rate of 6 percent in 2005 and 4.9 percent in   
2006. The original set of projection figures called for an increase of 37,700   
jobs. Growth was revised downward for this industry group because of greater    
projected losses in the sector of business support services. Leisure and        
hospitality is forecast to have an increase of 18,200 jobs, a growth rate of 4.3
percent for 2005 and 3.1 percent for 2006. The original projections set had an  
increase of 18,400 jobs. Government is projected to have a gain of 19,300 jobs, 
or a rate of growth of 2.6 percent in 2005 and 2.2 percent in 2006. The original
forecast called for an increase of 21,900 jobs. The projected rate of expansion 
in educational and health services has been revised downward. This industry is  
now projected to have an increase of 29,500 jobs, or a pace of expansion of 6.0 
percent in 2005 and 5.1 percent in 2006. The original forecast set the expansion
to be an increase of 32,200 jobs. Growth projections for health care have been  
decreased because of the dampening effects of rapidly rising health care costs  
and shortages of workers in skilled occupations, while the slowing growth of the
school age population, especially children in the primary and secondary school  
categories, has reduced the growth pace in educational and social services. The 
revised projections for other services are unchanged from the original with an  
addition of 4,800 jobs for a growth rate of 2.8 percent in 2005 and 2.5 percent 
in 2006.                                                                        

Overall, the remainder of 2005 and 2006 will be good for Arizona's economy
with strong job growth in most industries. Information is the only exception    
with anticipated, accelerating losses. The factors of concern are rising        
interest and energy costs because if these two costs increase fast enough, then 
they have the potential to significantly slow down the State's economy.         

Major Initiatives. The Governor's Fiscal Year 2005 budget reflected a     
commitment to phase-in initiatives that respect the State's fiscal situation to 
shape an environment in which Arizonans of all ages receive an excellent        
education, pursue a life of prosperity and abundance, live in peace and safety, 
and enjoy Arizona's precious natural resources.                                 

 The fiscal year 2005 Budget provided $25 million for classroom teachers and
new facilities as the first step in a five-year phase-in of voluntary Full Day  
Kindergarten. The budget fully funded the Operating, Capital Outlay, and        
Equalization Aid funding formulas. Arizona's two-year community colleges provide
high school graduates with a variety of educational opportunities, including    
technical education needed to participate in Arizona's and the nation's new     
economy. The budget provided full funding for FY 2005 enrollment growth at the  
three State universities. Additionally, funding for faculty retention was       
provided to the University of Arizona and Northern Arizona University. Finally, 
to help alleviate Arizona's shortage of nurses, over $1 million was provided for
the nursing school at Northern Arizona University.                              

Human infrastructure investments that were adopted in the FY 2005 Budget  
included additional funding for the Division of Children, Youth and Families    
(DCYF) in the Department of Economic Security. Of the $35.6 million requested by
the Governor, $28.8 million and 235 full-time equivalent (FTE) positions in FY  
2004 supplemental appropriations were provided for a variety of Child Protective
Services issues as well as other DCYF services such as Adoption Services,       
Permanent Guardianship subsidies, and out-of-home placements for foster         
children. Additionally, the budget provided $13.75 million to double the Healthy
Families program in FY 2005. The program provides contracted services to        
children under five years of age and members of their families. It is designed  
to prevent child abuse or neglect, as well as promote child development and     
wellness. Keeping the State's physical infrastructure in quality condition also 
requires continued investment. With the continued growth in population and      
attendant growth in Arizona's network of highways comes the requirement to build
more roads and maintain them for the safety of motorists. A major part of       
highway safety is having an adequate law enforcement presence. The FY 2005      
Budget contained approximately $1.9 million for new Highway Patrol officers to  
increase visibility on the highways and address increased workloads due to      
traffic accidents and motorist assists. The FY 2005 budget also provided $4.3   
million sworn officer salary adjustments.                                       

 Arizona forests have suffered from the wilderness equivalent of the perfect
storm: unrelenting drought, forest overgrowth stemming from years of policy     
decisions, and a major infestation of bark beetles. The result: unprecedented   
fire danger, putting people and property at risk. The FY 2005 Budget provided   
$782,900 and 14 FTE positions to the State Land Department in inmate fire crews,
which provided training for twelve inmate fire crews. The crews were used for   
fuel treatment and fire suppression in and around at-risk communities. The      
Budget also provided for $804,300 and 18 FTE positions in the Department of     
Corrections to fund 18 security positions for the newly added inmate fire crews.
Given the tremendous loss of property and the threat to the residents of more   
than 120 forest communities, it was a wise investment and one the State was     
dedicated to make.                                                              

   Combining the human, physical and financial resources of the State of Arizona
to drive economic development is the job of the Department of Commerce. The     
Governor's Task Force recommended the largest initiative for military           
facilities. Military bases provide 83,000 jobs and an economic impact of $5.7   
billion annually in Arizona. Laws 2004, Chapter 235 provided an annual $5       
million appropriation for military installation preservation and enhancement    
projects. Another executive initiative for economic development adopted in the  
FY 2005 Budget included $295,400 for rural community economic health, including 
direct technical assistance to help those communities find resources that will  
allow them to upgrade their physical and human infrastructure.                  

 General Fund. The General Fund is the chief operating fund of the State. At
June 30, 2005, unreserved fund balance of the General Fund was $986.168 million,
while total fund balance closed the year at $1.310 billion. As a measure of the 
General Fund's liquidity, it may be useful to compare both unreserved fund      
balance and total fund balance to total fund expenditures and other financing   
uses. Unreserved fund balance represents 6% of total expenditures and other     
financing uses, while total fund balance represents 8% of the same amount.      

The fund balance of the State's General Fund increased by $563.764 million
during the fiscal year. The primary source of the increase in fund balance is   
from the increase of sales tax and income tax revenues. Sales tax revenues      
increased $344.843 million from fiscal year 2004, an increase of 8%. Sales taxes
paid by retail stores, construction contractors, restaurants and bars, and      
out-of-state companies increased approximately $155.000 million, $111.000       
million, $29.000 million and $21.000 million, respectively, when compared to    
fiscal year 2004 sales tax receipts. Income tax revenues increased $709.789     
million, an increase of 25%. Income taxes paid by individuals increased by      
approximately $530.000 million when compared to fiscal year 2004 individual     
income tax receipts. In addition, income taxes paid by businesses increased     
approximately $180.000 million during the same period.                          

Health and welfare expenditures and intergovernmental revenue increased by
$640.612 million, or 9%, and $477.182 million, or 7%, as compared to fiscal year
2004, respectively. Overall program enrollment growth of 11% in the State's     
various healthcare programs, most significantly Title XIX Medicaid and the Title
XXI State Children's Health Insurance Program, was the main contributing factor 
to the growth in expenditures in fiscal year 2005. Additionally, increased      
expenditures resulted from rising cost of health care programs. Inflationary    
trends for health care costs are incorporated in the rate development process   
for the managed care organization capitation rates. Due to substantial increases
in utilization and costs for pharmacy (37%), physician (21%), and transportation
and inpatient (14%), the capitation rates were increased by an average of 6% for
the contract period of October 2004 to September 2005. The State received       
additional federal grants and county funding to cover a major portion of these  
increased costs.                                                                

  Education expenditures increased $305.888 million, or 8%, compared to fiscal
year 2004. The increase is primarily attributed to an increase in statewide     
enrollment of 41,000 from fiscal year 2004.                                     

Cash Management. The responsibility for cash management of the State is   
shared by the Office of the Treasurer (Treasurer) and the General Accounting    
Office of the Department of Administration, Financial Services Division (GAO).  
The Treasurer is responsible for the depository, custodial and investment       
functions of cash. The GAO is responsible for drawing down monies available for 
State functions and the expenditure or disbursement of those monies. The State  
requires that Treasurer's deposits and investments with financial institutions  
be entirely covered by Federal depository insurance or alternatively            
collateralized with surety equal to 102% of the deposit or investment. Component
units may have collateralization policies that differ from those of the         
Treasurer. The Legislature has passed statutes authorizing State investments.   
The Treasurer deposits receipts in accordance with applicable statutes and      
invests excess cash of the General Fund and various other funds. All interest,  
not otherwise apportioned by law, is deposited in the General Fund.             

Budgetary Controls. Budgetary control is maintained through legislative   
appropriation and the executive branch allotment process. The Governor is       
required to submit an annual budget to the Legislature. The budget is legally   
required to be adopted through passage of appropriation bills by the Legislature
and approval by the Governor. The appropriated funds are controlled by the      
executive branch through an allotment process. This process allocates the       
appropriation into quarterly allotments by legal appropriation level. The State 
also maintains an encumbrance accounting system to further enhance budgetary    
control. Encumbered amounts generally lapse as of the end of the fiscal year,   
with the exception of capital outlay items. Capital outlay appropriations and   
their encumbrances continue from year to year. The State's budgetary policies   
are explained in detail in the Required Supplementary Information (RSI).        

   The State is responsible for establishing and maintaining an internal control
structure designed to ensure that the assets of the State are protected from    
loss, theft or misuse and to ensure that adequate accounting data are compiled  
to allow for the preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S.    
generally accepted accounting principles. Internal accounting controls are      
designed to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that these          
objectives are met. The concept of reasonable assurance recognizes that: (1) the
cost of a control should not exceed the benefits likely to be derived and (2)   
the valuation of costs and benefits requires estimates and judgments by         
management. In the opinion of management, the State's internal controls are     
adequate to provide reasonable assurance that these objectives are met.         

   Risk Management. The State purchases property and liability coverage whenever
available on reasonable terms. The State is insured by an approved property     
insurer for claims in excess of $3.5 million, but less than $450 million, and   
liability claims in excess of $2 million for the Universities and the School for
the Deaf and Blind and $7 million for all other state agencies, but less than   
$107 million. The State also maintains first dollar aircraft liability, hull,   
and airport liability coverage up to $200 million. Other purchased coverages    
include fidelity, foreign liability, medical malpractice (limited to the        
University of Arizona's medical professional staff), nuclear property, nuclear  
liability, and employment practices. The State's self-insurance fund provides   
property and liability coverage for claims less than or in excess of this       
coverage, or whenever coverage, such as workers' compensation and medical       
malpractice for non-University of Arizona professional staff, is unavailable on 
reasonable terms.                                                               

The State pays self-insurance losses, defense costs, premiums and         
administrative costs from an appropriated fund which all of the State's agencies
participate in. Total costs (excluding the cost of administering the program)   
have risen from approximately $15.3 million in fiscal year 1988 to approximately
$86.7 million in fiscal year 2005. Yearly appropriations have also increased    
from approximately $27.7 million in fiscal year 1988 to approximately $93.9     
million in fiscal year 2005 to meet rising losses and claims-related expenses.  
Annual funding is established for expected paid claims. The accrued insurance   
losses are not considered when determining funding for each fiscal year.        

 Ratings. As of September 2006, Arizona was assigned an issuer credit rating
of AA by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services and Aaa by Moody's Investor's       
Service. Any explanation concerning the significance of such ratings must be    
obtained from the rating agencies. There is no assurance that any ratings will  
continue for any period of time or that they will not be revised or withdrawn.  

  Local Issuances. It should be noted that the creditworthiness of obligations
issued by local Arizona issuers may be unrelated to the creditworthiness of     
obligations issued by the State of Arizona, and there is no obligation on the   
part of the State to make payment on such local obligations in the event of     
default.                                                                        

The foregoing information constitutes only a brief summary of some of the 
general factors which may impact certain issuers of bonds contained in the      
Arizona IM-IT and does not purport to be a complete or exhaustive description of
all adverse conditions to which the issuers of such obligations are subject.    
Additionally, many factors including national economic, social and environmental
policies and conditions, which are not within the control of the issuers of such
bonds, could affect or could have an adverse impact on the financial condition  
of the State and various agencies and political subdivisions thereof. The       
Sponsor is unable to predict whether or to what extent such factors or other    
factors may affect the issuers of the bonds contained in the Arizona IM-IT, the 
market value or marketability of such bonds or the ability of the respective    
issuers of such bonds acquired by the Arizona IM-IT to pay interest on or       
principal of such bonds.                                                        

   The Arizona IM-IT is susceptible to political, economic or regulatory factors
affecting issuers of Arizona municipal obligations (the "Arizona Municipal      
Obligations"). These include the possible adverse effects of certain Arizona    
constitutional amendments, legislative measures, voter initiatives and other    
matters that are described. The information provided above is only a brief      
summary of the complex factors affecting the financial situation in Arizona and 
is derived from sources that are generally available to investors and are       
believed to be accurate. No independent verification has been made of the       
accuracy or completeness of any of the following information. It is based in    
part on information obtained from various State and local agencies in Arizona or
contained in Official Statements for various Arizona Municipal Obligations.     

 Arkansas Risk Factors

Economic Outlook. During the past two decades, Arkansas' economic base has
shifted from agriculture to light manufacturing. Agriculture has traditionally  
been a significant component of Arkansas' economy, but total income from this   
sector continues to decrease. Over 40% of the land in Arkansas is devoted to    
agriculture, and the state is a leading producer of rice, commercial broiler and
cotton, generating over $5.5 billion in overall farm income each year.          

The state is now moving toward a heavier manufacturing base involving more
sophisticated processes and products such as electrical machinery,              
transportation equipment, fabricated metals and electronics. In fact, Arkansas  
now has a higher percentage of workers involved in manufacturing than the       
national average. The diversification of economic interests has lessened the    
state's cyclical sensitivity to impact by any single sector. The State's work   
force and other factors continue to attract investment in manufacturing, as well
as other factors to the State.                                                  

  In 2005, wage and salary employment rose to 1,167,025 jobs. This represented
an increase of 15,875 jobs or 1.4 percent compared to 2004. In 2006, wage and   
salary employment is estimated to grow to 1,183,275 jobs. This represents an    
increase of 16,250 jobs or 1.4 percent from 2005. The 2006 forecast for gross   
general revenue is $4,804.5 million, an increase of $73.9 million or 1.6 percent
over 2005.                                                                      

  In fiscal year 2005, actual net available general revenues collected totaled
$3,937.1 million, of which $3,629.9 million was distributed to State agencies   
and $307.2 million surplus was deposited to the General Revenue Allotment       
Reserve Fund. This amount is $338.3 million or 9.4 percent above the net        
available collections of fiscal year 2004. The general revenue distribution     
included an estimated $54.4 million from a 3 percent income tax surcharge, which
will expire for tax years beginning January 1, 2005, and a transfer of $25.0    
million from the Property Tax Relief Trust Fund. Fiscal year 2006 net available 
general revenue collections are estimated at $3,923.5, a decrease of $13.6      
million or 0.3 percent over fiscal year 2005, with distribution to State        
agencies of $3,825.1 million, an increase of $195.2 million or 5.4% increase.   
This would provide an estimated $98.4 million surplus to be deposited to the    
General Revenue Allotment Reserve Fund for appropriation in the 2007 Legislative
Session. The net available general revenues distributed for fiscal year 2006 are
estimated to include $18.2 million from the Property Tax Relief Trust Fund.     
Revenue decreases from expiration of the 3 percent income tax surcharge and     
elimination of the Arkansas Estate Tax are estimated at $56.5 million and $9.1  
million, respectively.                                                          

Major Initiatives. In 2005, the Arkansas State Highway and Transportation 
Department (AHTD) maintained over 16,000 miles of highways and completed        
construction projects such as simple resurfacing of existing highways, replacing
bridges, adding passing lanes, and building new roads. During 2005 and the      
previous four years, the AHTD has made unprecedented improvements to the        
Arkansas Interstate System as a result of the Interstate Rehabilitation Program 
(IRP). By mid-2005, 50 Interstate roadway projects totaling 355.6 miles had been
let to contract at a cost of nearly $1 billion. Forty nine of these projects    
totaling 349.3 miles of reconstructed or rehabilitated Interstate have been     
completed, with one 6.3 mile project on Interstate 40 in North Little Rock      
remaining under construction. Completed jobs included 71.1 miles on Interstate  
30, 224.5 miles on Interstate 40, 47.1 miles on Interstate 55, and 6.6 miles on 
Interstate 540.                                                                 

   Revenues and Expenditures. Deficit spending has been prohibited by statute in
Arkansas since 1945. The Revenue Stabilization Act controls spending by state   
agencies and prohibits deficit spending. This Act requires that, before any     
state spending can take place, the General Assembly must make an appropriation  
and funds must be available in the fund from which the appropriation has been   
made. The state is prohibited from borrowing money to put into any state fund   
from which appropriations can be paid.                                          

Act 750 of 1973, as amended, established the State's Revenue Stabilization
Law. This law and related legislation govern the administration and distribution
of State revenues. Pursuant to the Stabilization Law, all general and special   
revenues are deposited into the General Revenue Allotment Account and the       
Special Revenue Allotment Account according to the type of revenue being        
deposited. From the General Revenues Fund, 3% of all general revenues are first 
distributed to the Constitutional Officers Fund and the Central Services Fund to
provide support for the States' elected officials and their staffs and the      
Department of Finance and Administration.                                       

The balance is then distributed to separate funds proportionately as      
established by the Stabilization Law. From the Special Revenue Fund, 3% of all  
special revenues collected by DFA and 1.5% of all special revenues collected by 
other agencies are first distributed to provide support for the State's elected 
officials, their staffs, and DFA. The balance is then distributed to the funds  
for which the special revenues were collected. Special revenues, which are      
primarily user taxes, are generally earmarked for the program or agency         
providing the related services. General revenues are transformed into funds     
established and maintained by the Treasurer for major programs and agencies of  
the state in accordance with fund priorities established by the General         
Assembly.                                                                       

According to the Stabilization Law, the General Assembly establishes three
levels of priority for general revenue spending, levels "A", "B", and "C".      
Successive levels of appropriations are funded only in the event sufficient     
revenues have been generated to fully fund any prior level. Accordingly,        
appropriations made to programs and agencies are only maximum authorizations to 
spend. Actual expenditures are limited to the lesser of (1) moneys flowing to a 
program or agencies' fund maintained by the Treasurer or (2) the maximum        
appropriation by the General Assembly. Because state revenues are not collected 
throughout the year in a pattern consistent with program and agency             
expenditures, a budget revolving fund, which receives interest earnings for     
State fund investments, has been established and is utilized to assure proper   
cash flow during any period.                                                    

   Debt Management. The Constitution of the State of Arkansas does not limit the
amount of general obligation bonds which may be issued by the State; however, no
such bonds may be issued unless approved by the voters of the State at a general
election or special election held for that purpose. Although the State of       
Arkansas defaulted on some of its general obligation debt during the depression 
in the late 1930s, it has not failed to pay the principal and interest on any of
its general obligations when due since that time.                               

  Act 496 of 1981, as amended, the Arkansas Water Resources Development Act of
1981 ("Act 496"), authorizes the issuance of State Water Resources Development  
General Obligation Bonds by the State of Arkansas, acting by and through the    
Arkansas Soil and Water Conservation Commission. The issuance of bonds pursuant 
to Act 496 was approved by the electors of the state at the general election on 
November 2, 1982. The total principal amount of bonds issued during any fiscal  
biennium may not exceed $15,000,000, and the total principal of all bonds issued
under Act 496 may not exceed $100,000,000. All bonds to be issued under Act 496 
shall be direct general obligations of the state, the principal and interest of 
which are payable from the general revenues of the state.                       

Act 686 of 1987, the Arkansas Waste Disposal and Pollution Abatement      
Facilities Financing Act of 1987 ("Act 686"), authorizes the issuance of        
Arkansas Waste Disposal and Pollution Abatement Facilities General Obligation   
Bonds by the State of Arkansas, acting by and through the Arkansas Soil and     
Water Conservation Commission. The issuance of bonds pursuant to Act 686 was    
approved by the electors of the state at the general election on November 8,    
1988. The total principal amount of bonds issued during any fiscal biennium may 
not exceed $50,000,000, and the total principal of all bonds issued under Act   
686 may not exceed $250,000,000. All bonds to be issued under Act 686 shall be  
direct general obligations of the state, the principal and interest of which are
payable from the general revenues of the state.                                 

 Act 683 of 1989, the Arkansas College Savings Bond Act of 1989 ("Act 683"),
authorizes the issuance of Arkansas College Savings General Obligation Bonds by 
the State of Arkansas, acting by and through the Arkansas Development Finance   
Authority. The issuance of bonds pursuant to Act 683 was approved by the        
electors of the state at the general election on November 6, 1990. The total    
principal amount of bonds issued during any fiscal biennium may not exceed      
$100,000,000, and the total principal of all bonds issued under Act 683 may not 
exceed $300,000,000. All bonds to be issued under Act 683 shall be direct       
general obligations of the state, the principal and interest of which are       
payable from the general revenues of the state.                                 

 Counties and municipalities may issue general obligation bonds (pledging an
ad valorem tax), special obligation bonds (pledging other specific tax revenues)
and revenue bonds (pledging only specific revenues from sources other than tax  
revenues). School districts may issue general obligation bonds (pledging ad     
valorem taxes). Revenue bonds may also be issued by agencies and                
instrumentalities of counties, municipalities and the State of Arkansas but, as 
in all cases of revenue bonds, neither the full faith and credit nor the taxing 
power of the State of Arkansas or any municipality or county thereof is pledged 
to the repayment of those bonds. Revenue bonds can be issued only for public    
purposes, including, but not limited to, industry, housing, health care         
facilities, airports, port facilities and water and sewer projects.             

In November 2004, Arkansas voters approved an amendment to the State      
Constitution to allow the State to issue general obligation bonds for projects  
that create 500 jobs and have an investment of $500 million. Bond issuance is   
limited to 5 percent of State general revenues during the most recent year,     
which currently would allow an issuance of approximately $223 million in bonds. 
New incentives have been added to attract non-profit headquarters facilities    
that create a new payroll of at least $1 million and pay wages that are 110     
percent of the State or county average wage. Targeted industry incentives       
provide start-up companies a 33 percent transferable income tax credit for      
research and development, a 10 percent payroll tax credit for up to 5 years, and
sales and use tax refunds for equipment and building materials. Industries      
targeted are those that grow knowledge-based businesses from the intellectual   
property generated by the State's research universities. The emerging technology
sectors include: advanced materials and manufacturing systems; agriculture,     
food, and environmental sciences; biotechnology, bioengineering, and life       
sciences; information technology; transportation logistics; bio-based products. 
Changes to legislation governing threshold limits and allowing the Director the 
discretion to increase incentives in highly competitive situations by approving 
rebates have provided Arkansas additional tools to attract industry.            

The total outstanding general obligation bonded indebtedness, including   
special obligation and other debt instruments, of the governmental fund types of
the State as of June 30, 2005, was approximately $945 million.                  

Ratings. As of September 2006, all outstanding general obligation bonds of
the State of Arkansas are rated AA by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services and Aa2
by Moody's Investor's Service, Inc. Any explanation concerning the significance 
of such ratings must be obtained from the rating agencies. There is no assurance
that any ratings will continue for any period of time or that they will not be  
revised or withdrawn.                                                           

  Local Issuances. It should be noted that the creditworthiness of obligations
issued by local Arkansas issuers may be unrelated to the creditworthiness of    
obligations issued by the State of Arkansas, and there is no obligation on the  
part of the State to make payment on such local obligations in the event of     
default.                                                                        

The foregoing information constitutes only a brief summary of some of the 
general factors which may impact certain issuers of bonds contained in the      
Arkansas IM-IT and does not purport to be a complete or exhaustive description  
of all adverse conditions to which the issuers of such obligations are subject. 
Additionally, many factors including national economic, social and environmental
policies and conditions, which are not within the control of the issuers of such
bonds, could affect or could have an adverse impact on the financial condition  
of the State and various agencies and political subdivisions thereof. The       
Sponsor is unable to predict whether or to what extent such factors or other    
factors may affect the issuers of the bonds contained in the Arkansas IM-IT, the
market value or marketability of such bonds or the ability of the respective    
issuers of such bonds acquired by the Arkansas IM-IT to pay interest on or      
principal of such bonds.                                                        

The Arkansas IM-IT is susceptible to political, economic or regulatory    
factors affecting issuers of Arkansas municipal obligations (the "Arkansas      
Municipal Obligations"). These include the possible adverse effects of certain  
Arkansas constitutional amendments, legislative measures, voter initiatives and 
other matters that are described. The information provided above is only a brief
summary of the complex factors affecting the financial situation in Arkansas and
is derived from sources that are generally available to investors and are       
believed to be accurate. No independent verification has been made of the       
accuracy or completeness of any of the following information. It is based in

or contained in Official Statements for various Arkansas Municipal Obligations. 

 California Risk Factors

  Economic Outlook. The real estate market was an important engine of economic
growth in 2005 for both the nation and California. In California, jobs closely  
related to the real estate market, namely construction and financial activities,
accounted for about 32% of jobs created in 2005. Low mortgage interest rates    
fueled growth in the real estate sector. By the fall of 2005, however, home     
sales were beginning to slow and inventory was growing. By January 2006,        
residential real estate sales in California dropped by 9.5%, below the rate for 
January 2005. Home prices began to level off as the year ended, but the January 
2006 median price was still 13.0% above the level of January 2005.              

Personal income growth in California has been more robust than that of    
payroll employment. Personal income for Californians was 6.0% higher in the     
third quarter of 2005 as compared to the third quarter of 2004, although lower  
than the 6.6% growth rate in 2004. Total employment is growing at a faster pace 
than payroll employment in California industries, thus boosting personal income 
growth. More workers are earning their income as contractors, self-employed or  
small business owners. State personal income tax collections through January    
2006 are up 12.6% from last year, due in part to the resurgence in capital gains
from the real estate market and the stock market. Because taxes on personal     
income are progressive, that is, the rate of taxation increases as taxable      
income increases, income gains by high-income taxpayers result in greater       
amounts collected in taxes.                                                     

The State experienced healthy increases in general revenues, primarily    
personal income, corporate, and sales tax revenues, and stabilized its expenses.
As a result, for the first time in the past four fiscal years, State revenues   
exceeded expenses and transfers for governmental activities. Total revenues for 
the State's business-type activities also exceeded expenses for the year.       
Therefore, net assets for the 2004-05 fiscal year for both governmental and     
business-type activities increased by 10.3% over last year.                     

Net Assets. The primary government's net assets as of June 30, 2005, were 
$44.2 billion. After the total net assets are reduced by $80.4 billion for      
investment in capital assets (net of related debt) and by $14.9 billion for     
restricted net assets, the resulting unrestricted net assets were a negative    
$51.1 billion. Restricted net assets are dedicated for specified uses and are   
not available to fund current activities. More than half of the negative $51.1  
billion consists of $29.7 billion in outstanding bonded debt issued to build    
capital assets for school districts and other local governmental entities. The  
bonded debt reduces the unrestricted net assets; however, local governments,    
instead of the State, record the capital assets that would offset this          
reduction.                                                                      

   Changes in Net Assets. The primary government's total net assets increased by
$4.1 billion (10.3%) during the year ended June 30, 2005. Net assets of         
governmental activities increased by $2.5 billion (7.9%), while net assets of   
business-type activities increased by $1.6 billion (19.8%).                     

  The California economy picked up speed in fiscal year 2004-05 and by the end
of the fiscal year had regained all of the jobs lost since the 2001 recession.  
From June 2004 to June 2005, non-farm payroll employment added 243,900 jobs,    
representing an annual growth rate of 1.7%, more than twice as fast as in the   
previous fiscal year. Income growth was also strong, getting a significant boost
from both job growth and capital gains. Despite short-term interest rate        
increases from the Federal Open Market Committee, mortgage rates remained low   
and the real estate market continued its upsurge. Home sales and prices reached 
record levels, and residential construction activity was strong. While          
professional and business services added more jobs (55,900) than any other      
single sector, construction gained a reported 54,500 jobs. Together,            
construction and financial activities provided 32.8% of the job growth in the   
fiscal year.                                                                    

The U.S. economy continued its expansion in 2005. Gross Domestic Product  
(GDP) growth for the year averaged 3.5%. In August and September of 2005 the    
Gulf Coast of the U.S. was hit by two major hurricanes that significantly       
damaged the lives and property of people in that region. Oil and gas facilities 
were extensively damaged, significantly raising energy prices. Many feared that 
the nation would fall into recession. However, the economy continued to grow in 
the wake of the hurricanes. GDP grew 4.1% in the third quarter before slowing to
1.6% in the fourth quarter of 2005. This slowing was at least partially due to  
the storms. The hurricanes slowed exports and accelerated imports, as the nation
replaced lost capacity at home with petroleum products and other goods from     
abroad.                                                                         

Payroll employment growth in calendar year 2005 was approximately 1.5% for
the nation and 2.0% for California. The nation added almost 2.1 million jobs and
California added approximately 287,000 jobs. By the end of December 2005, the   
unemployment rate in California had dropped to 5.1%, compared to 5.9% in        
December of 2004. The national unemployment rate in December 2005 was 4.9%. In  
January 2006 payroll employment in the nation grew by 193,000 jobs and in       
California by 18,300 jobs. The unemployment rate dropped to 4.7% in the nation  
and 4.9% in California. This was the lowest unemployment rate in California     
since March 2001. Jobs in construction, which was the leading source of         
employment gains for California in the prior 12 months, showed a decline in     
January.                                                                        

Infrastructure Planning. Recent disastrous flooding in the southern United
States has heightened awareness of the urgent need to shore up the State's      
Central Valley levee system. Much of the existing levee system needs substantial
rehabilitation. The State Department of Water Resources has estimated a cost of 
$1.0 to $1.5 billion for restoring the Central Valley flood control system's    
aging levees to the level of protection for which they were originally designed.
In the future, the State will likely incur much higher costs to adequately      
protect the Valley's expanding urban regions. The Governor has proposed a       
Strategic Growth Plan that looks to invest more than $222 billion in            
infrastructure over a 10-year period. Five areas targeted for investment are    
transportation and air quality, education, flood control and water supply,      
public safety, and court and other public service projects. Although the        
creation of an infrastructure bond plan has been discussed, no specific plan has
been finalized.                                                                 

Budget Outlook. The 2005 Budget Act was enacted on July 11, 2005, and     
authorizes total spending of $117.4 billion: $90.0 billion from the General     
Fund, $23.4 billion from special funds, and $4.0 billion from bond funds. Total 
General Fund resources and expenditures in this Budget are projected to be $92.0
billion and $90.0 billion, respectively. The Budget contains a $3.0 billion     
increase for education (kindergarten through 12th grade and community college   
funding), prepays a $1.2 billion loan due to local governments in 2006-07, and  
reflects program savings of approximately $4.1 billion.                         

The Governor's Budget for the 2006-07 fiscal year, released on January 10,
2006, seeks total spending of $125.6 billion: $97.9 billion from the General    
Fund, $25.0 billion from special funds, and $2.7 billion from bond funds. Total 
General Fund resources, including transfers, are projected to be $98.6 billion, 
while expenditures are estimated at $97.9 billion. The proposed 2006-07 General 
Fund expenditures represent a $7.6 billion increase over the 2005-06 enacted    
budget amounts. The Governor's Budget also calls for the prepayment of $920     
million of the $1.4 billion owed to transportation funds in 2007-08. For the    
first time, as required by Proposition 58, approved by California voters in     
March 2004, a transfer of $920 million will be made to the newly created Budget 
Stabilization Account. Half of the transfer to the Account serves to retire $460
million in deficit financing bonds, and the remainder stays in the Account as a 
reserve. The Legislative Analyst's Office (LAO), California's nonpartisan fiscal
and policy advisor, notes that the Governor's Budget would leave the State with 
major structural budget shortfalls and a large amount of other outstanding      
financial obligations. The LAO also recommends that the legislature reduce      
ongoing spending increases proposed in the Governor's Budget and use one-time,  
stronger than normal revenues to pay down more of the outstanding budgetary     
debt, or hold some of these revenues in reserve.                                

 Debt Management Plan. As part of the Strategic Debt Management Plan adopted
in the 2001-02 fiscal year, the State deferred, for up to four years, the       
initial principal payments on new and refunding general obligation bonds issued 
through June 30, 2004. Some of these deferred initial principal payments became 
due during the year ended June 30, 2005. Also, the initial principal payment    
became due this year for the Federal Highway Grant Anticipation Revenue Vehicles
(GARVEE bonds) issued last year.                                                

Debt Administration. At June 30, 2005, the primary government had total   
bonded debt outstanding of $78.6 billion. Of this amount, $47.6 billion (60.6%) 
represents general obligation bonds, which are backed by the full faith and     
credit of the State. Included in the $47.6 billion of general obligation bonds  
is $10.9 billion of economic recovery bonds that are secured by a pledge of     
revenues derived from dedicated sales and use taxes. The current portion of     
general obligation bonds outstanding is $1.8 billion and the long-term portion  
is $45.8 billion. The remaining $31.0 billion (39.4%) of bonded debt outstanding
represents revenue bonds, which are secured solely by specified revenue sources.
The current portion of revenue bonds outstanding is $1.0 billion and the        
long-term portion is $30.0 billion.                                             

The primary government's total long-term obligations increased during the 
year ended June 30, 2005. The main reason for the increase was the issuance of  
$3.1 billion in general obligation bonds and $2.1 billion in revenue bonds.     
However, the increase due to bond issuances was offset by an increase in general
obligation and revenue bond retirement payments made during the year.           

Budgetary Control. The State's annual budget is prepared primarily on a   
modified accrual basis for governmental funds. The Governor recommends a budget 
for approval by the legislature each year. This recommended budget includes     
estimated revenues; however, revenues are not included in the annual budget bill
adopted by the legislature. Under State law, the State cannot adopt a spending  
plan that exceeds estimated revenues. Under the State Constitution, money may be
drawn from the treasury only through a legal appropriation. The appropriations  
contained in the Budget Act, as approved by the legislature and signed by the   
Governor, are the primary sources of annual expenditure authorizations and      
establish the legal level of control at the appropriation level for the annual  
operating budget. The budget can be amended throughout the year by special      
legislative action, budget revisions by the Department of Finance, or executive 
orders of the Governor.                                                         

  Appropriations are generally available for expenditure or encumbrance either
in the year appropriated or for a period of three years if the legislation does 
not specify a period of availability. At the end of the availability period, the
encumbering authority for the unencumbered balance lapses. Some appropriations  
continue indefinitely, while others are available until fully spent. Generally, 
encumbrances must be liquidated within two years from the end of the period when
the appropriation is available. If the encumbrances are not liquidated within   
this additional two-year period, the spending authority for these encumbrances  
lapses. State agencies are responsible for exercising basic budgetary control   
and ensuring that appropriations are not overspent. The State Controller's      
Office is responsible for overall appropriation control and does not allow      
expenditures in excess of authorized appropriations. Financial activities are   
mainly controlled at the appropriation level but can vary, depending on the     
presentation and wording contained in the Budget Act. Certain items that are    
established at the category, program, component, or element level can be        
adjusted by the Department of Finance. For example, an appropriation for support
may have detail accounts for personal services, operating expenses and          
equipment, and reimbursements. The Department of Finance can authorize          
adjustments between the detail accounts but cannot increase the amount of the   
overall support appropriation. While the financial activities are controlled at 
various levels, the legal level of budgetary control, or the extent to which    
management may amend the budget without seeking approval of the governing body, 
has been established in the Budget Act at the appropriation level for the annual
operating budget.                                                               

Cash Management. Cash temporarily idle during the year is invested in the 
Pooled Money Investment Account (PMIA). Investment of PMIA moneys is restricted 
by law to the following categories: U.S. government securities, securities of   
federally sponsored agencies, domestic corporate bonds, bank notes,             
interest-bearing time deposits in California banks and savings and loan         
associations, prime commercial paper, repurchase and reverse repurchase         
agreements, security loans, bankers' acceptances, negotiable certificates of    
deposit, and loans to various bond funds. The average daily investment balance  
for the year ended June 30, 2005, amounted to $53.9 billion, with an average    
effective yield of 2.26%, compared to $54.6 billion and 1.53% for the year ended
June 30, 2004. The total earnings of the PMIA for the year ended June 30, 2005, 
amounted to $1.2 billion, which was distributed as follows: $233 million to the 
General Fund, $547 million to special funds, $431 million to local governments, 
$1.8 million to CalPERS, and $1.1 million to CalSTRS. The State's cash          
management program for the General Fund regularly issues short-term obligations 
to meet cash flow needs. The State issues revenue anticipation notes (RANs) to  
partially fund timing differences between revenues and expenditures. A          
significant portion of the General Fund revenues are received in the second half
of the fiscal year, while disbursements are paid more evenly throughout the     
fiscal year. If additional external cash flow borrowing is required, the State  
issues revenue anticipation warrants (RAWs).                                    

 Risk Management. The primary government has elected, with a few exceptions,
to be self-insured against loss or liability and generally does not maintain    
reserves. Losses are covered by appropriations in the year in which the payment 
occurs. The discounted liability for unpaid self-insured workers' compensation  
losses is estimated to be $2.8 billion as of June 30, 2005.                     

Proposed Budget 2006-2007. The Governor released his proposed budget on   
January 10, 2006. The 2006-07 proposed spending plan totals $125.6 billion. This
spending plan represents estimated General Fund expenditures of $97.9 billion,  
special fund expenditures of $25.0 billion, and bond fund expenditures of $2.7  
billion. Proposed General Fund expenditures are 8.4% higher than the $90 billion
expenditures estimated for the 2005-06 fiscal year. The Governor's budget       
projects to end the 2006-07 fiscal year with a $613 million reserve, including  
$460 million in the Budget Stabilization Account. Proposition 58, passed by     
California's voters in November 2004, requires that, beginning in the 2006-07   
fiscal year, the State transfer into the Budget Stabilization Account by        
September 30 of each year a specified portion of estimated general fund revenues
until the account balance reaches $8 billion or 5% of the estimated General Fund
revenues, whichever is greater. In the 2006-07 Overview of the Governor's       
Budget, the Legislative Analyst's Office, California's nonpartisan fiscal and   
policy advisor, expresses concerns about using unexpected revenue increases from
volatile revenue sources - such as business profits and capital gains - to      
increase spending instead of paying down outstanding obligations such as past   
borrowings from schools, local governments, and transportation. Given the       
continuing structural budget shortfall (when annual expenses exceed annual      
revenues) and an estimated $1.0 billion of potential unbudgeted costs, the      
Legislative Analyst cautions the legislature about taking on new and ongoing    
program commitments at this time.                                               

Ratings. As of September 2006, all outstanding general obligation bonds of
the State of California are rated A+ by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services and  
A1 by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. Any explanation concerning the            
significance of such ratings must be obtained from the rating agencies. There is
no assurance that any ratings will continue for any period of time or that they 
will not be revised or withdrawn.                                               

  Local Issuances. It should be noted that the creditworthiness of obligations
issued by local California issuers may be unrelated to the creditworthiness of  
obligations issued by the State of California, and there is no obligation on the
part of the State to make payment on such local obligations in the event of     
default.                                                                        

The foregoing information constitutes only a brief summary of some of the 
general factors which may impact certain issuers of bonds contained in the      
California IM-IT and does not purport to be a complete or exhaustive description
of all adverse conditions to which the issuers of such obligations are subject. 
Additionally, many factors including national economic, social and environmental
policies and conditions, which are not within the control of the issuers of such
bonds, could affect or could have an adverse impact on the financial condition  
of the State and various agencies and political subdivisions thereof. The       
Sponsor is unable to predict whether or to what extent such factors or other    
factors may affect the issuers of the bonds contained in the California IM-IT,  
the market value or marketability of such bonds or the ability of the respective
issuers of such bonds acquired by the California IM-IT to pay interest on or    
principal of such bonds.                                                        

The California IM-IT is susceptible to political, economic or regulatory  
factors affecting issuers of California municipal obligations (the "California  
Municipal Obligations"). These include the possible adverse effects of certain  
California constitutional amendments, legislative measures, voter initiatives   
and other matters that are described. The information provided above is only a  
brief summary of the complex factors affecting the financial situation in       
California and is derived from sources that are generally available to investors
and are believed to be accurate. No independent verification has been made of   
the accuracy or completeness of any of the following information. It is based in
part on information obtained from various State and local agencies in California
or contained in official statements for various California municipal            
obligations.                                                                    

 Colorado Risk Factors

General. Colorado became the thirty-eighth state of the United States of  
America when it was admitted to the Union in 1876. Its borders encompass 104,247
square miles of the high plains and the Rocky Mountains with elevations ranging 
from 3,350 to 14,431 feet above sea level. The state's major economic sectors   
include agriculture, manufacturing, technology, tourism, energy production, and 
mining. Considerable economic activity is generated in support of these sectors 
by government, wholesale and retail trade, transportation, communications,      
public utilities, finance, insurance, real estate, and other services. Given the
state's semiarid climate, water resource development, allocation, and           
conservation are ongoing issues for state management.                           

The state maintains a separation of powers utilizing three branches of    
government - executive, legislative, and judicial. The executive branch         
comprises four major elected officials - Governor, State Treasurer, Attorney    
General, and Secretary of State. Most departments of the state report directly  
to the Governor; however, the Departments of Treasury, Law, and State report to 
their respective elected officials, and the Department of Education reports to  
the elected State Board of Education. The elected officials serve four-year     
terms with the number of terms limited in duration.                             

The legislature is bicameral and comprises thirty-five senators and       
sixty-five representatives who are also term limited. It is a citizen           
legislature whose general session lasts 120 days beginning in January of each   
year. Special sessions may be called by the Governor at his discretion and are  
limited to the topics identified by the Governor. The legislature's otherwise   
plenary power is checked by the requirement for the Governor's signature of its 
legislation and by specific limitations placed in the State Constitution by     
voters. The most significant fiscal limitation is the restriction related to    
issuing debt, raising taxes, and changing existing spending limits. From a      
fiscal perspective, the Joint Budget Committee of the legislature, because of   
its preparation of the annual budget and supplemental appropriations bills,     
holds the most important power vested in the legislature. The committee is      
bipartisan with members drawn from each of the houses of the legislature. The   
Governor's Office of State Planning and Budgeting develops an executive branch  
budget proposal, but there is no requirement for the Joint Budget Committee to  
adopt that proposal.                                                            

 The Judicial Branch is responsible for resolving disputes within the state,
including those between the executive and legislative branches of government,   
and for supervising offenders on probation. The branch includes the Supreme     
Court, Court of Appeals, and district and county courts, served by 256 justices 
and judges in 22 judicial districts across the state (excluding 17 Denver county
court judges). Municipal courts are not part of the state system. There are also
seven water courts, one in each of the major river basins. The Judicial Branch  
budget is appropriated by the legislature, and it is funded primarily from      
general-purpose revenues of the General Fund.                                   

Economic Outlook. The state's General Fund revenue picture continued to   
rebound in Fiscal Year 2004-05. General Fund revenues were $394.4 million (6.8  
percent) over the prior year amount; however, those revenues remained $194.5    
million (3.1 percent) below the Fiscal Year 2000-01 record level. The           
general-purpose revenue growth parallels the reported 2004 state personal income
growth of 5.8 percent. It also reflects a beginning recovery in state employment
as 27,600 jobs were added in Fiscal Year 2003-04 and employment increased 2.3   
percent in August 2005 - the tenth highest rate of increase in the nation. The  
state's recovery from the most recent recession follows the national recovery   
although the state has recovered more slowly. Inflation adjusted national gross 
domestic product grew at an annual rate of 4.2 percent in calendar 2004, and in 
the third quarter of 2005, it grew at a 3.6 percent annual rate over the third  
quarter of 2004. National personal consumption expenditures, which account for  
two-thirds of GDP and were up 3.8 percent, outpaced the third-quarter to        
third-quarter average while private domestic investment (including              
nonresidential structures, equipment and software, residential, and changes in  
inventories) lagged the average at 3.4 percent. Government spending also lagged 
the average at a 2.1 percent growth rate and was primarily the result of slower 
growth in state and local government spending. Federal spending, while          
increasing, also lagged the third-quarter to third-quarter average growth rate. 

 Inflation in Colorado was extremely low in 2004 with consumer prices rising
only 0.1 percent. Inflation remained low through August 2005 with prices up only
1.4 percent. Colorado inflation was controlled primarily by reductions in       
housing rental rates and incentives offered by automobile dealers. The high-wage
jobs lost in the 2001 recession have also mitigated inflation pressures, as the 
job recovery has been slow since that time. A change in the method of computing 
the unemployment rate increased the 2004 percentage to 5.5 percent from 5.1     
percent calculated under the old method; however, unemployment is forecast to   
decline in Fiscal Year 2005 as job growth continues. After two successive years 
of decline, housing permits increased 15.6 percent in 2004 while the value of   
nonresidential construction increased 26.3 percent.                             

   Colorado's economic difficulties in Fiscal Years 2001-02 through 2003-04 have
continued to affect net migration in calendar year 2004. Net in-migration       
declined from approximately 69,000 and 35,000 in 2001 and 2002, respectively, to
approximately 12,000 in both 2003 and 2004. However, the 2004 amount includes   
international in-migration of approximately 22,000 and out-migration to other   
states of around 6,000. This pattern likely results in replacing established    
households that have a high level of economic activity with new households that 
have a lower level of economic activity.                                        

   Capital Assets and Long-Term Debt Activity. The state's investment in capital
assets at June 30, 2005, was $16.1 billion ($15.8 billion in Fiscal Year        
2003-04). Included in this amount were $4.1 billion of depreciable capital      
assets net of $2.9 billion of depreciation. Also included was $12.0 billion of  
land and non-depreciable infrastructure reported under the modified approach.   
The state added $750.3 million and $964.2 million of capital assets in Fiscal   
Year 2004-05 and 2003-04, respectively. Of the Fiscal Year 2004-05 additions,   
$416.5 million was recorded by governmental funds and $333.8 million was        
recorded by proprietary funds. Of the additions, $13.5 million was funded by    
general-purpose revenues and the balance was funded by federal funds, cash      
funds, or borrowing. The state continued construction of a major project to     
rebuild a portion of Interstate 25 in Denver. The project increases the capacity
and efficiency of the highway and adds a light rail line. The project is funded 
by Transportation Revenue Anticipation Notes (TRANs) authorized by a vote of the
people in the November 1999 election. The state will repay the notes from future
federal and other state revenues.                                               

   Conditions Expected to Affect Future Operations. Several conditions adversely
affect the state's future operations. First, there has been a very significant  
change related to previously anticipated Taxpayer's Bill of Rights ("TABOR")    
refunds over the next five years. In a bipartisan agreement between the         
legislature and the Governor, two referenda were placed on the November 2005    
election ballot. Voters approved one of the referenda by a narrow margin and    
rejected the other. The approved referendum, known as Referendum C, allows the  
state to retain all revenues in excess of the TABOR limits from Fiscal Year     
2005-06 through Fiscal Year 2009-10. At the time of the vote, Legislative       
Council estimated the retained revenues at $3.7 billion. The election did not   
guarantee the availability of those funds, but rather it allowed the state to   
keep and spend those dollars if they are realized through existing taxes, fees, 
and other sources subject to the TABOR limits. The defeated referendum, known as
Referendum D, would have allowed the state to borrow $2.07 billion in           
anticipation of the revenues to be retained under Referendum C. It specified the
use of the debt proceeds to fund transportation, fire and police pensions,      
primary education buildings, and higher education buildings. The rejection of   
Referendum D means that many of the items cited in this discussion in Fiscal    
Year 2003-04 continue to be conditions that are expected to affect future       
operations.                                                                     

An existing statute provides for diversion of general-purpose sales tax   
revenue to the Highway Fund when other General Fund obligations have been met.  
Another statute provides that any General Fund Surplus be distributed to the    
Highway Fund and Capital Projects Fund in a two-thirds and one-third ratio,     
respectively. With the passage of Referendum C, OSPB currently estimates that   
$836.7 million will be sent to the Highway Fund between Fiscal Years 2005-06 and
2009-10 under these statutes. Even if none of this amount is used for debt      
service on the Highway Fund's existing debt, it will result in less new highway 
construction than would have occurred under the passage of Referendum D. In     
addition, any new highway construction will be spread over five to eight years  
and will be reduced by any construction cost inflation occurring during that    
period.                                                                         

 Second, while one legislature cannot bind another, current law requires the
General Fund to repay transfers from various cash funds when resources exceed   
General Fund obligations.                                                       

Third, notwithstanding a 14.1 percent return on investments, the funding  
ratio (actuarial value of assets, using a four-year smoothed-market value,      
divided by actuarial accrued liability) of the State and School Division of the 
Public Employees Retirement Association (PERA) declined from 75.2 percent to    
70.1 percent within its most recent fiscal year. This is down from a 104.7      
percent funding ratio in 2000. The amortization period for the plan is infinite,
which means that at the current contribution level the liability associated with
existing benefits will never be fully paid. The current contribution rate of    
10.15 percent is 1.3 percentage points (or 11.4 percent) below the average      
during the 1990s. PERA's actuary estimates that the contribution rate would need
to be 16.9 percent to achieve the 40-year amortization period currently called  
for by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board. Several options have been   
offered to address the PERA funding issues, such as cutting benefits, raising   
employee contributions, or increasing employer contributions; however, each     
raises either legal, political, or budgetary issues.                            

Fourth, the Election 2000 Amendment 23 constitutional requirement was     
originally designed to dedicate a portion of TABOR refunds to education         
programs. However, resources that were once general-purpose revenues continue to
be diverted to the State Education Fund notwithstanding the passage of          
Referendum C, which eliminates TABOR refunds for the following five years. OSPB 
estimates that $321.7 million will be diverted from general-purpose tax revenue 
in Fiscal Year 2005-06 under this requirement. In addition, the state is        
required to increase funding of education by specified percentages over         
inflation. This requirement will have less of an impact in the near term than it
has had historically because of the low level of inflation experienced by the   
state economy. Nonetheless, this revenue diversion and mandated expenditure     
growth infringes on general funding for other programs because of the existing  
spending limits.                                                                

 Fifth, for Fiscal Year 2002-03 and following years, the Legislature changed
the budgetary accounting for June payroll and Medicaid expenditures to the cash 
basis. This causes the outflow of resources to be deferred into the following   
year. As a result, the state does not use full or modified accrual accounting to
calculate budgetary compliance. Instead, potentially significant liabilities    
($136.7 million net of related deferred revenue in Fiscal Year 2004-05) are     
delayed until the following year assuming that subsequent revenues will be      
adequate to pay those liabilities. Departures from generally accepted accounting
principles (GAAP) such as this could adversely affect the state's credit rating.
It will be difficult for the state to return to the GAAP basis of accounting for
budgetary expenditures because of the significant one-time budgetary impact of  
recording payroll and Medicaid expenditures that were previously deferred.      

  Sixth, the legislature temporarily reduced spending for Fiscal Year 2004-05.
Payments to counties for the senior Homestead Property Tax Exemption were       
suspended reducing General Fund expenditures. These payments were also suspended
for Fiscal Year 2005-06, but are scheduled to resume at an estimated amount of  
$65.8 million in Fiscal Year 2006-07. Additionally, payments to the Fire and    
Police Pension Association for Old Hire Pension Plans were suspended reducing   
General Fund expenditures by an estimated $25 million. These payments resume in 
Fiscal Year 2005-06.                                                            

Seventh, Debt service payments on the remaining $1.4 billion of           
Transportation Revenue Anticipation Notes issued by the Department of           
Transportation average $270.8 million per year over the next five years. While a
portion of the debt services will be funded by federal funds, a significant     
amount will be funded by state sources. When most of the notes were issued, the 
diversion of surplus general-purpose revenues was expected to accumulate to fund
that debt service. Due to the economic recession, those diversions did not occur
for several years. As discussed above, the diversion of General Fund resources  
is expected to resume with the passage of Referendum C. Nonetheless, the use of 
federal and other transportation resources to pay this debt service will reduce 
the amount that can be expended on road maintenance and construction statewide. 

Major Initiatives. The legislature passed significant legislation to      
implement measures recently placed in the State Constitution by voters and to   
address the fiscal impact of other voter approved constitutional requirements.  
The legislation was generally of two types. The first type was legislation that 
was immediately effective upon passage and signature by the Governor; the second
type was legislation that was contingent on a vote of the people at the November
1, 2005, general election.                                                      

  Among legislation that was immediately effective on signature was House Bill
05-1310 which required the state to change its accounting for TABOR refunds made
in excess of the TABOR constitutional requirements. The change allowed the state
to take credit for TABOR refunds made for which it previously did not receive   
credit. The change reduced the amount of TABOR refunds due to the state         
taxpayers for Fiscal Year 2004-05 by $222.5 million. Senate Bill 05-209, the    
annual appropriations bill, included funding of an Amortization Equalization    
Disbursement beginning January 2006 that is intended to begin addressing the    
decline in funding status of the Public Employees Retirement Association. House 
Bill 05-1261 created the Tobacco Tax Cash Fund to receive and distribute tobacco
taxes authorized by Section 21 of Article X of the State Constitution (Amendment
35), which was passed by the state's voters in the November 2004 general        
election. The same bill changed the financing for some existing tobacco         
education, prevention, and cessation programs from the Tobacco Litigation       
Settlement monies to the Tobacco Tax Cash monies. House Bill 05-1262 created    
several new funds to receive and expend monies distributed by the Tobacco Tax   
Cash Fund for programs generically designated in the constitution. House Bill   
05-1330 authorized the Governor to initiate the sale and leaseback of eligible  
state facilities, in Fiscal Year 2005-06, if the Office of State Planning and   
Budgeting revenue estimates show that the required General Fund Reserve will    
drop below two percent. The State Capitol is not considered an eligible state   
facility.                                                                       

Among the legislation that was passed and was contingent on a vote of the 
people at the November 1, 2005 general election was House Bill 05-1194 which    
placed a referred measure (Referendum C) on the statewide ballot requesting     
voter approval for the state to retain and spend all state revenues in excess of
the constitutional revenue and spending limitations in Section 20 Article X of  
the State Constitution for the following five years. The legislation specified  
categories of spending that ranged from general to specific for the related     
spending. A companion measure (House Joint Resolution 05-1057-Referendum D) that
was contingent on the passage of Referendum C asked voters for authority to     
issue $2.072 billion of notes with a maximum repayment cost of $3.225 billion.  
The referendum specified that $1.7 billion would be issued for transportation   
needs while $147.0 million would be used to pay the settlement of a lawsuit that
required the state to fund repairs of public school facilities. Fifty million   
would be used to repair facilities at institutions of higher education, and     
$175.0 million would be used for state shortfalls in funding local fire and     
police pension liabilities. The voters passed Referendum C in the November 2005 
election, and Referendum D was defeated. House Bill 05-1333 created the Critical
Needs Financing Authority (CNFA) and authorized the Department of Transportation
and the CNFA to issue notes authorized by Referendum D.                         

 Budgetary Controls. The General Assembly enacts the annual state budget for
all ongoing programs, except for federal and custodial funds. New programs are  
funded for the first time in enabling legislation and are continued through the 
Long Appropriations Act in future periods. For the most part, appropriations    
lapse at the end of the fiscal year unless extenuating circumstances prompt the 
State Controller to approve an appropriation rollforward. Capital construction  
appropriations are normally effective for three years. The state records the    
budget in its accounting system along with estimates of federal awards and      
custodial funds of the various departments. Revenues and expenses/expenditures  
are accounted for on the basis used for the fund in which the budget is recorded
except for certain budgetary basis exceptions (see Note RSI-1A). Encumbrances   
are also recorded and result in a reduction of the budgeted spending authority. 

Encumbrances represent the estimated amount of expenditures that will be  
incurred when outstanding purchase orders, contracts, or other commitments are  
fulfilled. Encumbrances in the General Fund are not reported as a reservation of
fund balance unless the related appropriations are approved for rollforward to  
the subsequent fiscal year. Fund balance is reserved for encumbrances that      
represent legal or contractual obligations in the Capital Projects Fund and the 
Department of Transportation's portion of the Highway Users Tax Fund.           

  In developing the state's accounting system, consideration has been given to
the adequacy of internal accounting controls. Internal accounting controls are  
designed to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance regarding the       
safeguarding of assets against loss from unauthorized use or disposition. Those 
controls also assure the reliability of financial records for preparing         
financial statements and maintaining the accountability for assets. The concept 
of reasonable assurance recognizes that the cost of a control should not exceed 
the benefits likely to be derived from that control. The evaluation of costs and
benefits requires estimates and judgments by management. All internal control   
evaluations occur within this framework.                                        

  Revenues and Expenditures. The State Constitution requires that expenditures
for any fiscal year not exceed revenues for such fiscal year. By statute, the   
amount of General Fund revenues available for appropriation is based upon       
revenue estimates which, together with other available resources, must exceed   
annual appropriations by the amount of the unappropriated reserve (the          
"Unappropriated Reserve"). For fiscal years 1994 and thereafter, the            
Unappropriated Reserve requirement is set at 4 percent. In addition to the      
Unappropriated Reserve, a constitutional amendment approved by Colorado voters  
in 1992 requires the state and local government to reserve a certain percentage 
of its fiscal year spending (excluding bonded debt service) for emergency use   
(the "Emergency Reserve"). The minimum Emergency Reserve is set at 3 percent for
1995 and later years. For fiscal year 1992 and thereafter, General Fund         
appropriations are also limited by statute to an amount equal to the cost of    
performing certain required reappraisals of taxable property plus an amount     
equal to the lesser of (i) 5 percent of Colorado personal income or (ii) 106    
percent of the total General Fund appropriations for the previous fiscal year.  
This restriction does not apply to any General Fund appropriations which are    
required as a result of a new federal law, a final state or federal court order 
or moneys derived from the increase in the rate or amount of any tax or fee     
approved by a majority of the registered electors of the State voting at any    
general election. In addition, the statutory limit on the level of General Fund 
appropriations may be exceeded for a given fiscal year upon the declaration of a
State fiscal emergency by the State General Assembly.                           

 On November 3, 1992, voters in Colorado approved a constitutional amendment
(the "Amendment") which, in general, became effective December 31, 1992, and    
restricts the ability of the State and local governments to increase revenues   
and impose taxes. The Amendment applies to the State and all local governments, 
including home rule entities ("Districts"). Enterprises, defined as             
government-owned businesses authorized to issue revenue bonds and receiving     
under 10 percent of annual revenue in grants from all Colorado state and local  
governments combined, are excluded from the provisions of the Amendment.        

The provisions of the Amendment are unclear and have required judicial    
interpretation. Among other provisions, beginning November 4, 1992, the         
Amendment requires voter approval prior to tax increases, creation of debt, or  
mill levy or valuation for assessment ratio increases. The Amendment also limits
increases in government spending and property tax revenues to specified         
percentages. The Amendment requires that District property tax revenues yield no
more than the prior year's revenues adjusted for inflation, voter approved      
changes and (except with regard to school districts) local growth in property   
values according to a formula set forth in the Amendment. School districts are  
allowed to adjust tax levies for changes in student enrollment. Pursuant to the 
Amendment, local government spending is to be limited by the same formula as the
limitation for property tax revenues. The basis for spending and revenue limits 
for each fiscal year is the prior fiscal year's spending and property taxes     
collected in the prior calendar year. Debt service changes, reductions and      
voter-approved revenue changes are excluded from the calculation bases. The     
Amendment also prohibits new or increased real property transfer tax rates, new 
state real property taxes and local district income taxes. There is also a      
statutory restriction on the amount of annual increases in taxes that the       
various taxing jurisdictions in Colorado can levy without electoral approval.   
This restriction does not apply to taxes levied to pay general obligation debt. 

 Litigation concerning several issues relating to the Amendment was filed in
the Colorado courts. The litigation dealt with three principal issues: (i)      
whether Districts can increase mill levies to pay debt service on general       
obligation bonds without obtaining voter approval; (ii) whether a multi-year    
lease purchase agreement subject to annual appropriations is an obligation which
requires voter approval prior to execution of the agreement; and (iii) what     
constitutes an "enterprise" which is excluded from the provisions of the        
Amendment. In September 1994, the Colorado Supreme Court held that Districts can
increase mill levies to pay debt service on general obligation bonds issued     
after the effective date of the Amendment; in June, 1995, the Colorado Supreme  
Court validated mill levy increases to pay general obligation bonds issued prior
to the Amendment. In late 1994, the Colorado Court of Appeals held that         
multi-year lease-purchase agreements subject to annual appropriation do not     
require voter approval. Finally, in May, 1995, the Colorado Supreme Court ruled 
that entities with the power to levy taxes may not themselves be "enterprises"  
for purposes of the Amendment; however, the Court did not address the issue of  
how valid enterprises may be created. Litigation in the "enterprise" arena may  
be filed in the future to clarify these issues.                                 

 TABOR, Article X, Section 20 of the Colorado State Constitution, limits the
state's revenue growth to the sum of inflation plus population growth in the    
previous calendar year. According to the OSPB after logging TABOR revenue       
surpluses for five years, the TABOR surplus vanished in FY 2001-02 and remained 
absent through FY 2003-04. The TABOR surplus disappeared because of the         
recession, Amendment 23, and the growth dividend. In FY 2004-05, the TABOR      
surplus reappears, totaling $53.1 million. From FY 2005-06 through the remainder
of the forecast, the TABOR surplus is expected to range between $290 million and
$950 million. The September 2004 OSPB forecast for the FY 2004-05 TABOR surplus 
is slightly lower than was forecast in June 2004, while the TABOR surpluses in  
FY 2005-06 and beyond are generally slightly higher. There are several reasons  
for the change. First, TABOR revenues received in FY 2003-04 were higher than   
anticipated in June 2004, permitting more of the growth dividend to be used in  
FY 2003-04. This raises the FY 2004-05 TABOR limit, which in turn, lowers the   
amount of the FY 2004-05 TABOR surplus, all things equal. Minor adjustments were
also made to the FY 2004-05 General Fund and cash fund forecasts in light of the
recent deceleration in national economic growth. Meanwhile, exceptionally low   
inflation in 2004 will result in a lower TABOR limit in FY 2005-06. The TABOR   
surplus in FY 2005-06 will thus increase.                                       

Governmental fund assets exceeded liabilities resulting in total fund     
balances of $3,441.1 million (prior year $3,195.6 million), of which, $2,349.3  
million (prior year $2,507.1 million) was reserved, and the balance of $1,091.8 
million (prior year $688.5 million) was unreserved. In total, governmental fund 
balances increased $245.5 million from the prior year primarily due to increases
in Other Special Revenue Funds and Other Governmental Funds. The unreserved     
undesignated fund balance of the General Fund was zero, at both June 30, 2005,  
and June 30, 2004, because there were not adequate net assets to meet the       
statutorily required reserve on the generally accepted basis of accounting.     
Enterprise Fund assets exceeded liabilities resulting in total net assets of    
$3,977.2 million (prior year $3,616.7 million), of which, $3,106.0 million      
(prior year $2,903.9 million) was restricted or invested in capital assets, and 
the balance of $871.2 million (prior year $712.8 million) was unrestricted. The 
total increase of $360.5 million in Enterprise Fund net assets primarily        
occurred in the Higher Education Institutions and Unemployment Insurance Funds. 

In Fiscal Year 2004-05, state revenues subject to TABOR were $8,483.0     
million, which was $41.1 million above the limit after the growth dividend and  
House Bill 05-1310 adjustments discussed above. The $41.1 million is reported as
a current liability on the fund-level General Fund Balance Sheet and the        
government-wide Statement of Net Assets; most of the refund will be paid out    
between January and May of 2006. Without the growth dividend and the House Bill 
05-1310 adjustments, the Fiscal Year 2004-05 refund would have been at least    
$352.8 million. At the beginning of Fiscal Year 2004-05 the University of       
Colorado, the Brand Board in the Department of Agriculture, and the Parking Fund
in the Department of Personnel & Administration all became fully qualified TABOR
enterprises. As fully qualified enterprises, the revenues of these activities   
are not subject to the TABOR revenue limits. As required by TABOR, the State    
Controller makes qualifications of enterprises neutral in the TABOR calculations
by removing the activities' revenues from the base upon which the TABOR limit is
calculated. In Fiscal Year 2004-05, the base was reduced by $384.0 million      
related to enterprise qualifications. Under the requirements of current law, the
Governor's Office of State Planning and Budgeting (OSPB) estimates refunds      
growing from $440.4 million in Fiscal Year 2005-06 to $838.8 million in Fiscal  
Year 2009-10. However, the legislature placed a referendum on the November 2005 
ballot allowing the state to retain the TABOR refund during those years. The    
voters approved the referendum, and although the Fiscal Year 2004-05 refund will
be distributed in Fiscal Year 2005-06, there will be no refunds made related to 
Fiscal Years 2005-06 through 2009-10.                                           

Debt Management. Under its constitution, the State of Colorado is not     
permitted to issue general obligation bonds secured by the full faith and credit
of the state. However, certain agencies and instrumentalities of the state are  
authorized to issue bonds secured by revenues from specific projects and        
activities. The state enters into certain lease transactions which are subject  
to annual renewal at the option of the state. In addition, the state is         
authorized to issue short-term revenue anticipation notes. Local governmental   
units in the state are also authorized to incur indebtedness. The major source  
of financing for such local government indebtedness is an ad valorem property   
tax. In addition, in order to finance public projects, local governments in the 
State can issue revenue bonds payable from the revenues of a utility or         
enterprise or from the proceeds of an excise tax, or assessment bonds payable   
from special assessments. Colorado local governments can also finance public    
projects through leases which are subject to annual appropriation at the option 
of the local government. Local governments in Colorado also issue tax           
anticipation notes. The Amendment requires prior voter approval for the creation
of any multiple fiscal year debt or other financial obligation whatsoever,      
except for refundings at a lower rate or obligations of an enterprise.          

The state has issued Certificates of Participation (COPs) secured by      
buildings and vehicles and revenue bonds that are secured by pledges of future  
revenues. In some instances the debt-financed asset generates the pledged       
revenue stream; in other instances, such as the TRANs, the pledged revenue      
stream is future federal revenues and state taxes. The state has other forms of 
borrowing that are small in relation to the revenue bonds and COPs. In Fiscal   
Year 2003-04, the total principal amount of revenue bonds and COPs was 38.9     
percent of net asset other than capital assets. In Fiscal Year 2004-05, that    
measure increased to 40.2 percent because debt principal increased more than did
noncapital net assets on a proportional basis. Total per capita debt including  
bonds, certificate of participation, mortgages, notes, and leases was $642 per  
person in Fiscal Year 2002-03, $781 per person in Fiscal Year 2003-04, and it   
rose to $904 per person in Fiscal Year 2004-05. Except for exempt enterprises,  
the TABOR amendment requires a vote of the people for the creation of any debt  
unless existing cash reserves are irrevocably pledged to service the debt. The  
amendment does allow debt issuance to refinance a borrowing at a lower interest 
rate. These requirements limit management's ability to address revenue          
shortfalls by borrowing for capital expenditures.                               

Risk Management. The state self-insures its agencies, officials, and      
employees against the risk of loss related to general liability, motor vehicle  
liability, and workers' compensation. Property claims are not self-insured, as  
the state has purchased insurance. The state uses the General Fund to account   
for the risk management function including operations and all current claims or 
judgments. Medical claims for officials and employees are managed through the   
Group Benefits Plan Fund, a Pension and Employee Benefits Trust Fund. The       
Regents of the University of Colorado are self-insured for workers'             
compensation, auto, general, and property liability. The Board of Governors of  
the Colorado State University System is self-insured for certain risks and      
participates in the state's risk management fund for other risks.               

  Local Issuances. It should be noted that the creditworthiness of obligations
issued by local Colorado issuers may be unrelated to the creditworthiness of    
obligations issued by the State of Colorado, and there is no obligation on the  
part of the State to make payment on such local obligations in the event of     
default.                                                                        

The foregoing information constitutes only a brief summary of some of the 
general factors which may impact certain issuers of bonds contained in the      
Colorado IM-IT and does not purport to be a complete or exhaustive description  
of all adverse conditions to which the issuers of such obligations are subject. 
Additionally, many factors including national economic, social and environmental
policies and conditions, which are not within the control of the issuers of such
bonds, could affect or could have an adverse impact on the financial condition  
of the State and various agencies and political subdivisions thereof. The       
Sponsor is unable to predict whether or to what extent such factors or other    
factors may affect the issuers of the bonds contained in the Colorado IM-IT, the
market value or marketability of such bonds or the ability of the respective    
issuers of such bonds acquired by the Colorado IM-IT to pay interest on or      
principal of such bonds.                                                        

The Colorado IM-IT is susceptible to political, economic or regulatory    
factors affecting issuers of Colorado municipal obligations (the "Colorado      
Municipal Obligations"). These include the possible adverse effects of certain  
Colorado constitutional amendments, legislative measures, voter initiatives and 
other matters that are described. The information provided above is only a brief
summary of the complex factors affecting the financial situation in Colorado and
is derived from sources that are generally available to investors and are       
believed to be accurate. No independent verification has been made of the       
accuracy or completeness of any of the following information. It is based in

or contained in Official Statements for various Colorado Municipal Obligations. 

Connecticut Risk Factors

Economic Condition and Outlook. After almost eight years of solid economic
growth, Connecticut began to experience payroll job losses in Fiscal Year 2001. 
In Fiscal Years 2001, 2002 and 2003 the state's payroll job losses totaled      
13,700, 10,300 and 19,100 respectively. Payroll employment for Connecticut was  
recorded at 1,653,000 jobs at the end of Fiscal Year 2003. The Fiscal Year 2003 
job loss represented a 1.1 percent decline in employment as compared to a 0.4   
percent job decline nationally during the same period. The first four months of 
Fiscal Year 2004 have been more promising with preliminary figures showing      
modest job growth.                                                              

Over the past ten years, Connecticut has experienced a shift in the       
industrial make-up of its workers with manufacturing jobs being replaced by     
service sector jobs. This is a trend that began several decades ago. In 1993,   
17.7 percent of Connecticut workers were employed in manufacturing. By 2003,    
this number stood at 12.5 percent. Conversely, service sector employment rose   
from 36.7 percent to 40.7 percent of the workforce during this period. The      
diversification of Connecticut's workforce has helped to mitigate the economic  
consequences of declines in specific industries such as defense. Despite these  
shifts, manufacturing continues to play an important role in Connecticut's      
economic life contributing approximately 16 percent of Gross State Product.     
Transportation equipment production (primarily aircraft engines and submarines) 
is the dominant manufacturing industry in Connecticut. The state also has a     
vibrant export sector with export growth of 11.3 percent in 2000 and 7 percent  
in 2001. Exports contribute just over 5 percent to Gross State product.         

Connecticut's unemployment rate was 4.9 percent at the end of Fiscal Year 
2003 compared to a national rate of 6.4 percent. After a slight rise at the     
beginning of Fiscal Year 2004, the state's unemployment rate dropped back to 4.9
percent in October 2003.                                                        

  One reason for the state's relatively low unemployment rate is stagnation in
its labor force growth. Between Fiscal Years 1993 and 2003, Connecticut's labor 
force actually declined slightly. Nationally during this period the labor force 
was growing at an annual average rate of 1.4 percent. Reversing the trend of a  
declining state labor force will prove important to Connecticut's long-term     
economic growth potential. A slight acceleration in the state's population      
growth has been observed since 1996. A continuation of this trend should also   
contribute to labor force growth.                                               

Connecticut continues to be a national leader in income measurements.     
Connecticut's 2002 per capita income of $42,829 was 38.9 percent above the      
national average. Connecticut's median household income of $53,347 was 26.3     
percent above the national average. Although Connecticut continues to hold its  
position as a high-income state, its comparative advantage over the rest of the 
country has declined through the first half of 2003. Through the first two      
quarters of 2003, Connecticut ranked 42nd in the country in personal income     
growth. It is projected that as Connecticut emerges from recession and job      
losses, its comparative income advantage will reemerge.                         

   Connecticut's housing market remained strong throughout the recent recession.
Historically low interest rates contributed to the strong real estate activity. 
Home sales advanced at double-digit growth rates and home prices in the greater 
Hartford-New Haven area increased by 14 percent through the first three quarters
of 2003 as compared to the same period a year earlier.                          

 Preliminary estimates point toward a growing national economy as 2003 ends.
This bodes well for Connecticut's economic future. In the third quarter of 2003,
preliminary estimates show Gross Domestic Product growth of 8.2 percent.        

MAJOR GOVERNMENT INITIATIVES                                              
Technology Initiative                                                     

In July 2003, the state implemented the first phase of a new fully        
integrated, Internet based financial management and human resources system      
called Core-CT. The system provides a single point of entry for all state       
financial, human resources and payroll data. Core-CT contains central and agency
accounting, purchasing, accounts payable, assets, inventory, payroll, time and  
attendance, worker's compensation, personnel and other business systems. The    
human resources/ payroll component of Core-CT came on-line in October 2003.     

The implementation of Core-CT is the product of several years of work to  
improve the state's financial reporting and management information systems. This
work is continuing with the development of additional system modules. Core-CT   
will ultimately allow the state to gather more detailed financial and personnel 
data than had been available in the past, and to better analyze the             
effectiveness and efficiency of governmental programs. Over the next decade it  
is anticipated that Core-CT will help the state to improve its delivery of      
services to the people of Connecticut and to reduce program costs through       
efficiencies.                                                                   

  From an information technology perspective, Core-CT has allowed the state to
standardize and modernize its computer technology bringing uniformity to the    
computers, programming languages, and data base packages utilized by state      
government. Core-CT utilizes PeopleSoft ERP software.                           

Tax Policy Initiatives                                                    

  By the beginning of Fiscal Year 2003, it was clear that the state was facing
its second straight year of a significant General Fund deficit. Estimates during
the first half of the fiscal year indicated that the deficit was in excess of   
half a billion dollars and growing. In February 2003, a deficit mitigation plan 
was enacted (Public Act 03-2). This plan raised General Fund revenue by an      
estimated $439.8 million in Fiscal Year 2003 as detailed below.                 

  o    The personal income tax rate on the upper income bracket was raised
         from 4.5 percent to 5 percent for an estimated revenue gain of $207.4
million.                                                    

     o    The sales and use tax base was expanded to include items such as media
   services, advertising, health clubs and magazines, adding $10.4
million in revenue.                                         

     o    The cigarette tax rate increased 40 cents to $1.51 per pack, which was
estimated to raise $27.5 million in additional revenue.     

  o    A surcharge of 20 percent was imposed on the corporation tax with a
   projected revenue gain of $32.4 million. Various other one-time
          revenue enhancements were implemented to add an additional $70 million
to General Fund revenue in Fiscal Year 2003.                

Downsizing the State's Workforce                                          

 In response to growing Fiscal Year 2003 General Fund deficit estimates, the
Governor and legislature took action to reduce state spending. A major part of  
the spending reduction plan included downsizing the state's workforce.          

Beginning in December 2002, the Governor laid off 1,886 General Fund      
employees for estimated savings in Fiscal Year 2003 of $9.2 million. These      
layoffs were in lieu of other state employee union concessions that were        
rejected by the Governor.                                                       

To achieve additional personnel savings, the legislature included an early
retirement incentive program in its February deficit mitigation act. The program
was intended to create $36.9 million in Fiscal Year 2003 savings. Over 4,500    
employees took advantage of the program.                                        

The deficit mitigation plan contained an additional $129.4 million in     
programmatic savings. Approximately half of this savings target was realized.   

BUDGETARY AND OTHER CONTROL SYSTEMS                                       

In November 1992, electors approved an amendment to the State Constitution
providing that the amount of general budget expenditures authorized for any     
fiscal year shall not exceed the estimated amount of revenue for such fiscal    
year. This amendment also provided a framework for placing a cap on budgeted    
appropriations. Annual budgeted appropriations are capped at a percentage       
increase that is based on either the five-year average annual growth in the     
state's personal income or inflation, whichever is higher. Debt service         
payments, certain statutory grants to distressed municipalities, and            
appropriations required by federal mandate or court order are excluded from the 
limits of the cap. The spending cap can be lifted if the Governor declares the  
existence of extraordinary circumstances and the General Assembly by a          
three-fifths vote approves appropriations in excess of the cap.                 

   Budget control is maintained at the individual appropriation account level by
agency as established in authorized appropriation bills. The allotment process  
exercises control over obligations or commitments. The Governor, through his    
budget office, allots funds for both budgeted and non-budgeted accounts and     
funds. The Governor is permitted to modify appropriations through the allotment 
process under certain circumstances and within percentage limitations specified 
by the General Assembly.                                                        

Elected officials, agency commissioners, directors of public benefit      
corporations and agency managers are responsible for establishing internal      
control structures. Good internal control systems ensure that: resource use is  
consistent with laws, regulations and polices; resources are safeguarded against
waste, loss and misuse; and reliable data are obtained, maintained and fairly   
disclosed in reports. The Office of the State Comptroller has worked to improve 
the overall internal control environment in state government. This work has     
included improvements to the central state accounting system that advance       
internal control efforts.                                                       

CASH MANAGEMENT                                                           

The State Treasurer continually monitors cash flow to maximize the        
utilization of cash resources. During the year, temporary balances are invested 
in the state's short-term investment fund. This fund is a money market          
investment pool with investments consisting of certificates of deposit, bankers'
acceptances, commercial paper, repurchase agreements, federal agency securities,
and other investments with various ranges of maturities. The investment income  
and average yield rate for Fiscal Year 2003 for this fund was approximately $60 
million and 1.64 percent respectively.                                          

  Bank balances at June 30, 2003 were $177.1 million of which about 67 percent
was insured or protected by collateral.                                         

DEBT MANAGEMENT                                                           

   The State's primary method for financing capital projects is through the sale
of general obligation bonds. These bonds are backed by the full faith and credit
of the State. As of November 1, 2002, the State had authorized direct general   
obligation bond indebtedness totaling $16,468,814,000, of which $15,102,913,000 
had been approved for issuance by the State Bond Commission and $13,430,976,000 
had been issued. As of November 1, 2002, net State direct general obligation    
bond indebtedness outstanding was $8,973,711,000. In addition, the State has    
limited or contingent liability on a significant amount of other bonds. Such    
bonds have been issued by the following quasi-public agencies: the Connecticut  
Housing Finance Authority, the Connecticut Development Authority, the           
Connecticut Higher Education Supplemental Loan Authority, the Connecticut       
Resources Recovery Authority and the Connecticut Health and Educational         
Facilities Authority. Such bonds have also been issued by the City of Waterbury 
and the Southeastern Connecticut Water Authority. As of November 1, 2002, the   
amount of bonds outstanding on which the State has limited or contingent        
liability totaled $4,066,600,000.                                               

The State is obligated to various cities and towns under grant programs to
fund certain school construction costs. As of June 30, 2002, the State's        
outstanding obligation was $1,124,000,000, and the Commissioner of Education    
estimated that future additional grant obligations might total $2,800,000,000.  

  General obligation bonds issued by municipalities are payable primarily from
ad valorem taxes on property located in the municipality. A municipality's      
property tax base is subject to many factors outside the control of the         
municipality, including the decline in Connecticut's manufacturing industry.    
Certain Connecticut municipalities have experienced severe fiscal difficulties  
and have reported operating and accumulated deficits. The most notable of these 
is the City of Bridgeport, which filed a bankruptcy petition on June 7, 1991.   
The State opposed the petition. The United States Bankruptcy Court for the      
District of Connecticut held that Bridgeport had authority to file such a       
petition but that its petition should be dismissed on the grounds that          
Bridgeport was not insolvent when the petition was filed. State legislation     
enacted in 1993 prohibits municipal bankruptcy filings without the prior written
consent of the Governor.                                                        

 In addition to general obligation bonds backed by the full faith and credit
of the municipality, certain municipal authorities finance projects by issuing  
bonds that are not considered to be debts of the municipality. Such bonds may be
repaid only from revenues of the financed project, the revenues from which may  
be insufficient to service the related debt obligations.                        

  The State's general obligation bonds are rated Aa3 by Moody's and AA by both
Standard & Poor's and Fitch. As of August 22, 2002, Moody's and Standard &      
Poor's had each revised its credit outlook on such bonds from "stable" to       
"negative."                                                                     

Regional economic difficulties, reductions in revenues, and increases in  
expenses could lead to further fiscal problems for the State, its political     
subdivisions, and its or their authorities and agencies. Such problems could    
result in declines, possibly severe, in the value of their outstanding          
obligations, increases in their future borrowing costs, and impairment of their 
ability to pay debt service on their obligations.                               

LITIGATION                                                                

The State, its officers and its employees are defendants in numerous      
lawsuits. Although it is not possible to determine the outcome of these         
lawsuits, the State's Attorney General has opined that an adverse decision in   
any of the following cases might have a significant impact on the State's       
financial position: (i) an action involving claims by property owners in one of 
the poorest towns in a regional school district asserting that the statutory    
formula for cost allocation among towns in such a district denies the plaintiffs
equal protection because it requires all towns in the district to pay the same  
per-pupil charge, seeking to enjoin use of the statutorily mandated system and  
to require that a formula more favorable to the plaintiffs be devised; (ii)     
litigation involving claims by Indian tribes and alleged Indian tribes to       
portions of the State's land area; (iii) an action by certain students and      
municipalities claiming that the State's formula for financing public education 
violates the State's constitution and seeking a declaratory judgment and        
injunctive relief; (iv) an action seeking to represent a class of certain       
Medicaid recipients, claiming that the Commissioner of the Department of Social 
Services fails to provide them adequate access to dental services and to        
adequately compensate providers of such services, and seeking declaratory and   
injunctive relief plus attorneys' fees and costs; (v) actions by several        
hospitals claiming partial refunds of taxes imposed on hospital gross earnings  
to the extent such taxes related to tangible personal property transferred in   
the provision of services to patients; (vi) an action against the State and its 
Attorney General by importers and distributors of cigarettes previously sold by 
their manufacturers seeking damages and injunctive relief relating to business  
losses alleged to result from the 1998 Master Settlement Agreement entered into 
by most states in litigation against the major domestic tobacco companies and   
challenging certain related so-called Non Participating Manufacturer statutes;  
(vii) an action seeking to represent a class of juveniles, claiming that the    
policy of strip searching all juveniles arriving at State detention centers is  
unconstitutional, and seeking damages, declaratory and injunctive relief,       
attorneys' fees, and costs; (viii) an action seeking to represent a class of    
adults, challenging the policy or practice of strip searching all adult inmates 
arriving at correctional centers, whether or not there is a reasonable suspicion
of the presence of weapons or contraband, and seeking damages, declaratory and  
injunctive relief, attorneys' fees, and costs; (ix) a class action alleging that
the Department of Mental Retardation violates federal laws by maintaining a     
waiting list for Medicaid services of Medicaid-eligible persons and by placing  
persons in quasi-institutional settings without allowing them to choose more    
integrated community settings, and seeking mandatory injunctive relief,         
attorneys' fees, and costs; (x) two sales and use tax refund cases involving    
claims of exemption for purchases by aircraft manufacturers of certain property 
used by them in conducting certain research and development activities; (xi) a  
purported class action on behalf of approximately 30,000 people, claiming that  
the Commissioner of the Department of Social Services has violated federal law  
by implementing a State statute reducing eligibility for Medicaid benefits to   
individuals with incomes of up to 100% of the federal poverty level, from       
incomes up to 150% of the federal poverty level, and seeking a continuation of  
benefits for a longer period of time than the State statute provides; and (xii) 
a purported class-action on behalf of laid-off State employees, alleging that   
they were laid off in violation of their constitutional rights and claiming back
wages, damages, attorneys fees, and costs.                                      

  As a result of litigation on behalf of black and Hispanic school children in
the City of Hartford seeking "integrated education" within the Greater Hartford 
metropolitan area, on July 9, 1996, the State Supreme Court directed the        
legislature to develop appropriate measures to remedy the racial and ethnic     
segregation in the Hartford public schools. On December 28, 2000, the plaintiffs
filed a motion seeking to have the Superior Court monitor the State's compliance
with the 1996 Supreme Court decision. A hearing was held in April 2002, and the 
case was settled early in 2003. Under the settlement agreement, the State will  
be required to open two new magnet schools in the Hartford area in each of the  
next four years and to substantially increase the voluntary inter-district      
busing program in that area. The anticipated cost of compliance over the        
four-year period is $45,000,000.                                                

Ratings. As of September 2006, all outstanding general obligation bonds of
the State of Connecticut are rated AA by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services and 
Aa3 by Moody's Investor's Service, Inc. Any explanation concerning the          
significance of such ratings must be obtained from the rating agencies. There is
no assurance that any ratings will continue for any period of time or that they 
will not be revised or withdrawn.                                               

  Local Issuances. It should be noted that the creditworthiness of obligations
issued by local Connecticut issuers may be unrelated to the creditworthiness of 
obligations issued by the State of Connecticut, and there is no obligation on   
the part of the State to make payment on such local obligations in the event of 
default.                                                                        

The foregoing information constitutes only a brief summary of some of the 
general factors which may impact certain issuers of bonds contained in the      
Connecticut IM-IT and does not purport to be a complete or exhaustive           
description of all adverse conditions to which the issuers of such obligations  
are subject. Additionally, many factors including national economic, social and 
environmental policies and conditions, which are not within the control of the  
issuers of such bonds, could affect or could have an adverse impact on the      
financial condition of the State and various agencies and political subdivisions
thereof. The Sponsor is unable to predict whether or to what extent such factors
or other factors may affect the issuers of the bonds contained in the           
Connecticut IM-IT, the market value or marketability of such bonds or the       
ability of the respective issuers of such bonds acquired by the Connecticut     
IM-IT to pay interest on or principal of such bonds.                            

The Connecticut IM-IT is susceptible to political, economic or regulatory 
factors affecting issuers of Connecticut municipal obligations (the "Connecticut
Municipal Obligations"). These include the possible adverse effects of certain  
Connecticut constitutional amendments, legislative measures, voter initiatives  
and other matters that are described. The information provided above is only a  
brief summary of the complex factors affecting the financial situation in       
Connecticut and is derived from sources that are generally available to         
investors and are believed to be accurate. No independent verification has been 
made of the accuracy or completeness of any of the following information. It is 
based in part on information obtained from various State and local agencies in  
Connecticut or contained in Official Statements for various Connecticut         
Municipal Obligations.                                                          

Florida Risk Factors

Economic Outlook. Florida's economic growth accelerated in fiscal year    
2004-05 and generally outperformed the domestic economy as a whole. This        
performance may be attributed to favorable natural, economic, and tax           
environments, and increasing demand for goods and services fueled by a growing  
population. Florida remains top ranked in the nation in total job growth and    
generated the fastest job growth rate among the ten most populous states.       
Florida's non-farm employment grew 3.5 percent in fiscal year 2004-05, adding   
254,900 jobs. Increases in jobs were led by gains in professional and business  
services, construction, educational and health services, leisure and            
hospitality, wholesale and retail trade, financial services, and government.    
Forty-two percent of the job increase in fiscal year 2004-05 came from          
professional and business services, and education and health services. With the 
strengthening economy, non-farm employment is anticipated to add 274,900 jobs in
fiscal year 2005-06, resulting in a 7.6 percent increase in wages and salaries. 
The unemployment rate is anticipated to decline from 4.4 percent in fiscal year 
2004-05 to 3.7 percent in fiscal year 2005-06.                                  

Population growth (2.3 percent in fiscal year 2004-05) continues to be a  
major driver of economic activity in Florida. The State's population is expected
to grow by 404,000 in fiscal year 2005-06. Over the next ten years, population  
is estimated to increase by 3.9 million. The projected growth in population will
continue to fuel the State's economic expansion as the demand for housing,      
durable and non-durable goods and other services continues to increase.         

In 2004, Florida was hit by four major hurricanes bringing destruction to 
thousands of homes and businesses. In 2005, the State was affected by another   
four hurricanes: Dennis, Katrina, Rita, and Wilma. Reconstruction activities    
that began in 2004 were extended in 2005. New home construction increased       
significantly in fiscal year 2004-05, adding 266,500 homes. Construction is     
expected to continue to increase due to reconstruction and population growth.   
Billions of federal, state, and insurance claim dollars have flowed into        
Florida's economy for reconstruction. Total construction employment added 38,000
jobs in fiscal year 2004-05 and is expected to create 34,700 jobs in fiscal year
2005-06.                                                                        

Florida's economy has continued to show strength and resilience even after
the hurricane damage. It has steadily expanded at a higher than expected rate,  
as evidenced by the strength of its labor market and the rise in personal       
incomes. Long-term growth is projected to be higher than previously anticipated 
as Florida's economic fundamentals remain strong and should provide stimulus for
sustained future growth.                                                        

Revenues and Expenditures. Governmental funds include general, special    
revenue, capital projects and debt service funds. Revenues are recognized when  
they are both measurable and available to finance current expenditures. Total   
revenues and total expenditures at the end of the 2004-05 fiscal year (June 30,
2005) were approximately $57.3 billion and $54.5 billion, respectively. The     
total fund balance at June 30, 2005, for governmental funds was $16.9 billion.  

   Debt Management. Florida's Constitution and statutes require that Florida not
run a deficit in its budget as a whole, or in any separate fund within its      
budget. Rather, its budget and funds must be kept in balance from currently     
available revenues each fiscal year. If the Governor or Comptroller believes a  
deficit will occur in any fund, by statute, he must certify his opinion to the  
Administrative Commission, which then is authorized to reduce all Florida agency
budgets and releases by a sufficient amount to prevent a deficit in any fund.   
Additionally, the Florida Constitution prohibits Florida from borrowing by      
issuing bonds to fund its operations.                                           

 Section 11 of Article VII of the State Constitution authorizes the State to
issue general obligation bonds and revenues bonds to finance or refinance the   
cost of state fixed capital outlay projects authorized by law. General          
obligation bonds are secured by the full faith and credit of the State and      
payable from the proceeds of various taxes. Revenue bonds are payable from funds
that receive legally restricted revenues. The Division of Bond Finance of the   
State Board of Administration has the responsibility to issue all state bonds.  
Florida's outstanding general obligation bonds at June 30, 2005, totaled        
approximately $19 billion and were issued to finance such capital outlays as    
educational projects of local school districts, community colleges and state    
universities, environmental protection and highway construction.                

 Litigation. Currently under litigation are several issues relating to state
actions or state taxes that put at risk a portion of General Revenue Fund       
monies. There is no assurance that any of such matters, individually or in the  
aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on the state's financial     
position. Florida's 1997 tobacco settlement is expected to total approximately  
$13 billion over the initial 25-year period. As of June 30, 2005, the state has 
received approximately $4.6 billion from the settlement. The settlement         
anticipates that the state will use the funds for children's health care        
coverage and other health-related services.                                     

Ratings. As of September 2006, all outstanding general obligation bonds of
the State of Florida are rated AAA by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services and Aa1
by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. Any explanation concerning the significance  
of such ratings must be obtained from the rating agencies. There is no assurance
that any ratings will continue for any period of time or that they will not be  
revised or withdrawn.                                                           

  Local Issuances. It should be noted that the creditworthiness of obligations
issued by local Florida issuers may be unrelated to the creditworthiness of     
obligations issued by the State of Florida, and there is no obligation on the   
part of the State to make payment on such local obligations in the event of     
default.

Sponsor is unable to predict whether or to what extent such factors or other    
factors may affect the issuers of the bonds contained in the Florida IM-IT, the 
market value or marketability of such bonds or the ability of the respective    
issuers of such bonds acquired by the Florida IM-IT to pay interest on or       
principal of such bonds.                                                        

   The Florida IM-IT is susceptible to political, economic or regulatory factors
affecting issuers of Florida municipal obligations (the "Florida Municipal      
Obligations"). These include the possible adverse effects of certain Florida    
constitutional amendments, legislative measures, voter initiatives and other    
matters that are described. The information provided above is only a brief

Georgia Risk Factors

Economic Condition and Outlook. Georgia's economy in fiscal year 2005     
continued its growth cycle following the recession of 2001. The three sources of
tax revenue most closely tied to economic conditions, personal income tax,      
corporate income tax and sales income tax, all experienced healthy growth in    
fiscal year 2005. Compared to fiscal year 2004, personal income tax grew 6.6%,  
corporate income tax grew approximately 50%, and sales tax grew 7.3%. This      
growth in tax revenue indicates solid growth in the underlying Georgia economy. 

Employment measures for Georgia have been giving mixed signals. Non-farm  
employment, which is measured based on a survey of establishments has been slow.
Total non-farm employment grew at about 0.5% in fiscal year 2005. This slow     
growth was primarily due to significant decreases in employment in retail trade 
and manufacturing. Decreases in payrolls in these two sectors cut employment    
growth nearly in half. Sectors in which job growth was strong include wholesale 
trade, financial services, business and professional services, education and    
health, leisure and hospitality and government.                                 

In contrast to the employment survey, the household survey indicates      
substantially strong growth in the level of employment in Georgia. The household
survey indicates that 58,000 jobs were added in fiscal year 2005, an increase of
about 1.4%. This is more than double the level indicated by the employment      
survey. A final timely economic indicator for Georgia is total personal income. 
In fiscal year 2005, Georgia personal income grew at 6.8%. In comparison,       
personal income for the U.S. grew 6.5%.                                         

   The outlook for Georgia's economy in fiscal year 2006 is clouded by run-up in
energy prices caused by hurricanes in the energy producing Gulf of Mexico. The  
initial quarter of fiscal year 2006 saw tax revenue growth of over 9% and       
non-farm employment growth of about 26,000 jobs. In addition, the bankruptcy    
proceeding of a major employer, Delta Air Lines, is likely to be a drag on      
growth. Despite these concerns, the overall outlook remains generally positive. 
State revenues are projected to grow at about 6.1%.                             

 The assets of the State exceeded its liabilities at the close of the fiscal
year by $20.6 billion (reported as "net assets"). Of this amount, $1.7 billion  
(reported as "unrestricted net assets") may be used to meet the State's ongoing 
obligations to citizens and creditors. Component units of the State reported net
assets of $4.3 billion for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005. The State's     
total net assets (including restatement of the prior year balance) decreased by 
$135 million.                                                                   

 Governmental Funds. As of the close of the current fiscal year, the State's
governmental funds reported a combined ending fund balance of $4.6 billion, with
$725 million of this total available for spending at the government's discretion
(unreserved fund balance).                                                      

Proprietary Funds. Net assets at the end of fiscal year 2005 totaled $7.4 
billion. Total net assets for the Enterprise Funds (including restatement of the
prior year balance) increased by $307 million during the fiscal year; Internal  
Service Funds decreased by $12 million.                                         

  Major Initiatives. The state was impacted by the high cost of fuel resulting
from the impact of hurricane Katrina. Through an executive order, approved by   
the legislature, the Governor suspended tax collections on motor fuel sales for 
the month of September 2005. An executive order in December 2005 reduced sales  
tax on natural gas during the peak heating months of January through April 2006 
and reduced the sales tax on liquid propane from January through March 2006.    
This order will provide tax savings to consumers ranging from $16 to $20 million
and prevents the state from reaping a revenue windfall from the high costs of   
these fuels.                                                                    

  With an improvement in economy and increases in tax revenues in the last two
years, funding for education has been enhanced to improve the quality of        
education and also to address growth of approximately 2.5 percent per year.     

  Increased health care costs related to Medicaid and employee health benefits
continue to place strains on the State's budget. The state is implementing a    
managed care plan for Medicaid and Peach Care as well as other initiatives to   
control costs.                                                                  

 Debt Administration. The Georgia State Financing and Investment Commission,
an agency of the State, is empowered by law to receive the proceeds from the    
issuance of State of Georgia general obligation and guaranteed revenue debt from
the State, to provide the means for the proper application of the proceeds of   
such debt, and to establish the procedure for protecting the holders of such    
debt. Under the Constitution of the State of Georgia, the highest aggregate     
annual debt service (principal and interest) for all outstanding general        
obligation and guaranteed revenue debt may not exceed 10% of the previous fiscal
year's revenue collections. The highest total annual commitments at June 30,
2005, were 6.01% of the 2005 revenue collections. At June 30, 2005, outstanding 
general obligation debt issues of the State of Georgia totaled $6,183,865,000   
and outstanding guaranteed revenue bonds issued by certain discretely presented 
component units were $745,173,466. Subsequent to June 30, 2005, the State issued
an additional $610,715,000 of general obligation debt and $425,000,000 of       
general obligation refunding debt. The State of Georgia's total long-term       
liabilities decreased by $77 million (1.0 percent) during the current fiscal    
year. The key factors contributing to this change are a net decrease of $274    
million in general obligation bonds due to maturities offset by a net increase  
of $199 million in capital lease obligations. The increase in capital lease     
obligations was primarily in the Higher Education Fund.                         

  Cash Management. The State's investment policy is to maximize the protection
of State funds on deposit while accruing an advantageous yield of interest by   
investing the funds in excess of those required for current operating expenses. 
Cash is managed in pooled funds to maximize interest earnings. Types of         
investments are dictated by legislation and are reviewed quarterly. The State   
Depository Board is designated by State law as the oversight Board for Georgia's
cash management and investment policies. The Office of Treasury and Fiscal      
Services ("OTFS") acts as the administrative agent of the Board. OTFS invests   
temporarily idle cash in statewide investment pools. All such funds are invested
considering first the probable safety of capital and then probable income, while
meeting daily cash flow requirements and conforming to all statutes governing   
the investment of public funds.                                                 

Risk Management. The state is self-insured against certain property and   
liability claims, including workers' compensation and unemployment compensation.
The Risk Management Funds accumulate reserves for certain property and liability
risks and pay for commercial insurance coverage. Revenues are generated from    
premiums charged to state and local government organizations. Various risk      
control techniques are utilized to minimize accident-related losses; risk       
managers also identify unique loss exposures and develop strategies to reduce   
the cost of risk associated with individual business operations.                

Ratings. As of September 2006, all outstanding general obligation bonds of
the State of Georgia are rated AAA by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services and Aaa
by Moody's Investor's Service, Inc. Any explanation concerning the significance 
of such ratings must be obtained from the rating agencies. There is no assurance
that any ratings will continue for any period of time or that they will not be  
revised or withdrawn.                                                           

  Local Issuances. It should be noted that the creditworthiness of obligations
issued by local Georgia issuers may be unrelated to the creditworthiness of     
obligations issued by the State of Georgia, and there is no obligation on the   
part of the State to make payment on such local obligations in the event of     
default.                                                                        

The foregoing information constitutes only a brief summary of some of the 
general factors which may impact certain issuers of bonds contained in the      
Georgia IM-IT and does not purport to be a complete or exhaustive description of
all adverse conditions to which the issuers of such obligations are subject.    
Additionally, many factors including national economic, social and environmental
policies and conditions, which are not within the control of the issuers of such
bonds, could affect or could have an adverse impact on the financial condition  
of the State and various agencies and political subdivisions thereof. The

 Kansas Risk Factors

State Profile. The State government is comprised of three branches: the   
Executive Branch, with the Governor as chief executive; the Legislative Branch, 
consisting of a Senate of 40 members and a House of Representatives of 125      
members; and the Judicial Branch, which includes the Supreme Court, the Appeals 
Court and the District Trial Courts. The State provides a full range of services
including education, safety, social services, recreation and transportation. The
annual budget serves as the foundation of the State's financial planning and    
control. On or before October 1, agencies are required to submit annually or    
biennially budget estimates for the next fiscal year to the Division of Budget. 
These estimates are used in preparing the Governor's budget report. On or before
the eighth calendar day of each regular legislative session, the Governor is    
required to submit the budget report to the Legislature. However in the case of 
the regular legislative session immediately following the election of a governor
who was elected to the Office of Governor for the first time, that governor must
submit the budget report to the Legislature on or before the 21st calendar day  
of that regular session.                                                        

 Economic Factors and Next Year's Budgets and Rates. According to the Kansas
Department of Human Resources Kansas Labor Market Information News Release for  
July 2005, employment for nonfarm jobs in the State of Kansas for June 2005 is  
improving. Compared to June 2004, employment increased by 16,100 jobs for a     
total of 1.4 million nonfarm jobs. Kansas has had 12 consecutive months of      
over-the-year job growth. The unemployment rate was 5.3 percent for June 2005,  
compared to 5.8 percent in June 2004.                                           

Net assets increased by $583 million or 6.2%. Approximately 57.2% of the  
total revenue came from taxes, while 28.6% resulted from grants and             
contributions (including federal aid). Charges for various goods and services   
provided 11.0% of the total revenues. Expenses cover a range of services. The   
largest expenses of total expenses were for education (34.9%), human resources  
(32.1%), and general government (12.5%).                                        

The combined net assets of the State (government and business-type        
activities) totaled $10.1 billion at the end of 2005, compared to $9.5 billion  
at the end of the previous year, and increase of 6.2%. The largest portion of   
net assets reflects investment in capital assets such as land, buildings,       
equipment, and infrastructure (roads, bridges, and other immovable assets), less
any related debt used to acquire those assets that are still outstanding. The   
State uses these capital assets to provide services to citizens; consequently,  
these assets are not available for future spending. Although investment in its  
capital assets is reported net of related debt, it should be noted that the     
resources needed to repay this debt must be provided from other sources, since  
the capital assets themselves cannot be used to liquidate these liabilities.    

Financial Highlights. The assets of the State exceeded its liabilities at 
fiscal year ending June 30, 2005 by $10.1 billion (presented as "net assets").  
Of this amount, $0.8 billion was reported as unrestricted net assets, which     
represents the amount available to be used to meet ongoing obligations to       
citizens and creditors.                                                         

Fund Highlights. For fiscal year 2005, the governmental funds reported a  
combined ending fund balance of $1,086 million, a increase of $98 million in    
comparison with the prior year. Of the total amount, $774 million represents the
fund balance of the Transportation Fund. There is ($202) million in the         
"unreserved fund balances" with all being in the Transportation Fund and        
Transportation-Capital Project Fund. The reserved balances of $1,288 million    
include the reserve for advances to other funds of $205 million and the reserve 
for encumbrances of $990 million.                                               

   Differences existed between the original budget and the final budget. Revenue
estimates were raised by approximately $55 million and expenditure estimates    
were raised by approximately $26 million. The original estimates provided for an
excess of revenues over expenditures of a negative $72 million. The final budget
provided for an excess of a negative $43 million of revenues over expenditures. 
Subsequently, fiscal year 2005 was closed with an excess of revenues over       
expenditures of $151 million.                                                   

Revenues and Expenditures. During 1990, the Kansas legislature enacted    
legislation-establishing minimum ending balances for the State General Fund to  
ensure financial solvency for the state. The act established targeted year-end  
State General Fund balances as a percentage of state expenditures for the       
forthcoming fiscal year. This act was phased in over several years and currently
requires an ending balance of at least 7.5% of expenditures and demand          
transfers.                                                                      

  Estimates for the State General Fund are developed using a consensus revenue
estimate approach. Pursuant to K.S.A. 75-6701, on or before each December 4 or  
each April 4, the Director of the Budget and the Director of the Legislative    
Research Department shall prepare a joint estimate of revenue to the State      
General Fund for the current and the ensuing fiscal year. If legislation is     
passed affecting State General Fund revenue, the two directors prepare a joint  
estimate of such revenue. If the two directors are unable to agree on the joint 
estimates, the Legislature must use the estimate of the Director of Legislative 
Research and the Governor must use the estimate of the Director of the Budget.  
(To date, the two directors have successfully reached agreement on these revenue
estimates.)                                                                     

The focus of the State's governmental funds is to provide information on  
near-term inflows, outflows, and balances of expendable resources. In           
particular, unreserved fund balance may serve as a useful measure of a          
government's net resources available for spending at the end of the fiscal year.
For fiscal year 2005, the governmental funds reported a combined ending fund    
balance of $1,086 million, an increase of $98 million in comparison with the    
prior year. Part of this fund balance is reserved to indicate that it is not    
available for new spending because it has already been committed to liquidate   
contracts and purchase orders of the prior fiscal year in the amount of $990    
million and for advances in the amount of $205 million.                         

  The General Fund is the chief operating fund of the State. At the end of the
current fiscal year, unreserved fund balance of the General Fund was a $297     
million, while the total fund balance reached $312 million. As a measure of     
liquidity of the General Fund, it may be useful to compare both unreserved fund 
balance and total fund balance to total fund expenditures. Unreserved fund      
balance represents 5.4 percent of total General Fund expenditures, while total  
fund balance represents 5.7 percent of that same amount. The fund balance in the
General Fund increased by $179 million during the current fiscal year.          

State investment in capital assets for its governmental and business-type 
activities as of June 30, 2005, amounts to $10.7 billion. This investment in    
capital assets includes land, buildings, improvements, equipment, infrastructure
and construction in progress. Infrastructure assets are items that are normally 
immovable and of value only to the State, such as roads and bridges.            

The Kansas Department of Transportation used the modified approach for    
valuing their infrastructure. The roadways' conditions are assessed using a     
pavement management system. The bridges' conditions are assessed using the      
Pontis Bridge Management System. The conditions for the roadways and the bridges
exceeded the Department's policy for minimum condition levels.                  

 The total increase in the investment in capital assets for its governmental
and business-type activities for the current fiscal year was about 5.2 percent  
in terms of net book value. The majority of capital asset expenditures were used
to construct or reconstruct roads and bridges. Depreciation charges for the year
totaled $53 million.                                                            

Cash Management. On a daily basis, the State monitors receipts to, and    
expenditures out of, the State Treasury. It also employs cash flow tools and    
techniques that maximize revenues without incurring undue risk. The State       
invests idle funds to match anticipated cash flow needs by using government     
securities, collateralized bank deposits, and high grade commercial paper to    
provide safety, liquidity, and yield, in that order. As a cash flow management  
policy, the State seeks to avoid borrowing from its own idle funds to meet      
expenditure obligations of the State General Fund.                              

Debt Management. The State of Kansas finances a portion of its capital    
expenditures with various debt instruments. Revenue bonds and loans from the    
Pooled Money Investment Board finance most debt-financed capital improvements   
for buildings, while "master lease" and "third-party" financing pays for most   
capital equipment. The State of Kansas does not have the statutory authority to 
issue general obligation bonds. The Legislature has authorized the issuance of  
specific purpose revenue bonds and other forms of long-term obligations. KDFA is
a public body politic and corporate, constituting an independent instrumentality
of the State of Kansas. It was created to enhance the ability of the State to   
finance capital improvements and improve access to long-term financing for State
agencies, political subdivisions, public and private organizations, and         
businesses. The total long-term bond debt obligations increased by $365 million 
during the current fiscal year. The key factor in this increase was the issuance
of $200 million for Highway Bonds, KDOT Series 2004 B, and $176 million in      
Public Water Supply Revolving Loan Fund Bonds, KDFA Series 2004 1 & 2, less $82 
million for various Bonds refunded by Series 2004 1 & 2.                        

The State's total long-term debt obligation showed a net increase of $477 
million (13.3%) during the current year. This increase was primarily due to the 
increase of $365 million in revenue bonds, $12 million in STAR bonds and $102   
million in other long-term obligations.                                         

   Ratings. The state of Kansas has no general obligation debt rating because it
issues no general obligations debt by Constitutional law; however, as of        
September 2006, Standard and Poor's and Moody's Investors Services, Inc.        
assigned an issuer credit rating of AA+ and Aaa respectively, to the state of   
Kansas. There can be no assurances that such ratings will be maintained in the  
future. It should be noted that the creditworthiness of obligations issued by   
local Kansas issuers may be unrelated to the creditworthiness of obligations    
issued by the state of Kansas, and there is no obligation on the part of the    
state to make payment on such local obligations in the event of default.        

   Litigation. The State is a defendant in numerous legal proceedings pertaining
to matters incidental to the performance of routine governmental operations.    
Such litigation includes, but is not limited to, claims asserted against the    
State arising from alleged torts, alleged breaches of contracts, condemnation   
proceedings and other alleged violations of State and Federal laws. Known       
claims, asserted and unasserted, have been evaluated for the likelihood of an   
unfavorable outcome. After review, it is the State's opinion, according to the  
State's financial report, that its ultimate liability in these cases, if any, is
not expected to have a material adverse effect on the State's financial         
position.                                                                       

Risk Management. The State maintains a combination of commercial insurance
and self -insurance to cover the risk of losses to which it may be exposed. This
is accomplished through risk management and various outside entity commercial   
insurance providers. It is the policy of the State to cover the risk of certain 
losses to which it may be exposed through risk management activities. In        
general, the State is self-insured for certain health care claims (prescription 
drug and dental plus three of eight medical health plan options), State employee
workers' compensation, long-term disability, tort liability, personal property, 
and real estate property losses up to $500,000 (except where separate coverage  
is required by bond covenant). The State has commercial vehicle liability       
coverage on all vehicles, and a statewide commercial policy on real property    
valued at $500,000 or more (except where separate coverage is required by bond  
covenant). Insurance settlements have not exceeded insurance coverage for the   
past three fiscal years. Risk is managed by positively addressing various       
benefits and liabilities through review, legislation and administration to      
assure that claims are promptly and correctly adjudicated and that appropriate  
and fair benefits and liabilities are reflected in the statutes and regulations.
Where cost effective and appropriate, such as limiting the impact of a          
catastrophic occurrence to the State buildings, the State has limited its       
exposure through high deductible catastrophic loss insurance.                   

  Local Issuances. It should be noted that the creditworthiness of obligations
issued by local Kansas issuers may be unrelated to the creditworthiness of      
obligations issued by the State of Kansas, and there is no obligation on the    
part of the State to make payment on such local obligations in the event of     
default.                                                                        

The foregoing information constitutes only a brief summary of some of the 
general factors which may impact certain issuers of bonds contained in the      
Kansas IM-IT and does not purport to be a complete or exhaustive description of 
all adverse conditions to which the issuers of such obligations are subject.    
Additionally, many factors including national economic, social and environmental
policies and conditions, which are not within the control of the issuers of such
bonds, could affect or could have an adverse impact on the financial condition  
of the State and various agencies and political subdivisions thereof. The       
Sponsor is unable to predict whether or to what extent such factors or other    
factors may affect the issuers of the bonds contained in the Kansas IM-IT, the  
market value or marketability of such bonds or the ability of the respective    
issuers of such bonds acquired by the Kansas IM-IT to pay interest on or        
principal of such bonds.                                                        

  The Kansas IM-IT is susceptible to political, economic or regulatory factors
affecting issuers of Kansas municipal obligations (the "Kansas Municipal        
Obligations"). These include the possible adverse effects of certain Kansas     
constitutional amendments, legislative measures, voter initiatives and other    
matters that are described. The information provided above is only a brief      
summary of the complex factors affecting the financial situation in Kansas and  
is derived from sources that are generally available to investors and are       
believed to be accurate. No independent verification has been made of the       
accuracy or completeness of any of the following information. It is based in    
part on information obtained from various State and local agencies in Kansas or 
contained in Official Statements for various Kansas Municipal Obligations.      

 Kentucky Risk Factors

Economic Condition and Outlook. The strength of the national economy is   
typically gauged by increases in output as measured by real GDP. The performance
of state economies is measured by personal income and employment. In terms of   
these two statistics the Kentucky economy edged into expansionary territory in  
FY04 when personal income grew by 4.6 percent and nonfarm employment was up by  
0.2 percent. (Employment had actually been falling before that.) The slow       
recovery was primarily from increased productivity, with the resulting need for 
a smaller work force, and excess manufacturing capacity abroad. In FY05,        
Kentucky's personal income is estimated to have increased by 5.9 percent to     
$118.7 billion. Wages and salaries comprise about half of total income. These   
were up by 5.6 percent during the year. Personal income is forecasted to be up  
by 6.0 percent in FY06 and 5.6 percent in FY07. The corresponding growth rates  
for wages and salaries are 4.6 and 5.1 percent.                                 

Employment data is commonly used to gauge the strength of the state's     
economy, primarily because of its timely availability and its impact on consumer
spending and confidence. Nonfarm employment in Kentucky increased by a 0.8      
percent in FY05 resulting in the addition of 15,800 jobs. Employment is expected
to firm up during the next two years with growth rates of 1.3 and 1.4 percent.  

 The service-providing sectors posted the largest gains during the year with
an increase of 1.1 percent compared to 0.7 percent for the goods-producing      
sector. Government jobs account for 17 percent of total nonfarm employment.     
There was a decline of 0.5 percent in this sector. Kentucky's employment        
composition has changed over the last decade and has converged closer to the    
national average. However, employment is still dominated by manufacturing and   
construction. The goods-producing sector accounts for 21 percent of all jobs in 
Kentucky compared to the national average of 16 percent. In the last few years  
this has been to Kentucky's disadvantage as manufacturing facilities have moved 
to low-cost centers abroad, and the ones that remain have seen a surge in       
productivity.                                                                   

   In FY05 manufacturing employment was flat, but showed some gains near the end
of the year with an increase of 0.8 percent in the fourth quarter. Manufacturing
of transportation equipment accounts for over one-fifth of all manufacturing    
jobs and was up 0.7 percent. The largest percentage gain in manufacturing       
employment was from computer and electronic products with an increase of 5.1    
percent. However, this sector accounts for 8,300 jobs or just 3 percent of total
manufacturing employment. Wood product manufacturing and paper manufacturing    
posted strong growths of 3.8 percent each. These two industries have combined   
employment of 24,500. Employment in fabricated metal products also grew strongly
by 1.9 percent. This industry provides for 8 percent of manufacturing jobs. The 
largest decline in terms of both levels and percentage was in the apparel       
industry. In FY05 apparel employment contracted by 13.5 percent with a loss of  
1,200 jobs.                                                                     

   Business services had an employment increase of 2.7 percent for the year. The
fastest-growing component was administrative and support with 60 percent of the 
jobs and a 6.7 percent increase in employment. Employment services account for  
26 percent of total business services and grew by 5.1 percent. One third of the 
jobs are in professional, scientific, and technical services. These grew by just
0.2 percent in FY05. Leisure and hospitality services comprise 10 percent of    
Kentucky's employment. During FY05 employment in this sector was up 2.7 percent.
Employment growth was strongest in the arts and entertainment portion of this   
sector (up 3.5 percent). However, those account for a little over 10 percent of 
this sector. Close to 90 percent of the jobs are in the accommodation and food  
service industries which grew by 2.5 percent.                                   

   Employment outlook for the next two years is strong with most of the gains in
business services (up 2.2 percent in FY06 and 3.1 percent in FY07); educational 
and health services (up 1.7 percent in FY06 and 1.6 percent in FY07); and       
leisure and hospitality (up 2.3 percent and 1.8 percent). High energy costs have
spurred coal mining. In terms of percentage growth this sector forecasted to    
increase rapidly with employment increases of 3.8 percent in FY06 and 5.4       
percent in FY07.                                                                

  Long-Term Financial Planning Kentucky has by statute (KRS 48.705) a set goal
of maintaining a Budget Reserve Trust Fund (BRTF) balance of 5 percent of       
general fund revenues. As of June 30, 2005, the BRTF was approximately $300     
million short of this goal. It is the policy of the current administration to   
earmark a portion of any year-end surplus to replenish the BRTF in order to     
achieve the desired balance. To that end, and as authorized by House Bill 267,  
we are increasing the BRTF by $90,250,000 for a total of $119,015,000 beginning 
with FY 2006.                                                                   

Major Initiatives. In March, 2005, the General Assembly enacted the       
Commonwealth's 2004-2006 biennial budget for the Executive Branch when meeting  
in Regular Session. Prior to that time, the Executive Branch of government had  
operated under quarterly Public Services Continuation Plans promulgated at the  
beginning of each fiscal quarter. This was the second consecutive biennium that 
the General Assembly did not pass an Executive Branch budget on time. The       
quarterly Public Services Continuation Plans represented a continuation of      
current levels of activity exclusive for the operating budget. The Franklin     
County Circuit Court ruled that no capital projects could move forward without  
an enacted budget. The Circuit Court also ruled that the spending plan could not
include spending on new programs or an amount for existing programs greater than
the General Assembly approved in its last budget. Outside of these requirements,
the Circuit Court did not issue an injunction barring the Executive Branch from 
implementing the quarterly Public Services Continuation Plans, and ruled that   
the spending plans expire at the end of the fiscal year absent legislative      
action.                                                                         

  In October, 2004, Governor Fletcher called the General Assembly into Special
Session to address funding for the public health insurance program which covers 
state employees, local school district employees, and public retirees. The      
General Assembly appropriated funds for this purpose as well as funds for the   
state school system. In March, 2005, the 2005 Session of the General Assembly   
enacted the remainder of the Executive Branch budget. Within the budget bill,   
the General Assembly ratified all of the actions the Executive Branch took      
pursuant to the Public Services Continuation Plans.                             

  One of the more notable initiatives in the budget was the unprecedented size
of the capital programs financed mainly through the issuance of debt. Education 
spending held the highest priority in the budget; it was increased by 12        
percent, and the Post-secondary Education budget was increased by 9 percent. The
capital budget for the Executive Branch included $1,456,315,300 in bond funded  
capital projects (exclusive of road and bridge construction) including          
$1,204,589,300 supported from General Fund debt service with the remainder      
($251,726,000) to be financed with agency/restricted fund debt service. The     
largest proportion of new project activity, including bond-financed activity,   
was directed to Post-secondary Education. These efforts reflect support for the 
top capital construction priorities at each of the eight public universities and
the Kentucky Community and Technical College System (KCTCS). The second largest 
commitment of support is for local school construction which was previously     
authorized and encouraged, but not fully funded. The School Facilities          
Construction Commission (SFCC), which aids local school districts in new        
construction and renovation projects, received $166 million in new bonds from   
the 2005 General Assembly to support offers of assistance to local school       
districts.                                                                      

   The General Assembly also enacted Tax Modernization legislation, the JOBS for
Kentucky program. The tax bill was revenue neutral over a five-year period. The 
legislation included a major restructuring of corporate and business taxes;     
repealing the corporate license tax, broadening the base of entities paying the 
corporate income tax, and lowering the corporation income tax rate. The personal
income tax rate was reduced, a low-income tax credit was established, the       
intangible property tax was repealed, the cigarette tax was raised, wholesale   
alcohol taxes were increased, communications taxes were restructured, and a     
number of tax credits were established.                                         

In May, 2005, the Kentucky Supreme Court ruled on the budget lawsuit. The 
Court ruled that absent legislative appropriations the Executive Branch may only
expend funds in certain instances, among which were: constitutional mandates,   
authorized bonded indebtedness, statutorily based appropriations, and federal   
mandates. The Commonwealth ended FY 2005 with a surplus in the General Fund of  
$622 million, including the Budget Reserve Trust Fund and $37 million in the    
Transportation Fund. The General Fund surplus was due to higher revenue receipts
than anticipated combined with the lapse of unexpended funds. The Transportation
Fund surplus was mostly the result of the lapse of unexpended funds. Governor   
Fletcher devoted $90 million of the General Fund surplus, the maximum allowed by
the budget bill, to the Commonwealth's Budget Reserve Trust Fund, or Rainy Day  
fund.                                                                           

Assets. The Commonwealth's combined net assets (governmental and          
business-type activities) totaled $17.4 billion at the end of 2005, as compared 
to $16.6 billion at the end of the previous year. At $17.4 billion, the largest 
portion of the Commonwealth's net assets is invested in capital assets (e.g.    
land, infrastructures, buildings and improvements and machinery and equipment), 
less any related debt used to acquire those assets that is still outstanding.   
The Commonwealth uses these capital assets to provide services to its citizens; 
therefore, these assets are not available for future spending.                  

 The second largest portion of the Commonwealth's net assets, totaling $1.46
billion, is restricted and represents resources that are subject to either      
external restrictions or legislative restrictions on how they may be used. The  
remaining balance is unrestricted net assets. The unrestricted net assets, which
if positive could be used at the Commonwealth's discretion, showed a negative   
balance of $1.45 billion. Therefore, no funds were available for discretionary  
purposes. A contributing factor to the negative balance is that liabilities are 
recognized on the governmentwide statement of net assets when the obligation is 
incurred. Accordingly, the Commonwealth recognizes long-term liabilities (such  
as general bonded debt, compensated absences, unfunded employer pension cost,   
and contingent liabilities-shown in Note 15 to the financial statements) on the 
statement of net assets.                                                        

Debt Administration. The authority of the Commonwealth to incur debt is   
described in Article X, Section 25, of the Kentucky Constitution. In 1987, the  
Commonwealth created the Executive Bond Oversight Commission and the Legislative
Bond Oversight Commission. The commissions meet jointly to review all proposed  
debt issuance. Both commissions must approve each financing plan before         
obligations are issued. The legislation that created the bond oversight         
commissions also created the position of Commonwealth Bond Advisor, who advises 
the commissions and must approve the pricing and fees associated with any debt  
issuance.                                                                       

The Commonwealth of Kentucky's bonded debt increased by $11 million to    
$3,236,766, a .35% increase during the current fiscal year. No general          
obligation bonds were authorized or outstanding at June 30, 2005. The key factor
in this increase was the issuance of new debt during fiscal year 2005.          

   Cash Management. The Commonwealth's investments are governed by KRS 42.500 et
seq. and KAR Title 200 Chapter 14. The State Investment Commission, comprised of
the Governor, the Treasurer, Secretary of the Finance and Administration Cabinet
and gubernatorial appointees of the Kentucky Banker's Association, is charged   
with the oversight of the Commonwealth's investment activities. The Commission  
is required to meet at least quarterly, and delegates day-to-day investment     
management to the Office of Financial Management.                               

The Commonwealth's investments are categorized into four investment pools:
Short-term, Intermediate-term, Long-term and Bond Proceeds Pools. The purpose of
these pools is to provide economies of scale that enhance yield, ease           
administration and increase accountability and control. The Short-term Pool     
consists primarily of General Fund cash balances and provides liquidity to the  
remaining pools. The Intermediate-term Pool represents Agency Fund investments, 
state held component unit funds and fiduciary fund accounts held for the benefit
of others by the Commonwealth. The Long-term Pool invests funds deemed          
appropriate for the pool where liquidity is not a serious concern. The Bond     
Proceeds Pool is where bond proceeds for capital construction projects are      
deposited until expended for their intended purpose.                            

The Commonwealth engages in selective derivative transactions. These      
transactions are entered into only with an abundance of caution and for specific
hedge applications to minimize yield volatility in the portfolio. The State     
Investment Commission expressly prohibits the use of margin or other leveraging 
techniques. The Commonwealth executes a variety of transactions which may be    
considered derivative transactions, which include: the securities lending       
program, over-the-counter treasury options, interest rate swaps, mortgage backed
securities, collateralized mortgage obligations and asset backed securities.    

The Commonwealth has used over-the-counter treasury options since the     
mid-1980s to hedge and add value to the portfolio of treasury securities. These 
transactions involve the purchase and sale of put and call options on a covered 
basis, holding either cash or securities sufficient to meet the obligation      
should it be exercised. The State Investment Commission limits the total option 
commitment to no more than twenty percent of the total portfolio of treasury and
agency securities. Historically, actual commitments have been less than ten     
percent of the portfolio. The Commonwealth has had a securities lending program 
since the mid-1980s. The Commonwealth is able to enter into either a principal  
relationship or an agent relationship. In a principal relationship the          
Commonwealth reverses its treasury and agency securities in exchange for 102% of
eligible collateral, marked to market daily. Eligible Collateral is defined as  
securities authorized for purchase pursuant to KRS 42.500. In an agent program  
the agent lends the Commonwealth's treasuries and agencies, takes the cash      
received from the loan and invests it in securities authorized for purchase     
pursuant to KRS 42.500. The income generated by these transactions is split     
between the agent and the Commonwealth. At the present time the Commonwealth has
entered into an agent agreement that has a guarantee of 10 basis points of the  
average market value of securities in the program.                              

 On June 20, 2003, the State Investment Commission adopted Resolution 03-03,
which amended the Commonwealth's investment policy concerning asset-based       
interest rate swaps. The change modifies the exposure limits from a $200 million
notional amount to a net market value approach, the absolute value of which     
cannot exceed $50 million for all counter-parties. The Commonwealth engages in  
asset-based interest rate swaps to better manage its duration and to stabilize  
the volatility of interest income.                                              

House Bill 5 of the First Extraordinary Session of 1997 was enacted on May
30, 1997. The Bill amended KRS 42.500 to authorize the purchase of additional   
investment securities with excess funds available for investment. The new       
classes of investment securities include: United States dollar denominated      
corporate securities, issued by foreign and domestic issuers, including         
sovereign and supranatural governments, rated in one of the three highest       
categories by a nationally recognized rating agency, and asset backed securities
rated in the highest category by a nationally recognized rating agency.         

KAR Title 200 Chapter 14 provides, among other things that: corporate     
securities, inclusive of Commercial Paper, Banker's Acceptances and Certificates
of Deposit are limited to twenty-five million per issuer and a stated final     
maturity of five years or less. Money market securities rated A1-P1 or higher   
are limited to 20% of any investment pool and when combined with corporate and  
asset backed securities (ABS) must not exceed 25% of any investment pool. United
States Agency Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS) and Collateralized Mortgage      
Obligations (CMO) are also limited to a maximum of 25% of any investment        
portfolio. ABS, MBS and CMO must have a weighted-average-life of four years or  
less at time of purchase.                                                       

 Ratings. As of September 2006, State of Kentucky was given an issuer credit
rating of AA- by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services and Aa2 by Moody's          
Investor's Service, Inc. Any explanation concerning the significance of such    
ratings must be obtained from the rating agencies. There is no assurance that   
any ratings will continue for any period of time or that they will not be       
revised or withdrawn.                                                           

  Local Issuances. It should be noted that the creditworthiness of obligations
issued by local Kentucky issuers may be unrelated to the creditworthiness of    
obligations issued by the State of Kentucky, and there is no obligation on the  
part of the State to make payment on such local obligations in the event of     
default.                                                                        

The foregoing information constitutes only a brief summary of some of the 
general factors which may impact certain issuers of bonds contained in the      
Kentucky IM-IT and does not purport to be a complete or exhaustive description  
of all adverse conditions to which the issuers of such obligations are subject. 
Additionally, many factors including national economic, social and environmental
policies and conditions, which are not within the control of the issuers of such
bonds, could affect or could have an adverse impact on the financial condition  
of the State and various agencies and political subdivisions thereof. The       
Sponsor is unable to predict whether or to what extent such factors or other    
factors may affect the issuers of the bonds contained in the Kentucky IM-IT, the
market value or marketability of such bonds or the ability of the respective    
issuers of such bonds acquired by the Kentucky IM-IT to pay interest on or      
principal of such bonds.                                                        

The Kentucky IM-IT is susceptible to political, economic or regulatory    
factors affecting issuers of Kentucky municipal obligations (the "Kentucky      
Municipal Obligations"). These include the possible adverse effects of certain  
Kentucky constitutional amendments, legislative measures, voter initiatives and 
other matters that are described. The information provided above is only a brief
summary of the complex factors affecting the financial situation in Kentucky and
is derived from sources that are generally available to investors and are       
believed to be accurate. No independent verification has been made of the       
accuracy or completeness of any of the following information. It is based in    
part on information obtained from various State and local agencies in Kentucky  
or contained in Official Statements for various Kentucky Municipal Obligations. 

Louisiana Risk Factors

Economic Outlook. Located on the Gulf of Mexico and bounded by Arkansas,  
Texas and Mississippi, Louisiana occupies a land area of 43,411 square miles and
serves a population of 4,483,000. The Executive, Judicial and Legislative       
Branches govern the State as provided by the State Constitution of 1974. The    
State provides a variety of services to citizens including education, health    
care, public safety, road and highway development and maintenance, and          
recreation. These services are financed primarily through taxes, fees, mineral  
royalties and federal revenues, which are accounted for by various funds        
(general fund, special revenue funds, capital project funds, etc.).             

   Major industries in Louisiana include agriculture, fishing, and processing of
mineral resources. The State leads the nation in the production of salt and     
sulfur and ranks high in the production of crude petroleum, natural gas, and    
natural gas liquids. The State rapidly industrialized in the 1960's and 70's and
has giant oil refineries, petrochemical plants, foundries, and lumber and paper 
mills. Four of the ten busiest U.S. ports are located in Louisiana along the    
lower Mississippi River (New Orleans, South Louisiana, Baton Rouge, and         
Plaquemines). The State financial reporting entity includes 51 active component 
units, which are reported discretely in the financial statements. These         
component units include colleges and universities, boards and commissions,      
ports, levee districts, and other special purpose authorities.                  

Louisiana is projected to operate in a recession-free environment over the
next two years, though the national economy's growth rate is projected to slow  
to closer to 3% annually. After a slight heating of inflationary pressures in   
2005 (3%), lower oil prices and a tighter monetary policy are expected to drop  
inflation to under 2% annually. Low inflation rates are predicted to keep long  
term interest rates very low, though the 30-year fixed rate should rise about 59
basis points.                                                                   

 The State of Louisiana was heavily impacted by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.
Katrina was the worst hurricane in U.S. history. Its destructive power was      
compounded by the breaks in the levee system around New Orleans and the         
subsequent long-term flooding. This flooding set limits on home insurance       
reimbursements and in some cases rendered void business interruption insurance. 
This will result in changes that will significantly increase the cost of        
rebuilding.                                                                     

Hurricanes Katrina and Rita imposed extensive damage on offshore platforms
and pipelines and onshore infrastructure. These damages have caused a short term
spike in oil and natural gas prices. However, it is forecasted that the oil     
prices will drop into the $45 to $58 per barrel range and natural gas will      
stabilize at about $7.90 to $8.20 per mmbtu.                                    

 These two hurricanes also affected the Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSA)
of New Orleans, Baton Rouge, Lafayette, Houma, Lake Charles, and Alexandria. It 
is estimated that over 267,000 homes in the New Orleans MSA were rendered       
uninhabitable by these two hurricanes and many more were significantly damaged. 
It is also expected that the New Orleans MSA employment will decline by 278,900 
from the 2004 levels. Rebuilding of homes should enable 31,100 jobs to be added 
in 2007. By 2006, New Orleans will be the second largest MSA in Louisiana.      

Immediately after Katrina, the Baton Rouge MSA's population rose by about 
248,000 people as evacuees flooded into the area. Ultimately, this MSA's        
population will be limited by its ability to create jobs for the evacuees. It is
estimated that the Baton Rouge population will settle in at about 50,000 over   
the pre-Katrina level, which implies the MSA will add 26,300 jobs in 2006 and   
another 4,300 in 2007.                                                          

 These jobs will come from the relocation of some New Orleans firms to Baton
Rouge and from the expansion of Baton Rouge as a bedroom community for people   
working in New Orleans. The influx of new jobs plus the decline in New Orleans, 
means that in 2006 the Baton Rouge MSA will be the largest in Louisiana.        

It is anticipated that the Lafayette MSA will add 5,200 jobs in 2006 and  
1,600 jobs in 2007. Two factors will boost this MSA's employment. First, there  
will be some relocation of firms from New Orleans to this MSA. Secondly,        
fabrication and oilfield service firms will gain business associated with       
rebuilding the energy infrastructure destroyed in the Gulf of Mexico.           

   It is estimated that the Houma MSA will have 4,600 new jobs in 2006 and 1,600
more in 2007. Post-Katrina this MSA will benefit from (1) the impact of higher  
energy prices on the extraction sector, (2) the gains for the area's fabricators
in rebuilding the damaged energy infrastructure, (3) the boom in Port Fourchon  
due to the destruction of other ports servicing the offshore industry, and (4)  
by becoming a bedroom community for people who work in New Orleans.             

  It is projected that the Lake Charles MSA will gain 3,700 jobs over 2006-07.
This was the hardest hit MSA in the state by Rita. However, unlike New Orleans, 
Lake Charles avoided the prolonged flooding problem. It is assumed that this    
region will pick up 1,000 new jobs associated with repair from the hurricane.   
These gains will be offset somewhat by the announced closure of Lyondell        
Chemical and the temporary loss of jobs due to damage to Harrah's two riverboat 
casinos.                                                                        

The Alexandria MSA is expected to have 3,500 new jobs over 2006-07. Three 
thousand of those jobs are due to the opening of Union Tank Car, a              
mega-construction project by Cleco, and the opening of the new federal          
penitentiary at Pollock. This MSA will gain very marginally from the relocation 
of firms and families to the region post-Katrina/Rita.                          

 It is expected that there will be minor job gains in the rural areas of the
state, especially in Tangipahoa Parish, just northwest across Lake Ponchartrain 
from New Orleans. On the net, it is forecasted that non-farm employment in      
Louisiana will fall by 59,700 jobs in 2005, fall a farther 158,900 jobs in 2006,
and then rebound by 47,700 jobs in 2007 as more housing becomes available in New
Orleans. In effect, the estimates suggest that Katrina and Rita wiped out about 
11 years of employment growth in Louisiana and decreased the state's population 
in 2006 by 515,570, which is a loss significant enough to probably cost the     
state a congressional seat.                                                     

Fund Highlights. Supplemental appropriations are usually passed before the
end of the fiscal year based on revisions to estimated revenues by the Revenue  
Estimating Conference and the needs of various departments and programs. These  
supplemental appropriations are included in the final budget, but are not in the
original budget. Final budgeted revenues were approximately $338 million greater
than originally budgeted and final budgeted expenditures were approximately $445
million greater than originally budgeted. Transfers in from other funds make up 
the difference between revenues and expenditures. Final budgeted expenditures in
excess of original budgeted expenditures include $150 million for Higher        
Education mainly due to the Disadvantaged or Disabled Support Program; $127     
million for Department of Health and Hospitals mainly due to an increase in     
medical vendor payments made to State of Louisiana private providers; $65       
million for bond defeasance in accordance with the provisions of Article VII,   
Section 10(D)(2)(a) of the State Constitution to produce savings from the early 
repayment of debt; $27 million for Social Services mainly due to obligations    
incurred but unmet in fiscal year 2004 for the Temporary Assistance for Needy   
Family (TANF) Program; and expenditures for various other projects or services. 

The final budget for the TANF Program was increased to ensure that the    
obligations would be met in fiscal year 2005. Actual revenues were $336 million 
less than final budgeted revenues and actual expenditures were $773 million less
than final budgeted expenditures. The difference between the final budgeted     
amounts and actual results can be attributed to an over estimation of final     
budgeted revenues and expenditures necessary for the operations of the general  
government and for providing for health and welfare. Actual revenues and        
expenditures were lower than budgeted amounts in part because the number of cash
assistance cases, which provide temporary cash assistance to families in need,  
declined. Child care expenditures were less than budgeted amounts due to a      
decrease in the percentage used to calculate payments to subsidize child care   
centers.                                                                        

Assets. The overall financial position for the State improved from the    
previous year as reflected in the increase in net assets to $15.4 billion (8%). 
Net assets for governmental activities increased by $1.2 billion (9%), while net
assets for business-type activities increased by $37 million (2%). The largest  
portion of the net assets of the State, $12.2 billion (49%), reflects investment
in capital assets (e.g., land, roads, buildings, machinery, and equipment).     
These assets are used to provide services to residents of the State, and        
consequently are not available for future spending. Capital assets increased by 
$485 million (4%), due mainly to infrastructure improvements under the Louisiana
Transportation Infrastructure Model for Economic Development (TIMED)            

  In contrast, current and other assets (e.g., cash, investments, receivables,
and inventory) totaled $12.7 billion (51% of total assets) at fiscal year end,  
and the State uses some of these resources to repay debt associated with capital
assets. The current and other assets of the State at June 30, 2005 represent an 
increase of 15% from the prior fiscal year. Cash increased by $672 million      
(16%), mainly because of bond sales in the Capital Outlay ($500 million) and    
TIMED ($551 million) funds. A portion of these bond proceeds have been invested,
contributing to the increase in investments of $712 million (19%).              

  Restricted net assets represent those assets not available for spending as a
result of legislative or constitutional requirements, donor agreements, or grant
requirements. Restricted net assets increased by $1 billion (18%) from the      
previous fiscal year for governmental activities, due in large part to the      
increase in investment in capital assets for the TIMED program. Restricted net  
assets increased by $10 million (less than 1%) for business-type activities,    
reflecting a decrease in the expenses of the Unemployment Trust Fund because of 
a reduction in the number of unemployed.                                        

Revenue and Expenditures. The Louisiana Revenue Estimating Conference (the
"Conference") was established by Act No. 814 of the 1987 Regular Session of the 
Legislature and given constitutional status in 1990 (Article VII, Section 10 of 
the State Constitution). The Conference was established to provide an official  
forecast of anticipated state revenues upon which the executive budget shall be 
based, to provide for a more stable and accurate method of financial planning   
and budgeting and to facilitate the adoption of a balanced budget as is required
by Article VII, Section 10(E) of the State Constitution.                        

In developing the official forecast, the Conference can only consider     
revenues that are projected to accrue to the state as a result of laws and rules
enacted and in effect during the forecast period. The Conference is prohibited  
from including revenues which would be raised by proposed legislation or rules. 
During the 1990 Regular Session of the Louisiana Legislature, a constitutional  
amendment was approved (Act No. 1096), granting constitutional status to the    
existence of the Revenue Estimating Conference without altering its structure,  
powers, duties or responsibilities which are currently provided by statute.     

The General Fund is the chief operating fund of the State. The overall    
performance of the General Fund improved by $290 million, in part due to an     
increase in revenues of $410 million (6%) for fiscal year 2005.                 
Unreserved/undesignated fund balance increased to a balance of $264 million.    

   The rise in revenues is mainly due to an increase in federal revenues for the
Medical Vendor Payment Program, which saw an increase of $248 million. This     
program provides for direct payments to healthcare providers for health care    
services for Louisiana residents who are (1) eligible for the Title XIX Medicaid
program, (2) Department of Corrections inmates, or (3) medically indigent. The  
Subgrantee Assistance Program, which provides flow-through funds for school and 
community support programs that enhance learning environments and improve the   
quality of teaching, saw an increase of $113 million in federal revenues, while 
the State Treasurers' Office realized an increase in investment earnings from   
last year of $39.5 million, largely due to the avoidance of investment losses in
the prior year which did not occur this year. General Fund expenditures have    
increased by $726 million (4%). Part of the increase can be attributed to a $347
million increase for health care and social services costs. These increases     
include $250 million for medical vendor payments and $72 million for education  
expenditures for the Minimum Foundation Program, which is the mechanism by which
all students in public elementary and secondary schools are assured of a minimum
program of education. Expenditures have also grown by $118 million for the      
Office of Group Benefits, due to double-digit increases in health and drug      
costs.                                                                          

   The Bond Security and Redemption Fund revenues increased by $854 million (8%)
in fiscal year 2005, mainly because of an increase in tax revenue. The Louisiana
Education Quality Trust Fund reported interest earnings of $18.6 million (a 26% 
decrease) and market gains of $14.6 million. The fund balance for the Medicaid  
Trust Fund for the Elderly decreased to $865 million (1%).                      

   Cash Management. The State Treasurer is responsible for managing all cash and
investments, with the exception of certain component units included in the      
reporting entity that have independent powers to manage and invest their funds. 
During fiscal year 2005, cash management and investment transactions managed by 
the State Treasurer included checking accounts, certificates of deposit, U.S.   
government and agency obligations, commercial paper, repurchase agreements, and 
security lending agreements. Legal requirements for the investment of funds     
maintained by the State Treasurer are discussed in Note 2 to the financial      
statements.                                                                     

For fiscal year 2005, the Treasury earned $90,299,850 on its fixed-income 
investments for the General Fund. The investments earned a cash rate of return  
of 2.58% during fiscal year 2005, which is a 14.6% decrease from the 3.02% rate 
that earned $85,308,039 in the previous year. By comparison, the thirty-day     
Treasury Bill yield averaged 1.96% and the two-year Treasury Bill averaged 1.74%
during the same period.                                                         

The fixed income and equity investments of the Louisiana Education Quality
Trust Fund earned a total rate of return of 9.56% for the 2005 fiscal year,     
which is a 34.7% increase from the 7.10% rate of return reported for the 2004   
fiscal year.                                                                    

 Debt Management. The Louisiana Constitution of 1974 provides that the state
shall have no power, directly or indirectly, through any state board, agency,   
commission or otherwise to incur debt or issue bonds except by law enacted by   
two-thirds of the elected members of each house of the legislature. The State   
authorizes, issues, and sells debt obligations. General obligation bonds issued 
by the State are backed by the full faith and credit of the State. The State    
also issues revenue obligations, which are secured by a pledge of revenues or   
property derived from the operations of a program funded by the issuance of the 
obligations.                                                                    

Louisiana Revised Statutes (LRS) 39:1365(25) limits the legislative       
authorization of general obligation bonds and other general obligations secured 
by the full faith and credit of the state by prohibiting total authorized bonds 
from exceeding an amount equal to two times the average annual revenues of the  
Bond Security and Redemption Fund for the last three fiscal years prior to such 
authorization.                                                                  

Debt Administration. The State authorizes, issues, and sells debt         
obligations. General obligation bonds issued by the State are backed by the full
faith and credit of the State. The State also issues revenue obligations, which 
are secured by a pledge of revenues or property derived from the operations of a
program funded by the issuance of the obligations.                              

  During the year, $650 million of new general obligation refunding debt, $500
million of new general obligation debt, and $687 million of new revenue bonds   
were issued, contributing to the increase in bonded debt of $908 million. The   
general obligation bonds were issued for various construction projects needed   
for repairs and maintenance statewide, for various construction projects at     
several State parks, construction and renovation at several universities, and   
various local projects. The bulk of the newly issued revenue bonds ($525        
million) can be attributed to the TIMED program discussed earlier, which        
includes 16 transportation projects aimed at improving economic development     
throughout the State.                                                           

Risk Management. The primary government, through the Office of Risk       
Management, retains risk for property, casualty, and worker's compensation      
insurance, as well as coverage for all State property, with virtually no upper  
limits. Auto liability, comprehensive, and collision coverage is provided for   
the State fleet and other coverage, such as bonds, crime, aviation, and marine  
insurance, is provided as needed.                                               

Ratings. As of September 2006, all outstanding general obligation bonds of
the State of Louisiana are rated A by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services and A2 
by Moody's Investor's Service, Inc. Any explanation concerning the significance 
of such ratings must be obtained from the rating agencies. There is no assurance
that any ratings will continue for any period of time or that they will not be  
revised or withdrawn.                                                           

  Local Issuances. It should be noted that the creditworthiness of obligations
issued by local Louisiana issuers may be unrelated to the creditworthiness of   
obligations issued by the State of Louisiana, and there is no obligation on the 
part of the State to make payment on such local obligations in the event of     
default.                                                                        

The foregoing information constitutes only a brief summary of some of the 
general factors which may impact certain issuers of bonds contained in the      
Louisiana IM-IT and does not purport to be a complete or exhaustive description 
of all adverse conditions to which the issuers of such obligations are subject. 
Additionally, many factors including national economic, social and environmental
policies and conditions, which are not within the control of the issuers of such
bonds, could affect or could have an adverse impact on the financial condition  
of the State and various agencies and political subdivisions thereof. The       
Sponsor is unable to predict whether or to what extent such factors or other    
factors may affect the issuers of the bonds contained in the Louisiana IM-IT,   
the market value or marketability of such bonds or the ability of the respective
issuers of such bonds acquired by the Louisiana IM-IT to pay interest on or     
principal of such bonds.                                                        

The Louisiana IM-IT is susceptible to political, economic or regulatory   
factors affecting issuers of Louisiana municipal obligations (the "Louisiana    
Municipal Obligations"). These include the possible adverse effects of certain  
Louisiana constitutional amendments, legislative measures, voter initiatives and
other matters that are described. The information provided above is only a brief
summary of the complex factors affecting the financial situation in Louisiana   
and is derived from sources that are generally available to investors and are   
believed to be accurate. No independent verification has been made of the       
accuracy or completeness of any of the following information. It is based in

Maine Risk Factors

  Economic Outlook. The Maine economy recovered from the recession in 2004 and
is now experiencing moderate and steady growth. The prime movers were an        
improved national economy and continued low interest rates. The Maine Coincident
Economic Index (CEI - which roughly tracks Real Gross State Product) rose 2.3%  
for the year, the strongest performance since 2000, and a significant           
improvement over the 0.6% growth measured in 2003                               

Maine payroll employment increased by 6,900, or 1.1%, the best showing in 
four years. Maine's average unemployment rate in 2005 was 4.6%, down from 5% in 
the previous years, and still well below the national rate of 5.5%. As a result,
personal income growth was also improved. Personal income growth in 2004 was 6%,
25th best in the country. Maine's ability to navigate through the recent        
recession better than many other states has resulted in Maine's per capita      
income ranking improving to 31st in the country in 2004.                        

   Very low interest rates enabled a record setting year for national home sales
and home refinancing activity again put billions into people's pockets, a boon  
to retailers. Maine total taxable retail sales increased by 6% in 2004, up from 
5% growth in the previous year. The bulk of this improvement was due to the     
exceptional strength of the building supply store-type group (up 15.7%). In     
recent months rising interest rates and energy costs have slowed the growth in  
taxable sales to 3%.                                                            

   The November 2005 Maine economic forecast calls for payroll employment growth
of .8% in 2005 and .9% in 2006. The largest jobs gains over this period will be 
in education and health services, professional and business services, retail and
leisure and hospitality. Construction employment is expected to shrink and      
manufacturing jobs will continue to decline, but at a slower rate than over the 
past few years.                                                                 

Personal income is expected to grow a bit more slowly than in the recent  
past, with growth near 5.5% for this year and next. Wage and salary income      
growth will increase by an average of 5% for the period, with even stronger     
growth rates predicted for "other labor income," proprietors' income, and       
transfer payments                                                               

Major Initiatives. Chapter 20, Public Laws of 2005 enacted into law the   
Administration's comprehensive government reorganization plan to consolidate and
streamline administrative services across Maine State Government through the    
consolidation of information technology, statewide payroll, accounting and      
finance, human resources, and administrative hearings. The consolidation is,    
perhaps, the most sweeping reorganization of backbone services in Maine's recent
history. The initiative will provide State government and the citizens of Maine 
with long-term benefits. The consolidation brings an enterprise-wide view to    
managing the State's internal service resources. This structure ensures that    
State government is positioned to provide more efficient support services to    
State agencies. The plan changes the service delivery model in a way that       
benefits agencies with limited resources, while providing savings from the      
economies of scale. The consolidation provides an operating model to ensure that
resources are managed with accountability and maximum transparency for the      
overall good of Maine's citizens. The model provides an enhanced measure of     
internal control over all backbone service resources throughout State           
government, allowing issues to be identified earlier and addressed timely and   
effectively. The State benefits by having a group of professional employees with
specialized skills that are transferable to serve any agency in State           
government. The plan creates a mechanism for the rapid deployment of resources  
where needed in case of an emergency, or to address problems. The reorganization
eliminates the inter-agency competition for qualified staff resources while     
providing employees with greater opportunity for professional development and   
career advancement. The plan saves approximately $10.7 million across all funds 
that comprise State government. The General Fund alone will provide annual net  
savings of approximately $5.3 million into the future.                          

Significant property tax legislation was enacted in Chapter 2, Public Laws
2005 which provides property tax relief to the vast majority of Maine's         
citizens. The tax reform law limits spending at the municipal level of          
government as well as the State level. The law increases the State's share of   
education aid by $250 million in the 2006 - 2007 biennia and increases according
to a predetermined formula until the State meets its obligation of funding local
education at 55%.                                                               

   The State Controller and State Treasurer jointly introduced a proposed change
to Maine Law related to the overall management of the Treasurer's Cash Pool to  
provide better accountability of internal transfers of cash among the various   
funds that comprise the cash pool. The language proposed was adopted by the     
Legislature in Chapter 386, Public Laws of 2005.                                

Revenues and Expenditures. The State pools cash for a variety of State    
agencies and public sector entities. Interest earned on pooled cash is allocated
to the various funds, generally based on their average equity balances. In      
accordance with statute, the Treasurer of State may deposit State funds in any  
of the banking institutions organized under the laws of this State, and any     
national bank or federal savings and loan association located in the State. All 
State money in any depository of State Government shall be to the credit of the 
State but the Treasurer of State shall not withdraw any of the funds except upon
the authority of the State Controller.                                          

   The Treasurer of State may invest funds that exceed current obligations, with
the concurrence of the State Controller or the Commissioner of Administrative   
and Financial Services, and the consent of the Governor. The list of approved   
pool investments includes: U.S. Treasury Bills, Notes, Bonds and Agency         
Securities, certain secured repurchase agreements, prime commercial paper,      
tax-exempt obligations, banker's acceptances, and certain secured shares of an  
investment company registered under the federal Investment Company Act of 1940. 

 Deposits with financial institutions are classified by collateral risk into
three categories. Category 1 is the amount of State deposits that are fully     
insured or collateralized with securities held by the State or its agent in the 
States name. Category 2 is the amount of deposits that are collateralized with  
securities held by the pledging financial institution's trust department or     
agent in the State's name. Category 3 is the amount of deposits that are neither
collateralized nor insured.                                                     

Debt Management. The Constitution of the State of Maine provides that the 
Legislature shall not create any debt which exceeds $2,000,000 except to        
suppress insurrection, to repel invasion or for purposes of war except when     
two-thirds of the Legislature and a majority of the voters authorize the        
issuance of debt. The Constitution also provides that tax anticipation loans    
must be repaid during the fiscal year of issuance. Constitutional amendments    
have been adopted which also allow the Legislature to authorize the issuance of 
bonds to insure payments on revenue bonds of up to $4,800,000 for local public  
school building projects; in the amount of up to $4,000,000 to guarantee student
loans; to insure payments on up to $1,000,000 of mortgage loans for Indian      
housing; to insure payments on up to $4,000,000 of mortgage loans or small      
business loans to war veterans; and to insure payments on up to $90,000,000 of  
mortgage loans for industrial, manufacturing, fishing, agricultural, and        
recreational enterprises. This last authorization has been limited statutorily  
to a maximum of $87,500,000 available for issue through the Finance Authority of
Maine.                                                                          

When issuing General Obligation Bonds, the State of Maine pledges its full
faith and credit to repay the financial obligation. Unless certain tax revenue  
streams are specifically restricted, states typically pledge all of their tax   
raising powers to secure the obligations. The major bond rating agencies        
regularly assess the capacity and willingness of the State to repay its general 
obligation debt. Moody's Investors Service, Standard & Poor's make their        
assessments, in large part, by examining four basic analytical areas: economy   
financial performance and flexibility debt burden administration. The economic  
base is the most critical element in determining the rating. Growth and         
diversity in the demographics, tax base, and employment base of the State over  
the last decade are indicators of future growth prospects and debt repayment    
capabilities. Generally, States with higher income levels and diverse economic  
bases have superior debt repayment capabilities and are better protected from   
sudden shocks or unexpected volatility in the economy. Because a strong economy 
does not always ensure a State's ability to meet debt payments, the State's     
financial management and performance are also key factors.                      

Financial analysis involves several factors, including: accounting and    
reporting methods; revenue and expenditure patterns; annual operating and       
budgetary performance; leverage and equity positions; budget and financial      
planning; and contingency obligations. These factors present a clear indication 
of the financial strengths and weaknesses of the State. The rating agencies'    
analyses of these factors provide the framework for judging Maine's capacity to 
manage economic, political, and financial uncertainties.                        

Risk Management. In general, the State is "self-insured" for health and   
dental insurance, worker's compensation, tort liability, vehicle liability,     
marine and aircraft, property losses, and retiree health insurance for State    
employees and teachers. The Risk Management Division's activities include       
analysis of and control over insurance coverage and risk exposure. Risk         
Management funds the cost of providing claims servicing and claims payment by   
charging premiums to agencies based on a review of past losses and estimated    
losses for the current period.                                                  

Ratings. As of September 2006, all outstanding general obligation bonds of
the State of Maine are rated AA- by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services and Aa3  
by Moody's Investor's Service, Inc. Any explanation concerning the significance 
of such ratings must be obtained from the rating agencies. There is no assurance
that any ratings will continue for any period of time or that they will not be  
revised or withdrawn.                                                           

  Local Issuances. It should be noted that the creditworthiness of obligations
issued by local Maine issuers may be unrelated to the creditworthiness of       
obligations issued by the State of Maine, and there is no obligation on the part
of the State to make payment on such local obligations in the event of default. 

The foregoing information constitutes only a brief summary of some of the 
general factors which may impact certain issuers of bonds contained in the Maine
IM-IT and does not purport to be a complete or exhaustive description of all    
adverse conditions to which the issuers of such obligations are subject.        
Additionally, many factors including national economic, social and environmental

 Maryland Risk Factors

 Economy and Outlook. Maryland's economy continued its strong performance in
2004 and through the first three-quarters of 2005. Almost 27,000 jobs were      
created in 2004, as employment growth was 1.1%. For the first three quarters of 
this year almost 50,000 jobs have been created with a robust 1.9% employment    
growth, stronger than the national average of 1.7%. Wage and salary income      
increased 6.5% in the first half of 2005, also an acceleration from the year's  
before 5.7% growth. A booming housing market, Federal spending on defense,      
homeland security, and health, very strong corporate profitability and a growing
tourism trade have helped drive Maryland's economy.                             

  Construction, professional and business services and leisure and hospitality
services were the fastest growing industries in Maryland in 2004. The           
construction industry grew by 4.7%, boosted by continuing low interest rates.   
The near-term outlook is relatively strong as mortgage rates have only recently 
started to climb, public sector spending has recovered after several weak years,
and with very strong corporate profits, business expansion will continue. The   
professional and business services industry, Maryland's third-largest, grew by  
2.8% in 2004. As with the construction sector, recent business profitability    
helps to support the growth of this industry, as does the vast amounts of       
Federal spending in Maryland on contracts of all descriptions. Through the first
nine months of 2005, this industry has contributed almost one-third of all new  
jobs in the State despite representing under 15% of total employment. The       
leisure and hospitality industry also grew by 2.8% in 2004, spurred in part by  
an increase in tourism in the State. The number of domestic visitors increased  
by 4.8% to more than 21 million, outpacing national growth of 2.1%. To date in  
2005, this industry has grown 5.7%, almost twice as fast as the next best       
industry.                                                                       

   The manufacturing and information industries were two of the State's laggards
in 2004. For six of the last eight years, manufacturing was the worst-performing
industry in the State. In the other two years, it was second-worst. Although the
industry posted its best performance in four years in 2004, it still declined by
2.9%, in part due to the long-anticipated closure of General Motors' Broening   
Highway plant. The information industry has been on a roller coaster ride of    
late, reaching higher highs and lower lows in the last five years than any other
industry in Maryland. At the end of the technology boom in 2000, job growth     
reached 7.9%, the best growth of any major industry since 1990. And just two    
years later the sector cratered as a result of massive overinvestment in        
telecommunications during the prior several years and the wind-down from Y2K,   
falling by 8.9%, the second-worst performance of any industry since 1990. The   
sector is recovering, shrinking by only 1.0% in 2004. While the prospects for   
this industry are positive, manufacturing seems likely to continue declining.   

 Current risks to Maryland's economy include the national economic impact of
hurricane Katrina, rising energy prices and interest rates, and the Base        
Realignment and Closure process. Shortly after hurricane Katrina struck, many   
economists estimated that national economic growth would slow by about one      
percentage point in the last half of 2005, and increase by about the same amount
in the first half of 2006. The majority of the impact would obviously be in     
Louisiana and Mississippi, but the slowdown was expected to affect most of the  
country. After more consideration, the consensus now seems to be that the impact
on the national economy will be about half of that previously estimated, and,   
with one exception, the impact will essentially be concentrated in the states   
which were directly affected by the storm.                                      

 The one exception-a significant one-is energy prices. While gasoline prices
are now below the levels they spiked to for several weeks immediately following 
Katrina in most if not all of the country and oil prices have receded to around 
$60 a barrel from a peak of $70.85, gasoline and oil prices are still very high 
relative to not long ago. The situation with natural gas is much more dire;     
Katrina had a larger effect on gas production than oil production in the Gulf.  
Inventories of gas are very low as a result; a cold winter could result in      
shortages. Prices of both natural gas and heating oil will be much higher this  
winter than last. A further sharp rise in energy prices, aside from the effect  
on overall inflation as it flows through the economy, could be enough to tip the
country into recession and slow Maryland's growth precipitously, if not bring it
to a halt.                                                                      

 Rising interest rates could bring a dramatic slowing to the housing market,
which has been a significant impetus to the State's economy. The Federal Reserve
has raised interest rates 25 basis points for twelve consecutive meetings. Not  
until recently have the increases in the Federal funds rate affected long-term  
interest rates. Fixed-rate 30 year mortgages are currently hovering around 6%,  
roughly where they have stood since the end of 2002. The regulatory steps the   
Fed is taking to restrict the expansion of new types of mortgages which can be  
risky for many borrowers may perhaps have more of an impact. Given Maryland's   
relative lack of developable land and the stability the Federal presence        
currently lends to the State's economy, Maryland's housing market is probably at
less risk than most others that have grown similarly over the past several      
years.                                                                          

   Finally, the largest positive risk in the outlook is the Base Realignment and
Closure process. President Bush signed the commission's report on September 15; 
Congress has 45 legislative days to disapprove the report or it has the force   
and effect of law. As adjusted by the BRAC Commission, Maryland will gain a net 
of about 6,000 jobs. The bulk of the new jobs will be at Ft. Meade (5,300) and  
Aberdeen Proving Grounds (2,200). Estimates of the new jobs created indirectly  
through this process range from 5,000 to 14,000; longer-term, the number of     
direct, indirect and induced jobs could reach as high as 60,000. Many industries
will be affected from central Maryland through Harford County, and the boost to 
the State's economy will be substantial. The process wonbe complete for a number
of years, although the first impacts will begin to be seen in 2007.             

  Economic Factors and Next Year's Budget. The State's total budget for fiscal
year 2006 totals $25.9 billion, a 4.2 percent increase over fiscal year 2005.   
The budget for fiscal year 2006 includes an increase of $396.6 million in public
school education, kindergarten through grade 12 and an increase of $371 million 
in the Medicaid budget. The fiscal year 2006 budget also allots $79.1 million to
build state and local correctional facilities and $8.5 million for drug         
treatment programs. Maryland's capital budgets for fiscal year 2006 total       
approximately $2.8 billion. This amount includes $947 million for state-owned   
capital projects as well as capital programs that provide grants and loans to   
local governments and the private and non-profit sectors. The remainder of the  
capital budget, $1.9 billion is directed to highway projects, mass transit, and 
other transportation improvement. The proposed budget protects the State Reserve
Fund and projects that the balance at the end of fiscal year 2006 will total    
$796 million, an increase of $256 million over fiscal year 2005.                

Major Budgetary Initiatives. The budget for fiscal year 2006 includes     
increases in public school education, kindergarten through grade 12 and in the  
Medicaid budget. Legislation was passed last year to assist the Chesapeake Bay  
Restoration Fund and, accordingly, $36 million has been provided to upgrade     
Maryland's most needy wastewater treatment plants. Over the next six years, the 
fund will provide nearly $1 billion to improve these plants. Maryland's capital 
budget includes funding for transportation improvements and to build state and  
local correctional facilities, as well as for capital programs that provide     
grants and loans to local governments and the private and non-profit sectors.   

  Financial Analysis of the State's Funds. As of the end of the current fiscal
year, the State's governmental funds reported a combined fund balance of $3.2   
billion, an increase of $1.3 billion from the prior year. The combined fund     
balance includes $308 million in unreserved, undesignated fund balance and $777 
million in unreserved, designated fund balance for the general fund. It includes
$173 million in unreserved, undesignated fund balance for the special revenue   
fund and a deficit of $181 million in unreserved, undesignated fund balance for 
the other governmental funds. The remainder of the fund balance is reserved to  
indicate that it is not available for new spending because it has been committed
to: 1) liquidate contracts and purchase orders of the prior period, $671        
million; 2) fund prepaid and inventory items, $442 million; 3) restricted       
revenue carry forwards, $418 million; and 4) reserve for various loans,         
construction projects, and debt service, $30 million. In addition, $540 million 
of the reserved fund balance is in the "State Reserve Fund," and is set aside to
meet future financial needs. The unreserved general fund, fund balance, plus the
amount in the State Reserve Fund, is approximately 7% of the total annual       
expenditures in governmental funds, compared with 3% for the prior year.        

 Debt Management. The State is empowered by law to authorize, issue and sell
general obligation bonds, which are backed by the full faith and credit of the  
State. The State also issues revenue dedicated bonded debt for the Department of
Transportation and various business-type activities whose payment for principal 
and interest comes solely out of revenues received from the respective          
activities. This debt is not backed by the State's full faith and credit. As of 
June 30, 2005, the State had outstanding bonds totaling $8.4 billion. Of this   
amount $4.5 billion were general obligation bonds, backed by the full faith and 
credit of the State. The remaining $3.9 billion was secured solely by the       
specified revenue sources.                                                      

 Ratings. As of September, 2006, all outstanding general obligation bonds of
the State of Maryland are rated AAA by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services and   
Aaa by Moody's Investor's Service, Inc. Any explanation concerning the          
significance of such ratings must be obtained from the rating agencies. There is
no assurance that any ratings will continue for any period of time or that they 
will not be revised or withdrawn.                                               

  Local Issuances. It should be noted that the creditworthiness of obligations
issued by local Maryland issuers may be unrelated to the creditworthiness of    
obligations issued by the State of Maryland, and there is no obligation on the  
part of the State to make payment on such local obligations in the event of     
default.                                                                        

The foregoing information constitutes only a brief summary of some of the 
general factors which may impact certain issuers of bonds contained in the      
Maryland IM-IT and does not purport to be a complete or exhaustive description  
of all adverse conditions to which the issuers of such obligations are subject. 
Additionally, many factors including national economic, social and environmental
policies and conditions, which are not within the control of the issuers of such
bonds, could affect or could have an adverse impact on the financial condition  
of the State and various agencies and political subdivisions thereof. The       
Sponsor is unable to predict whether or to what extent such factors or other    
factors may affect the issuers of the bonds contained in the Maryland IM-IT, the
market value or marketability of such bonds or the ability of the respective    
issuers of such bonds acquired by the Maryland IM-IT to pay interest on or      
principal of such bonds.                                                        

The Maryland IM-IT is susceptible to political, economic or regulatory    
factors affecting issuers of Maryland municipal obligations (the "Maryland      
Municipal Obligations"). These include the possible adverse effects of certain  
Maryland constitutional amendments, legislative measures, voter initiatives and 
other matters that are described. The information provided above is only a brief
summary of the complex factors affecting the financial situation in Maryland and
is derived from sources that are generally available to investors and are       
believed to be accurate. No independent verification has been made of the       
accuracy or completeness of any of the following information. It is based in    
part on information obtained from various State and local agencies in Maryland  
or contained in Official Statements for various Maryland Municipal Obligations. 

Massachusetts Risk Factors

  Economic Outlook. Massachusetts is starting to recover economically. Our
Commonwealth is home to many world-renowned institutions of medicine and higher 
education, both public and private, keeping the economy relatively stable and an
incubator for new ideas and growth. Unemployment has dropped due to this        
stabilization.                                                                  

  The Commonwealth with an international reputation for medical, cultural,
historical and educational institutions remains the economic and educational hub
of New England. The Commonwealth's economy remains diversified, but its         
strongest component is its knowledge - based technology and service industries. 
Massachusetts' infrastructure provides strong support for this knowledge-based  
economy. There are over 120 colleges and universities located in Massachusetts, 
and the 2000 US Census, updated in March of 2002, estimated that 34.3% of the   
residents over age 25 have earned bachelor's degrees, compared to an estimate of
26.7% for the United States as a whole. Massachusetts ranks third in the nation 
in educational attainment by age 25 within only 1.5% of the leader, Colorado.   

  Inflation continued to rise though in the past year. The Boston consumer
price index rose nearly 4% from July 2004 to July 2005. However, fuel and       
utilities prices rose nearly 16% and transportation 6%. Extended to September   
2005 to include the oil price shock from Hurricane Katrina, inflation was 8.4%  
with a huge 34% jump in fuel and utilities prices and a nearly 24% rise in other
transportation prices. Though the oil price shock seems to be abating, it will  
effect budgeting decisions throughout FY06.                                     

 Per capita net income continues to rise in the Commonwealth faster than
inflation. Per capita net income rose 5.3% in FY05, though lagging behind the   
6.5% rise nationally. However, on a dollar basis, per capita net income is over 
$9,200 higher than the national average.                                        

     Unemployment declined throughout the year, but spiked in September of 2005,
due to Katrina. Preliminary figures indicate that the downward trend is resuming
in October. The unemployment rate in the Commonwealth stood at 4.8% in October. 
This figure is down from a high of 5.1% early last year. The Commonwealth is    
still below the national rate of 5.0%.                                          

Net Assets. The liabilities of the Commonwealth exceeded its assets at the
end of fiscal year 2005 by over $8.5 billion. Of this amount, "unrestricted net 
assets" is reported as a negative $14.6 billion. The primary reason for negative
unrestricted net assets is that the Commonwealth is incurring long-term         
obligations to either construct or assist political subdivisions in constructing
assets owned by these political subdivisions. For example, upon completion, the 
Central Artery / Third Harbor Tunnel will be owned by the Massachusetts Turnpike
Authority and the Massachusetts Port Authority. The Commonwealth, however, is   
paying for the construction of these assets and retains $5.4 billion of related 
debt. Similarly, the Commonwealth has a liability of $8.7 billion for its share 
of the construction costs of schools owned and operated by municipalities. In   
fiscal year 2005, new legislation changed the funding of school construction    
from direct appropriations to a dedicated portion of the sales tax administered 
by the new Massachusetts School Building Authority (MSBA), a "blended" component
unit of the Commonwealth. Also, the authority's enabling legislation obligated  
the authority for projects that had previously been on a waiting list. This     
change caused an increase in the liability for school construction from $3.6    
billion in fiscal year 2004 to $8.7 billion in fiscal year 2005. Finally,       
significant restricted net asset balances were set aside for unemployment       
benefits and debt retirement.                                                   

     Changes in Net Assets. The Commonwealth's net assets decreased by over $4.6
billion in fiscal year 2005. Net assets of governmental activities decreased by 
the majority of this $4.6 billion, incurring a $5.2 billion deficit during the  
fiscal year. The decrease in net assets is primarily attributable to the        
aforementioned school construction activity. However, this was somewhat offset  
by an increase in tax revenues by nearly $1.2 billion above prior year          
collections. Net assets of the business type activities showed an increase of   
nearly $561 million. Expenses of governmental activities were nearly $39.5      
billion. General revenue for the Commonwealth, net of transfers, but including  
taxes, investment income and tobacco settlement income from governmental        
activities was over $18.7 billion.                                              

Governmental Fund Balances. As of the close of fiscal year 2005, the  
Commonwealth's governmental funds reported a combined ending fund balance of    
over $5.0 billion. Of the $5.0 billion nearly $1.6 billion represents unreserved
fund balance. This is an increase from previous years due to an increase in the 
general fund balance of $1.6 billion. The highway fund maintains a deficit of   
over $791 million. The highway fund's deficit increased by $117 million from the
prior year. The unreserved general fund balance of over $1.7 billion offsets the
highway fund deficit. Similar to last year, a $126.9 million has been declared  
as a receivable in the governmental funds related to anticipated tobacco        
settlement proceeds in fiscal year 2006.                                        

Additionally, governmental reserved fund balances total nearly $3.5   
billion. They include nearly $330 million for continuing appropriations, $305   
million of spending that is yet to be identified by the legislature, over $1.7  
billion for stabilization, nearly $29 million in bond proceeds reserved for     
capital projects, most of which are connected with the Boston Convention and    
Exhibition Center project and nearly $364 million reserved for retirement of    
indebtedness, the vast majority of which is held in escrows related to crossover
refunding bonds. Nearly $132 million is reserved for the CA/T owner controlled  
insurance program for workers' compensation and general liability. This reserve 
will be used to fund $73 million of projected long-term claims payable with the 
remaining $59 million represents amounts currently due and accumulated surplus. 

   To meet the fiscal challenges of fiscal 2005 and beyond, the Commonwealth
took a series of measures to remain in fiscal balance. At the beginning of the  
fiscal year, $343 million was transferred from the Stabilization Fund to pay for
current expenditures. However, higher than expected tax revenues resulted in a  
year end inflows to the fund of $691 million from surplus. Also in fiscal year  
2006, an additional 0.5% of current year net tax revenues, or $86 million, was  
deposited into the Stabilization Fund. In addition, $136 million of tax revenue 
withheld by control measures restricting tax growth in excess of inflation was  
deposited into the Stabilization Fund. Tobacco settlement proceeds for the year 
were $257 million. All of the tobacco settlement proceeds for the year were used
in support of current operations.                                               

 Budgetary Highlights. Differences between the original budget and final
budget expenditures amount to nearly $355 million, exclusive of transfers. As   
revenues continued to increase this fiscal year, supplemental budget legislation
grew. An initial supplemental operating budget of nearly $121 million, inclusive
of $32 million in collective bargaining agreements for higher education         
employees, $34 million for costs associated with snow and ice removal, $12      
million for private counsel compensation for public defenders and $43 million   
for a variety of other programs and services. A second supplemental operating   
budget including an additional $41 million for snow and ice removal, $21 million
for health insurance premium costs and $9 million for substance abuse treatment 
to ensure the receipt of $15 million in federal funds from the substance abuse  
block grant. The legislation also included $8 million for a variety of programs 
and services. A final supplemental budget for over $129 million including $72   
million in additional collective bargaining agreement funding, $6 million to    
fund workers compensation and utility costs for the Department of Corrections,  
$24 million to cover a shortfall in the uncompensated care pool and the         
remainder for a large number of programs and services. The original budget was  
passed on June 25, 2004, just before the start of fiscal year 2005. Transfers of
revenues and expenditures largely related to stabilization activity and taxation
transfers resulted in nearly $2 billion of additional financial uses, net.      

     Debt Administration. The Commonwealth issues short-term and long-term debt.
Debt that is general obligation in nature is backed by the full faith and credit
of the Commonwealth and paid from governmental funds. Additionally, short-term  
notes are issued and redeemed annually. The Commonwealth issued nearly $2.7     
billion in debt this year. Of this amount, nearly $1.4 billion was used to fund 
ongoing projects and nearly $1.3 billion was in the form of general and special 
obligation refunding bonds, taking advantage of low interest rates. Of the $1.4 
billion in new issuances, $500 million was used to fund school construction     
through the MSBA. An additional $227 million was generated through a second     
special obligation crossover refunding transaction. Though this is a legal      
defeasance of debt, because of the nature of the transaction and the use of its 
proceeds, an accounting defeasance is not accomplished. Subsequent to year-end, 
the Commonwealth completed three additional bond transactions, with a $60       
million portion of the third transaction sold as a taxable transaction.         

    Ratings. As of September 2006, all outstanding general obligation bonds of
the Commonwealth of Massachusetts are rated AA by Standard & Poor's Ratings     
Services and Aa2 by Moody's Investor's Service, Inc. Any explanation concerning 
the significance of such ratings must be obtained from the rating agencies.     
There is no assurance that any ratings will continue for any period of time or  
that they will not be revised or withdrawn.                                     

Local Issuances. It should be noted that the creditworthiness of      
obligations issued by local Massachusetts issuers may be unrelated to the       
creditworthiness of obligations issued by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and
there is no obligation on the part of the Commonwealth to make payment on such  
local obligations in the event of default.                                      

   The foregoing information constitutes only a brief summary of some of the
general factors which may impact certain issuers of bonds contained in the      
Massachusetts IM-IT and does not purport to be a complete or exhaustive         
description of all adverse conditions to which the issuers of such obligations  
are subject. Additionally, many factors including national economic, social and 
environmental policies and conditions, which are not within the control of the  
issuers of such bonds, could affect or could have an adverse impact on the      
financial condition of the Commonwealth and various agencies and political      
subdivisions thereof. The Sponsor is unable to predict whether or to what extent
such factors or other factors may affect the issuers of the bonds contained in  
the Massachusetts IM-IT, the market value or marketability of such bonds or the 
ability of the respective issuers of such bonds acquired by the Massachusetts   
IM-IT to pay interest on or principal of such bonds.                            

     The Massachusetts IM-IT is susceptible to political, economic or regulatory
factors affecting issuers of Massachusetts municipal obligations (the           
"Massachusetts Municipal Obligations"). These include the possible adverse      
effects of certain Massachusetts constitutional amendments, legislative         
measures, voter initiatives and other matters that are described. The

 Michigan Risk Factors

  Generally. Michigan's economy relies on the performance of the manufacturing
sector in general and the auto industry specifically. Given extremely weak      
manufacturing employment performance, declining vehicle production, continued   
declines in Big 3 market share along with continued supply rationalization among
vehicle suppliers, Michigan's employment performance has been below the national
average. Substantial productivity gains in the manufacturing sector and vehicle 
industry have also contributed to Michigan's sub-par employment performance.    

For 2005, employment is estimated to have declined by 13,000 jobs (0.3    
percent) - the fifth straight year that Michigan employment has declined. From  
Michigan's employment peak in June 2000, Michigan has lost approximately 330,000
jobs. However, there are signs the Michigan labor market may be improving.      
Through November 2005, state employment has increased in three of the last four 
months. Personal income was up an estimated 4.6 percent and wages and salaries  
income was up an estimated 3.0 percent in 2005. Both exceeded the increase in   
consumer prices, as measured by the Detroit consumer price index, which is      
estimated at 2.7 percent for 2005.                                              

   With continued U.S. economic growth, smaller declines in manufacturing sector
employment, and improvements in the private non-manufacturing section, Michigan 
employment is expected to grow 0.5 percent in 2006, with employment gains       
averaging about 5,000 jobs per quarter. Michigan personal income and wages and  
salaries income are projected to rise 5.3 percent and 4.1 percent, respectively,
in 2006. Consumer prices are projected to increase 2.5 percent.                 

   Revenues and Expenditures. In recent years, the State of Michigan has, except
as described below, reported its financial results in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles. Revenue growth in 2005 benefited from strong    
growth in annual payments for the income tax and single business tax. During    
fiscal year 2005, the State was again faced with difficult budget challenges    
resulting in significant expenditure reductions. In March 2005, Executive Order 
2005-7 was issued authorizing expenditure reductions of $295.1 million and      
transfers of unexpended balances and excess revenues from restricted revenue    
sources totaling $8.2 million to be used as general fund, general purpose       
revenues.                                                                       

 In addition to the executive order spending reductions, the original budget
was amended by various supplemental appropriations and appropriation reductions.
General-purpose tax revenues of $8.4 billion were $186.1 million more than the  
original estimate of $8.2 billion. Restricted revenue inflows of $14.3 billion  
were $215.3 million more than the estimated $14.1 billion. The General Fund     
received transfers of $465.1 million from other appropriated funds; the largest 
transfers were from the Liquor Purchase Revolving Fund and the Counter-Cyclical 
Budget and Economic Stabilization Fund. Difference between the final budget and 
actual spending result from spending authority lapses of $65.4 million and      
restricted revenue authorized but not spent of $7.8 million. The Department of  
Human Services finished the year with line item over-expenditures of $8.0       
million. All other agencies finished the year with lapses.                      

   In November of 1997, the State Legislature adopted legislation to provide for
the funding of claims of local school districts, some of whom had alleged in a  
lawsuit, Durant v. State of Michigan, that the State had, over a period of      
years, paid less in school aid than required by the State's Constitution. Under 
this legislation, the State paid to school districts which were plaintiffs in   
the suit approximately $212 million from the Budget Stabilization Fund on April
15, 1998, and will be required to pay to other school districts an estimated    
amount of $632 million over time. Those payments, which commenced in fiscal year
1998-99, are being paid from the Budget Stabilization Fund and the General Fund,
half in annual payments over 10 years and half in annual payments over 15 years.

  The Michigan Constitution of 1963 limits the amount of total revenues of the
State raised from taxes and certain other sources to a level for each fiscal    
year equal to a percentage of the State's personal income for the prior calendar
year. In the event that the State's total revenues exceed the limit by 1 percent
or more, the Michigan Constitution of 1963 requires that the excess be refunded 
to taxpayers. There can be no assurance that any financial difficulties the     
State may experience will not adversely affect the market value or marketability
of the Bonds or the ability of the respective obligors to pay interest on or    
principal of the Bonds, particularly in view of the dependency of local         
governments and other authorities upon State aid and reimbursement programs and,
in the case of bonds issued by the State Building Authority, the dependency of  
the State Building Authority on the receipt of rental payments from the State to
meet debt service requirements upon such bonds. In the 1991 fiscal year, the    
State deferred certain scheduled cash payments to municipalities, school        
districts, universities and community colleges. While such deferrals were made  
up at specified later dates, similar future deferrals could have an adverse     
impact on the cash position of some local governmental units. Additionally, the 
State reduced revenue sharing payments to municipalities below that level       
otherwise provided under formulas in each of those years.                       

 The Trust may contain general obligation bonds of local units of government
pledging the full faith and credit of the local unit which are payable from the 
levy of ad valorem taxes on taxable property within the jurisdiction of the     
local unit. Such bonds issued prior to December 22, 1978, or issued after       
December 22, 1978 with the approval of the electors of the local unit, are      
payable from property taxes levied without limitation as to rate or amount. With
respect to bonds issued after December 22, 1978, and which were not approved by 
the electors of the local unit, the tax levy of the local unit for debt service 
purposes is subject to constitutional, statutory and charter tax rate           
limitations. In addition, several major industrial corporations have instituted 
challenges of their ad valorem property tax assessments in a number of local    
municipal units in the State. If successful, such challenges could have an      
adverse impact on the ad valorem tax bases of such units which could adversely  
affect their ability to raise funds for operation and debt service requirements.

   Assets. The State's combined net assets increased $59.9 million (0.3 percent)
over the course of this fiscal year's operations. The net assets of the         
governmental activities increased $329.0 million (2.0 percent) and business-type
activities had a decrease of $269.0 million (or 23.0 percent). The largest      
component, $15.2 billion, of the State's net assets reflects its investment, in 
capital assets (e.g., land, buildings, equipment, infrastructure, and others),  
less any related debt outstanding that was needed to acquire or construct the   
assets. Restricted net assets are the next largest component, comprising $3.0   
billion. These represent resources that are subject to external restrictions,   
constitutional provisions, or enabling legislation on how they can be used. The 
State's unrestricted net assets were ($925.3) million as of the close of the    
year. A positive balance in unrestricted net assets represents excess assets    
available to meet ongoing obligations. A negative balance means that it would be
necessary to convert restricted assets to unrestricted assets if all ongoing    
obligations were immediately due and payable.                                   

Debt Management. The State Constitution authorizes general obligation     
long-term borrowing, subject to approval by the Legislature and a majority of   
voters at a general election. During the year, the State issued general         
obligation refunding bonds to retire older bonds and to make loans to local     
school districts, resulting in an increase of $117.6 million. In addition, the  
State issued revenue-dedicated bonds to retire grant anticipation notes and to  
secure more favorable interest rates and reduce certain debt service payments.  

   Ratings. As of September 2006, State of Michigan general obligation bonds are
rated AA by Standard & Poor's, Aa2 by Moody's. There can be no assurance that   
such ratings will be maintained in the future. It should be noted that the      
creditworthiness of obligations issued by local Michigan issuers may be         
unrelated to the creditworthiness of obligations issued by the State of         
Michigan, and that there is no obligation on the part of the State to make      
payment on such local obligations in the event of default.                      

Each Michigan Trust is susceptible to political, economic or regulatory

Minnesota Risk Factors

 Economic Outlook. Minnesota's economy grew during the 2005 fiscal year, but
by most measures it did not perform as well as the U.S. averages. The state's   
unemployment rate was the bright spot, falling from 4.6 percent to 3.7 percent  
between June 2004 and June 2005. The U.S. average also fell over that same      
12-month span, but only by 0.6 percentage points. Minnesota's unemployment rate 
is now 1.3 percentage points below the U.S. average rate of 5.0 percent.        
Historically, Minnesota's unemployment rate has been between 1 and 1.5          
percentage points less than the U.S. average. At the end of fiscal 2004,        
Minnesota was just 1 percentage point below the U.S. average.                   

 Payroll employment grew by 33,800 jobs between June 2004 and June 2005, the
largest fiscal year increase since the 2000 fiscal year. In June 2005, total    
payroll employment in Minnesota exceeded its pre-recession highs. The national  
economy exceeded its pre-recession employment high in January 2005. Payroll     
employment in Minnesota increased by 1.3 percent in the twelve months between   
June 2004 and June 2005, while nationally payroll employment increased by 1.6   
percent.                                                                        

 Personal income growth in Minnesota also lagged the U.S. averages. Personal
income grew 6 percent between the second quarter of 2004 and the second quarter 
of 2005. The U.S. average growth rate was 6.4 percent. In calendar 2004, per    
capita personal income in Minnesota was $36,173, 9.5 percent above the U.S.     
average. Minnesota ranked ninth among all states in personal income per capita. 
In fiscal 2006, the economy is expected to slow nationally and in Minnesota.    
Employment and income are expected to continue to grow, but the rate of growth  
is projected to be slightly slower than that observed in fiscal 2005, and well  
below the growth rates of the late 1990s.                                       

In Minnesota, personal income is expected to increase by 4.2 percent, 1.8 
percentage points less than in fiscal 2005. Higher interest rates, continued    
high energy prices, and lost production due to Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and    
Wilma will slow U.S. economic growth through at least early 2006. Payroll       
employment in Minnesota is projected to grow at a 1 percent rate during fiscal  
2006. U.S. payroll employment is projected to grow at a 1.6 percent annual rate.
Private construction spending in storm damaged areas along the Gulf Coast,      
federal disaster assistance for rebuilding and restoring damaged infrastructure,
and a return to normal production levels by energy producers along the Gulf will
provide a boost to the national economy, but have relatively little impact on   
Minnesota.                                                                      

Major Initiatives. The fiscal year 2005 budget was adopted in May 2003. To
meet the constitutional requirements for a balanced budget for the state General
Fund, material actions were taken to address a $1.751 billion budgetary         
shortfall projected for fiscal year 2005.                                       

While no general tax increases were enacted, General Fund resources were  
increased by $473 million or 3.4 percent. Revenue collection changes increased  
fiscal year 2005 tax revenues by $167 million. Of this amount, $123 million     
resulted from eliminating the repeal of the June sales tax acceleration that    
requires remitters to advance a portion of their estimated July tax payments in 
June. Non-tax revenues were increased by $106 million from fee increases and    
changes to other non-tax revenues deposited to the General Fund. Transfers from 
other state funds were increased $211 million; the largest portion, $192        
million, reflected utilization of excess balances in the state's Health Care    
Access Fund.                                                                    

  The enacted General Fund budget included spending reductions totaling $1.253
billion, 8.1 percent below forecast General Fund spending for the fiscal year.  
Most of these reductions represented permanent reductions made across all major 
spending areas. Spending for K-12 education, representing 42 percent of the     
budget, was largely unchanged, down $122 million. General education revenues per
student were held at 2003 levels. Health and human services spending, at 26     
percent of the budget, was reduced by $439 million through a combination of     
changes in eligibility, utilization, and provider payments. Resulting balances  
in the state's Health Care Access Fund resulting from program changes were      
transferred into the General Fund. Spending for all other areas was reduced $692
million. Reductions varied by specific area including 3 percent from state      
courts, 7 percent for higher education, 19 percent for property tax and local   
government aids, and an average 15 percent reduction for most state agencies.   

 Finally, there is a material change in the status of General Fund budgetary
reserves. These reserves had been depleted in fiscal year 2003 as part of budget
balancing actions. Provisions enacted in 2003 restored the budgetary reserve to 
$300 million in fiscal year 2004. That amount was increased to $522 million in  
2005. In addition, current law provides that any forecast balances during the   
year first be used to restore $350 million to Cash Flow Account designation, and
then to increase the Budget Reserve Account an additional $131 million to $653  
million. This occurred in November 2004.                                        

Additional forecast balances occurring in the biennium were automatically 
allocated to reversing the school payment changes enacted in fiscal year 2004.  
During fiscal year 2005, $268 million was allocated for this purpose. The action
affected formula entitlement payments to school districts that are funded in a  
manner that requires a final payment be made in the following state fiscal year.
The payment schedule was modified from an 80 percent payment with a 20 percent  
settlement in the following year to an 84.3 percent payment with a 15.7 percent 
settlement. This action reduced the budget to GAAP difference related to the    
education aids in the General Fund.                                             

Debt Management. The state debt management policy has four guidelines. The
first requires that the ratio of budgeted biennial debt service expenditures for
general obligation bonded debt, paid by transfers from the General Fund, should 
not exceed 3.0 percent of total projected biennial General Fund non-dedicated   
revenues, net of refunds, on a budgetary basis. The ratio of transfers to net   
non-dedicated revenues for the biennium ending June 30, 2005 is 2.1 percent. The
second and third guidelines state that general obligation bonded debt should not
exceed 2.5 percent of the total personal income for the state, and also that the
total debt of state agencies and the University of Minnesota should not exceed  
3.5 percent of total personal income. These ratios were 1.9 percent and 3.1     
percent, respectively, based on debt outstanding at June 30, 2005, and estimated
personal income for the year ended on that date. The fourth guideline states    
that the total amount of state general obligation debt, moral obligation debt,  
state bond guarantees, equipment capital leases and real estate leases should   
not exceed 5.0 percent of the total personal income for the state. The ratio was
3.2 percent based on information at June 30, 2005.                              

Cash Management. The majority of cash is held in the state treasury and   
commingled in state bank accounts. The cash in individual funds may be invested 
separately where permitted by statute. However, cash in most funds is invested  
as a part of an investment pool. Investment earnings of the pools are allocated 
to the individual funds where provided by statute. Earnings for all other       
participants are credited to the General Fund.                                  

 Minnesota statutes require that deposits be secured by depository insurance
or a combination of depository insurance and collateral securities held in the  
state's name by an agent of the state. This statute further requires that such  
insurance and collateral shall be in amounts sufficient to ensure that the      
deposits do not exceed 90 percent of the sum of the insured amount and the fair 
value of the collateral.                                                        

  The State Board of Investment manages the majority of the state's investing.
Minnesota statutes broadly restrict investment to obligations and stocks of U.S.
and Canadian governments, their agencies and their registered corporations,     
short-term obligations of specified high quality, restricted participation as a 
limited partner in venture capital, real estate, or resource equity investments 
and restricted participation in registered mutual funds.                        

Legislation/Litigation. On May 8, 1998, Minnesota settled its lawsuit with
the tobacco industry, resulting in a new revenue stream for the state. A small  
portion of the settlement ($202 million) was dedicated by the courts for        
specific purposes and will not be a part of the state's general revenues. A     
larger portion of the settlement (the one-time payments) was dedicated by the   
Governor and the legislature to be placed into endowments for specific purposes.
The balance (the annual payments) will be deposited into the state's General    
Fund.                                                                           

 The 2002 legislature expanded the uses of one-time tobacco settlement funds
to allow for short-term borrowing by the state effective July 2003. The         
legislature created the endowments in response to the 1998 settlement and       
dedicated the proceeds to medical education and tobacco prevention. Up to five  
percent of the endowment's value is appropriated each year for health programs. 
After the recent law changes, appropriations may still be issued for medical    
education and tobacco prevention, but the state may use endowment balances if   
necessary to meet short-term cash flow needs.                                   

At any given time there may be numerous civil actions pending against the 
state of Minnesota which could, if determined adversely to the state, affect the
state's expenditures and, in some cases, its revenues.                          

Risk Management. Minnesota statutes permit the purchase of insurance on   
state-owned buildings and contents. The Commissioner of the Department of       
Administration may authorize the purchase of insurance on state properties      
should it be deemed necessary and appropriate to protect buildings and contents.
All losses of state property are self-insured, covered by programs of the Risk  
Management Fund (an internal service fund), or covered by insurance policies    
purchased by the Risk Management Fund on behalf of state agencies. Employees'   
health and a portion of dental insurance are self-insured. Employees' life and  
the remaining dental insurance are provided through contracts with outside      
organizations. Premiums collected for these benefits have been more than        
sufficient to cover claims submitted.                                           

Ratings. As of September 2006, all outstanding general obligation bonds of
the State of Minnesota are rated AAA by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services and  
Aa1 by Moody's Investor's Service, Inc. Any explanation concerning the          
significance of such ratings must be obtained from the rating agencies. There is
no assurance that any ratings will continue for any period of time or that they 
will not be revised or withdrawn.                                               

  Local Issuances. It should be noted that the creditworthiness of obligations
issued by local Minnesota issuers may be unrelated to the creditworthiness of   
obligations issued by the State of Minnesota, and there is no obligation on the 
part of the state to make payment on such local obligations in the event of     
default.                                                                        

The foregoing information constitutes only a brief summary of some of the 
general factors which may impact certain issuers of bonds contained in the      
Minnesota IM-IT and does not purport to be a complete or exhaustive description 
of all adverse conditions to which the issuers of such obligations are subject. 
Additionally, many factors including national economic, social and environmental
policies and conditions, which are not within the control of the issuers of such
bonds, could affect or could have an adverse impact on the financial condition  
of the state and various agencies and political subdivisions thereof. The       
Sponsor is unable to predict whether or to what extent such factors or other    
factors may affect the issuers of the bonds contained in the Minnesota IM-IT,   
the market value or marketability of such bonds or the ability of the respective
issuers of such bonds acquired by the Minnesota IM-IT to pay interest on or     
principal of such bonds.                                                        

The Minnesota IM-IT is susceptible to political, economic or regulatory   
factors affecting issuers of Minnesota (the "Minnesota Municipal Obligations"). 
These include the possible adverse effects of certain Minnesota constitutional  
amendments, legislative measures, voter initiatives and other matters that are  
described. The information provided above is only a brief summary of the complex
factors affecting the financial situation in Minnesota and is derived from      
sources that are generally available to investors and are believed to be        
accurate. No independent verification has been made of the accuracy or          
completeness of any of the following information. It is based in part on        
information obtained from various state and local agencies in Minnesota or      
contained in Official Statements for various Minnesota Municipal Obligations.   

 Missouri Risk Factors

Economic Outlook. The State provides a range of services in the areas of  
agriculture, education, health and social services, transportation systems,     
public safety, law enforcement, judicial systems, economic development,         
conservation and natural resources, labor relations, and general administration.

  The State operates on a legally adopted budget in order to ensure compliance
with legal provisions embodied in the annual appropriated budget passed by the  
General Assembly and approved by the Governor prior to the beginning of the     
fiscal year. If appropriations are not sufficient for a fiscal year,            
supplemental amounts are requested during the next legislative session by the   
same process that original appropriations are requested. Budgetary control is   
maintained at the departmental level. Expenditures cannot exceed the            
appropriation amounts at the individual appropriation level. Also, the Governor 
has the authority to reduce the allotments of appropriations in any fund if it  
appears that the revenue estimate will not be met. Unexpended appropriations    
lapse at the end of each appropriation year, unless reappropriated to the       
following appropriation year.                                                   

The economic future of Missouri is increasingly positive as evidenced by  
improving economic indicators and statistics. Since July of 2003, the State's   
jobs growth was ranked second in the nation with the addition of more than      
80,000 jobs, an increase of more than 3%. In addition to improving employment   
numbers, Missouri's economy is expanding as evidenced by the purchasing         
manager's index that considers variables such as new orders, inventory levels,  
and production. Further, Missouri's cost of living remains well below the nation
average, currently ranked 37th out of 48 participating states. While Missouri's 
economic outlook is positive, the State faces significant funding challenges    
including Medicaid, elementary and secondary education, higher education, and   
the correctional institutions. The State's fiscal year 2004 net revenue         
collections, although growing, are still below the pre-recession collections of 
fiscal year 2001. Simultaneously, the expenditure demands of priority programs  
continue to outpace general revenue collections.                                

 The primary source of Missouri's net revenue collections is personal income
tax, which accounts for approximately 60% of total tax collections. In recent   
years however, changes in personal income have not been mimicked by similar     
changes in income tax collections.                                              

   Capital Assets: The State's investment in capital assets for its governmental
and business-type activities as of June 30, 2004, was $27.4 billion (net of     
accumulated depreciation). This investment in capital assets includes           
construction in progress, infrastructure in progress, land, land improvements,  
buildings and improvements, equipment, and infrastructure. The total increase in
the State's investment in capital assets for the current fiscal year was 0.9%.  

 Long-term debt: At the end of fiscal year 2004, the State had total general
obligation and other bonded debt outstanding of $2.5 billion. Of this amount,   
$855.1 million comprises debt backed by the full faith and credit of the        
government. During fiscal year 2004, $150,305,000 of general obligation         
refunding bonds were issued to refund $155,920,000 of general obligation bonds  
and to take advantage of lower interest rates. Other revenue refunding bonds of 
$116,030,000 were issued to refund $116,015,000 of other revenue bonds and to   
take advantage of lower interest rates. Other bonds were issued in the amount of
$254,000,000. Principal amounts retired in fiscal year 2004 were $40,015,000 for
general obligation bonds and $36,460,000 for other revenue bonds.               

 The original budget is the first complete appropriated budget that is truly
agreed to and finally passed, and signed by the Governor. The final budget      
includes emergency and supplemental appropriations, transfers, and increases to 
estimated appropriations. Budgeted appropriations for fiscal year 2004 from the 
general fund were $15.2 billion original budget and $15.5 billion revised       
budget. Actual spending was $14.7 billion. Reasons for the budget variances     
include:                                                                        

 o    Revenue refunds were less than expected partially due to lower tax
credit utilization.                                         

o    Federal grants received were lower than appropriation authority. 

    o    The late receipt of federal moneys and late contract completion moved
some expenditures from fiscal year 2004 to fiscal year 2005.

     o    Multiple year grants are appropriated in one year but the expenditures
may occur over several years.                               

o    Appropriation authority exceeded cash available for expenditures.

     o    Federal moneys related to Medicaid were lost because the Department of
     Social Services did not have available the money for the required
        state match. Budgeted revenues/transfers in for fiscal year 2004 for
        the general fund was $14.7 billion original budget and $14.8 billion
          revised budget. Actual revenue/transfers in was $14.8 billion. Reasons
for the budget variances include:                           

    o    Revenue growth in fiscal year 2004 outpaced economic growth forecasts
     for the State. Many economic forecasting experts predicted strong
   growth in production, but slow growth in jobs. Since Missouri's
 revenues are highly dependent on withholding and sales taxes,
continued conservatism in the forecast was justified.       

     o    Tax changes at the Federal level, particularly the Jobs and Growth Tax
    Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003, created uncertainty and posed
         substantial downside risk. While some provisions of the Act benefited
       Missouri's revenues, the Act also raised the standard deduction for
many filers and enhanced depreciation allowances.           

Governmental Funds. As of the end of fiscal year 2004, the State's        
governmental funds reported combined ending fund balances of $3.4 billion, an   
increase of $243.4 million or 7.8% over fiscal year 2003. Approximately 60.4% of
this amount constitutes unreserved fund balance, which is available for spending
at the government's discretion. The remainder of fund balance is reserved to    
indicate that it is not available for new spending because it has already been  
committed: 1) for budget reserve, 2) to pay debt service, 3) for loans          
receivable, and 4) for a variety of other restricted purposes                   

Proprietary Funds. The State has three major proprietary funds: State     
Lottery, Unemployment Compensation, and the Petroleum Storage Tank Insurance    
Fund. The State Lottery was established in 1986 to account for the sale of      
lottery tickets and lottery operations. Since 1992, public education has been   
the sole beneficiary of lottery proceeds. Unemployment Compensation accounts for
contributions and payments collected from Missouri employers under the provision
of the "Unemployment Compensation Law". This tax finances benefits for workers  
who become unemployed through no fault of their own. The Petroleum Storage Tank 
Insurance Fund accounts for moneys collected from transport load fees and       
participating owners of petroleum storage tanks. The fund pays cleanup expenses 
from petroleum leaks or spills from underground storage tanks and certain above 
ground storage tanks as well as third party property damage or bodily injury    
resulting from such discharges. This fund is one of the largest insurers of     
tanks in the country.                                                           

The State Lottery Fund's net assets decreased by $7.3 million. Although   
operating income increased because of more robust sales, transfers of public    
education also increased and the value of investments held for grand prize      
winners decreased substantially. The Unemployment Compensation Fund's net assets
decreased by $180.1 million due to employer contributions and intergovernmental 
revenues insufficient to pay claims. During the year, loans from the Federal    
government were obtained as allowed by Title XII of the Social Security Act. The
outstanding Federal liability was $288.6 million at June 30, 2004. The Petroleum
Storage Tank Insurance Fund's net assets increased by $13.6 million due to      
significantly reduced environmental cleanup expenses.                           

The General Fund is the chief operating fund of the State. At the end of  
fiscal year 2004, the State's General Fund reported a total fund balance of $1.2
billion. The net increase in fund balance during fiscal year 2004 was $193.6    
million. Revenues of the general fund totaled $13.9 billion in fiscal year 2004,
an increase of $646.5 million from fiscal year 2003. Factors contributing to    
this increase included the following:                                           

 o    Revenue from taxes increased $417 million from fiscal year 2003 to
         fiscal year 2004. The most significant increase was Individual Income
       Tax, which increased $202 million or 4.6%. This increase was due to
continued economic growth.                                  

o    Contributions and intergovernmental revenues increased by $371.6 
        million during fiscal year 2004 due primarily to an increase of $125
      million in federal receipts for grants or programs financed by the
         U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and an increase of $99.5
    million from federal receipts for grants or programs financed by
miscellaneous federal sources.                              

   o    Cost reimbursement/miscellaneous revenues decreased $93.5 million in
          fiscal year 2004. This was primarily due to a decrease within recovery
          costs of $114.1 million because of a reduction in money recovered from
outside parties.                                            

 Expenditures of the General Fund totaled $11.5 billion in fiscal year 2004,
an increase of $110.1 million from fiscal year 2003. The factors contributing to
the increase included the following:                                            

o    An increase to human services expenditures of $306.8 million due 
        primarily to a $218.1 million increase in payments for mental health
     services provided. There was also an increase of $59.2 million in
        payments to individual recipients for social welfare and an increase
 of $58 million in payments to doctors, hospitals, and similar
institutions who provide medical treatment to social welfare
recipients.                                                 

    o    Debt service principal expenditures decreased by $56.7 million due to
debt refinancing.                                           

The public education fund category provides general and special education 
services to the children of the State and other related functions such as       
library services and student loans. Total fund balance increased by $20.7       
million. Expenditures of the public education funds totaled $3.6 billion in     
fiscal year 2004, an increase of $44.9 million from fiscal year 2003. The major 
factor that contributed to this was an increase of $60.9 million in the         
education expenditures for an increase in aid to educational institutions and   
school districts for expenditures by the institution or the district. There was 
also an increase of $176.3 million to other financing sources and uses due to   
more General Revenue funding and an increase in funds from Lottery.             

  The conservation and environmental protection fund category provides for the
preservation of the State's wildlife and environment. The fund balance increased
by $81.9 million. Revenues of the conservation and environmental protection     
funds totaled $342.4 million for fiscal year 2004, an increase of $1.7 million  
from fiscal year 2003. The factors contributing to the increase included the    
following:                                                                      

o    Taxes increased $4.2 million primarily from an increase of $3.6  
million in conservation sales and use tax.                  

  o    Contributions and intergovernmental revenues decreased $5.6 million
    due mainly to a decrease of $6.3 million in federal receipts for
    grants or programs financed by the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency.                                                     

o    Penalties and Unclaimed Properties increased $1 million due to an
       increase in money received by the state to settle claims for goods,
services or damages against the state.                      

 Expenditures of the conservation and environmental protection funds totaled
$267.9 million for fiscal year 2004, an increase of $19.5 million. The main     
factor that contributed to this was an increase of $101.9 million to            
Intergovernmental Expenditures due to an increase in both aid to local          
governments and loans disbursed to other entities. The transportation and law   
enforcement fund category provides transportation services, road construction   
and maintenance, and the enforcement of vehicle laws and traffic safety. The    
fund balance increased by $15.6 million. Revenues increased $23.6 million during
fiscal year 2004. The major factor contributing to this was an increase of $39.3
million in tax revenues due primarily to an increase of $22.4 million in        
receipts of tax on gasoline for use in motor vehicles.                          

 The State Road Fund accounts for revenues from highway users' fees, federal
reimbursements for highway projects, and bond proceeds to be used for costs of  
constructing and maintaining an adequate state highway system. The fund balance 
increased by $20.9 million in fiscal year 2004. Revenues of the State Road Fund 
decreased during fiscal year 2004 by $119.4 million. The major factor           
contributing to this was a decrease of $82.1 million in Contributions and       
Intergovernmental revenues due mainly to a decrease of $60.8 million in federal 
receipts for grants or programs financed by the U.S. Department of              
Transportation. Other Financing Sources/Uses increased by $243.4 million during 
Fiscal Year 2004. The main factor for this was an increase in proceeds from     
Other Bonds of $254 million due to an issuance of State Road Bonds.             

Business Type Activities. Net assets of the business-type activities      
decreased by $174 million during the fiscal year. The primary reason net assets 
declined relates to the Unemployment Compensation Fund where benefit payments   
far outpaced employer contributions and Federal loans were obtained for the     
difference. Lottery also had a significant decline in net assets because of     
increased transfers to education, however, the decline was offset across all    
business activities because of gains in the Petroleum Storage Tank Insurance    
Fund.                                                                           

  The State's total net assets decreased $570.3 million dollars or 2.1% during
fiscal year 2004. This decrease resulted from increases in bonds and claims     
payable. Capital assets net of related debt and restricted assets, which do not 
represent resources available to pay day-to-day operating expenses, increased by
$28.7 million or 0.1%. The largest component of the State's net assets at $25.4 
billion or 93.3% is invested in capital assets net of related debt, such as     
bonds payable or capital lease obligations. These assets include land,          
infrastructure, buildings, and equipment which are not easily converted to cash 
nor readily available to pay state debts as they come due. Restricted net assets
of the primary government totaled $1.1 billion or 4.1% of total net assets, a   
decrease of 4.0% from the prior year. Net assets are restricted for several     
reasons including constitutional, legal, or external requirements. Examples of  
restricted net assets include lottery proceeds restricted for public education, 
funds restricted for debt service, and certain sales taxes restricted for the   
maintenance of highways or state parks and conservation areas. Also, many       
federal funds are restricted to funding certain programs.                       

Revenues and Expenditures. The slumping economy, federal tax cuts that sap
state revenue, and rapidly increasing health care costs have required decisive  
action each year to balance the budget. While the federal government is allowed 
to run a deficit, Missouri state government must balance its budget each year.  

 Missouri's constitutional revenue and spending limit ("Article X") provides
that over time the growth in state revenues and spending cannot exceed the      
growth in Missouri Personal Income. The Missouri Constitution requires that the 
revenue and spending limit formula use the personal income figure supplied by   
the United States Department of Commerce Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). The 
personal income statistics are designed to measure current economic activity.   
Changes have been made in the methodology for computing the personal income     
statistics in recent years with significant effect on the state's revenue limit.
In 1998 the BEA implemented a change that significantly lowered the revenue and 
spending limit beginning in Fiscal Year 1999. Personal income is the sum of all 
wages and salaries, proprietors and rental income, interest and dividend income,
and transfer payments (such as social security and welfare). Personal income has
never included capital gains made on direct investment in the stock market. In  
1998, the BEA concluded that they were including capital gains made by mutual   
funds that invest in the stock market. The personal income statistics published 
by the BEA now deduct the value of mutual funds' capital gains from personal    
income - about a $2 billion reduction in Missouri Personal Income.              

Strong economic growth resulted in revenues above the total state revenue 
limit in fiscal years 1995 through 1999. The State has refunded to Missouri     
income taxpayers the entire $978.7 million in excess revenue for those years.   
All Article X refunds were initially paid from the General Revenue Fund and     
various other funds reimbursed their share of the refund liability through      
operating transfers to the General Revenue Fund as appropriated by the General  
Assembly.                                                                       

The Missouri Merchants and Manufacturer's Association filed a lawsuit to  
obtain a judicial determination of certain issues relative to this calculation. 
The lawsuit (Missouri Merchants and Manufacturer's Association et al v. State of
Missouri Case No. 99-CV-323530) was remanded with instructions to the Circuit   
Court of Cole County after an appeal to the Missouri Supreme Court. In fiscal   
year 2003, $6 million of Article X refunds relating to prior years revenue      
receipts were paid based on the Cole County Circuit Court decision regarding the
treatment of refundable tax credits in the total state revenue calculation.     

The Missouri Merchants and Manufacturer's Association filed an additional 
lawsuit to obtain a judicial determination of certain issues relative to this   
calculation. The lawsuit (Missouri Merchants and Manufacturer's Association et  
al v. State of Missouri, Case No. 00-CV-325457) was dismissed on April 22, 2002.

Tobacco Settlement. In November 1998 the National Association of Attorney 
Generals announced a national settlement agreement with five major tobacco      
companies. Attorney General Jay Nixon accepted the proposed agreement on behalf 
of the State of Missouri. The agreement is the largest settlement ever achieved 
by the State of Missouri. Over the next 25 years, the state will receive        
approximately $4.5 billion before the settlement's adjustments for inflation and
discounts.                                                                      

In May 2001, Missouri received its first payment of the tobacco settlement
proceeds. It is estimated that the state will receive about $160 million during 
Fiscal Year 2005. The Governor has recommended using a portion of the tobacco   
settlement proceeds to pay for core health care programs while retaining a      
portion for the most critical investments that will improve the lives of        
Missourians in the futures.                                                     

  In 2002, the Governor recommended that the General Assembly pass legislation
that would allow the state to sell a portion of the tobacco settlement proceeds 
in a process called "securitization." The General Assembly passed SB 1191 (2002)
to give the state this option for up to 30 percent of the tobacco settlement    
proceeds. Tobacco securitizations have been completed by other states and are   
somewhat similar to revenue bond borrowing.                                     

Debt Management. Missouri voters have approved constitutional amendments  
providing for the issuance of general obligation bonds used for a number of     
purposes. The amount of general obligation debt that can be issued by the state 
is limited to the amount approved by popular vote plus $1 million.              

   Risk Management. The State attempts to minimize credit and market risks while
maintaining a competitive yield on its investments. Approximately 82% of        
investments held by the State and subject to risk categorization at June 30,
2003, are classified in the lowest risk category as defined by the Governmental 
Accounting Standards Board. All deposits invested by the State Treasurer are    
either insured by federal depository insurance or collateralized.               

Ratings. As of September 2006, all outstanding general obligation bonds of
the State of Missouri are rated AAA by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services and   
Aaa by Moody's Investor's Service, Inc. Any explanation concerning the          
significance of such ratings must be obtained from the rating agencies. There is
no assurance that any ratings will continue for any period of time or that they 
will not be revised or withdrawn.                                               

  Local Issuances. It should be noted that the creditworthiness of obligations
issued by local Missouri issuers may be unrelated to the creditworthiness of    
obligations issued by the State of Missouri, and there is no obligation on the  
part of the State to make payment on such local obligations in the event of     
default.                                                                        

The foregoing information constitutes only a brief summary of some of the 
general factors which may impact certain issuers of bonds contained in the      
Missouri IM-IT and does not purport to be a complete or exhaustive description  
of all adverse conditions to which the issuers of such obligations are subject. 
Additionally, many factors including national economic, social and environmental
policies and conditions, which are not within the control of the issuers of such
bonds, could affect or could have an adverse impact on the financial condition  
of the State and various agencies and political subdivisions thereof. The       
Sponsor is unable to predict whether or to what extent such factors or other    
factors may affect the issuers of the bonds contained in the Missouri IM-IT, the
market value or marketability of such bonds or the ability of the respective    
issuers of such bonds acquired by the Missouri IM-IT to pay interest on or      
principal of such bonds.                                                        

The Missouri IM-IT is susceptible to political, economic or regulatory    
factors affecting issuers of Missouri municipal obligations (the "Missouri      
Municipal Obligations"). These include the possible adverse effects of certain  
Missouri constitutional amendments, legislative measures, voter initiatives and 
other matters that are described. The information provided above is only a brief
summary of the complex factors affecting the financial situation in Missouri and
is derived from sources that are generally available to investors and are       
believed to be accurate. No independent verification has been made of the       
accuracy or completeness of any of the following information. It is based in    
part on information obtained from various State and local agencies in Missouri  
or contained in Official Statements for various Missouri Municipal Obligations. 

 Nebraska Risk Factors

General. The State was admitted to the Union as the thirty-seventh state in
1867. Nebraska's government is divided into three branches: legislative,        
executive and judicial. Nebraska is the only state with a Unicameral            
Legislature, which has 49 non-partisan members. The chief executive is the      
governor, who is elected for a four-year term. Within the executive branch are  
various departments and agencies that perform a variety of functions. Since     
Nebraska's Constitution generally allows no indebtedness, government expenses of
such departments and agencies must be met on a pay-as-you-go basis. The State   
provides a full range of services including: the construction and maintenance of
highways and infrastructure, education, social and health services, public      
safety, conservation of natural resources, economic development, and recreation 
facilities and development.                                                     

Budgetary control of state expenditures is maintained chiefly by three    
processes. First, a budget is required to be adopted through passage of         
appropriation bills by the Legislature. Second, the appropriated funds are      
allocated by program and fund type and are controlled by the executive branch   
through an allotment process. The Legislature may also enact a supplemental     
appropriation bill and other appropriation bills as it deems necessary. Finally,
the State's accounting system is designed to budget check each expenditure to   
ensure the appropriation is not exceeded.                                       

Economic Outlook. The State of Nebraska, located at the heart of the Great
Plains, has a population of about 1.7 million people. Along with positive       
population growth, the state has enjoyed regular economic growth during the past
few years. Historically, the state's economy is less cyclical than the national 
economy; that is, it typically does not grow as quickly as the national economy 
during periods of expansion but also does not contract as much during periods of
recession. With more than 44 million of the state's 49 million acres used for   
farming and ranching, agriculture is a leading component of the Nebraska        
economy. Thus, any changes in agriculture and in the agricultural economy may   
have significant consequences for the overall Nebraska economy.                 

  Current Revenue Outlook. The General Fund operations of the State are almost
entirely dependent upon the income and sales taxes the State receives each year.
Such taxes represent over 92 percent of all General Fund revenues. Net revenue  
from income taxes and sales taxes from all funds for the fiscal year ended June
30, 2004 increased $229 million over the prior year, due to an increased sales  
tax base and a sales tax rate increase to help offset a small decline in income 
tax revenue. In finalizing the biennium budget for the fiscal years ending June
30, 2004 and June 30, 2005, the Legislature, as required by the State           
Constitution, balanced the budget.                                              

For the year ended June 30, 2005 there was a continued increase in taxes  
collected, as income and sales taxes from all funds increased $301 million over 
last year, chiefly due to a $208 million jump in income taxes collected. This   
reflects the steady, solid growth in Nebraska in all areas: jobs, income and    
revenue. Employment continues to have steady, moderate growth. Farm income      
reached record levels in calendar years 2003 and 2004. Calendar year 2005 farm  
income is expected to remain near record levels.                                

The State has seen continued improvement in revenues for the fiscal year  
ending June 30, 2005. Net tax revenue exceeded the prior year by $339 million.  
For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2005, the State's General Fund ended the    
fiscal year with a $617 million cash and investments balance.                   

State Economy. The Bureau of Business Research of the University of       
Nebraska-Lincoln, together with the Nebraska Business Forecast Council, are     
optimistic on Nebraska's economic future, stating that the Nebraska economy     
should expand steadily with moderate growth. Total net taxable retail sales     
growth should continue to receive a boost from the broadening of the sales tax  
base. Sales tax and income tax revenue will also benefit by the increases in    
employment and personnel income.                                                

  Cash Management. All cash is required to be deposited in the State Treasury.
At the direction of the State Treasurer, the State Investment Officer invests   
all cash in the Operating Investment Pool (OIP). This pool is comprised of some 
short-term investments and many medium-term investments. Interest earnings are  
credited on a monthly basis to each fund eligible to earn interest. All interest
earnings not credited to other funds are deposited in the General Fund.         

At June 30, 2005, there was $1.9 billion invested in the OIP. This was    
invested as follows: 26 percent in government securities; 20 percent in         
corporate bonds; 36 percent in Federal agencies; 4 percent in time deposits; and
14 percent in money market funds and other. For the fiscal year ended June 30,
2005, the average daily balance of $1.84 billion returned $65 million, a 3.54%  
yield. This yield is a decrease from the 2004 yield of 3.91%.                   

State law requires that all public funds deposited in banks be secured by 
having each such bank maintaining, at all times, an aggregate amount of         
securities of at least 102 percent of the amount on deposit, less the $100,000  
insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). It is the State's  
policy to continually monitor the clearing and depository banks for compliance  
with this law.                                                                  

Risk Management. Workers' compensation, employee health coverage, employee
liability and general liability are self-insured. Commercial insurance coverage 
has been purchased for automobile liability, real and personal property damage, 
employee life coverage, and employees' errors or omissions.                     

Retirement Systems. Total net assets of the State's pension trust funds   
reached $6.4 billion by June 30, 2004, compared to $5.5 billion on June 30,
2003. These are the assets of the three defined benefit plans (School, Judges   
and State Patrol plans), two defined contribution and cash balance plans (County
and State Employees plans) and the State Employees' Deferred Compensation Plan  
that are administered by the State.                                             

  Financial Highlights - Government-wide. The assets of the State exceeded its
liabilities at June 30, 2005 by $9.3 billion (presented as "net assets" in the  
CAFR). The majority of the net assets are represented by the investment in the  
State's infrastructure and other capital assets, which cannot be used to fund   
ongoing activities of the State. Of the net assets, "unrestricted net assets"   
was reported as $830 million, much of which is, by statute, to be spent on      
nursing facilities, medical assistance programs and tobacco prevention and      
control. The primary government's net revenues exceeded net expenses for 2005 by
$615 million (thus, an increase in net assets). The increase in net assets was  
primarily a result of a continually improving economy causing an increase in    
taxes collected coupled with a less than budgeted increase of expenditures from 
2004.                                                                           

Fund Level. General Fund receipts for 2005 were $262 million above the    
original budgeted amount and above the final budget by $48 million. Expenditures
were $132 million less than the original budget. On a Generally Accepted        
Accounting Principles (GAAP) basis, the General Fund had $173 million in excess 
revenues prior to $28 million in other financing sources (uses) resulting in an 
ending fund balance on June 30, 2005 of $409 million. Other governmental funds  
had $113 million in excess revenues prior to other financing sources (uses)     
increasing such fund balances at June 30, 2005 to $1,599 million. The $211      
million of net assets of the Unemployment Compensation Fund represents          
eighty-six percent of the proprietary funds. Such fund only had a $28 million   
increase in net assets for 2005 (compared to a $10 million decrease in 2004) due
to a $42 million decrease in unemployment claims.                               

   Long-term Liabilities. Long-term liabilities totaled $658 million at June 30,
2005, which is a small change from the prior year. Most of these liabilities    
consist of (1) $290 million of claims payable for workers' compensation claims, 
medical excess liability, unemployment compensation claims, employee health     
insurance claims, among other claims, (2) $181 million of Medicaid claims, and  
(3) the calculated amount for vested sick leave due employees when they retire  
and accrued vacation, totaling $111 million. Debt related to capital assets     
totaled $48 million at June 30, 2005.                                           

Net Assets. The State's assets totaled $11,026 million at June 30, 2005 as
compared to $10,236 at June 30, 2004. Total liabilities only totaled $1,767     
million, while net assets amounted to $9,259 million as of June 30, 2005. As of 
June 30, 2004, these amounts were $1,575 million and $8,661 million,            
respectively. By far the largest portion of the State of Nebraska's net assets  
(77 percent) reflects the State's investment in capital assets (e.g., land,     
buildings, equipment and infrastructure - highways, bridges, etc.). The State   
uses these capital assets to provide services to citizens; consequently, these  
assets are not available for future spending.                                   

The State's non-capital assets chiefly consist of cash, investments and   
receivables. It should be noted that $489 million in 2005 and $374 million in   
2004 of such assets represent "Securities Lending Collateral," an amount created
by a journal entry required by GASB in order to record a lending transaction.   
Since the asset is offset by a corresponding equal liability, the net asset is  
zero and thus the asset cannot be spent. (For more detail, see Note 2 to the    
financial statements.)                                                          

 Since the State's Constitution generally prohibits the State from incurring
debt, the Statement of Net Assets presents few long-term liabilities (shown as  
noncurrent liabilities). The majority of such liabilities are for claims payable
for workers' compensation claims, medical excess liability, unemployment        
compensation claims, employee health insurance claims, among other claims ($290 
million for 2005 and $284 million for 2004), Medicaid claims for $181 million   
($177 million in 2004) and the calculated amount for vested sick leave due      
employees when they retire and accrued vacation of $111 million of 2005 ($109   
million for 2004). Other minor amounts of long-term liabilities consist chiefly 
of capital lease obligations (See Note 9 to the Financial Statements), and bonds
payable related to NETC Leasing Corporation and Nebraska State Building         
Corporation bonds. Both of these entities are legally separate from the State,  
but are so intertwined with the State that they are, in substance, the same as  
the State.                                                                      

Governmental Activities. Governmental activities increased the State's net
assets by $557 million in 2005 ($461 million in 2004). Furthermore, governmental
activities represent 96% of all the primary government's revenues. Program      
revenues of governmental activities were $2,661 million and were used to        
partially offset program expenses of $5,836 million, leaving net expenses of    
$3,175 million. Only 4% of total expenses were spent on general government      
expenses. General taxes, earnings and transfers of $3,732 million were used to  
more than cover the remaining costs of the programs.                            

  Business-type Activities. The business-type activities increased the State's
net assets by $42 million for 2005 after a $26 million transfer to the          
governmental activities. Most of the $258 million of business-type activities'  
program revenues was related to the business assessment fees in the Unemployment
Compensation Fund and Lottery Fund revenues. The Unemployment Compensation Fund 
had operating income of $19 million in 2005. This income, when combined with the
operating income of $9 million created in the Excess Liability Fund, $14 million
in investment income and $2 million in net revenues from Cornhusker State       
Industries, produced $44 million of revenue. Lottery revenues of $101 million   
generated net revenue of $24 million, which was offset by the $26 million       
transfer to the Governmental Activities. The lottery transfer was used primarily
for education and environmental studies.                                        

   Governmental Funds. The focus of the State's Governmental Funds is to provide
information on near-term inflows and outflows and the availability of spendable 
resources. In particular, the unreserved balance may provide some indication of 
the State's net resources available for spending at the end of the fiscal year. 
(Unreserved balances may be designated or undesignated. If they are designated, 
they are unreserved only as long as they are used for the purposes of the fund  
involved. In the Governmental Funds, most of the unreserved balances reside in  
designated funds.) At the end of 2005, the State's Governmental Funds reported  
combined ending fund balances of $2,008 million. The total unreserved balances  
amounted to $1,630 million.                                                     

  General Fund. The General Fund is the chief operating fund of the State. The
major General Fund liability was the estimated tax refunds payable of $244      
million. Such refunds payable were $64 million less than the expected taxes owed
the State. Other assets of the General Fund available to pay near-term          
liabilities exceeded such liabilities by $345 million. On June 30, 2004, the    
General Fund had a positive fund balance of $208 million. While both revenues   
and expenditures increased in 2005, revenues were greater than expenditures     
which resulted in an increase in fund balance of $173 million in 2005, which was
slightly less than the $208 million increase that occurred in 2004. This $173   
million increase in 2005, when coupled with $28 million of other financing      
sources, caused the General Fund balance to increase by $201 million, ending    
with a fund balance of $409 million.                                            

Revenues in 2005 were more than anticipated and were up $337 million over 
2004 chiefly due to (1) continued increase in corporate income taxes because of 
increased revenues and companies had less losses to write off, (2) increased    
individual income tax revenue resulting from the effect of less capital losses  
being reported and increased revenues by farmers and small business owners, and 
(3) increased sales taxes collected because of increased retail sales and the   
continuing effect of the increased sales tax base. Expenditures were less than  
budgeted due to a concerted effort by agency heads to be conservative in        
spending.                                                                       

To compensate for any downturns in revenues, the State has maintained a   
budgetary basis Cash Reserve Fund. While this Cash Reserve Fund is commingled   
with General fund cash in the General Fund financial statements, it is separate 
and distinct in that, by State Statute, it can only be used (1) when the cash   
balance of the General Fund is insufficient to meet General Fund current        
obligations and (2) for legislatively mandated transfers to other funds. Any    
money transferred in accordance with item one above must be repaid as soon as   
there is sufficient cash in the General Fund cash account to do so. Such reserve
was at $59 million at the beginning of 2004. In 2004, because of the increased  
revenues, the General Fund was able to repay the $30 million that was borrowed  
from the Cash Reserve in 2003. Cigarette tax revenues of $27 million were placed
into the Cash Reserve in 2004 and the $29 million of federal funds was          
transferred to the General Fund cash account, leaving a Cash Reserve Fund       
balance at the end of 2004 of $87 million. Due to the fact that 2004 revenues   
exceeded the forecast, a statutory requirement caused a $109 million transfer   
from the General Fund cash account to the Cash Reserve Fund in July 2004.       
Cigarette tax revenues of $8 million was added to the Cash Reserve Fund during  
2005 (this revenue stream ended October 1, 2004). These two items, when combined
with $27 million of transfers out, left a balance of $177 million at the end of 
2005. Again, because 2005 revenues exceeded the forecast, a $262 million        
transfer was made from the General Fund into the Cash Reserve Fund in July,     
2005. Offsetting this large transfer was a $146 million payment made on August
1, 2005 from the Cash Reserve to settle a lawsuit against the state related to a
low-level waste site.                                                           

Other Governmental Funds. Other governmental fund balances totaled $1,599 
million at June 30, 2005; $378 million of such fund balances is reserved to     
indicate that they are not available for new spending because such funds (1) are
represented by endowment principal ($184 million), (2) are represented by an    
asset that has not yet been received, e.g., loans receivable ($180 million), (3)
have been expended for other assets, chiefly inventories ($8 million) and thus  
the funds are not available, or (4) have been committed for debt service ($6    
million).                                                                       

Of the non-General Fund unreserved fund balances of $1,221 million, $227  
million represents permanent school funds which can be used only for support of 
public schools. $936 million is represented by special revenue funds which while
unreserved, normally must be spent within the confines of such special revenue  
funds (a majority of these same funds are considered "restricted" on the        
government-wide financial statements). Twenty-three million dollars is          
represented by other permanent funds, which again normally must be spent within 
the confines of the fund. Thirty-four million dollars is in the Capital Projects
Fund, which, while unreserved, must be spent on a capital projects.             

The three major funds presented as special revenue funds are the Highway  
Fund, the Federal Fund and the Health and Social Services Fund, with total fund 
balances of $555 million. Of this balance, $543 million is classified as        
unreserved, but which are restricted in the government-wide statements in that  
the funds are unreserved only within the confines of such funds. Governmental   
funds other than the General Fund saw an increase in fund balances of $115      
million. The fund balances of all such funds increased: the Highway Fund ($12   
million), the Federal Fund ($1 million), the Health and Social Service Fund ($38
million), the Permanent School Fund ($40 million) and other Non-major Funds ($24
million).                                                                       

Fiduciary Funds. The Pension Trust Funds represent the majority of the    
fiduciary funds. Such Pension Trust Funds net assets increased $644 million to  
$7,063 million in 2005 due primarily to a strong market in 2005, which provided 
$505 million in appreciation of investments. Investment income in 2005 was $117 
million versus $106 million in 2004. Contributions to the plans exceeded        
benefits, refunds and related administrative expenses by $31 million. In another
trust fund, $376 million was received by the College Savings Plan and is        
recorded in the Private Purpose Trust Funds. Total net assets in the College    
Savings Plan now total $950 million.                                            

Proprietary Funds. The State's proprietary funds provide the same type of 
information found in the government-wide financial statements under             
Business-type Activities, but in more detail. The State's one major proprietary 
fund, the Unemployment Compensation Fund, had reported net assets of $211       
million at the end of 2005. This fund's net assets increased $28 million in     
2005, due to charges to customers which exceeded the unemployment claims paid   
out by $19 million. Other proprietary or enterprise funds - the Lottery Fund,   
the Excess Liability Fund (this fund was established to provide limited         
liability for physicians working in Nebraska) and Cornhusker State Industries   
(this operation utilizes incarcerated persons to manufacture and sell items) had
combined income of $39 million prior to a $26 million transfer from the Lottery 
to governmental funds. Such transfer was used primarily for education and       
environmental studies.                                                          

 Analysis of General Fund. In 2005, the State continued to reap the benefits
of the improving national economy. Forecasted revenues, upon which the State's  
budgeted expenses were based, had anticipated a slow growth coming out of the   
recession. However, the State exceeded the revised projected tax revenues of $  
2,899 million by $48 million, realizing actual tax revenues, net of refunds, of 
$ 2,947 million. Because the revenues continued to exceed expectations, the     
State's Forecasting Board made two new forecasts throughout the year, each time 
increasing the expected revenues. As the year unfolded, revenues continued to   
pick up and the end result was that actual revenues again exceeded the annual   
forecast. Additionally, throughout the year, agencies were encouraged to watch  
their spending and General Fund spending ended up $110 million less than the    
appropriated amount. This reduction, when coupled with the increased tax        
revenues, allowed the State to finish 2005 with $318 million of revenues in     
excess of expenditures on a budgetary basis.                                    

 Debt Management. Article XIII of the State Constitution prohibits the State
from incurring debt in excess of one hundred thousand dollars. However, there is
a provision in the constitution that permits the issuance of revenue bonds for: 
(1) construction of highways; and (2) construction of water conservation and    
management structures. The State can enter into capital lease and other         
financing contracts provided that the contracts include cancellation of clauses 
if the Legislature does not appropriate funds to continue the lease or financing
agreement.                                                                      

  Local Issuances. It should be noted that the creditworthiness of obligations
issued by local Nebraska issuers may be unrelated to the creditworthiness of    
obligations issued by the State of Nebraska, and there is no obligation on the  
part of the State to make payment on such local obligations in the event of     
default.                                                                        

The foregoing information constitutes only a brief summary of some of the 
general factors which may impact certain issuers of bonds contained in the      
Nebraska IM-IT and does not purport to be a complete or exhaustive description  
of all adverse conditions to which the issuers of such obligations are subject. 
Additionally, many factors including national economic, social and environmental
policies and conditions, which are not within the control of the issuers of such
bonds, could affect or could have an adverse impact on the financial condition  
of the State and various agencies and political subdivisions thereof. The       
Sponsor is unable to predict whether or to what extent such factors or other    
factors may affect the issuers of the bonds contained in the Nebraska IM-IT, the
market value or marketability of such bonds or the ability of the respective    
issuers of such bonds acquired by the Nebraska IM-IT to pay interest on or      
principal of such bonds.                                                        

The Nebraska IM-IT is susceptible to political, economic or regulatory    
factors affecting issuers of Nebraska municipal obligations (the "Nebraska      
Municipal Obligations"). These include the possible adverse effects of certain  
Nebraska constitutional amendments, legislative measures, voter initiatives and 
other matters that are described. The information provided above is only a brief
summary of the complex factors affecting the financial situation in Nebraska and
is derived from sources that are generally available to investors and are       
believed to be accurate. No independent verification has been made of the       
accuracy or completeness of any of the following information. It is based in    
part on information obtained from various State and local agencies in Nebraska  
or contained in Official Statements for various Nebraska Municipal Obligations. 

 New Jersey Risk Factors

  Economic Outlook. New Jersey's economy continues to expand steadily in 2005.
The State added around 103,200 jobs between the bottom of the employment cycle  
in March 2003 and September 2005. Payroll employment year-to-date through       
September increased at an average annual rate of 1.3 percent after growing at   
0.6 percent last year. Although New Jersey's unemployment rate inched up        
slightly to 4.3 percent in September 2005, it remains well below the            
corresponding national rate of 5.1 percent.                                     

  New Jersey's employment increased by 1.2 percent in September 2005 from over
a year ago adding close to 48,100 jobs and continuing the positive year over    
year growth trend for the twentieth consecutive month. Overall, the State added 
35,500 jobs between January and September of 2005. Employment gains were        
primarily spread across the service providing sectors with particularly strong  
growth in Trade, Transportation and Utilities (10,900 jobs) and Professional and
Business Services (10,600 jobs). The total Government sector added 3,000 jobs   
during this period.                                                             

However, the State continues to suffer from job losses in manufacturing   
(-7,900 jobs) and downsizing in the telecommunications industry (-3,300 jobs).  
Practically all the job losses in New Jersey, were concentrated in those two    
areas. New Jersey's employment level has remained consistently above the 4.0    
million mark for the last sixteen months.                                       

The United States' Department of Commerce's Bureau of Economic Analysis   
preliminary report released on September 28, 2005 indicates that the preliminary
growth rate for New Jersey's personal income of 6.4 percent during the second   
quarter of calendar year 2005 came in above the revised growth rate of 6.1      
percent for the first quarter of this year. Personal income for New Jersey is   
expected to grow at a steady pace through the rest of the year and through 2006.
Despite current inflationary pressures due to surges in energy costs, the       
improving labor market conditions benefit New Jersey consumers and businesses. A
low interest rate environment has supported spending on housing, which continues
to remain robust, and other consumer durables in the State. However, rising     
interest rates through 2005 are expected to have a moderating influence on      
interest sensitive spending in the economy.                                     

  The State's and the nation's economy are expected to continue expanding at a
steady pace through the rest of 2005 and 2006. Despite the recent disruptions   
due to Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita, particularly on energy costs, the  
Federal Reserve expects the United States economy to withstand the shock and    
remain on track in 2005, without a sizable deceleration in growth. New Jersey   
and the nation may experience further near-term slow growth and the expected    
pace of economic expansion may stall if consumers, investors, and businesses    
become more concerned about geopolitical tensions. The future direction of      
economic expansion nationally and in New Jersey hinges on the assumptions of no 
further terrorist attacks, stable energy prices, supportive monetary and fiscal 
policies and no further turmoil in the financial markets. However, the          
fundamentals of the State economic health remain stable and the long run        
prospects for economic growth of the State in 2005 and beyond are favorable.    

  Revenues and Expenditures. The State's Fiscal Year 2005 net assets decreased
by $3.5 billion. During Fiscal Year 2005, the State made $1.9 billion in        
expenditures that were supported by the securitization of a portion of cigarette
tax revenue and motor vehicle surcharges. Another $1.4 billion was disbursed to 
the New Jersey Schools Construction Corporation to help finance school          
facilities construction throughout the state. Approximately 51.6 percent of the 
State's total revenue came from general taxes, while 23.3 percent was derived   
from charges for services. Operating grants amounted to 20.5 percent of total   
revenues, while other items such as governmental subsidies and grants, capital  
grants, interest and investment earnings, and miscellaneous revenues accounted  
for the remainder. State expenditures cover a range of services. The largest    
expense, 28.0 percent was for educational, cultural, and intellectual           
development. Physical and mental health amounted to 19.7 percent of total       
expenditures, while government direction, management, and control amounted to   
16.6 percent. Other major expenditures focused on economic planning,            
development, and security, public safety and criminal justice, and community    
development and environmental management. During Fiscal Year 2005, governmental 
activity expenses exceeded program revenues, resulting in the use of $26.0      
billion of general revenues (mostly taxes and transfers). Revenues from         
business-type activities in Fiscal Year 2005 exceeded expenses by $707.9        
million.                                                                        

 During Fiscal Year 2005, State revenues, including transfers, totaled $45.1
billion, an increase of $4.9 billion from the prior fiscal year. General taxes  
totaled $23.3 billion and accounted for 51.6 percent of total State revenues for
Fiscal Year 2005. This amount reflects a $2.4 billion increase from the prior   
fiscal year. The State's Gross Income Tax totaled $9.5 billion, the Sales and   
Use Tax totaled $6.5 billion and the Corporation Business Tax totaled $2.4      
billion. The State's three major taxes comprised 78.8 percent of the total      
general taxes that were collected during Fiscal Year 2005. Fiscal Year 2005     
expenditures totaled $48.6 billion, an increase of $5.2 billion from the prior  
fiscal year. The largest increase in expenditures occurred in the area of       
government direction, management, and control. This increase of $2.1 billion    
represented a 34.2 percent increase over the prior fiscal year. Government      
direction, management, and control increased primarily as a result of increased 
rebates through the implementation of the FAIR Plan. Overall, 47.7 percent of   
all State expenditures occurred in the areas of education, higher education and 
physical and mental health.                                                     

  Litigation. The state is a party in numerous legal proceedings pertaining to
matters incidental to the performance of routine governmental operations.       
Adverse judgments in these and other matters could have the potential for either
a significant loss of revenue or a significant unanticipated expenditure by the 
state. At any given time, there are various numbers of claims and cases pending 
against the state, state agencies and employees, seeking recovery of monetary   
damages that are primarily paid out of the fund created pursuant to the New     
Jersey Tort Claims Act.                                                         

Debt Administration. The primary method for state financing of capital    
projects is through the sale of the general obligation bonds of the state. These
bonds are backed by the full faith and credit of the state tax revenues and     
certain other fees are pledged to meet the principal and interest payments and  
if provided, redemption premium payments, if any, required to repay the bonds.  
General Obligation Debt must be approved by voter referendum and is used        
primarily to finance various environmental projects, transportation             
infrastructure, and correctional and institutional construction. As of June 30,
2005, New Jersey's outstanding long-term debt totaled $31.8 billion, a $5.5     
billion increase over the prior fiscal year. In addition, the State has $6.7    
billion of legislatively authorized bonding capacity that has not yet been      
issued. During Fiscal Year 2005, the legislatively authorized bonding capacity  
decreased by $1.7 billion.                                                      

Ratings. As of September 2006, all outstanding general obligation bonds of
the State of New Jersey are rated AA by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services and  
Aa3 by Moody's Investor's Service, Inc. Any explanation concerning the          
significance of such ratings must be obtained from the rating agencies. There is
no assurance that any ratings will continue for any period of time or that they 
will not be revised or withdrawn.                                               

  Local Issuances. It should be noted that the creditworthiness of obligations
issued by local New Jersey issuers may be unrelated to the creditworthiness of  
obligations issued by the State of New Jersey, and there is no obligation on the
part of the State to make payment on such local obligations in the event of     
default.                                                                        

The foregoing information constitutes only a brief summary of some of the 
general factors which may impact certain issuers of bonds contained in the New  
Jersey IM-IT and does not purport to be a complete or exhaustive description of 
all adverse conditions to which the issuers of such obligations are subject.    
Additionally, many factors including national economic, social and environmental
policies and conditions, which are not within the control of the issuers of such
bonds, could affect or could have an adverse impact on the financial condition  
of the State and various agencies and political subdivisions thereof. The       
Sponsor is unable to predict whether or to what extent such factors or other    
factors may affect the issuers of the bonds contained in the New Jersey IM-IT,  
the market value or marketability of such bonds or the ability of the respective
issuers of such bonds acquired by the New Jersey IM-IT to pay interest on or    
principal of such bonds.                                                        

The New Jersey IM-IT is susceptible to political, economic or regulatory  
factors affecting issuers of New Jersey municipal obligations (the "New Jersey  
Municipal Obligations"). These include the possible adverse effects of certain  
New Jersey constitutional amendments, legislative measures, voter initiatives   
and other matters that are described. The information provided above is only a  
brief summary of the complex factors affecting the financial situation in New   
Jersey and is derived from sources that are generally available to investors and

accuracy or completeness of any of the following information. It is based in    
part on information obtained from various State and local agencies in New Jersey
or contained in Official Statements for various New Jersey Municipal            
Obligations.                                                                    

 New Mexico Risk Factors

General. New Mexico is the nation's fifth-largest state in area (121,356  
square miles), with an estimated population in 2001 of 1,829,146. Albuquerque is
the state's largest city and economic center. Most of the state's leading       
employers are concentrated in Albuquerque, where 40% of the state's population  
resides. Albuquerque area employers include the University of New Mexico,       
Albuquerque Public Schools, Kirtland Air Force Base, and Sandia National        
Laboratories. Intel Corp. is the largest manufacturer and private employer in   
the state, with a semiconductor plant in Rio Rancho just outside Albuquerque.   

Financial Highlights. The assets administered by the Office of the State  
Treasurer in the Investment Trust Fund increased by $416,888,265. The majority  
of this increase is due to increased average yield on the investment portfolio  
which has also resulted in increased deposit activity. As of the close of the   
current fiscal year, the Office of the State Treasurer's governmental funds     
reported combined ending fund balances of $154,065,840, a decrease of           
$17,093,210 in comparison with the prior year. The Office of the State Treasurer
and the Department of Finance and Administration altered the policy related to  
the reporting of debt. Only debt issued by and for the Office of the State      
Treasurer should be included in the government-wide financial statements. As a  
result, the 2004 government-wide financial statements solely include $83,614 in 
debt related to compensated absences. This policy change also resulted in a net 
prior period increase in net assets of $761,104,004, a $764,105,000 increase    
related to debt and a $3,000,996 decrease related to bond issuance costs net of 
amortization.                                                                   

   Although policy has been changed on the reporting of debt, it should be noted
that the Office of the State Treasurer has the statutory responsibility for the 
overall management and investing of bond proceeds and debt service funds issued 
by the State Board of Finance. These proceeds require the tracking of all       
earnings for rebate, arbitrage and interest earnings distribution. The          
management of these funds begins with the issuance of bonds by the State Board  
of Finance. On the closing date of bond issuance, funds are delivered to the    
State Treasurer with identification of sources and uses of the bond proceeds.   
The State Treasurer then authorizes release of bond funds to the buyer and      
invests the proceeds in accordance with the State Treasurer's Investment Policy.
The State Treasurer administers the distribution of interest earnings on 39     
severance-tax bonds, 7 general obligation bonds and 1 miscellaneous bond. All   
transactions are tracked for the purpose of calculating rebate and arbitrage.   

  In addition, the State Treasurer provides information to the audit firm that
prepares the rebate calculations. Management of debt service funds includes     
monitoring available cash for payment, investing, and cost of issuance. The     
State Treasurer's Office coordinates with the State Board of Finance cash       
availability for issuance of one-day notes and determines the amount available  
for transfer to the state permanent fund as required by statute. Previously     
issued bonds by the Board of Finance may be re-financed or refunded and acting  
as the paying agent, the State Treasurer must coordinate payment with escrow    
agent and Depository Trust Company (DTC). A statutory function of the Office of 
the State Treasurer is to make debt service payments on behalf of State         
Agencies. As a result, the debt service assets and activity continues to be     
reported in the governmental funds. Information related to the debt service     
assets and activity is included in the supplementary information.               

Financial Analysis of the Government's Funds. As of the end of the current
fiscal year, the Office of the State Treasurer's governmental funds reported    
combined ending fund balances of $154,065,840, a decrease of $17,093,210 in     
comparison with the prior year. Approximately 99.06% of this total amount,      
$152,624,938 is unreserved, designated for subsequent year's expenditures that  
is an internal designation of unreserved fund balance. The remainder of fund    
balance is reserved to indicate that it is not available for new spending       
because it has already been committed to encumbrances and the New Mexico        
Business Development Corporation, $1,502,424. The remainder, less than 1%,      
reported as undesignated, is subject to reversion (if positive) to the State    
Permanent Fund. The fund balance of the Office of the State Treasurer's general 
fund increased by $193,428 during the current fiscal year.                      

General Fund Budgetary Highlights. Differences between the original budget
and the final amended budget are briefly summarized as follows:                 

     o    $253,000 in decreases for personnel services and employee benefits due
to several positions remaining open.                        

o    $337,117 in increases for operating costs for rent, maintenance, 
repair and replacement of computer software and equipment.  

Capital Assets. The Office of the State Treasurer's investment in capital 
assets for its governmental activities as of June 30, 2004, amounts to $142,432 
(net of accumulated depreciation). This investment in capital assets includes   
office and computer equipment.                                                  

Long-term Debt. At the end of the current fiscal year, the Office of the  
State Treasurer was responsible for administering debt service payments on total
bonded debt outstanding of $735,990,000 all of which is secured by pledged tax  
revenues.                                                                       

Economic Factors and Next Year's Budgets and Rates. Inflationary trends in
the region compare favorably to national indices. Costs associated with the     
general fund are expected to remain stable. During fiscal year end June 30,
2004, several personnel positions remained open, causing the budget to be       
underspent. The June 30, 2005 budget anticipates filling those positions. These 
factors were considered in preparing the Office of the State Treasurer's budget 
for the 2005 fiscal year.                                                       

Revenues and Expenditures. The State derives the bulk of its recurring    
General Fund revenues from five major sources: general and selective sales      
taxes, income taxes, the emergency school tax on oil and gas production, rents  
and royalties from State and federal land, and interest earnings from its two   
Permanent Funds. Effective July 1, 1981, the Legislature abolished all property 
taxes for State operating purposes.                                             

Debt Management. Sections 7 and 8 of Article IX of the Constitution of the
New Mexico limits the power of State officials to incur general obligation      
indebtedness extending beyond the fiscal year in three ways. First, the state   
may borrow money not exceeding the sum of two hundred thousand dollars          
($200,000) in the aggregate to meet casual deficits or failure in revenue, or   
for necessary expenses. Second, other debt may be contracted by or on behalf of 
the State only when authorized by law for some specified work or object. Such a 
law takes effect only after being submitted to the qualified electors of the    
State and having received a majority of all votes cast thereon at a general     
election. No debt may be created if the total indebtedness of the State,        
exclusive of the debts of the territory and several counties thereof assumed by 
the State, would thereby be made to exceed 1% of the assessed valuation of all  
property subject to taxation in the State, as shown by the last preceding       
general assessment. Lastly, the State may also contract debts to suppress       
insurrection and to provide for the public defense.                             

General obligation bonds of the State are issued and the proceeds thereof 
appropriated to various purposes pursuant to an act of the Legislature of the   
State. The State Constitution requires that any law which authorizes general    
obligation debt of the State shall provide for an annual tax levy sufficient to 
pay the interest and to provide a sinking fund to pay the principal of the      
debts. General obligation bonds are general obligations of the State for the    
payment of which the full faith and credit of the State are pledged. The general
obligation bonds are payable from "ad valorem" taxes levied without limit as to 
rate or amount on all property in the State subject to taxation for State       
purposes. The total debt service on general obligation bonds was $230,104,066.25

Ratings. As of September 2006, all outstanding general obligation bonds of
the State of New Mexico are rated AA+ by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services and 
Aa1 by Moody's Investor's Service, Inc. Any explanation concerning the          
significance of such ratings must be obtained from the rating agencies. There is
no assurance that any ratings will continue for any period of time or that they 
will not be revised or withdrawn.                                               

  Local Issuances. It should be noted that the creditworthiness of obligations
issued by local New Mexico issuers may be unrelated to the creditworthiness of  
obligations issued by the State of New Mexico, and there is no obligation on the
part of the State to make payment on such local obligations in the event of     
default.                                                                        

The foregoing information constitutes only a brief summary of some of the 
general factors which may impact certain issuers of bonds contained in the New  
Mexico IM-IT and does not purport to be a complete or exhaustive description of 
all adverse conditions to which the issuers of such obligations are subject.    
Additionally, many factors including national economic, social and environmental
policies and conditions, which are not within the control of the issuers of such
bonds, could affect or could have an adverse impact on the financial condition  
of the State and various agencies and political subdivisions thereof. The       
Sponsor is unable to predict whether or to what extent such factors or other    
factors may affect the issuers of the bonds contained in the New Mexico IM-IT,  
the market value or marketability of such bonds or the ability of the respective
issuers of such bonds acquired by the New Mexico IM-IT to pay interest on or    
principal of such bonds.                                                        

The New Mexico IM-IT is susceptible to political, economic or regulatory  
factors affecting issuers of New Mexico municipal obligations (the "New Mexico  
Municipal Obligations"). These include the possible adverse effects of certain  
New Mexico constitutional amendments, legislative measures, voter initiatives   
and other matters that are described. The information provided above is only a  
brief summary of the complex factors affecting the financial situation in New   
Mexico and is derived from sources that are generally available to investors and
are believed to be accurate. No independent verification has been made of the   
accuracy or completeness of any of the following information. It is based in    
part on information obtained from various State and local agencies in New Mexico
or contained in Official Statements for various New Mexico Municipal            
Obligations.                                                                    

 New York Risk Factors

  Economic Condition and Outlook. The economy improved as 2003 progressed, and
by mid-2004 the economic expansion was on firmer footing. The strengthening of  
the national economy has been beneficial for New York State and its             
export-oriented economy. On a seasonally adjusted basis, State employment began 
to grow and again during the summer of 2003. The recovery in the New York City  
economy has contributed to the State's economic improvement, and job growth has 
continued to be steady on Long Island and in the Hudson Valley during the first 
five months of 2004. Several major upstate metropolitan areas have experienced  
some recovery, although job losses continue in areas such as Buffalo and Elmira.

  The pace of the State's recent recovery has been relatively better than that
of some other states. In the wake of the recession, the terrorist attacks, and  
the financial market downturn, New York State's employment performance          
deteriorated falling to a rank of 42nd in the nation in 2002. During 2003,      
though average annual State employment declined by 0.7%, the State's ranking    
rose to 37th in the nation. With employment up 0.3% in the first five months of 
2004, the State's rank remains at 37th.                                         

Improvement on Wall Street has been a major factor in the recovery of both
the City and State economies. The decline in the financial markets ended in     
2003, as the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index advanced 20.2% for the year,     
although in the first five months of 2004 the gain has slowed to 2%. Securities 
industry growth has not yet resumed, but the rate of decline has slowed. By     
contrast, securities industry profits rebounded sharply, rising from $6.8       
billion in 2002 to $16.8 billion in 2003 - the second highest level on record.  
As a result, year-end securities industry bonuses rose by almost 25% in 2003    
after falling by about 33% in 2002 and more than 34% in 2001. Profits have      
remained strong in the first quarter of 2004, totaling $5.1 billion - an        
increase of 45% compared to the level one year earlier.                         

Incomes in New York State are responding to the recovery in the financial 
markets and the higher Wall Street profits and bonuses. Personal income growth  
in New York State rose from 0.8% in 2002 to 2.6% in 2003, and to 5.5% in the    
first quarter of 2004 compared to the same period one year earlier. Nationally, 
personal income rose by 2.3% in 2002, 3.3% in 2003, and 5.2% in the first       
quarter of 2004. Compared to other states, income growth in New York State has  
rebounded faster than employment growth. New York's personal income gain ranked 
23rd among the states in the first quarter of 2004, up from 46th in both 2002   
and 2003.                                                                       

 As the site of one of the terrorist attacks, the impact on New York State's
economy was greater than in other parts of the nation. New York had lagged      
behind the recovery from the early 1990s recession, and it was only in recent   
years that the State's economic performance had improved. In the short run, the 
State's economy will go through a difficult period as the recovery slowly takes 
hold and spreads. New York City will reassert itself as a major center of       
commerce, and will benefit from reconstruction spending. Although the current   
recession will be followed by a new expansion, the strength of that expansion in
New York State will be dependent on many factors. As the major engine of recent 
economic growth, the downstate economy is particularly dependent on the health  
of the financial industry, investments in transportation infrastructure, the    
ability of the education system to produce a skilled workforce, the availability
of affordable housing, the cost and availability of energy, and the continued   
attractiveness of the region for both domestic migrants and international       
immigrants. Upstate, many regions continue to transition from manufacturing to  
service-based economies, and to face their own issues in education, housing,    
energy, and population. Finally, the fiscal stresses currently faced by many    
localities will have an impact on how policies that address important issues are
resolved.                                                                       

  General Government Results. An operating surplus of $3.0 billion is reported
in the General Fund for fiscal year 2003-04. As a result, the General Fund now  
has an accumulated deficit of $281 million. The State completed its fiscal year 
ended March 31, 2004 with a combined Governmental Funds operating surplus of    
$3.2 billion as compared to a combined Governmental Funds operating deficit in  
the preceding fiscal year of $4.3 billion. The combined 2003-04 surplus of $3.2 
billion included operating surpluses in the General Fund of $3.0 billion and    
Other Governmental Funds of $198 million. The State's financial position as     
shown in its Governmental Funds Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2004 includes a   
fund balance of $6.2 billion represented by liabilities of $19.7 billion and by 
assets available to liquidate such liabilities of $25.9 billion. The            
Governmental Funds balance includes a $281 million accumulated General Fund     
deficit.                                                                        

 As the State completed the year, its governmental funds reported a combined
fund balance of $6.2 billion. Included in this year's total change in fund      
balance is an operating surplus of $3.0 billion in the State's General Fund. The
General Fund operating surplus is attributable to several factors including the 
sale of tobacco bonds which provided resources of $4.2 billion, an increase of  
$1.3 billion in personal income tax revenue, a $1.0 billion increase in         
consumption and use tax revenue, a $645 million increase in Federal grants and a
$504 million increase in miscellaneous revenues offset by a $206 million decline
in business and other taxes. Much of the increase in tax revenues is related to 
improvement in the national economy and tax increases enacted for personal      
income and sales taxes. The increase in General Fund revenues was offset by a   
$2.5 billion increase in expenditures. Local assistance expenditures increased  
by $2.2 billion due primarily to increased spending for medical assistance and  
income maintenance programs. State operations increased by $300 million due     
primarily to increased employer pension costs. The State ended the 2003-04      
fiscal year with a General Fund accumulated deficit of $281 million. The        
reduction of the deficit primarily reflects the restoration of reserves as a    
result of the improving State economy and the sale of tobacco bonds from which  
the General Fund received a $4.2 billion benefit.                               

 Overall Financial Position. The State reported net assets of $41.2 billion,
which was comprised of $60.5 billion in capital assets reported net of related  
debt, $4.3 billion in restricted net assets offset by an unrestricted net assets
deficit of $23.6 billion. Net assets reported for governmental activities       
decreased by $3.3 billion form a year ago, decreasing form $42.4 billion to     
$39.1 billion. Unrestricted net assets, the part of net assets that can be used 
to finance day-to-day operations without constraints established by debt        
covenants, enabling legislation, or other legal requirements, was a deficit of  
$24.0 billion at March 31, 2004. The deficit in unrestricted governmental net   
assets arose primarily because of the issuance of debt for purposes not         
resulting in a capital asset related to governmental activities. Such           
outstanding debt included securitizing the State's future tobacco settlement    
receipts ($4.8 billion), local aid payments for school education aid that were  
financed on a long-term basis by the Local Government Assistance Corporation    
($4.6 billion), local highway and bridge projects ($2.7 billion), local mass    
transit projects ($2.4 billion), and a wide variety of grants and other         
expenditures not resulting in governmental capital assets ($6.5 billion). This  
deficit in unrestricted net assets of governmental activities can be expected to
continue for as long as the State continues to have obligations outstanding for 
purposes other than the acquisition of governmental capital assets.             

 Net assets for business-type activities decreased by 16.5%, $2.1 billion in
2004 compared to $2.5 billion in 2003. The decrease in net assets for           
business-type activities was caused primarily by unemployment benefit payments  
exceeding employer contributions and other revenues for the Unemployment        
Insurance Fund ($287 million) and CUNY Senior College operating expenses        
exceeding operating revenues and State support ($143 million). As of June 30,
2003, $8.0 billion in debt had been issued and was outstanding to finance       
capital assets of the State's colleges and universities.                        

  General Fund Budgetary Highlights. The original financial plan reported that
the annual budget approved by the Legislature created a potential imbalance of  
$900 million in the General Fund before any possible positive impacts from new  
Federal aid or a fiscal management plan. Approximately $1.1 billion in temporary
Federal aid eliminated the initial projected $900 million imbalance. New York's 
share of the national aid package consisted of a revenue sharing grant of $645  
million and a temporary 2.95% increase in the Federal Medical Assistance        
Percentage that produced $506 million in General Fund savings.                  

The State's fiscal year 2005 capital budget calls for it to spend another 
$6.7 billion for capital projects, of which $3.5 billion is for transportation  
projects. To pay for these capital projects the State plans to use $207 million 
in general obligation bond proceeds, $3.5 billion in other financing            
arrangements with public authorities, $1.8 billion in Federal funds, and $1.1   
billion in funds on hand or received during the year.                           

Debt Administration. There are a number of methods by which the State may 
incur debt. The State has obtained long-term financing in the form of           
voter-approved General Obligation debt (voter approved debt) and other          
obligations for which voter approval is not needed and has not otherwise been   
sought (non-voter approved debt). Non-voter approved long-term financing        
includes debt obligations the State pays pursuant to contractual obligations it 
entered into with the issuer. Such obligations include certain bonds issued     
through state public authorities, certificates of participation, and capital    
leases obtained through vendors. The State administers its long-term financing  
needs as a single portfolio of state-supported debt that includes general       
obligation bonds and other obligations of both its governmental activities and  
business-type activities. Most of the debt reported under business-type         
activities, all of which was issued for capital assets used in those activities,
is supported by payments from resources generated by the State's Governmental   
Activities--thus it is not expected to be repaid from resources generated by    
business-type activities. The State finance law allows for the bonded portion of
this single combined debt portfolio--which includes debt reported in both       
governmental and business-type activities combined--to include variable rate    
securities equal to 15% of total bonds outstanding and interest rate exchange   
agreements (Swaps) equal to 15% of total bonds outstanding. At March 31, 2004   
the State had $1.9 billion in State-supported variable rate bonds outstanding   
and $5.5 billion in variable rate bonds outstanding that are subject to swap    
agreements resulting in effective fixed rates, subject to certain risks. In     
addition, the State had $2.4 billion in convertible bonds that, at various dates
in the future, can remain in a fixed rate mode, at new fixed rates to be        
established at future mandatory tender dates, or convert to a variable rate. At 
March 31, 2004, variable rate bonds, net of those subject to the fixed rate     
swaps, were equal to 4.7% of the State-supported bonded debt portfolio. At March
31, 2004 the State had $46.9 billion in bonds, notes, and other financing       
agreements outstanding compared with $39.3 billion last year, an increase of    
$7.6 billion.                                                                   

   The State Constitution, with exceptions for emergencies, limits the amount of
general obligation bonds that can be issued to that amount approved by the      
voters for a single work or purpose in a general election. The State may issue  
short-term debt without voter approval in anticipation of the receipt of tax and
revenues or proceeds from duly authorized but not issued general obligation     
bonds. The State Finance Law, through the Debt Reform Act of 2000 (the Act),    
also imposes phased-in caps on new debt issued and related debt service costs.  
The Act also limits the use of debt to capital works and purposes, and          
establishes a maximum length of term for repayment of 30 years. The Act applies 
to all State-supported debt but does not require that the capital works or      
projects be limited to State-owned projects. Debt issued prior to the Act and   
State-related debt including the Tobacco Revenue Bonds issued subsequent to the 
date of the financial statements to finance a portion of last year's budgetary  
deficit are not subject to the Act.                                             

The construction of certain State office buildings, campus facilities, and
other public facilities has been financed through bonds and notes issued by     
public benefit corporations or local governments pursuant to lease/purchase     
agreements with the State. These lease/purchase contracts are capital leases for
which the State's rental payments over the duration of the agreements constitute
long-term liabilities. The amount included in obligations under lease/purchase  
and other financing arrangements consists of total future principal payments and
equals the outstanding balance of the related bonds and notes. Reporting        
relative to capitalized interest is also not included for leased capital assets.

Risk Management. The State does not insure its buildings or their contents
against theft, fire or other risks and does not insure its automobiles against  
the possibility of bodily injury and property damage. However, the State does   
have fidelity insurance on State employees. Workers' compensation coverage is   
provided on a self-insurance basis.                                             

   Litigation. The State is a defendant in numerous legal proceedings pertaining
to matters incidental to the performance of routine governmental operations.    
Such litigation includes, but is not limited to, claims asserted against the    
State arising from alleged torts, alleged breaches of contracts, condemnation   
proceedings, and other alleged violations of State and Federal laws.            

Included in the State's outstanding litigation are a number of cases      
challenging the legality or the adequacy of a variety of significant social     
welfare programs primarily involving the State's Medicaid and mental health     
programs. Adverse judgments in these matters generally could result in          
injunctive relief coupled with prospective changes in patient care that could   
require substantial increased financing of the litigated programs in the future.

Actions commenced by several Indian nations which include the St. Regis   
Mohawk Indian Nation, the Oneida Indian Nation and the Cayuga Indian Nation     
claim that significant amounts of land were unconstitutionally taken from the   
Indians in violation of various treaties and agreements during the eighteenth   
and nineteenth centuries. The claimants seek recovery of thousands of acres of  
land as well as compensatory and punitive damages.                              

   In addition, the State is party to other claims and litigation that its legal
counsel has advised are not probable of adverse court decisions. Although the   
amounts of potential losses, if any, are not presently determinable, it is the  
State's opinion that its ultimate liability in these cases is not expected to   
have a material adverse effect on the State's financial position.               

Ratings. As of September 2006, all outstanding general obligation bonds of
the State of New York are rated AA by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services and A1 
by Moody's Investor's Service, Inc. Any explanation concerning the significance 
of such ratings must be obtained from the rating agencies. There is no assurance
that any ratings will continue for any period of time or that they will not be  
revised or withdrawn.                                                           

  Local Issuances. It should be noted that the creditworthiness of obligations
issued by local New York issuers may be unrelated to the creditworthiness of    
obligations issued by the State of New York, and there is no obligation on the  
part of the State to make payment on such local obligations in the event of     
default.                                                                        

The foregoing information constitutes only a brief summary of some of the 
general factors which may impact certain issuers of bonds contained in the New  
York IM-IT and does not purport to be a complete or exhaustive description of   
all adverse conditions to which the issuers of such obligations are subject.    
Additionally, many factors including national economic, social and environmental
policies and conditions, which are not within the control of the issuers of such
bonds, could affect or could have an adverse impact on the financial condition  
of the State and various agencies and political subdivisions thereof. The       
Sponsor is unable to predict whether or to what extent such factors or other    
factors may affect the issuers of the bonds contained in the New York IM-IT, the
market value or marketability of such bonds or the ability of the respective    
issuers of such bonds acquired by the New York IM-IT to pay interest on or      
principal of such bonds.                                                        

The New York IM-IT is susceptible to political, economic or regulatory    
factors affecting issuers of New York municipal obligations (the "New York      
Municipal Obligations"). These include the possible adverse effects of certain  
New York constitutional amendments, legislative measures, voter initiatives and 
other matters that are described. The information provided above is only a brief
summary of the complex factors affecting the financial situation in New York and
is derived from sources that are generally available to investors and are       
believed to be accurate. No independent verification has been made of the       
accuracy or completeness of any of the following information. It is based in

 North Carolina Risk Factors

Economic Condition and Outlook. According to the Employment Security      
Commission (ESC, net job growth in the state between August 2004 and August 2005
was only .9% (36,400 employees) and wage rate increases are probably no more    
than 4%. The key to North Carolina's business cycle experience continues to be  
their dependence on the declining manufacturing sector (15% of all              
nonagricultural employment in N.C. vs. 11% for the nation). The result is that  
the state has lost the "recovery premium" normally experienced during a business
cycle recovery. For example, the state's economy grew 33% faster than the       
national experience following the 1981-82 recession and 45% stronger following  
the Gulf War downturn. Expressed another way, North Carolina was the fifth      
fastest growing state during the 1992-93 period in terms of personal income. The
favorable North Carolina experience was due to the fact that manufacturing      
employment in the state actually rose during this recovery. This time around    
they are continuing to shed manufacturing jobs and our turnaround has been 10%  
slower than the U.S. Problems in the manufacturing side of the economy began    
well before the 2001 recession.                                                 

Data indicates that manufacturing employment grew by 2.2% in 2003. After a
leveling off period, manufacturing jobs began a steady decline in 1996 due to   
the mild national economic slowdown and the kicking in of NAFTA. The rate of    
decline began to accelerate in February 2001 and peaked at an 8.8% rate in 2002.
Particularly hard hit were the textile and apparel sectors, with North Carolina 
jobs in these sectors dropping over 15% on a year-over-year basis by the spring 
of 2001. While the rate of decline has slowed due to the economic recovery, the 
erosion continues. The only saving grace is that the loss of traditional jobs   
has been so great that these sectors exert a much smaller impact on the overall 
economy than in the past.                                                       

While the job market typically lags overall economic trends, retail sales 
tell us how the economy is performing at a particular point in time. The        
prospects for consumer spending are important for the state budget because the  
sales tax makes up 30% of the revenue base.                                     

Cash Management. It is the policy of the State that all agencies,         
institutions, departments, bureaus, boards, commissions and officers of the     
State shall devise techniques and procedures for the receipt, deposit and       
disbursement of monies coming into their control and custody which are designed 
to maximize interest-bearing investment of cash, and to minimize idle and       
nonproductive cash balances. The State Controller, with the advice and          
assistance of the State Treasurer, the State Budget Officer, and the State      
Auditor, develops, implements, and amends the Statewide Cash Management Policy. 
All cash deposited with the State Treasurer by state entities is managed in     
pooled investment accounts to maximize interest earnings. During fiscal year    
2005, uncommitted state funds were invested in short-term and medium-term U.S.  
Government notes and bonds, as well as other deposits, which had a composite    
average yield of 2.875%.                                                        

Risk Management. The State maintains self-insurance programs for employee 
health; general liability; medical malpractice; workers' compensation; and      
automobile, fire and other property losses. The State limits its risk for       
general liability; medical malpractice; and automobile fire and other property  
losses by purchasing private insurance for losses in excess of deductibles.     

 Budget and Rate Projections. The North Carolina State Constitution requires
that the total expenditures of the state for the fiscal period covered by each  
budget not exceed the total of receipts during the fiscal period and a portion  
of the surplus remaining in the State Treasury at the beginning of the period.  
State law requires 25% of surplus funds from the previous fiscal period to be   
placed in the Savings Reserve Account; an amount of the funds equal to 3% of the
value of state-owned facilities to be placed in the Reserve for Repairs and     
Renovations; and 6.5% of the surplus funds to be placed in the Clean Water      
Management Trust Funds. The remainder of the surplus may be used for            
expenditures during the following fiscal period.                                

The economy-based revenue growth estimate for 2005-06 was lowered from the
5.4% rate used as part of the Governor's proposed budget to 4.8% in the enacted 
budget. The primary reason for reducing baseline revenue growth is that         
prolonged exposure to higher energy prices and interest rate hikes by the       
Federal Reserve has already led to what economists call a "mid-decade slowdown".

 The budget continues the current 4.5% state sales tax rate and 8.25% income
tax bracket for two additional years (see 2004-05 General Fund Budgetary        
Highlights section). It includes changes to simplify and modernize the sales tax
in order to comply with the Streamlined Sales Tax Agreement and to equalize     
rates on consumption. The budget also includes a 25 cent per pack increase in   
the cigarette tax effective September 1, 2005 and an additional 5 cent increase 
effective July 1, 2006. These adopted changes total $628 million for the 2005-06
fiscal year. The fiscal year 2005-06 budget is also supported by overcollections
and reversions from fiscal year 2004-05 that factor into the beginning General  
Fund unreserved fund balance of $478.509 million. The 2005-06 budget calls for  
using $365.1 million of beginning availability, with an estimated ending        
unreserved fund balance of $113.387 million at June 30, 2006.                   

 Litigation. The State is involved in numerous claims and legal proceedings,
many of which normally recur in governmental operations and may have a material 
adverse effect on the financial position of the State.                          

   Debt Administration. During the 2004-05 fiscal year, the State issued $1.0215
billion in general obligation bonds (excluding refunding issues), $53.64 million
in lease-purchase revenue bonds, and $188.39 million in certificates of         
participation (COPs). The new general obligation debt consisted of $705.5       
million in public improvement bonds (consolidation of clean water bonds and     
higher education bonds), $300 million in highway bonds, and $16 million in      
natural gas bonds. The proceeds of the lease-purchase revenue bonds were used to
acquire correctional facilities in Avery County and Pamlico County and will also
be used to pay the cost of design and construction drawings for up to thirteen  
youth development centers. The proceeds of the COPs will be used to construct   
and equip a close security correctional facility in Columbus County, to         
construct a new State psychiatric hospital facility, and to finance higher      
education and other capital projects.                                           

  The State refinanced $986.9 million of its existing debt in fiscal year 2005
to improve cash flow and to take advantage of lower interest rates. By          
refinancing the debt, the State will reduce its future debt service payments by 
approximately $47 million over the next thirteen years.                         

The State's general obligation bonds are secured by a pledge of the faith,
credit, and taxing power of the State. The revenue bonds issued by the State are
secured solely by specified revenue sources. The certificates of participation  
(COPs) and lease-purchase revenue bonds issued by the N.C. Infrastructure       
Finance Corporation, a blended component unit of the State, are secured by lease
and installment payments made by the State, and in the event of default, by a   
security interest in the leased facilities pursuant to a leasehold deed of trust
(as applicable). The COPs issued for repair and renovation projects are not     
secured by a lien upon or security interest in the projects or any other        
property of the State.                                                          

 All payments of the State for the COPs and the lease-purchase revenue bonds
are subject to appropriation by the General Assembly. If the State defaulted on 
its repayments, no deficiency judgment could be rendered against the State, but 
the State property that serves as security could be disposed of to generate     
funds to satisfy the debt. Failure to repay the debt would have negative        
consequences for the State's credit rating. Article 9 of Chapter 142 of the     
General Statutes prohibits the issuance of special indebtedness (e.g., COPs and 
lease-purchase revenue bonds) except for projects specifically authorized by the
General Assembly. The use of alternative financing methods provides financing   
flexibility to the State and permits the State to take advantage of changing    
financial and economic environments.                                            

   The Constitution of North Carolina (Article 5, Section 3) imposes limitations
upon the increase of certain U.S. State debt. It restricts the General Assembly 
from contracting debts secured by a pledge of the faith and credit of the State,
unless approved by a majority of the qualified voters of the State, except for  
the following purposes:                                                         

1.   To fund or refund a valid existing debt;                         

2.   To supply an unforeseen deficiency in the revenue;               

   3.   To borrow in anticipation of the collection of taxes due and payable
        within the current fiscal year to an amount not exceeding 50 percent
of such taxes;                                              

4.   To suppress riots or insurrections; or to repel invasions;       

5.   To meet emergencies immediately threatening the public health or 
      safety, as conclusively determined in writing by the Governor; and

6.   For any other lawful purpose, to the extent of two-thirds of the 
        amount by which the State's outstanding indebtedness shall have been
reduced during the next preceding biennium.                 

Ratings. As of September 2006, all outstanding general obligation bonds of
the State of North Carolina are rated AAA by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services 
and Aa1 by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. Any explanation concerning the       
significance of such ratings must be obtained from the rating agencies. There is
no assurance that any ratings will continue for any period of time or that they 
will not be revised or withdrawn.                                               

  Local Issuances. It should be noted that the creditworthiness of obligations
issued by local North Carolina issuers may be unrelated to the creditworthiness 
of obligations issued by the State of North Carolina, and there is no obligation
on the part of the State to make payment on such local obligations in the event 
of default.

general factors which may impact certain issuers of bonds contained in the North

of all adverse conditions to which the issuers of such obligations are subject. 
Additionally, many factors including national economic, social and environmental
policies and conditions, which are not within the control of the issuers of such

interest on or principal of such bonds.                                         

  The North Carolina IM-IT is susceptible to political, economic or regulatory

Carolina Municipal Obligations"). These include the possible adverse effects of 
certain North Carolina constitutional amendments, legislative measures, voter   
initiatives and other matters that are described. The information provided above

 Ohio Risk Factors

General. The State of Ohio's first constitution was adopted in 1802, and Ohio
entered the union in 1803. Ohio's present constitution was modified by a state  
constitutional convention in 1851 and has since been amended on numerous        
occasions. The Constitution establishes a state governmental structure similar  
to the federal model, with three separate branches of government -- executive,  
legislative, and judicial. The executive branch consists of the Governor and    
Lieutenant Governor, who are jointly elected, and four additional statewide     
elected officials: the Attorney General, the Auditor of State, the Secretary of 
State, and the Treasurer of State. All of these officials are elected to        
four-year terms. More than 100 departments, agencies, boards, and commissions   
are part of the executive branch of government and receive appropriations from  
the legislature, along with three judicial and five legislative agencies.       

The state legislature in Ohio is referred to as the General Assembly and  
consists of two separate chambers, the Senate, a 33-member body, and the House  
of Representatives, a 99-member body. Each member of the General Assembly is    
elected to represent the residents of a geographical district for a specified   
term. Members of Ohio's General Assembly are subject to term-limits; senators   
are restricted to serving two four-year terms, and representatives are          
restricted to serving four two-year terms. Each chamber has a presiding officer 
to call the chamber to order and direct the calendar of events. The presiding   
officer in the Senate is the President of the Senate, and the presiding officer 
of the House of Representatives is the Speaker of the House. A new General      
Assembly is convened in January of each odd-numbered year. Along with the       
establishment of our state governmental structure, the Constitution requires    
Ohio to have a balanced budget. Ohio's budget is prepared for a period of two   
years - a biennium -, which begins on July 1 of odd-numbered years and ends 24  
months later on June 30.                                                        

   The State provides a wide range of services and support to its citizenry that
are accounted for in the following functions or programs: primary, secondary and
other education, higher education support, public assistance and Medicaid,      
health and human services, justice and public protection, environmental         
protection and natural resources, transportation, general government, community 
and economic development, workers' compensation, lottery, unemployment          
compensation, tuition credits, liquor control, and other business-type          
activities.                                                                     

Economic Overview. Economic growth continued through 2005 at a solid but  
somewhat slower pace. Held back in the fourth quarter by the after-effects of   
the late summer hurricanes along the Gulf Coast, real GDP expanded by 3.5       
percent, compared with growth of 4.2 percent in 2004. Consumer spending         
accounted for most of the increase, followed by business investment in equipment
and software, government purchases, investment in residential structures, and   
net exports. Business inventories shrank in response to the strong demand.      
Consumer spending was fueled by solid increases in personal income, arising from
steady growth in hourly earnings and employment. Average hourly earnings grew by
3.2 percent from December 2004 to December 2005 and continued to accelerate in  
2006. Total employment increased by almost 200,000 jobs per month on average    
through August 2005. After slowing for two months due to damage from the        
hurricanes, employment growth rebounded to its previous pace in November and    
following months. In addition, consumers borrowed more on credit cards and      
against their homes, pushing the quarterly saving rate into negative territory  
for the first time on record in the third quarter of 2005 and again in the      
fourth quarter.                                                                 

Flush with high profits and heavy cash flow, corporations continued to    
increase capital expenditures at a brisk, though slower, pace in 2005 than in   
2004. Investment in equipment and software increased at an annual rate of 8.7   
percent, down from 13.8 percent in 2004. Again the hurricanes restrained growth 
late in the third period. Home building and remodeling also made solid          
contributions to overall growth again in 2005, with investment in residential   
structures rising 7.6 percent during 2005, compared with 6.6 percent in 2004.   
Low mortgage rates and easier credit terms combined with high confidence levels 
through much of the period to support housing activity. Construction was begun  
on more houses in 2005 than in any year since 1973. Sales of new and of existing
homes both set new record highs. Signs of weakness in the housing sector have   
begun to surface, with inventories of unsold homes rising and prices rising less
rapidly or even falling in some markets.                                        

The more than 20-percent depreciation in the foreign exchange value of the
dollar during the last four years began to affect trade flows in 2005. The trade
deficit continued to widen during the year, but by less than in 2004. In        
addition to the cheaper dollar, a strengthening in growth overseas added to     
demand for U.S. exports, which increased by 6.9 percent in 2005. Imports grew by
6.4 percent. The Ohio economy continued to move forward unevenly in 2005.       
Activity was supported by strong domestic motor vehicle production, growing     
demand overseas for U.S. manufactured goods, and residential construction       
activity. Employment growth resumed in 2005 after the second-half slide in 2004,
with the number of jobs rising by 29,300 from December 2004 to December 2005.   
The fastest growing major sectors in terms of employment were Professional &    
Business Services, Education & Health Services, and Leisure & Hospitality. The  
unemployment rate was stable during 2005, ending the year at 5.9 percent,       
compared with the national unemployment rate of 4.9 percent. Ohio personal      
income grew by 4.4 percent in 2005, driven by modest job growth and improving   
growth in wages and salaries. This marked the fastest rate of increase in Ohio  
personal income since 2000, following growth of 4.2 percent in 2004, 2.8 percent
in 2003, 2.3 percent in 2002, and 1.6 percent in 2001. U.S. personal income     
growth slowed in 2005 to 5.5 percent from 5.9 percent in 2004.                  

 The consensus is for a rebound in economic growth nationally in 2006, after
the temporary slowdown in response to the Gulf Coast hurricanes. Forecasters    
trimmed their projections for growth in late 2005 by 0.5 to 1.0 percentage      
points and raised projections for growth during the first half of 2006 by like  
amounts. The performance of the economy early in 2006 has been in line with     
expectations of stronger growth.                                                

   Major Initiatives. In June 2005, the Governor signed Amended Substitute House
Bill 66, the biennial budget bill, which when combined with other legislation   
authorizing expenditures, provides approximately $25.3 billion in fiscal year   
2006 and $25.9 billion in FY 2007 in General Revenue Fund (GRF) dollars and     
$53.6 billion in fiscal year 2006 and $55.2 billion in fiscal year 2007 in all  
funds for the operating budget. The GRF appropriations in this budget will      
result in the two slowest growing fiscal years of the last 40 years, with GRF   
growth rates of 1.9 percent in FY 2006 and 2.6 percent in FY 2007. Many agencies
will spend less from the GRF in FY 2007 than they spent in FY 2000. The majority
of GRF spending increases over this time period can be attributed to increased  
spending in primary and secondary education, Medicaid, debt service, and        
property tax relief programs.                                                   

   To improve Ohio's competitiveness the FY 2006-2007 budget enacted fundamental
tax reform making a number of changes to address situations in which Ohio's high
tax rates act as disincentives to investment and employment. The tax reform     
reduces the burden on investment and encourages capital formation, which in turn
will increase productivity and encourage growth in employment and income.       
Because the State must continue to meet its financial obligations and make      
strategic public investments in education and infrastructure, cuts in taxes on  
capital investment are phased in over time, and also balanced with innovative   
solutions to raise the revenue needed to pay for essential public services.     

Consistent with the recommendations of the Ohio Commission to Reform      
Medicaid, the FY 2006-2007 budget adopts strategies to reduce projected costs in
the FY 2006-2007 biennium and sets the stage for responsible long-term Medicaid 
reform using strategies that will control the rate of growth over time. These   
strategies are intended to deliver cost effective and preventive care for       
low-income families and children; provide cost-effective, non-institutional     
residential options and health care for seniors; and improve the information    
technology used to manage the Medicaid program.                                 

The current biennium continues to make progress on Governor Taft's Rebuild
Ohio Plan, which addresses the facility needs of all Ohio school districts. The 
plan will allow every Ohio school child to learn in safe, modern facilities and 
give school districts the capability to create customized classrooms and        
instruction tailored to meet students' needs. The School Facilities Commission, 
charged with providing funding to public school districts and overseeing the    
construction and renovation of school facilities, spends approximately $2       
million daily on new school construction and repair. Since the inception of the 
Commission in May 1997, $3.5 billion has been used to construct or repair 270   
new or renovated buildings. The FY 2006 budget provides an additional $220      
million from the General Revenue Fund and other sources to support construction 
projects.                                                                       

 Revenues and Expenditures. For fiscal year 2005, revenues slightly outpaced
expenses, and when combined with transfers from the State's business-type       
activities, an increase of $970.9 million in net assets resulted for            
governmental activities. Revenues for fiscal year 2005 in the amount of $40.29  
billion were 5.9 percent higher than those reported for fiscal year 2004. This  
increase in revenues can, in part, be attributed to strong personal income tax  
and corporation franchise tax collections. Expenses followed the trend as the   
reported $40.12 billion in spending represented a 5.1 percent increase over     
fiscal year 2004. Net transfers for fiscal year 2005 also increased to $807.7   
million, or by 3.4 percent, when compared to fiscal year 2004.                  

   Budgetary Control. The State's management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining internal control designed to ensure that the State's assets are     
protected from loss, theft, or misuse and to ensure that adequate accounting    
data are compiled to allow for the preparation of financial statements in       
conformity with GAAP. Internal control is designed to provide reasonable, but   
not absolute, assurance that these objectives are met. The concept of reasonable
assurance recognizes that: 1) the cost of a control should not exceed the       
benefits likely to be derived, and 2) the valuation of costs and benefits       
requires estimates and judgments by management. In fiscal year 1992, an         
executive order initiated the Internal Accounting Control Program (IACP). The   
IACP establishes written guidelines for state agencies to follow during periodic
management reviews of their accounting operations. Under the program, agencies  
are required to formally establish, maintain, and annually evaluate and report  
on internal accounting control.                                                 

 The State's Central Accounting System (CAS) achieves budgetary control over
the various accounts of the State's funds. The General Assembly, authorizes     
expenditures by appropriating funds in biennial and supplemental appropriation  
acts. The Office of Budget and Management uses the CAS to control departmental  
obligation and expenditure activity to ensure authorized appropriations are not 
exceeded. The State's non-GAAP budgetary financial statements are prepared on a 
modified cash basis of accounting. This means that revenues are recognized when 
cash is received and expenditures are recognized when cash is paid.             
Encumbrances, reservations of appropriation authority as of June 30, the end of 
the State fiscal year, are reflected as expenditures on the budgetary basis of  
accounting. Budget-to-actual comparisons can be found in this report for each   
governmental fund for which an appropriated annual budget has been adopted. For 
the General Fund and major special revenue funds, these comparisons are         
presented as part of the basic financial statements. For other budgeted         
governmental funds with appropriated annual budgets, budget-to-actual           
comparisons are in the non-major governmental funds section of the CAFR.        

The CAS maintains all non-GAAP budgetary basis transactions and most GAAP 
basis adjustments. In addition to the information obtained from the CAS for     
financial reporting, selected financial information provided by the State's     
agencies and departments is compiled to complete the GAAP basis financial       
statements. Differences between the two bases of accounting (GAAP vs. non-GAAP  
budgetary) include: 1) entity differences -- the GAAP reporting entity may      
include organizations such as financing authorities and other component units   
that are not included in the State's budget; 2) basis differences -- the GAAP   
basis results in the reporting of accruals while the non-GAAP budgetary basis   
results in the reporting of cash transactions; and 3) timing differences -- for 
example, GAAP recognizes expenditures for payables for goods and services       
received, whereas the non-GAAP budgetary basis considers unliquidated           
encumbrances as expenditures.                                                   

  Cash Management. In Ohio, with the exception of certain organizations within
the State's reporting entity that have independent powers to manage and invest  
their funds, the Treasurer of State is responsible for investing the State's    
cash and investments pool. During fiscal year 2004, cash management and         
investment transactions made by the Treasurer of State's Office, in accordance  
with the Uniform Depository Act, were limited to checking accounts and          
certificates of deposit with qualified public depositories, U.S. government and 
agency obligations, commercial paper, repurchase agreements, bankers'           
acceptances, bonds of foreign nations diplomatically recognized by the United   
States, and security lending agreements.                                        

Quarterly, the Office of Budget and Management allocates the investment   
income earned on the cash and investments pool to the various funds designated  
by law to receive the earnings. The allocation is calculated in accordance with 
a formula based on average daily cash balances invested over the quarter. The   
Ohio Lottery Commission's investment portfolio, which is dedicated to the       
payment of deferred lottery prizes and is accounted for as part of the cash and 
investments pool, however, is not part of the investment earnings allocation    
just described. Instead, the Treasurer of State credits the investment earnings 
from the dedicated portfolio directly to the credit of the fund that accounts   
for this activity.                                                              

Risk Management. The State's primary government is self-insured for claims
under the Ohio Med Health and United Healthcare plans and for vehicle liability 
while it has placed public official fidelity bonding with a private insurer. The
State self-funds tort liability and most property losses on a pay-as-you-go     
basis; however, selected state agencies have acquired private insurance for     
their property losses. Also, the State's primary government and its component   
units participate in a public entity risk pool, which is accounted for in the   
Bureau of Workers' Compensation Enterprise Fund, for the financing of their     
workers' compensation liability.                                                

Ratings. As of September 2006, all outstanding general obligation bonds of
the State of Ohio are rated AA+ by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services and Aa1 by
Moody's Investor's Service, Inc. Any explanation concerning the significance of 
such ratings must be obtained from the rating agencies. There is no assurance   
that any ratings will continue for any period of time or that they will not be  
revised or withdrawn.                                                           

  Local Issuances. It should be noted that the creditworthiness of obligations
issued by local Ohio issuers may be unrelated to the creditworthiness of        
obligations issued by the State of Ohio, and there is no obligation on the part 
of the State to make payment on such local obligations in the event of default. 

The foregoing information constitutes only a brief summary of some of the 
general factors which may impact certain issuers of bonds contained in the Ohio 
IM-IT and does not purport to be a complete or exhaustive description of all    
adverse conditions to which the issuers of such obligations are subject.        
Additionally, many factors including national economic, social and environmental
policies and conditions, which are not within the control of the issuers of such
bonds, could affect or could have an adverse impact on the financial condition  
of the State and various agencies and political subdivisions thereof. The       
Sponsor is unable to predict whether or to what extent such factors or other    
factors may affect the issuers of the bonds contained in the Ohio IM-IT, the    
market value or marketability of such bonds or the ability of the respective    
issuers of such bonds acquired by the Ohio IM-IT to pay interest on or principal
of such bonds.                                                                  

The Ohio IM-IT is susceptible to political, economic or regulatory factors
affecting issuers of Ohio municipal obligations (the "Ohio Municipal            
Obligations"). These include the possible adverse effects of certain Ohio       
constitutional amendments, legislative measures, voter initiatives and other    
matters that are described. The information provided above is only a brief      
summary of the complex factors affecting the financial situation in Ohio and is 
derived from sources that are generally available to investors and are believed 
to be accurate. No independent verification has been made of the accuracy or    
completeness of any of the following information. It is based in part on        
information obtained from various State and local agencies in Ohio or contained 
in Official Statements for various Ohio Municipal Obligations.                  

 Oklahoma Risk Factors

Economic Outlook. Oklahoma is an attractive place in which to live and    
conduct business. The state enjoys a very low cost of doing business, has a     
highly skilled and productive work force, enjoys low energy costs and is        
geographically well positioned for interstate commercial activity. For example, 
Oklahoma lies at the crossroads of U.S. Interstates 35, 40 and 44, three of the 
nation's most important transportation and shipping corridors, allowing state   
businesses to take advantage of opportunities anywhere in the United States.    
Oklahoma boasts high quality education systems with award winning schools, which
are considered models for career-technology, common, and higher education.      
Oklahoma's School of Science and Math in Oklahoma City consistently ranks among 
the top schools in the country.                                                 

Oklahoma is also known for its abundant resources. The state remains a    
leading producer of oil and natural gas, allowing Oklahoma manufacturers to take
advantage of some of the lowest energy prices in the nation. Oklahoma is a      
leading producer of agricultural products, ranking in the top ten in production 
of wheat, peanuts, grain sorghum, pecans, rye, hogs and cattle. Oklahomans also 
enjoy many opportunities for outdoor recreation and, due to its many man-made   
reservoirs, Oklahoma has more miles of shoreline than any other state.          

Oklahoma's economy has made great gains since the economic recession of   
2001-2002. Oklahoma was rated one of the "Top 10 Pro-Business States for 2005"  
by Pollina Corporate Real Estate. The national study recognized Oklahoma for its
business incentives and economic development efforts. Oklahoma's economy has    
added 26,700 new jobs over the past year. In 2005, state job growth outpaced the
nation with growth of 1.8% compared to 1.4% for the U.S. Oklahoma's unemployment
rate also outpaced the nation with a 9% decline in unemployment from 4.7% in    
October of 2004 to 4.3% in October of 2005. For the same periods in time, the   
U.S. unemployment rate decreased by 9% from 5.5% to 5.0%. Some of the most      
notable employment announcements taking place in Oklahoma include: 363 jobs     
being added in Oklahoma City by Walgreens, 500 in Bartlesville by               
ConocoPhillips, 400 in Tulsa by Lenders Services Direct, and Cherokee ConneX LLC
announced plans to add 840 jobs in Muskogee.                                    

   Oklahoma emerged from the revenue shortfall years of FY-2002 and FY-2003 with
solid revenue growth in FY-2004 and FY-2005. Actual revenue collected again     
exceeded 100% of the estimate and, for the first time since the creation of the 
Rainy Day Fund, a deposit of $243.8 million into the fund raised the balance to 
the maximum allowed by law. The legal maximum is equal to 10% of the prior      
fiscal year's general revenue fund appropriations, or $461.3 million for fiscal 
year 2005.                                                                      

In addition, the Governor proposed and the Legislature passed legislation 
which provided for the surplus revenue collected above the Rainy Day maximum to 
be used for two purposes. HB 1193 directed 50% of any surplus revenue collected 
in FY-2005 to be deposited in the Oklahoma Taxpayer Relief Fund. This fund      
provided a one-time tax rebate payment to all taxpayers in the State of         
Oklahoma. Rebates were $45 for single taxpayers and $90 for joint taxpayers. The
other 50% of excess surplus funds were directed to the Oklahoma Dynamic Economy 
and Budget Security Fund. This fund is subject to legislative appropriation and 
is to be used for promoting research and development of critical sectors of the 
state's economy, commercialization of technology, health care, promotion of     
endowments to nonprofit entities, unmet infrastructure needs and to provide a   
source of funds for any needed stabilization of the budget for the fiscal year  
ending June 30, 2006. These funds provide an additional cash source in case of a
shortfall but more importantly provide revenues for strategic research and      
development investments to grow Oklahoma's economy. A $92 million deposit was   
made to each of these funds.                                                    

The Teachers' Retirement System (TRS) has accrued liabilities in excess of
its assets and projected asset growth. The annual valuation performed at June
30, 2005 reflects an increase in the funded position from the funding level at  
June 30, 2004. It also reflects that based on current statutes for determining  
the state, federal, and employer contribution rates, the funded period, which is
the number of years that would be required to amortize the unfunded actuarial   
accrued liability, is 42.6 years. This compares to an infinite amortization     
period at June 30, 2004. The actuarial accrued liability decreased $28 million  
and the actuarial value of assets increased $291 million. As a result, the      
System's unfunded actuarial accrued liabilities decreased $319 million to $7.1  
billion at June 30, 2005. The decrease in the funded period and the increase in 
the funded ratio are due to the adoption of actuarial assumption changes        
determined from an experience study performed during the year ended June 30,
2005. A task force to study the retirement benefits offered Oklahoma teachers,  
the optimal retirement benefits offering and solutions to the funding shortfall 
in the system was appointed.                                                    

Major Initiatives. The Governor and Legislature focused on a number of    
significant issues during the 2005 legislative session designed to encourage    
economic development, improve education and increase access to quality health   
care services. The Governor proposed and the Legislature passed legislation     
expanding the retirement income tax exemption by increasing the retirement      
income qualifications and increasing the income exemption amount from $7,500 to 
$ 10,000. The Legislature passed and the Governor signed legislation eliminating
method II of the income tax rate with a maximum individual income tax rate of   
10% and reduced the top individual income tax rate from 6.65% to 6.25%. In      
addition, legislation was enacted that exempts 50% of all military retirement   
income effective for the 2006 calendar year. To spur strategic economic         
development, HB 1547 exempts Oklahoma source capital gains from the corporate   
income tax rate. Property located in this state must be owned for 5 years before
claiming the exemption while stocks and interest from an Oklahoma company must  
be held for 3 years before claiming the exemption. This component encourages all
people to invest in Oklahoma.                                                   

   SB 982 created the Achieving Classroom Excellence (ACE) Act of 2005, Governor
Henry's education initiative. Some highlights of this education reform package  
are outlined below. The ACE Act created the Achieving Classroom Excellence (ACE)
Task Force whose charge is to study state testing requirements for 8th grade and
high school students, hold public hearings, make recommendations and present a  
report to the Legislature and Governor by 12-31-05. ACE requires students to    
demonstrate mastery of state academic content standards in reading and math by  
the 8th grade, beginning in the 2009-2010 school year. ACE provided $2 million  
each for teacher training and bonuses to improve middle school math and for math
labs in ten middle schools with records of low performance. ACE requires        
students entering the 9th grade in the 2008 - 2009 school year to demonstrate   
mastery in four out of six subject areas to receive a high school diploma and to
complete three units of math in grades 9 through 12. Students entering 9th grade
in the 2006 - 2007 school year will be enrolled in a college preparatory        
curriculum unless their parents opt out. ACE also provided $1.4 million for     
tuition waivers for up to six credit hours per semester for high school seniors.
ACE also addressed early childhood education. School districts will be required 
to offer full day kindergarten by the 2011-2012 school year. More than 70       
percent of school districts already offer this, and the FY-2006 budget provides 
school districts an increased rate for full day kindergarten at a cost of $21.6 
million as an incentive to implement the program. Districts with bonded         
indebtedness exceeding 85 percent of the maximum allowable at any time within   
previous five years are exempted from the requirement. The FY-2006 budget       
includes $57.8 million for the second year of the multi-year teacher's salary   
increase plan to reach the regional average. While the average teacher salary   
for this fiscal year is not yet known, the average salary increase was estimated
to be $1,300. Further aiming to fairly compensate Oklahoma's teachers and       
support personnel, the budget also includes $42.8 million to fully annualize and
pay for 100 percent of teachers' and support personnel health insurance.        

Revenues and Expenditures. Revenue collections continue to improve in the 
current fiscal year. In the first five months, General Revenue Fund collections 
are $65.3 million (or 3.1%) above estimated collections and $180.8 million (or  
9.8%) above prior year collections. Individual and corporate income taxes and   
sales taxes are primarily responsible for the revenue increases. Gross          
production tax on natural gas has increased over the prior year, but is below   
estimated collections. The growth of income and sales tax collections is a good 
indicator that the underlying state economy continues to gain strength. The     
likelihood of budget cuts during the current fiscal year is remote unless the   
current trends reverse.                                                         

Receipts from all of the four major taxes (income tax, sales tax, gross   
production tax and motor vehicle tax) exceeded revenues of the prior year,      
producing a combined total of $4.4 billion, or 88% of total GRF receipts. The   
total of major taxes collected increased $292.3 million or 7.2% from that of the
prior year, an indication of increased business activity. As compared to fiscal 
year 2004, collections from income taxes increased by $190.2 million, or 9.0%;  
sales taxes increased by $52.8 million, or 4.1%; motor vehicle taxes decreased  
by $2.2 million, or (1.0%); and gross production taxes on gas increased by $51.5
million, or 11.6%.                                                              

Oklahoma has established an enviable record in recent years in its revenue
forecasting results. Since enactment of a constitutional amendment in 1985      
establishing new revenue estimating procedures, collections have exceeded the   
estimate in eight years and dipped below the estimate seven years.              

  Assets and Funds. The assets of the State exceeded its liabilities at fiscal
year ending June 30, 2005 by $11 billion (presented as "net assets"). Of this   
amount, $2.4 billion was reported as "unrestricted net assets." Unrestricted net
assets represent the amount available to be used to meet the State's ongoing    
obligations to citizens and creditors. The State's total net assets increased by
$873 million (an 8.6% increase) in fiscal year 2005, equal to the 8.6% increase 
from the previous fiscal year. Net assets of government activities increased by 
$697 million (a 5.1% increase), while net assets of the business-type activities
showed an increase of $176 million (a 24.8% increase).                          

  As of the close of fiscal year 2005, the State's governmental funds reported
a combined ending fund balance of $4.1 billion, an increase of $615.7 million in
comparison with the prior year. Of this total amount, $2.16 billion represents  
the "unreserved fund balances," all being in the general fund. Of this $2.16    
billion, $489 million (increased $57 million) is in the Cash Flow Reserve Fund  
and $461 million (increased $244 million) is in the Rainy Day Fund leaving $1.2 
billion (increased $143 million) as undesignated for the general fund. This $1.2
billion is roughly 10.4% of the total governmental funds expenditures for the   
year. This ratio improved from 9.7% a year ago.                                 

The State's total long-term debt obligations showed a net increase of $24 
million (20.8%) in the governmental type activities and a net increase of $167  
million (31.2%) the business type activities during the current fiscal year. The
key factor causing the governmental type increase was the issuance of $154      
million in new OCIA revenue bonds. The large debt increase in the business type 
activities was from the issuance of $204 million in new revenue bonds by the    
Oklahoma Water Resources Board.                                                 

  Government Funds. For FY-2006, the Governor proposed in Senate Bill 547, the
Oklahoma Prescription Drug Discount Program Act of 2005, a new program which    
will assist Oklahomans with no prescription drug coverage to access all         
prescription drug manufacturers' free and discount drug programs through a      
single point of entry. This program will utilize a pharmacy benefit manager     
software product that can automatically assess for the consumer which drugs     
through which manufacturers they qualify for assistance. This process will make 
access to these programs much easier and more understandable for those who use  
it in addition to increasing access to free and discount drugs.                 

 In Medicaid, funds were appropriated to bring the payment rates for doctors
and hospitals to the benchmark standard of 100% of the Medicare rate of payment 
for services. The state share of this funding was $63 million and it will yield 
a total of $196.3 million for payment to providers when state and federal       
matching funds are combined. Also in Medicaid, funding was provided for a full  
12 months of eligibility for Medicaid services. This change makes it possible   
for the first time in the state's Medicaid history for an enrollee to be        
eligible for services and keep the same primary care provider for a full year.  

The focus of the State's governmental funds is to provide information on  
near-term inflows, outflows, and balances of spendable resources. Such          
information is useful in assessing the State's financing requirements. In       
particular, unreserved fund balance may serve as a useful measure of a          
government's net resources available for spending at the end of the fiscal year.

As of the end of the current fiscal year, the State's governmental funds  
reported combined ending fund balances of $4.1 billion, an increase of $615.7   
million from the prior year. More than one half ($2.2 billion or 53%) of this   
total amount constitutes unreserved fund balance, which is available for        
spending in the coming year. The remainder of fund balance is reserved to       
indicate that it is not available for new spending because it has already been  
committed (1) to liquidate contracts and purchase orders of the prior fiscal    
year ($228 million), (2) to pay debt service ($89 million), (3) to be held in   
permanent trust funds for education, wildlife and prevention of tobacco related 
health issues ($1.6 billion) or (4) for a variety of other restricted purposes  
($41.6 million).                                                                

  The general fund is the chief operating fund of the State. At the end of the
current fiscal year, unreserved fund balance of the general fund was $2.16      
billion, while the total fund balance increased $450 million to $2.52 billion.  
As a measure of the general fund's liquidity, it may be useful to compare both  
unreserved fund balance and total fund balance to total fund expenditures.      
Unreserved fund balance represents 19% of total general fund expenditures (up   
from 16% a year ago), while total fund balance represents 22% of that same      
amount (up from 19%). Overall the fund balance of the State's general fund      
increased by $450 million during the current fiscal year. This is a 21.7%       
increase from the prior year.                                                   

 The Commissioners of the Land Office Permanent Fund, which accounts for the
land and cash granted to the State by the United States Congress for the use and
benefit of educational systems in Oklahoma, continues to recover from a two year
period in 2002 and 2001 of poor investment earnings which caused noticeable     
decreases in fund balance. Because of better market conditions, this fund       
reported a $155 million gain in net investment revenues. Overall, the current   
year activity resulted in an increase in the fund balance of $103.7 million for 
the year. This is an increase of about 8.8% from the previous year fund balance.
Expenditures and transfers from the fund to benefit educational systems in      
Oklahoma decreased by $13 million to about $63 million. The Department of       
Wildlife's Lifetime Licenses fund balance increased by 9.3% to $66.4 million.   
This increase occurred due to increases in both license revenue and investment  
revenue over the previous year.                                                 

   The Tobacco Settlement Endowment Permanent Fund holds certain moneys that are
received in settlement of claims by the state against tobacco manufacturers.    
Earnings from these moneys are to be utilized for research, education,          
prevention and treatment of tobacco related diseases and certain other health   
programs. This fund reported a $56.8 million increase in fund balance with most 
of the increase, $43.5 million, coming from the settlement payment by tobacco   
manufacturers for 2005. The prior year's payment was about $39 million. The     
state now has $245.4 million in the permanent fund.                             

Debt Administration. General obligation bonds are backed by the full faith
and credit of the State, including the State's power to levy additional taxes to
ensure repayment of the debt. Accordingly, all general obligation debt currently
outstanding was approved by a vote of the citizens. Prior to a 1993 general     
obligation bond program, except for refunding bonds, the State last issued      
general obligation bonds in 1968. Certain maturities of those bonds were advance
refunded in 1977 and again in 2003. As of June 30, 2005, the outstanding general
obligation net debt of the State of Oklahoma was $261.2 million. This figure    
excludes the self-supporting taxable bonds of the Oklahoma Industrial Finance   
Authority, which are secured by the repayment of loans made to private          
businesses. State revenues have never been required to support debt service     
payments on these obligations. Various agencies, trusts, and authorities issue  
revenue bonds on behalf of the State of Oklahoma, and these obligations are     
supported solely by the revenues of the issuing entities. Those revenues may    
include appropriations to the respective entities.                              

Risk Management. In general the State is "self-insured" for health care   
claims, workers' compensation, tort liability, vehicle liability, and property  
losses, with some exceptions for participation in health maintenance            
organizations and for excess coverage items. The property loss excess coverage  
is limited to a maximum loss of $1 billion. The Oklahoma State and Education    
Employees' Group Insurance Board provides group health, life, dental and        
disability benefits to the State's employees and certain other eligible         
participants. The State Insurance Fund provides workers' compensation coverage  
for both public and private sector employees in Oklahoma.                       

Ratings. As of September 2006, all outstanding general obligation bonds of
the State of Oklahoma are rated AA by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services and Aa3
by Moody's Investor's Service, Inc. Any explanation concerning the significance 
of such ratings must be obtained from the rating agencies. There is no assurance
that any ratings will continue for any period of time or that they will not be  
revised or withdrawn.                                                           

  Local Issuances. It should be noted that the creditworthiness of obligations
issued by local Oklahoma issuers may be unrelated to the creditworthiness of    
obligations issued by the State of Oklahoma, and there is no obligation on the  
part of the State to make payment on such local obligations in the event of     
default.                                                                        

The foregoing information constitutes only a brief summary of some of the 
general factors which may impact certain issuers of bonds contained in the      
Oklahoma IM-IT and does not purport to be a complete or exhaustive description  
of all adverse conditions to which the issuers of such obligations are subject. 
Additionally, many factors including national economic, social and environmental
policies and conditions, which are not within the control of the issuers of such
bonds, could affect or could have an adverse impact on the financial condition  
of the State and various agencies and political subdivisions thereof. The       
Sponsor is unable to predict whether or to what extent such factors or other    
factors may affect the issuers of the bonds contained in the Oklahoma IM-IT, the
market value or marketability of such bonds or the ability of the respective    
issuers of such bonds acquired by the Oklahoma IM-IT to pay interest on or      
principal of such bonds.                                                        

The Oklahoma IM-IT is susceptible to political, economic or regulatory    
factors affecting issuers of Oklahoma municipal obligations (the "Oklahoma      
Municipal Obligations"). These include the possible adverse effects of certain  
Oklahoma constitutional amendments, legislative measures, voter initiatives and 
other matters that are described. The information provided above is only a brief
summary of the complex factors affecting the financial situation in Oklahoma and
is derived from sources that are generally available to investors and are       
believed to be accurate. No independent verification has been made of the       
accuracy or completeness of any of the following information. It is based in    
part on information obtained from various State and local agencies in Oklahoma  
or contained in Official Statements for various Oklahoma Municipal Obligations. 

 Oregon Risk Factors

 General Economic Conditions. Oregon is the least populous of the three west
coast states that also include California and Washington. Oregon had about 1.9  
million of the three states' 23.1 million workers in late 2005. Oregon's largest
metro area is the Portland-Vancouver-Beaverton metropolitan statistical area.   
The Portland area is the sixth largest of the seven metro areas with one million
or more workers in the three states. It includes about half of Oregon's jobs.   

   Employment grew more rapidly in Oregon than in most neighboring states in the
mid-1990s due largely to a boom in high technology (primarily computer chips),  
transportation equipment (such as recreational vehicles and heavy trucks), and  
construction. The Asian financial crisis in 1997 led to weaker manufacturing    
employment and slower overall job growth in Oregon. Then the national recession 
hit the state. Between late 2000 and the middle of 2003, employment fell by as  
much as 4.0 percent, much worse than neighboring states. Since then, Oregon has 
seen very rapid job recovery. The state surpassed its November 2000 prerecession
peak employment level in early 2005 and added about 35,000 jobs (+2.2%) during  
the following eight months.                                                     

During the rapid job growth of the mid-1990s, Oregon's unemployment rate  
ranked in the middle of all states and lower than its neighboring states.       
However, the rate rose with the Asian financial crisis. During the economic boom
of the late 1990s and in 2000, Oregon's unemployment rate did not fall as low as
did the rates in neighboring states. With the onset of the recession, Oregon's  
unemployment rate soared from just over 5.0 percent in late 2000 to a peak of   
8.5 percent in the middle of 2003. The state's population continued to grow     
despite the high unemployment rate with weaker, but still positive, net         
migration. Oregon had the nation's highest or second-highest state unemployment 
rate for 43 months, from April 2001 to October 2004. With the recovery in job   
growth, the unemployment rate eased to about 6.0 percent by late 2005, still    
about one percentage point higher than the national rate.                       

Oregon's major export-related industries include lumber and wood products,
high technology, agriculture and food products, machinery, transportation       
equipment, and tourism-related sectors. The state also has a concentration in   
call center employment. Despite the recent rapid job recovery, forecasters see  
no major source of rapid job growth in the near future. Therefore, annual       
employment growth is expected to slow to less than 1.5 percent by 2007 and to   
only 1.0 percent by 2011. Still, this is higher than the growth forecast for the
nation as a whole. Job growth is expected to be fastest in the professional and 
business services sector and in the health care industry. Manufacturing is      
projected to lose jobs. With population projected to grow faster than jobs      
between 2005 and 2011, Oregon may continue to have an elevated unemployment     
rate.                                                                           

During the past ten years, the State's general governmental expenditures  
related to education have increased in amount, but have decreased as a          
percentage of total expenditures (a ten-year decrease of 4.5 percent). This     
relative decline results from a shift in allocation of total expenditures for   
other program areas such as public safety, transportation, and debt service     
expenditures. Although general governmental expenditures related to human       
resources have increased as programs to serve needy Oregonians have expanded,   
the percentage of total expenditures remains the same as it was ten years ago.  

During this same ten-year period, federal revenues, while continuing to   
increase in amount, have actually decreased as a percentage of total revenue (a 
ten-year decrease of 3.8 percent). The reason for this relative decline is the  
relative increase in general governmental expenditures related to services that 
are supported more by taxes than by federal revenues (e.g., education, human    
resources, public safety); thus, as taxes have increased to support these       
services, so has the proportion of total revenue generated by taxes.            

The unemployment rate for Oregon is currently 6.0 percent, down from 7.3  
percent a year ago. This is higher than the national rate of 5.0 percent.       
Employment growth in the second quarter of 2005 was 3.1 percent. This was the   
eighth consecutive quarter of job growth, an indication of a well-established   
economic recovery in Oregon's job market.                                       

Budgetary Process. The Oregon budget is approved on a biennial basis by   
separate appropriation measures. A biennium begins July 1 and ends June 30 of   
odd-numbered years. Measures are passed for the approaching biennium during each
regular Legislative session, held beginning in January of odd-numbered years.   

Because the Oregon Legislative Assembly meets in regular session for      
approximately six months of each biennium, provision is made for interim funding
through the Legislative Emergency Board. The Emergency Board is authorized to   
make allocations of General Fund monies to State agencies from the State        
Emergency Fund. The Emergency Board may also authorize increases in expenditure 
limitations from Other or Federal Funds (dedicated or continuously appropriated 
funds), and may take other actions to meet emergency needs when the Legislative 
Assembly is not in session. The most significant feature of the budgeting       
process in Oregon is the constitutional requirement that the budget be in       
balance at the end of each biennium. Because of this provision, Oregon may not  
budget a deficit and is required to alleviate any revenue shortfalls within each
biennium.                                                                       

   Revenue and Expenditures. Actual revenue and other financing sources exceeded
actual expenditures and other financing uses by $212.4 million for the 2003-05  
biennium, increasing the ending budgetary fund balance. For the biennium, actual
revenues were greater than budgetary estimates mainly due to higher than        
expected corporate income tax revenues. These higher than expected corporate    
income tax revenues resulted in a corporate income tax credit of $101.0 million.
Actual expenditures for the biennium were less than budgeted expenditures, as   
presented in the (cash basis) budgetary schedule for the General Fund; however, 
it is expected that the majority of remaining budget will be expended as        
obligations are paid during the six-month lapse period from July 1 to December
31, 2005. The State spent nearly $519.8 million on 1,762 highway and bridge     
construction projects. Nearly $12.0 million was spent on capital equipment used 
to maintain highways and bridges, such as road graders, bulldozers, and similar 
vehicles. Commitments of $1,085.0 million have been made for highway and bridge 
construction.                                                                   

 Debt Administration and Limitation. The State's constitution authorizes the
issuance of general obligation bonds for financing higher education building    
projects, facilities, institutions, and activities. As of June 30 2005, the     
total balance of general obligation bonds was $4.35 billion.                    

Ratings. As of September 2006, all outstanding general obligation bonds of
the State of Oregon are rated AA- by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services and Aa3 
by Moody's Investor's Service, Inc. Any explanation concerning the significance 
of such ratings must be obtained from the rating agencies. There is no assurance
that any ratings will continue for any period of time or that they will not be  
revised or withdrawn.                                                           

  Local Issuances. It should be noted that the creditworthiness of obligations
issued by local Oregon issuers may be unrelated to the creditworthiness of      
obligations issued by the State of Oregon, and there is no obligation on the    
part of the State to make payment on such local obligations in the event of     
default.                                                                        

  Miscellaneous. The foregoing information constitutes only a brief summary of
some of the general factors which may impact certain issuers of bonds contained 
in the Oregon IM-IT and does not purport to be a complete or exhaustive         
description of all adverse conditions to which the issuers of such obligations  
are subject. Additionally, many factors including national economic, social and 
environmental policies and conditions, which are not within the control of the  
issuers of such bonds, could affect or could have an adverse impact on the      
financial condition of the State and various agencies and political subdivisions
thereof. The Sponsor is unable to predict whether or to what extent such factors
or other factors may affect the issuers of the bonds contained in the Oregon    
IM-IT, the market value or marketability of such bonds or the ability of the    
respective issuers of such bonds acquired by the Oregon IM-IT to pay interest on
or principal of such bonds.                                                     

  The Oregon IM-IT is susceptible to political, economic or regulatory factors
affecting issuers of Oregon municipal obligations (the "Oregon Municipal        
Obligations"). These include the possible adverse effects of certain Oregon     
constitutional amendments, legislative measures, voter initiatives and other    
matters that are described. The information provided above is only a brief

 Pennsylvania Risk Factors

Economic Outlook. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania ("Pennsylvania" or the 
"Commonwealth") historically has been identified as a heavy industry state,     
although that reputation has been changing as the industrial composition of     
Pennsylvania's economy continues to diversify into the service sector, including
trade, medical and health services, education and financial institutions.       
Pennsylvania's agricultural industries are also an important component of the   
Commonwealth's economic structure, particularly in crop and livestock products  
as well as agribusiness and food related industries.                            

Greater than projected growth in the national and Pennsylvania economies  
during the second half of 2004 and continuing in early 2005 contributed to      
improvements in several measures of economic activity including income,         
government finances and jobs. In the second half of 2005 economic growth is     
expected to weaken slightly from the cumulative impacts of recent hurricanes and
spikes in oil prices. Significant increases in energy costs will adversely      
impact consumer spending and inflation during late 2005 and early 2006. However,
the national economy is expected to grow at a greater rate during the first part
of 2006 as reconstruction activities accelerate and energy prices and demand    
moderate. Overall, slow-to-moderate economic growth is forecasted for the nation
and Pennsylvania.                                                               

Commonwealth Financial Structure. The Constitution and the laws of the    
Commonwealth require all payments from the State Treasury, with the exception of
refunds of taxes, licenses, fees and other charges, to be made only by duly     
enacted appropriations. Amounts appropriated from a fund may not exceed its     
actual and estimated revenues for the fiscal year plus any unappropriated       
surplus available. Appropriations from the principal operating funds of the     
Commonwealth (the General Fund, the Motor License Fund and the State Lottery    
Fund) are generally made for one fiscal year and are returned to the            
unappropriated surplus of the fund (a lapse) if not spent or encumbered by the  
end of the fiscal year. The Commonwealth's fiscal year begins July 1 and ends   
June 30.                                                                        

The General Fund. The General Fund, the Commonwealth's largest operating  
fund, may be used to assess Pennsylvania's financial position and activities for
the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005. It accounts for all revenues and other     
receipts that are not required by law to be accounted for or deposited in other 
special funds, and reflects a significant portion of Commonwealth expenditures. 
Tax revenues, principally personal and corporate income and sales and use taxes,
constitute approximately 53.6 percent of the General Fund budgetary basis       
revenues. General Fund expenditures are reported in the following functional    
assignments, along with the related percentage of state-funded expenditures:    
direction and supportive services (3.92), protection of persons and property    
(11.84), health and human services (40.04), public education (37.51), recreation
and cultural enrichment (1.11), economic development (2.55), transportation     
(1.49) and transfers to debt service funds (1.54) for all obligations except    
those incurred for highway or other special revenue fund purposes.              

   A moderately growing national economy that achieved preliminary estimates for
growth resulted in improved economic conditions within significant portions of  
the national and Pennsylvania economies. Gains in government revenues, corporate
profits, job creation and personal income were experienced. However, economic   
growth slowed significantly during the second quarter of 2005 in which real     
growth in gross domestic product slowed down from 3.8% to 2.3% on a seasonally  
adjusted annual rate basis. An increase in business inventories led to a slowing
of business investment and manufacturing during the second quarter of 2005.     
Rising energy prices adversely impacted consumer spending, which dropped        
slightly during the second half of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005 while    
personal incomes continued to grow modestly. Job growth continued during the    
fiscal year and the unemployment rate continued to drop throughout the fiscal   
year. Overall, economic conditions positively impacted state revenue growth, as 
revenues exceeded the budget estimate. These additional revenues were used in   
part to replenish portions of reserve funds and to support an increased demand  
for governmental goods and services, particularly in the area of health care    
costs.                                                                          

 During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005, total General Fund revenues and
other sources exceeded expenditures and other uses by $287.3 billion and, at    
June 30, 2005, the Commonwealth reported an unreserved/undesignated fund balance
(budgetary basis) of $364.8 billion in the General Fund.                        

Debt Administration. The constitution of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania 
permits the incurrence of debt, without approval of the electorate, for capital 
projects specifically authorized in a capital budget. Capital project debt      
outstanding cannot exceed one and three quarters (1.75) times the average of the
annual tax revenues deposited in all funds during the previous five fiscal      
years. The certified constitutional debt limit at August 31, 2005 was $45.7     
billion. Outstanding capital project debt at August 31, 2005 amounted to $6.1   
billion, for a remaining legal debt margin of $39.6 billion. In addition to     
constitutionally authorized capital project debt, the Commonwealth may incur    
debt for electorate-approved programs, such as economic revitalization, land and
water development, water facilities restoration, and certain environmental      
initiatives; and for special purposes approved by the General Assembly, such as 
disaster relief. Total general obligation bond indebtedness outstanding at June
30, 2005 was $7.151 billion. Total debt service fund transfers paid from General
Fund and Motor License Fund appropriations to make principal and interest       
payments to bondholders during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005 amounted to  
$778 million and $43 million, respectively.                                     

During the fiscal year ending June 30, 2006, the Office of the Budget     
currently plans general obligation bond issuances, excluding refundings,        
amounting to $882 million, an increase of $481 million as compared to actual    
bond issuances of $401 million, excluding refundings, during the fiscal year    
ended June 30, 2005. This plan reflects the need to make additional investments 
in the Commonwealth's capital infrastructure, local capital projects and mass   
transportation. Additionally, a significant portion of the projected increase in
issuances for the 2006 fiscal year is attributable to two major environmental   
programs which would target capital improvements to water supply and sewage     
treatment facilities associated with economic development as well as general    
environmental capital improvement projects. Debt principal retirements of $535.7
million are currently planned for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2006.         

The Commonwealth continues to evaluate refunding opportunities for its    
outstanding bonds to reduce interest costs. During the fiscal year ending June
30, 2005, $1,469 million of outstanding bonds were refunded to produce over     
$71.4 million of interest savings over the remaining life of those bonds. As    
market conditions provide additional opportunities, the Commonwealth may pursue 
additional refundings.                                                          

In addition to general obligation bonds, the Commonwealth may issue tax   
anticipation notes to meet operating cash needs during certain months of the    
fiscal year. Tax anticipation notes may be issued only for the General Fund and 
the Motor License Fund. They may not exceed 20% of the funds' estimated revenues
for the year, and must mature during the fiscal year in which they were issued. 
Cash shortages may occur during the fiscal year because tax receipts, unlike    
cash disbursements, are concentrated in the last four months of the fiscal year.
The Commonwealth has not issued tax anticipation notes during the past seven    
fiscal years and has no plans to issue any during the 2005 fiscal year. There   
were no changes in credit ratings and there were no debt limitations during the 
fiscal year ended June 30, 2005 that may affect the Commonwealth's plans during 
the fiscal year ending June 30, 2006.                                           

Capital Asset Activity. Throughout the fiscal year, Commonwealth agencies 
acquire or construct capital assets. In governmental fund statements,           
expenditures for capital assets are typically reported as capital outlay.       
Funding for a significant portion of capital asset acquisition is provided by   
proceeds of general obligation bonds issued; such proceeds are generally        
accounted for in the capital projects funds in the funds financial statements as
an other financing source. Construction in progress for Department of General   
Services (public works) and Department of Transportation (highway and bridge)   
projects at June 30, 2005 amounted to $1.1 and $1.6 billion, respectively.      
Authorized but unissued general obligation bonds at June 30, 2005 totaled $46.5 
billion. General capital assets as of June 30, 2005 amounted to $22.0 billion at
actual or estimated historical cost, net of accumulated depreciation of $10.7   
billion.                                                                        

   Legislative Changes During Fiscal Year 2005-2006. During the fiscal year that
began July 1, 2005, the legislature approved several new laws which are expected
to change the Commonwealth's financial position in the future. Act 36, signed on
July 5, 2005, amends the Storage Tank and Spill Prevention Act. The interim     
registration fees paid by tank owners of aboveground and underground storage    
tanks included in the original act will be set as permanent with the fees       
expiring on December 31, 2009. The sunset date of the additional maximum        
$500,000 allocation from the Underground Storage Tank Indemnification Fund      
(USTIF) for assistance to owners of underground storage tanks for heating oil   
with capacities of 3,000 gallons or less in the Underground Storage Tank        
Environmental Cleanup Program would expire on June 30, 2007.                    

The Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) will continue to be      
reimbursed by the USTIF for costs incurred for corrective actions in the        
underground storage tank program; however, they will now be reimbursed for their
administrative costs as well. In addition, DEP may request reimbursement of up  
to $3 million annually for investigation and closure costs beginning in fiscal  
year 2007-2008 to be paid from USTIF. Act 37, also signed July 5, 2005, amends  
Title 75 (Vehicles) to comply with the federal enabling regulations of the      
Federal Motor Carrier Improvement Act of 1999. The commercial driver licensing  
program will be strengthened by expanding the violations resulting in           
disqualification, imposing longer terms of disqualification and increasing      
fines. Violations that occur in a personal vehicle by a commercial driver will  
count the same as if they occurred in a commercial motor vehicle. The complete  
driving record of all violations of traffic laws, except parking, of commercial 
drivers will be maintained by the Department of Transportation. Total           
nonrecurring costs for the Department of Transportation to implement the        
program, including computer system upgrades, training and revision of forms and 
publications, are estimated at $4.8 million; $4.27 million in federal funds and 
$546,000 in state Motor License Funds. Without compliance by September 30, 2005,
Pennsylvania could have lost approximately $40 million in federal funds in the  
first year of the program and additional federal funds in subsequent years.     

Ratings. As of September 2006, all outstanding general obligation bonds of
the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania are rated AA by Standard & Poor's Ratings      
Services and Aa2 by Moody's Investor's Service, Inc. Any explanation concerning 
the significance of such ratings must be obtained from the rating agencies.     
There is no assurance that any ratings will continue for any period of time or  
that they will not be revised or withdrawn.                                     

  Local Issuances. It should be noted that the creditworthiness of obligations
issued by local Pennsylvania issuers may be unrelated to the creditworthiness of
obligations issued by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and there is no         
obligation on the part of the Commonwealth to make payment on such local        
obligations in the event of default.                                            

The foregoing information constitutes only a brief summary of some of the 
general factors which may impact certain issuers of bonds contained in the      
Pennsylvania IM-IT and does not purport to be a complete or exhaustive          
description of all adverse conditions to which the issuers of such obligations  
are subject. Additionally, many factors including national economic, social and 
environmental policies and conditions, which are not within the control of the  
issuers of such bonds, could affect or could have an adverse impact on the      
financial condition of the Commonwealth and various agencies and political      
subdivisions thereof. The Sponsor is unable to predict whether or to what extent
such factors or other factors may affect the issuers of the bonds contained in  
the Pennsylvania IM-IT, the market value or marketability of such bonds or the  
ability of the respective issuers of such bonds acquired by the Pennsylvania    
IM-IT to pay interest on or principal of such bonds.                            

The Pennsylvania IM-IT is susceptible to political, economic or regulatory
factors affecting issuers of Pennsylvania municipal obligations (the            
"Pennsylvania Municipal Obligations"). These include the possible adverse       
effects of certain Pennsylvania constitutional amendments, legislative measures,
voter initiatives and other matters that are described. The information provided
above is only a brief summary of the complex factors affecting the financial    
situation in Pennsylvania and is derived from sources that are generally        
available to investors and are believed to be accurate. No independent          
verification has been made of the accuracy or completeness of any of the        
following information. It is based in part on information obtained from various 
State and local agencies in Pennsylvania or contained in Official Statements for
various Pennsylvania Municipal Obligations.                                     

Puerto Rico Risk Factors

Economic Conditions and Outlook. Puerto Rico enjoyed almost two decades of
economic expansion through fiscal year 2001. Almost every sector of the economy 
participated, and record levels of employment were achieved. Factors behind this
expansion included government-sponsored economic development programs, periodic 
declines in the value of the U.S. dollar, which is the currency used in the     
Commonwealth, increases in the level of federal transfers, a significant        
expansion in construction investment driven by infrastructure projects and      
private investment, primarily in housing, and the relatively low cost of        
borrowing.                                                                      

Puerto Rico has a diversified economy with manufacturing and services     
comprising its principal sectors. The economy of Puerto Rico is closely linked  
to the United States economy. The following exogenous variables are affected by 
the United States economy: exports, direct investment, transfer payments,       
interest rates, inflation, and tourist expenditures.                            

Manufacturing is the largest sector in terms of gross domestic product.   
Manufacturing in Puerto Rico is now more diversified than during the earlier    
phases of its industrial development and includes several industries less prone 
to business cycles. In the last three decades, industrial development has tended
to be more capital intensive and more dependent on skilled labor. The services  
sector, which includes finance, insurance, real estate, wholesale and retail    
trade, tourism, and other services has shown a strong interaction with          
manufacturing, tourism, construction, and agriculture. Tourism makes a          
significant contribution to economic activity. An estimated $3,245 million were 
spent by visitors in Puerto Rico during fiscal year 2005. San Juan has become   
the largest home port for cruise ships in the Caribbean and the fourth largest  
home port for cruise ships in the world. During the year 2005, the number of    
persons registered in tourist hotels increased 4.63% in comparison with fiscal  
year 2004. The construction sector is an integral part of the economic activity 
from fiscal year 1999 through fiscal year 2005. Puerto Rico is heavily dependent
on oil imports for the production of electricity; however, as a result of the   
construction of two cogeneration plants, one of which is fueled by liquefied    
natural gas and the other by coal, Puerto Rico's dependence on oil imports for  
the production of electricity has been reduced from 99% to 72%.                 

The Puerto Rico Planning Board's preliminary reports of the performance of
the Puerto Rico economy during fiscal year 2005 indicate that the economy       
registered an increase of 6% in total gross product. Gross product in fiscal    
year 2000 was $41.4 billion and gross product in fiscal year 2005 was $53.3.    
This represents an increase in gross product of 28.74% from fiscal year 2000 to 
fiscal year 2005. In terms of personal income, in fiscal year 2005, personal    
income per capita was $12,549 compared to 12,031 in 2004 and $10,204 in 2000.   
According to the Department of Labor and Human Resources, during fiscal year    
2005 the labor force was 1.39 million compared to 1.36 million in fiscal year   
2004. Unemployment, although at relative low historical levels, remains above   
the United States average. The average unemployment rate decreased from 11.4%   
during fiscal year 2004 to 10.6% in fiscal year 2005.                           

 Financial Information. The Commonwealth reported a deficit of $15.2 billion
as of June 30, 2005, a deterioration in the financial position of $3 billion    
from last year's balances. The accumulated deficit is principally the result of 
the Commonwealth's practice of issuing debt and transferring such funds to its  
discretely presented component units in order for them to carry out the         
corresponding construction programs.                                            

  The Commonwealth's total deficit increased by $3 billion (a 25% increase) as
a result of this year's operations. The governmental activities deficit         
increased by $2.9 billion (a 22% increase), while net assets of the             
business-type activities showed a decrease of $181 thousand (a 21% decrease).   
The Commonwealth's governmental activities had total revenue of $13.7 billion,  
which were exceeded by total expenses of $17 billion, excluding transfers       
received from business-type activities amounting to $493 million. The           
Commonwealth's business-type activities had total revenue of $1.2 billion, which
exceeded total expenses of $930 million, excluding transfers made to the        
governmental activities amounting to $493 million.                              

   Cash Management. The Commonwealth maintains a cash pool for its cash and cash
equivalents. The balance in the pooled cash accounts is available to meet       
current operating requirements and any excess is invested in various            
interest-bearing accounts in the Government Development Bank for Puerto Rico    
(GDB), a discretely presented component unit. In addition, the Puerto Rico      
Government Investment Trust Fund (PRGITF), was created by the Commonwealth      
pursuant to Act No. 176 of August 11, 1995, and began operations on December 4,
1995. PRGITF is a no-load diversified collective investment trust that was      
created for the purpose of providing eligible investors with a convenient and   
economical way to invest in a professionally managed money market portfolio. The
deposits on hand and the investments purchased are not collateralized, secured, 
or guaranteed by the Commonwealth or any of its agencies, instrumentalities, or 
political subdivisions.                                                         

The Commonwealth's investment policy is to minimize credit and market risk
while maintaining a competitive yield on its portfolio. The cash temporarily    
idle during this year was invested mainly in U.S. government securities, stocks,
corporate bonds, repurchase agreements, Commonwealth securities, trading        
securities, and short-term investments. These are primary government investments
that are restricted and unrestricted.                                           

   Budgetary Policy. The fiscal year of the Commonwealth begins each July 1. The
Governor is constitutionally required to submit to the Legislature an annual    
balanced budget of capital improvements and operating expenses of the Central   
Government for the ensuing fiscal year.                                         

The annual budget is prepared by the Puerto Rico Office of Management and 
Budget, working Puerto Rico Planning Board, the Puerto Rico Department of the   
Treasury, and other government offices and agencies. Section 7 of Article 6 of  
the Constitution provides that "The appropriations made for any fiscal year     
shall not exceed the total revenue, including available surplus, estimated for  
said fiscal year unless the imposition of taxes sufficient to cover said        
appropriations is provided by law."                                             

The Commonwealth maintains extensive budgetary controls. The objective of 
these controls is to ensure compliance with legal provisions embodied in the    
annual appropriated budget approved by the Legislature. Activities of the       
general fund are included in the annual appropriated budget. Budgetary control  
resides at the department level. The Commonwealth also maintains an encumbrance 
accounting system as one method of maintaining budgetary control.               

The annual budget, which is developed using elements of performance-based 
program budgeting and zero-based budgeting, includes an estimate of revenue and 
other resources for the ensuing fiscal year under laws existing at the time the 
budget is submitted and legislative measures proposed by the Governor and       
submitted with the proposed budget, as well as the Governor's recommendations as
to appropriations that in his judgment are necessary, convenient and in         
conformity with the four-year investment plan prepared by the Puerto Rico       
Planning Board.                                                                 

 The Legislature may amend the budget submitted by the Governor, but may not
increase items that would cause a deficit without imposing additional taxes to  
cover such deficit. Once approved by the Legislature, the budget is referred to 
the Governor, who may decrease or eliminate any item, but may not increase or   
insert new items in the budget. The Governor may also veto the budget in its    
entirety and return it to the Legislature with his objections. The Legislature, 
by a two-thirds majority in each house, may override the Governor's veto. If a  
budget is not adopted prior to the end of the fiscal year, as originally        
approved by the Legislature and the Governor, it is automatically renewed for   
the ensuing fiscal year until a new budget is approved by the Legislature and   
the Governor. This allows the Commonwealth to continue to pay operating and     
other expenses until a new budget is approved.                                  

Assets. As noted earlier, net assets may serve over time as a useful      
indicator of a government's financial position. Total assets and total          
liabilities of the Commonwealth's primary government at June 30, 2005 amounted  
to $13.3 billion and $28.6 billion, respectively, for a net deficit of $15.2    
billion, compared to $12.1 billion net deficit at the beginning of the current  
year, as restated.                                                              

  A portion of the Commonwealth's net assets (deficit) reflects its investment
in capital assets such as land, buildings, equipment and infrastructure, less   
any related debt used to acquire those assets that are still outstanding. The   
Commonwealth uses these capital assets to provide services to its residents;    
consequentially, these assets are not available for future spending. Although   
the Commonwealth's investment in its capital assets is reported net of related  
debt, it should be noted that the resources needed to repay this debt must be   
provided from other sources, since the capital assets themselves cannot be used 
to liquidate these liabilities.                                                 

 An additional portion of the Commonwealth's net assets (deficit) represents
resources that are subject to external restrictions on how they may be used. An 
otherwise positive remaining balance would be used to meet the Commonwealth's   
ongoing obligations to its residents and creditors. Internally imposed          
designations of resources are not presented as restricted net assets. At the end
of the current fiscal year, the Commonwealth is able to report positive balances
in two categories of net assets, and a deficit, both for the government as a    
whole, as well as for its separate governmental and business-type activities.   

As explained earlier, the net deficit of the primary government primarily 
results from the Commonwealth's practice of issuing debt and transferring such  
funds to the component units so that they can carry out the construction        
projects. The primary government retains the debt while the component units     
report the corresponding asset financed by such debt.                           

Total assets increased by $375 million during the fiscal year 2005 when   
compared to prior fiscal year. Restricted cash decreased by $574 million when   
compared to the prior year. This decrease is primarily the result of a reduction
in the unused proceeds from the facilities revenue bonds by the Public Buildings
Authority and a reduction in the unused proceeds from the capital fund program  
bonds as a result of projects carried out during the year. Net increase in      
capital assets amounting $1 billion.                                            

  Total liabilities increased $2.8 billion during the current fiscal year when
compared to the prior fiscal year. The key elements for this increase are mostly
due to the net increase in debt issued of $4.6 billion which consisted of       
issuances during fiscal year 2005 of Commonwealth general obligation bonds and  
notes payable amounting to $642 million, and $4 billion, respectively, offset by
repayments of such debt in the amount of $281 million and $3.6 billion.         
Increases were also experienced in the net pension obligation of $302 million   
and the liability for legal claims and judgments of $722 million. The increase  
in legal claims is the effect of a legal case brought against the Commonwealth  
by parents of special education students as further explained in note 18 to the 
basic financial statements.                                                     

The Commonwealth's net deficit increased by $3 billion or 25% from last   
year's total net deficit. Approximately 57% of the Commonwealth's total revenue 
came from taxes, while 31% resulted from grants and contributions (primarily    
federal financial assistance). Charges for services represented 5% of the total 
revenue. The Commonwealth's expenses cover a range of services. The largest     
expenses were for education, public housing and welfare, and public safety. In  
2005, governmental activities' expenses exceeded program revenue by $12.1       
billion, resulting in the use of $9.2 billion in general revenue (mostly taxes) 
and transfers. On the other hand, program revenue from business-type activities 
in 2005 exceeded expenses by approximately $280 million. In addition, the       
business-type activities had unrestricted investment earnings of $32 million and
transfers to the governmental activities amounting to $493 million.             

Governmental activities decreased the Commonwealth's net assets by $2.9   
billion, which is on line with the decrease of $2.8 billion experienced in the  
prior year. Business-type activities decreased the Commonwealth's net assets by 
$181 million. The key factor of this variance was a transfer of funds of $200   
million from the Additional Lottery System to the general fund as further       
explained in note 10 to the basic financial statements.                         

Debt Administration. Section 2 of Article VI of the Constitution of Puerto
Rico provides that direct obligations of the Commonwealth evidenced by full     
faith and credit bonds or notes shall not be issued if the amount of the        
principal of and interest on such bonds and notes and on all such bonds and     
notes theretofore issued, which is payable in any fiscal year, together with any
amount paid by the Commonwealth in the preceding fiscal year on accounts of     
bonds or notes guaranteed by the Commonwealth, exceeds 15% of the average annual
revenue raised under the provisions of the Commonwealth Legislation and covered 
into Treasury of Puerto Rico in the two fiscal year preceding the current fiscal
year. Section 2 of Article VI does not limit the amount of debt that the        
Commonwealth may guarantee so long as the 15% limitation is not exceeded.       

  Total long-term obligations as of June 30, 2005 were $25 billion, from which
$1.9 billion are due within one year. The long-term obligation of the           
governmental activities increased by $2.1 billion (9%) to $24.7 billion when    
compared to the prior year, while the business-type activities increased by $12 
million (3%) to $407 million.                                                   

Ratings. As of September 2006, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico has a BBB  
credit rating from Standard & Poor's Corporation and a Baa3 from Moody's        
Investor Service on general obligation bond issues.                             

  Local Issuances. It should be noted that the creditworthiness of obligations
issued by local Pennsylvania issuers may be unrelated to the creditworthiness of
obligations issued by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and there is no          
obligation on the part of the Commonwealth to make payment on such local        
obligations in the event of default.                                            

  Miscellaneous. The foregoing information constitutes only a brief summary of
some of the general factors which may impact certain issuers of bonds contained 
in the Puerto Rico IM-IT and does not purport to be a complete or exhaustive    
description of all adverse conditions to which the issuers of such obligations  
are subject. Additionally, many factors including national economic, social and 
environmental policies and conditions, which are not within the control of the  
issuers of such bonds, could affect or could have an adverse impact on the      
financial condition of the Commonwealth and various agencies and political      
subdivisions thereof. The Sponsor is unable to predict whether or to what extent
such factors or other factors may affect the issuers of the bonds contained in  
the Puerto Rico IM-IT, the market value or marketability of such bonds or the   
ability of the respective issuers of such bonds acquired by the Puerto Rico     
IM-IT to pay interest on or principal of such bonds.                            

The Puerto Rico IM-IT is susceptible to political, economic or regulatory 
factors affecting issuers of Puerto Rico municipal obligations (the "Puerto Rico
Municipal Obligations"). These include the possible adverse effects of certain  
Puerto Rico constitutional amendments, legislative measures, voter initiatives  
and other matters that are described. The information provided above is only a  
brief summary of the complex factors affecting the financial situation in Puerto
Rico and is derived from sources that are generally available to investors and  
are believed to be accurate. No independent verification has been made of the   
accuracy or completeness of any of the following information. It is based in    
part on information obtained from various State and local agencies in Puerto    
Rico or contained in Official Statements for various Puerto Rico Municipal      
Obligations.                                                                    

 South Carolina Risk Factors

Governmental Overview. South Carolina stretches from the Atlantic Ocean to
the Blue Ridge Mountains, containing 30,111 square miles. The coastal area,     
which is one of the leading recreation centers on the east coast, is the anchor 
of the State's thriving tourism industry. Since 1970, 565,000 people have       
relocated to South Carolina to take advantage of its growing economy and to     
retire here.                                                                    

South Carolina's government is divided into three separate branches:      
legislative, executive, and judicial. State government provides a full range of 
services to South Carolina's citizens including educational, health,            
social/human, transportation, public safety, regulatory, and                    
conservation/natural resources services. In addition, the State provides grants 
and loans to local governments, including school districts, within its borders. 

   South Carolina is primarily a manufacturing state. While the textile industry
is still the major industrial employer in the State, the State's economy has    
undergone a gradual transition to other sectors. Since 1950, the State's        
economic base has diversified into other sectors such as trade, health care,    
services, and durable goods manufacturing.                                      

Economic Condition and Outlook. South Carolina historically has been a    
manufacturing state; however, the State's economic base has been transitioning  
toward other sectors such as trade, health care, services, and durable goods    
manufacturing. Businesses have migrated here from all over the world to take    
advantage of the State's skilled labor force, competitive wages, lower-priced   
land, excellent port facilities, accessibility to markets, and in recent years, 
substantial tax incentives.                                                     

Employment in the State rose during 2004 by 1.1% over the prior year,     
matching the national pace. However, South Carolina's overall economy generally 
remained stable during the past five years (January 2000 through December 2004).
While total employment levels remained largely unchanged during this period, the
State's economy has become more diversified and is starting to move closer to   
the national base. Employment in the manufacturing sector has been declining    
such that manufacturing employment now represents less than 15% of total        
employment, down from about 19% in 2000. The State's service sector, fueled by  
tourism and retirement industries, has contributed to a more diversified overall
employment base and improved income levels. This sector represented 35% of total
employment in 2004, up from 25% in 2000. Similarly, the State's metropolitan    
areas are enjoying rapid job growth while rural areas, traditionally supported  
by textile manufacturing jobs, are struggling.                                  

   The State's average unemployment rate has remained above that of the national
level since 2001. South Carolina's unemployment rate was 6.8% for 2004, compared
to the national average of 5.5%. While recent federal employment statistics     
indicate that the State's employment growth is slow, the State is reporting     
strong growth in personal and corporate income withholding taxes and in retail  
sales tax collections. This growth suggests that a more robust economy actually 
is occurring. Average personal income growth for 2000 through 2004 was 4.5%;    
equal to the national average, but less than the 4.8% growth for the            
southeastern region. Despite this, the State's $27,153 per capita personal      
income in 2004 represented only 82% of the national average and 91% of the      
southeastern average. In 2004, South Carolina ranked 43rd among states in       
personal income per capita, down from 39th in 2000.                             

   The State is committed to improving its economic base and has been successful
at attracting foreign investments, most notably in the automotive industry.     
Chemicals and metals, as well as specialty textiles, also have been consistent  
major components of capital investment in recent years. The State has undertaken
several new economic development programs in the past few years with the goal of
fostering growth, increasing economic diversity, and raising income levels. The 
State has authorized the issuance of economic and university research bonds to  
help attract new industries in fields such as biomedicine, transportation, and  
alternate fuels.                                                                

  Continued growth is expected in health care, leisure and hospitality, retail
trade, certain manufacturing segments, and military defense. Vought Aircraft    
Industries has announced plans to build a $560 million aircraft components      
manufacturing center in North Charleston. The company is expected to hire 645   
highly paid employees initially and is expected to spawn thousands of jobs      
during both the construction and the production phases from related             
distribution, storage, supply and real estate. BMW is currently undergoing a    
$600 million expansion in South Carolina, and has started production on its new 
sports utility vehicle. In addition, BMW has announced plans to develop a new   
model similar to a minivan at its Upstate plant.                                

  The State's budgetary results have improved dramatically during the last two
years, leading to an increase in hiring and salaries within State government.   
This comes after substantial reductions in State government employment with only
limited pay increases since the economic downturns in 2000 and 2001. There are  
several large military installations in South Carolina. These installations     
overall were spared the brunt of the Federal government's recent military       
downsizing. The State actually will have a net gain in military jobs because of 
base realignments. Charleston is expected to see a relatively small loss of     
military-related jobs, while the Columbia region could see a net gain of nearly 
2,000 military jobs that could lead to other job growth.                        

 Despite the State's high unemployment rate, Budgetary General Fund revenues
for the first four months of the 2005-2006 fiscal year were $143.481 million, or
7.9%, higher than fiscal year 2004-2005. South Carolina's three major revenue   
sources are experiencing significant gains, reinforcing the fact that economic  
conditions are improving in the State. Individual income taxes are up 9.5%, as  
withholdings increased 9.4% and estimated tax payments increased 19.8%.         
Corporate income taxes have grown by 9.9%. Sales taxes have increased 7.4%      
despite higher gasoline prices.                                                 

Budgetary General Fund Highlights. The State's Board of Economic Advisors 
(BEA) is responsible for forecasting revenues for the budget. State law requires
that the BEA meet at least quarterly to review revenue collections and to adjust
its forecasts if necessary. If the BEA reduces revenue projections significantly
once the budget year begins, the State's Budget and Control Board is responsible
for mandating spending cuts to keep the budget in balance.                      

  During the fiscal year, the BEA increased its revenue estimate by a total of
$286.877 million for the Budgetary General Fund. The increases occurred over a  
period of six months as the BEA examined current-year and prior-year revenue    
collection trends. Tax revenue collections were greater than expected as        
economic conditions improved and enforcement efforts were stepped up.           

   The 2004-2005 appropriations had to be increased by $4.975 million during the
year to fund certain State-mandated programs that were underestimated in the    
Appropriation Act. The State Treasurer's Office received $4.905 million of these
additional appropriations for aid to fire districts in accordance with formula  
funding. Actual revenues at June 30, 2005, were $122.302 million more than even 
the revised expected revenues. Furthermore, actual revenues were $517.866       
million greater than actual expenditures. Because of reasons previously stated  
and limited increases in agency spending, the State was able to end the year    
with an accumulated budgetary general fund surplus of $533.365 million after    
giving effect to a one-time adjustment in the amount of $104.934 million to     
correct errors in recording revenues in prior fiscal years. Also, an additional 
$50.000 million was restored to the State's "rainy day account" bringing the    
balance in the reserve to $75.155 million at June 30, 2005.                     

 Assets. At the end of the 2004-2005 accounting year, the State's net assets
totaled $14.807 billion. The largest portion of the State's net assets reflects 
its investment in capital assets (for example, buildings, roads, and bridges),  
less any related debt used to acquire those assets that is still outstanding.   
The State uses these capital assets to provide services to citizens;            
consequently, they are not available for future spending. Further, the State    
cannot sell the capital assets themselves to pay off the related debt because it
needs the assets for its operations; so it must find other resources to pay off 
the debt.                                                                       

Restricted net assets generally are available for future spending but are 
subject to external restrictions, such as bond covenants, federal government    
grant restrictions, or restrictions imposed by enabling State legislation or    
through State constitutional provisions. The State's largest restricted balances
include capital improvement bond proceeds (restricted for various capital       
projects), and loan program funds (restricted primarily for local government    
water and sewer projects). Unrestricted net assets--resources available for     
future spending--reported a balance of $187.862 million at June 30, 2005. This  
represents an improvement of $867.511 million over the prior year. The majority 
of this improvement resulted from a $777.854 million increase in the net assets 
reported for the State's governmental activities, which reported a negative     
$172.175 million in unrestricted net assets for the current fiscal year versus a
negative $950.029 million balance in the prior year.                            

  Cash Management. The State Treasurer is responsible for managing the State's
cash and investments, except for certain component units included within the    
reporting entity that manage and invest their own funds. State law requires full
collateralization of all State Treasurer bank balances. Some component units may
have collateralization policies that differ from those of the State Treasurer.  
Investment income includes appreciation and depreciation in the fair value of   
investments. Increases in fair value during the current year, however, do not   
necessarily represent trends that will continue; nor is it always possible to   
realize such amounts, particularly in the case of temporary changes in the fair 
value of investments that the State plans to hold to maturity.                  

  Debt Administration. At the end of the accounting year, the State had $6.932
billion in bonds and notes outstanding--an increase of $964.106 million, or     
13.9%, over last year. The State limits the amount of annual payments for       
principal and interest on general obligation bonds and notes rather than        
directly limiting the amount of those bonds and notes that the State may have   
outstanding. At June 30, 2005, the State legally could issue additional bonds as
long as the new debt would not increase the State's annual principal and        
interest payments by more than the following amounts: $34.771 million in total  
for all institution bonds, $16.222 million for highway bonds, $52.374 million   
for general obligation bonds, excluding institution and highway bonds, and      
$15.689 million for economic development bonds.                                 

Risk Management. The State conducts various risk control programs to help 
minimize losses to which it is exposed. The health insurance program conducts   
extensive wellness education programs that promote development and maintenance  
of healthful lifestyles for covered employees. The State self-funds many types  
of general liability and property losses rather than purchasing insurance.      

Ratings. As of September 2006, all outstanding general obligation bonds of
the State of South Carolina are rated AA+ by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services 
and Aaa by Moody's Investor's Service, Inc. Any explanation concerning the      
significance of such ratings must be obtained from the rating agencies. There is
no assurance that any ratings will continue for any period of time or that they 
will not be revised or withdrawn.                                               

  Local Issuances. It should be noted that the creditworthiness of obligations
issued by local South Carolina issuers may be unrelated to the creditworthiness 
of obligations issued by the State of South Carolina, and there is no obligation
on the part of the State to make payment on such local obligations in the event 
of default.                                                                     

The foregoing information constitutes only a brief summary of some of the 
general factors which may impact certain issuers of bonds contained in the South
Carolina IM-IT and does not purport to be a complete or exhaustive description  
of all adverse conditions to which the issuers of such obligations are subject. 
Additionally, many factors including national economic, social and environmental
policies and conditions, which are not within the control of the issuers of such
bonds, could affect or could have an adverse impact on the financial condition  
of the State and various agencies and political subdivisions thereof. The       
Sponsor is unable to predict whether or to what extent such factors or other    
factors may affect the issuers of the bonds contained in the South Carolina     
IM-IT, the market value or marketability of such bonds or the ability of the    
respective issuers of such bonds acquired by the South Carolina IM-IT to pay    
interest on or principal of such bonds.                                         

  The South Carolina IM-IT is susceptible to political, economic or regulatory
factors affecting issuers of South Carolina municipal obligations (the "South   
Carolina Municipal Obligations"). These include the possible adverse effects of 
certain South Carolina constitutional amendments, legislative measures, voter   
initiatives and other matters that are described. The information provided above
is only a brief summary of the complex factors affecting the financial situation
in South Carolina and is derived from sources that are generally available to   
investors and are believed to be accurate. No independent verification has been 
made of the accuracy or completeness of any of the following information. It is 
based in part on information obtained from various State and local agencies in  
South Carolina or contained in Official Statements for various South Carolina   
Municipal Obligations.                                                          

Tennessee Risk Factors

   Government Profile. The State of Tennessee was admitted to the union in 1796,
as the sixteenth state. Tennessee has 41,219 square miles and a population      
estimated to be 5.9 million. The State has three branches of government,        
Executive, Legislative and Judicial. The Governor, who appoints commissioners to
lead the various departments, heads the Executive branch. The Legislative branch
is bicameral, with 99 members of the House of Representatives and 33 Senators.  
The Representatives serve two-year terms. The Senators serve four-year terms,   
with about one-half being elected every two years. The Judicial branch rules on 
the constitutionality of laws enacted by the Legislature and the legality of    
administrative policies and regulations of the Executive branch.                

   The State of Tennessee provides a full range of services including education,
health and social services, transportation, law, correction, safety, resources, 
regulation, and business and economic development. Its financial reporting      
entity includes all the funds of the primary government as well as all its      
component units. Component units are legally separate entities for which the    
primary government is financially accountable.                                  

   State legislation requires the Governor to present his proposed budget to the
General Assembly at the beginning of each annual session. Annual budgets are    
adopted for the general fund, special revenue funds (except Fraud and Economic  
Crime, Community Development and the Dairy Promotion Board), and debt service   
fund. The General Assembly enacts the budget through passage of specific        
departmental appropriations, the sum of which may not exceed estimated revenues.
Before signing the Appropriations Act, the Governor may veto or reduce any      
specific appropriation, subject to legislative override. Once passed and signed,
the budget becomes the State's financial plan for the coming year.              

Budgetary control is maintained at the department level. Budget revisions 
during the year, reflecting program changes or interdepartmental transfers of an
administrative nature, may be affected with certain executive and legislative   
branch approval. Only the legislature, however, may transfer appropriations     
between departments.                                                            

   Local Economy. Economic conditions in Tennessee continue to show improvement.
Unemployment rates have fallen, income growth has been relatively strong and    
nonfarm employment has gained some momentum. Following several years of job     
losses in manufacturing, there are emerging signs that growth may be on the     
horizon. By several barometers of economic conditions, the state economy has    
performed better than its national counterpart. Modest improvement in economic  
conditions is expected in 2005 and 2006. The most important shift in economic   
fortunes will be in state labor markets. Nonfarm jobs are expected to advance   
1.5 percent in 2005 and 1.8 percent in 2006. Manufacturing job growth should    
move back into the black in both years.                                         

 Characteristics of Tennessee that have been identified as important reasons
why firms have chosen sites within the state include work force related factors 
such as worker productivity, right-to-work laws and low unionization, as well as
access to markets and the pro-business attitude of the state. Other factors     
include relatively inexpensive energy, plentiful natural resources, and sun-belt
location.                                                                       

 Manufacturing investment in Tennessee totaled $2.7 billion in 2004, marking
the twenty-second consecutive billion-dollar year for the state. The combined   
new and expansion manufacturing, headquarters, distribution and selected        
services projects created an estimated 31 thousand new job opportunities.       

Per capita personal income is commonly used to compare economic well-being
and quality of life across areas. Tennessee has seen noticeable improvement over
time in its per capita income relative to the nation. However, state per capita 
income has remained below the US average since 1986. The gap between the US and 
Tennessee narrowed during the strong growth period of the early 1990s, then     
widened from 1996 forward to the onset of the recession in 2001. Since then the 
state's relative standing has been improving.                                   

Tennessee job growth slowed in the last half of the decade of the 1990s on
the heels of exceptionally strong job growth through 1995. Job growth was       
particularly resilient in 1993 and 1994, coming in at 3.7 percent and 4.1       
percent, well ahead of the national pace of job growth. Job contraction took    
place in 2001 and 2002 as a result of the national recession, but has           
subsequently rebounded with positive growth. The state's manufacturing sector   
enjoyed the economic boom of the early 1990s, but since 1996 the manufacturing  
sector has not fared as well. As manufacturing has suffered, the various service
sectors have prospered. Jobs in the services sector have prospered. Jobs in the 
services sector have reflected positive compound annual growth rates since 1992.

 Tennessee's unemployment rate generally varies with the cyclical pattern of
the national economy. The state tends to enjoy lower rates of unemployment over 
the ups and downs of the business cycle than the national economy. The state    
unemployment rate stood at 6.4 percent in 1992, a reflection of the weak        
economic conditions that prevailed at that time; the US unemployment rate was   
7.5 percent. In 2000, the state unemployment rate was only 3.9 percent. But with
the onset of the recession in 2001, rates rose into 2003 when the prevailing    
average reached 5.8 percent. The US rate of unemployment stood at 6.0 percent in
the same year. Annual average rates fell in 2004 with Tennessee coming in at 5.4
percent against a US average of 5.5 percent.                                    

Long-term Financial Planning. In 1996, legislation was enacted that       
determined the allocation goal for a reserve for revenue fluctuations to be five
percent of the estimated State tax revenues to be allocated to the general fund 
and education trust fund. The revenue fluctuation reserve allows services to be 
maintained when revenue growth is slower than estimated in the budget. Beginning
with the budget for the fiscal year 1998-1999 and until the statutory funding   
level is achieved, an allocation to the reserve is to be budgeted in an amount  
at least equal to ten percent of the estimated growth in estimated state tax    
revenues to be allocated to the general fund and education trust fund. Amounts  
in the revenue fluctuation reserve may be utilized to meet State tax revenue    
shortfalls. Subject to specific provisions of the general appropriations bill,  
an amount not to exceed the greater of $100 million or one-half (1/2) of the    
amount available in the reserve may be used to meet expenditure requirements in 
excess of budgeted appropriation levels. The expansion of the fund is a         
priority. An increase in this reserve that exceeds the minimum legal requirement
has been included in the 2005-2006 budget.                                      

   In 2002, Tennessee initiated an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) automation
assessment study to research the feasibility of implementing an ERP system to   
meet the State's financial management, procurement, human resources, payroll    
administration and other administrative business needs. Currently in the process
of procuring software and an integrator, the implementation of an ERP system is 
expected to significantly improve the state's business processes, and thereby   
its effectiveness and efficiency, by enabling the use of best management        
practices for financial, human resource, purchasing and other administrative    
operations.                                                                     

Relevant Financial Policies. In 1994, the State transformed its Medicaid  
Program into a managed care project called TennCare, which covered not only     
Medicaid eligible persons but also certain uninsured or uninsurable persons. The
State is in the process of implementing TennCare reform during fiscal year      
2005-2006. These reforms include disenrolling uninsured and uninsurable adults  
who do not qualify for traditional Medicaid categories, establishing benefits   
limits in the pharmacy and medical programs, and gaining alterations to federal 
consent decrees. In addition, certain operational reforms are underway,         
including returning managed care contractors to risk arrangements, upgrading    
edits in the pharmacy point of sale system, and negotiating settlements with    
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services on current funding arrangements and  
prior disallowances. These reform strategies are intended to provide the State a
greater ability to control TennCare spending. The 2005-2006 budget reflects     
disenrolling uninsured and uninsurable adults and establishing benefit limits in
the pharmacy program.                                                           

Unreformed, a projected $647 million growth in state funds required in    
2005-2006 would consume all of an estimated $325 million growth in general fund 
state taxes, plus another $322 million. The reform of TennCare allows for needed
improvements in other areas, such as education, with no new taxes and no        
statewide budget reductions.                                                    

 Tennessee pursues an aggressive cash management and investment program. One
aspect of this program that is believed unique to Tennessee is the state's      
direct access into the Federal Reserve wire system. Through the State Trust of  
Tennessee, wire services in the federal system are available via a terminal     
located in the State's investment offices. This provides the State flexibility  
in investing and concentrating cash balances, pension fund assets, and in       
redeeming warrants and checks issued against the Treasury. During fiscal year   
2005, uncommitted State funds were invested in short-term collateralized        
deposits as follows (averaged): certificates of deposit (33%), commercial paper 
(27%), U.S. Treasuries (37%), and money market accounts (3%). The composite     
average yield on these investments was 2.12%, up from 1.11% last year.          

 Tennessee currently provides a subsidy to retiree healthcare premiums based
on years of service. The funding of those subsidies is on a pay-as-you-go basis.
New accounting standards will require state and local government employers to   
account for other postemployment benefits (benefits other than pensions) by     
recognizing an obligation in the government-wide financial statements if the    
benefits promised to employees are not advance funded. As a result of the new   
accounting standards, executive management will soon begin considering whether a
change in policy regarding the funding of the state's other postemployment      
benefits is appropriate. An actuarial study to determine an estimate of the     
state's obligation has been completed and will be used in the decision-making   
process.                                                                        

Major Initiatives. Tennessee continues to focus on making education the   
state's fundamental priority, and on taking the next steps in job creation and  
economic development, public safety, and making state government focused and    
more responsive to its citizens.                                                

The voluntary pre-kindergarten program is to be expanded during 2005-2006 
from education lottery funds, with the goal of eventually integrating this      
program into the state's education funding formula, the Basic Education Program 
(BEP). The Basic Education Program will continue to be fully funded and BEP     
funding increased for at-risk students across the state. "Teach Tennessee" is   
being implemented to challenge highly motivated, mid-career professionals to    
each in the hardest-to-staff schools and high-need subject areas.               

A redesigned jobs initiative will focus on job creation with a goal of    
modernizing the tool kit used to sustain and build new industry in Tennessee.   
This will include investment in Tennesseans through training and re-training    
workers in advanced technologies, along with an expansion of infrastructure to  
foster competitiveness for new industry statewide. A Jobs Cabinet has been      
created to coordinate efforts at the highest levels of state government to      
create better-paying, higher-skilled jobs for working Tennesseans, and an Office
of Diversity Business Enterprise has been created to serve as a point of service
and information clearinghouse for small businesses, including minority- and     
women-owned businesses.                                                         

Methamphetamine abuse is a clear and present danger to the future of      
Tennessee. Legislation was passed to broaden the state's attack on              
methamphetamine abuse. This legislation includes limits on the sale of cold and 
sinus products containing pseudoephedrine, a vital ingredient in the meth-making
process. It also enhances criminal penalties relating to meth use, particularly 
personal use. Funding is to be provided for the cost of increased penalties;    
grants to Child Advocacy Centers in meth-plagued areas; the safe and drug free  
school program; a drug court pilot project; a public service campaign; and legal
and lab response training for law enforcement officers, prosecutors and         
firefighters.                                                                   

 Financial Information. Net assets may serve over time as a useful indicator
of a government's financial position. In the case of the State of Tennessee,    
combined assets exceeded liabilities by $22.805 billion as of June 30, 2005. By 
far the largest portion of the State's net assets (85%) reflects its investment 
in capital assets (e.g., land, infrastructure, structures and improvements,     
machinery and equipment), less any related debt used to acquire those assets    
that is still outstanding. The State uses these capital assets to provide       
services to its citizens; consequently, these assets are not available for      
future spending. Although the State's investment in its capital assets is       
reported net of related debt, it should be noted that the resources needed to   
repay this debt must be provided from other sources, since the capital assets   
themselves cannot be used to liquidate these liabilities.                       

 An additional portion of the State's net assets (8.6 percent) is restricted
and represents resources that are subject to either external restrictions or    
legislative restrictions on how they may be used. The remaining balance is      
unrestricted net assets ($1.428 billion) and may be used to meet the State's    
ongoing obligations to citizens and creditors not funded by resources that are  
restricted.                                                                     

   At June 30, 2005, the State was able to report positive balances in all three
categories of net assets, for the government as a whole, and for its separate   
governmental and business-type activities. The State's net assets increased by  
$1.167 billion during the year ended June 30, 2005. Most of this increase was   
attributable to the State's decision to adopt the modified approach to          
infrastructure. Because of this decision, the State capitalized $757.6 million  
in infrastructure expenditures and did not record depreciation expense. Also,   
Tennessee does not fund highway construction by issuing debt, but it is funded  
primarily with fuel taxes and federal grants in the Highway Fund. Most of the   
remaining gain of $409.4 million resulted from operations in the Education      
Trust, Sewer Treatment Loan, and Employment Security Funds, and other non-major 
enterprise funds. Tax collections increased for the year and expenditures       
increased as well. The Revenue Fluctuation Reserve has been increased to $275.4 
million or 1.9% of General Fund expenditures. General fund revenue collections  
increased for the year by $938 million. Sales tax collections increased by $124 
million. In addition, Excise tax collections were up $135 million due to the    
improved economy. Federal revenue collections increased by $415 million         
primarily due to increased expenditures in the TennCare program.                

General fund expenditures increased approximately $1.341 billion. $938    
million of this increase was due to increased expenditures in the TennCare      
program resulting from pharmacy inflation and medical utilization increases. In 
addition, Human Services experienced increased expenditures of $135 million.    
This increase was due to the increase in food stamp coupons distributed to      
citizens of approximately $117 million. The food stamp program has experienced  
an increase in the number of eligible participants. The program is reimbursed   
100% by the federal government. Mental Retardation expenditures increased by $84
million. Community services for the mentally retarded increased by $61 million. 
This increase reflects the rising cost of community residential placements and  
associated medical costs as well as increased demand for services. Current      
assets in the General fund remained relatively constant with only a decrease of 
..5%. The fund balance of the General fund also remained relatively constant with
a decrease of 1.4%.                                                             

 The Education Trust Fund revenue increased $357.7 million for the year. The
sales tax appropriated to the fund increased by $144.7 million and federal      
revenue collections were up by $93.0 million. In addition, the net lottery      
proceeds transferred from the Tennessee Education Lottery Corporation (TELC)    
increased by $104.1 million. This was the first full year that the Education    
Trust Fund received the net lottery proceeds that funds scholarships for        
eligible Tennessee citizens to attend post-secondary educational institutions   
located in Tennessee. Of the $304.0 million Education Trust fund balance, $255.1
million is restricted for the distribution of these scholarships.               

 Education Trust Fund expenditures increased approximately $470.7 million or
10.2%. Most of the increase was to maintain full funding of the Basic Education 
Program (BEP) formula, equalize teacher salaries, and provide for teacher salary
increases and group health insurance increases for local education agencies     
($207.5 million). In addition, expenditures increased due to additional funding 
for the No Child Left Behind Act ($35.7 million), increased funding for special 
education programs ($21.1 million), and additional students qualified for school
nutrition programs ($14.5 million). Also, beginning in August of 2004,          
lottery-funded scholarships were awarded to eligible Tennessee students ($93.5  
million). In addition, appropriations to the college and university systems     
increased approximately $59 million to restore prior year budgetary cuts, and to
provide for employee salary and group health insurance increases.               

 The total plan net assets of the pension trust funds were $27.2 billion, up
over $1.6 billion from the prior year. As a result of the improved performance  
of the financial markets, the pension trust funds incurred a net investment gain
of $1.85 billion.                                                               

Ratings. As of September 2006, all outstanding general obligation bonds of
the State of Tennessee are rated AA by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services and   
Aa2 by Moody's Investor's Service, Inc. Any explanation concerning the          
significance of such ratings must be obtained from the rating agencies. There is

Texas Risk Factors

  General Economic Information. The State of Texas was identified in its early
history with agriculture and ranching, and through much of the last century it  
was identified with the oil and gas industry. But the rapid growth of           
service-providing industries and high technology manufacturing over the last two
decades has left a diversified Texas economy more similar to the national       
economy. To illustrate the change, the Texas oil and gas industry (drilling,    
production, refining, chemicals and energy-related manufacturing) accounted for 
nearly 26 percent of the State's total output of goods and services in 1981.    
Today, these businesses account for only 9.2 percent of the State's economy. In 
the early 1980s, the Texas oil and gas industry was about six times as large as 
the State's high technology industry. High technology industries in the state   
actually inched above the oil and gas industry in recent years. However, due to 
recent increases in oil and gas prices and weak high technology prices, high    
technology slipped back to 8 percent of the Texas gross state product today.    

   As with the national economy, service-providing sectors, which include trade,
transportation and utilities, information, financial activities, educational and
health services, professional and business services, leisure and hospitality    
services, and government, have been the major sources of job growth in Texas.   
From 2000 through 2004, these industries added over 485,000 jobs in Texas, while
goods-producing sectors have lost 134,400. Service-providing jobs now account   
for 83.3 percent of total non-farm employment. Over the last year, however, with
the strength of oil and gas and construction, as well as new growth in          
manufacturing, the goods sectors have been growing at a faster pace than the    
service-providing sectors. Goods-producing sectors added 3.1 percent, compared  
to 2.9 percent in services, from March 2005 to March 2006. Texas' location and  
transportation accessibility have made it a distribution center for the         
southwestern United States, as well as a growing international market for export
trade.                                                                          

According to the Foreign Trade Division of the U. S. Census Bureau, Texas 
exports during 2005 totaled more than $128.8 billion, surpassing 2004's level of
$117.2 billion by 9.8 percent. Through the first two months of 2006, Texas      
exports have totaled $22.3 billion, up another 12.8 percent compared to the same
two months in 2005. Texas ranks first among the fifty states in international   
trade and accounts for more than one-seventh of the nation's total export trade.
Texas' export total has exceeded California's, which had ranked first           
previously, since 2001. While Texas ranked seventh among the states in          
manufacturing employment as recently as 1987, the state now ranks second, with  
900,900 Texas manufacturing jobs. With the growth of productivity and exports,  
manufacturing production is expected to remain a significant part of Texas'     
long-term economic future. Enhanced by robust increases in worker productivity, 
Texas' inflation-adjusted gross state product from manufacturing has grown by   
63.2 percent, or 5.0 percent annually, over the last ten years (1995 through    
2005). Overall, the Comptroller predicts that the Texas economy will grow by 3.0
percent annually over the long-term (2006-2030), slightly outpacing forecasts of
national economic growth (2.9 percent, according to Global Insight, Inc.).      

During 2005's first 11 months, the Texas economy improved, matching 2004's
moderate employment growth of 1.4 percent. Texas added 136,400 jobs from        
November 2004 through November 2005. Although this growth rate was modest       
compared to that seen in the 1990s, every major industry expanded its employment
rolls in 2005. Texas and the nation also both witnessed improved unemployment   
rates, with the Texas rate falling from 5.9 percent to 5.3 percent over the past
year. Overall, Texas ranked 24th among the states in its rate of employment     
growth over the past year. Although the state's job growth during 2005 was      
lukewarm compared to recent decades, Texas still added more jobs than all but   
two states.                                                                     

   Current Economic Information. For the first the first time in five years, all
of Texas' major industries are now experiencing year-to-year job growth. In step
with national patterns, manufacturing and information, in particular, had       
suffered through four years of jobs losses. From March 2005 to March 2006,      
however, the number of jobs in Texas' information industry grew by 0.2 percent, 
while manufacturing bucked the trend of losses nationwide and added jobs at a   
0.8 percent rate. Mining and construction were the main job gainers among Texas'
goods industries from March 2005 to March 2006. Construction has added 32,100   
jobs in response to road and utility-system construction and still vibrant      
single-family housing market, and natural resources and mining, which is        
predominantly oil and gas in Texas, added 10,300 jobs (for a substantial gain of
6.4 percent). Manufacturing posted a gain of 7,100 jobs statewide, mostly due to
fabricated metals, machinery, and transportation equipment. Manufacturing       
employment in Texas and the nation has been affected by a five-year weakness in 
domestic and international markets, a cratering of high technology investments, 
outsourcing of jobs to other nations, and rapid productivity gains per worker,  
but a turnaround is taking shape in several durable goods sectors. Overall, with
the strength of energy and construction, and renewed growth in manufacturing,   
goods jobs have been growing at a faster pace than service-providing jobs for   
over a year. From March 2005 to March 2006, goods-producing employment in Texas 
has increased by a total of 49,500 jobs. Service-providing industries expanded  
by 229,900 jobs from March 2005 to March 2006, representing a growth of 2.9     
percent. Among the major service industries, professional and business services 
advanced the fastest (with employment up 6.2 percent), while information grew   
the slowest (up 0.2 percent). Financial activities increased by 3.4 percent,    
education and health services by 3.2 percent, and trade/transportation/utilities
by 2.7 percent. Leisure and hospitality services tacked on job growth of 2.3    
percent. Even with some of the nation's highest unemployment rates along the    
international border, the State's unemployment rate has narrowed its gap with   
the U. S. rate, partly due to marked improvements in those traditionally high   
border rates, in addition to recent improvements in the energy industry.        

Government Organization. The State was admitted to the Union as the 28th  
state on December 29, 1845, approximately nine years after its secession from   
the Republic of Mexico in 1836. The Constitution of the State of Texas divides  
the powers of the government of the State into three distinct departments: the  
legislative, the executive and the judicial. Under the terms of the             
Constitution, no person in any one department may exercise any power attached to
another department unless specifically authorized to do so by the Constitution. 

The legislative power of the State is vested in a House of Representatives
and a Senate, which together constitute the Legislature of the State. The House 
of Representatives consists of 150 members who are elected for terms of two     
years each, and the Senate consists of 31 members who are elected for four-year 
terms. After senatorial redistricting, which occurs every 10 years, each member 
must run for re-election. At that time the members must draw lots, with 15      
Senators to serve two-year terms and 16 Senators to serve four-year terms.      
Proceedings in the House of Representatives are presided over by the Speaker of 
the House, who is selected by the members of the House of Representatives from  
among their ranks, and proceedings in the Senate are presided over by the       
Lieutenant Governor, who is elected by a statewide vote or in his absence, the  
President pro tempore of the Senate, who is selected by the members of the      
Senate from among their ranks. Regular sessions of the Legislature are held     
every two years in odd numbered years and may not exceed 140 days in duration.  
Special sessions of the Legislature may be convened by the Governor at any time.
A special session of the Legislature may not exceed 30 days in duration and may 
address only those subjects designated by the Governor.                         

The Executive Department of the State is composed of the Governor, the    
Lieutenant Governor, the Comptroller of Public Accounts, the Commissioner of the
General Land Office, the Attorney General and the Secretary of State, all of    
whom are elected except the Secretary of State (who is appointed by the         
Governor). There are other elected State officials, including the Commissioner  
of the Department of Agriculture and the three Commissioners of the Railroad    
Commission (which has regulatory jurisdiction over certain public utilities,    
transportation and the oil and gas industry). The Governor is elected for a term
of four years and is eligible to seek re-election for an unlimited number of    
terms.                                                                          

The judicial power of the State is vested in a Supreme Court, a Court of  
Criminal Appeals, 14 courts of appeals, numerous district courts and various    
lower courts. The Supreme Court is the appellate court of last resort in all    
cases except criminal matters and, in addition, has original jurisdiction over  
actions for mandamus against State officials and certain other matters. The     
Court of Criminal Appeals has final appellate jurisdiction over all criminal    
matters. The courts of appeals are intermediate level appellate courts and have 
jurisdiction over both civil and criminal cases. The justices and judges of all 
courts in the State are elected. Terms of office are six years in the case of   
the members of the Supreme Court, the Court of Criminal Appeals and the courts  
of appeals, and four years for judges of lower courts.                          

Fiscal Matters. The State operates on a fiscal year basis, which begins on
September 1 and ends on August 31. The State's appropriation period is a        
biennium covering two fiscal years. During the 1987 session, the Legislature    
imposed uniform accounting and financial reporting procedures on all State      
agencies and provided that accounting for State agencies be in accordance with  
generally accepted accounting principles.                                       

Total assets of the state on August 31, 2005, were $159.9 billion, an     
increase of $9.5 billion. Total liabilities as of August 31, 2005, were $44.3   
billion, a decrease of $2.0 billion or 4.3 percent. Net assets were affected by 
a number of factors. Although cash and cash equivalents dropped $3.6 billion    
from fiscal year 2004, investments increased $5.4 billion. Net capital assets   
increased $4.0 billion, much from additions to the state's highway system. A    
significant decline in total liabilities of $2.0 billion was made possible by   
the repayment of $6.6 billion of Tax and Revenue Anticipation Notes by fiscal   
year end. The Net Asset balance was $115.6 billion in fiscal year 2005, an      
increase of $11.5 billion, or 11.1 percent. Of the state's net assets, $60.1    
billion were invested in capital assets, net of related debt, while $44.7       
billion were restricted by statute or other legal requirements, and were not    
available to finance day-to-day operations of the state. Unrestricted net assets
were $10.8 billion. The state's bonded indebtedness was $19.4 billion, which    
included new issuances of $4.0 billion in state bonds to finance new            
construction, housing, water conservation, and other projects. Approximately    
$2.2 billion in bonded debt was retired or refunded. The state earned program   
revenues of $57.0 billion and general revenues of $32.2 billion, for total      
revenues of $89.2 billion, an increase of $8.2 billion, or 10.2 percent. The    
major components of this increase are taxes, which were up by $2.0 billion, and 
charges for services, which increased $1.9 billion. The largest tax gains       
occurred in four areas: sales, motor vehicle, franchise, and oil and gas taxes, 
showed increases over the prior year of $696.6 million, $231.8 million, $546.4  
million, and $490.3 million, respectively.                                      

   The expenses of the state were $77.7 billion, an increase of $3.5 billion, or
4.8 percent. The expense fluctuations in Governmental Activities is largely     
attributable to the health and human service function, primarily with Medicaid  
and the Children's Health Insurance Program. In the business type activities,   
college and university expenses were the largest increase, caused primarily by  
staff growth and merit increases. Other proprietary entities showed relatively  
stable activities between the prior and current years.                          

Debt. The State of Texas issues both General Obligation Bonds and Revenue 
Bonds. Each series of revenue bonds is backed by the pledged revenue source and 
restricted funds specified in the bond resolution. Most revenue bonds are       
designed to be self-supporting from a primary revenue source related to the     
program financed.                                                               

 During fiscal year 2005, Texas' state agencies and universities issued $4.0
billion in state bonds to finance new construction, housing, water conservation 
and treatment, and other projects. General obligation debt accounted for $1.4   
billion of state bonds issued in fiscal year 2005. This debt, which can only be 
authorized by a constitutional amendment, carries the full faith and credit of  
the state. The remaining $2.6 billion is due to new issuances of revenue bonds, 
which are serviced by the revenue flows of individual entity projects. Bonds    
retired during the year were composed of $308.1 million in general obligation   
bonds and $626.4 million in revenue bonds. Also, $134.9 million in general      
obligation bonds and $1.1 billion in revenue bonds were refunded. The total     
outstanding general obligation debt of the state after new issuances,           
retirements, and refundings as of August 31, 2005 was $6.8 billion. This        
represents an increase of $951.2 million, or 16.3 percent, from fiscal year     
2004. An additional $3.9 billion of general obligation bonds have been          
authorized but have not been issued. Total revenue bonds outstanding were $12.4 
billion, which is an increase of $858.1 million, or 7.4 percent, from fiscal    
year 2004.                                                                      

Cash Management. Funds deposited in the State Treasury are pooled for     
investment purposes. The Treasury is authorized to invest in NOW accounts, time 
deposits, obligations of the United States, obligations of various federal      
credit organizations, repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements,     
bankers' acceptances, commercial paper, and mutual funds.                       

   Texas' real gross state product advanced by an estimated 3.8 percent in 2005,
while personal income increased by an estimated 7.6 percent. The personal income
growth rate, expressed in nominal dollars, substantially exceeded the 3.4       
percent inflation rate for the year. Real per capita personal income in the     
state rose 5.9 percent during the year.                                         

Ratings. As of September 2006, all outstanding general obligation bonds of
the State of Texas are rated AA by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services and Aa1 by
Moody's Investor's Service, Inc. Any explanation concerning the significance of 
such ratings must be obtained from the rating agencies. There is no assurance   
that any ratings will continue for any period of time or that they will not be  
revised or withdrawn.                                                           

  Miscellaneous. The foregoing information constitutes only a brief summary of
some of the general factors which may impact certain issuers of bonds contained 
in the Texas IM-IT and does not purport to be a complete or exhaustive          
description of all adverse conditions to which the issuers of such obligations  
are subject. Additionally, many factors including national economic, social and 
environmental policies and conditions, which are not within the control of the  
issuers of such bonds, could affect or could have an adverse impact on the      
financial condition of the State and various agencies and political subdivisions
thereof. The Sponsor is unable to predict whether or to what extent such factors
or other factors may affect the issuers of the bonds contained in the Texas     
IM-IT, the market value or marketability of such bonds or the ability of the    
respective issuers of such bonds acquired by the Texas IM-IT to pay interest on 
or principal of such bonds.                                                     

 The Texas IM-IT is susceptible to political, economic or regulatory factors
affecting issuers of Texas municipal obligations (the "Texas Municipal          
Obligations"). These include the possible adverse effects of certain Texas      
constitutional amendments, legislative measures, voter initiatives and other    
matters that are described. The information provided above is only a brief

 Virginia Risk Factors

 Economic Outlook. Building upon the growth of fiscal year 2004, fiscal year
2005 has been an excellent year for Virginia's economy. Unemployment continued  
its downward trend, employment has grown in nearly every industry sector and    
almost every urban center, real wages and salaries and personal income increased
sharply, and the housing and retail markets performed very well.                

Employment. The unemployment rate in the Commonwealth declined from 3.9   
percent in fiscal year 2004 to 3.5 percent in fiscal year 2005, over a 10       
percent decrease. This marks the lowest unemployment rate for Virginia since    
fiscal year 2001. Moreover, Virginia had the fourth lowest unemployment rate in 
the United States in fiscal year 2005, matching last fiscal year's ranking and  
surpassing the sixth lowest ranking in fiscal year 2003. The nation's           
unemployment rate was 5.3 percent in fiscal year 2005, 1.8 percentage points    
higher than the Commonwealth's.                                                 

Several Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) had higher rates of         
unemployment than Virginia as a whole: the Blacksburg-Christiansburg-Radford MSA
(3.8 percent), the Danville MSA (7.5 percent), the Lynchburg MSA (4.0 percent), 
the Richmond MSA (3.8 percent), the Virginia portion of the Kingsport-Bristol   
MSA (4.8 percent), and the Virginia portion of the Virginia                     
Beach-Norfolk-Newport News MSA (4.1 percent). Only four MSAs had unemployment   
rates lower than the Commonwealth's: the Charlottesville MSA (3.0 percent), the 
Harrisonburg MSA (3.0 percent), the Virginia portion of the Winchester MSA (2.9 
percent), and the Virginia portion of the Washington-Arlington-Alexandria MSA   
(2.6 percent). It is interesting to note that the combined labor forces of these
four MSAs comprise approximately 40 percent of the Commonwealth's total labor   
force. The Virginia portion of the Washington-Arlington-Alexandria MSA, alone,  
accounted for over one third of the Virginia labor force in fiscal year 2005.   
The Northern Virginia region, having the combination of the lowest unemployment 
rate and the largest labor force in Virginia, is the main driving force behind  
the Commonwealth's low unemployment rate.                                       

Total non-farm employment grew by 2.4 percent in fiscal year 2005 to reach
3,619,650 workers. The Virginia economy added 84,458 jobs. This marks the second
straight fiscal year that employment has grown in the Commonwealth (1.3 percent 
growth in fiscal year 2004). Virginia ranked fifth in the nation in the number  
of total non-farm jobs added in fiscal year 2005 behind Florida, California,    
Texas and Arizona.                                                              

  Only two sectors incurred slight declines in employment in fiscal year 2005,
manufacturing (-167 jobs or -0.1 percent) and information (-617 jobs or -0.6    
percent). Professional and business services posted the largest increase in     
employment (25,600 or 4.6 percent). The other sectors that experienced          
significant gains in employment are: construction (11,975 or 5.3 percent),      
trade, transportation and utilities (11,383 or 1.8 percent) and total government
(11,283 or 1.8 percent). The sectors that moderately increased employment are:  
education and health services (9,817 or 2.6 percent), leisure and hospitality   
(7,725 or 2.5 percent), other services (4,050 or 2.3 percent) financial         
activities (3,392 or 1.8 percent) and natural resources and mining (17 or 0.2   
percent).                                                                       

   The vast majority of Virginia's 3.6 million non-farm jobs are located in MSAs
(88.3 percent). In fiscal year 2005, MSA non-farm employment reached 3,195,575, 
and non-MSA non-farm employment was 424,075. MSAs added 86,142 jobs (2.8        
percent), while non-MSAs lost 1,683 jobs (-0.4 percent) over fiscal year 2004   
levels.                                                                         

   The Virginia portion of the Washington-Arlington-Alexandria MSA accounted for
about 62 percent of the increase in non-farm employment in the State (53,400 or 
4.5 percent). The other MSAs posting significant gains were: the Richmond MSA   
(13,133 or 2.2 percent) and the Virginia Beach-Norfolk-Newport News MSA (11,575 
or 1.6 percent). The MSAs posting modest gains were: the Roanoke MSA (2,225 or  
1.4 percent), the Charlottesville MSA (2,042 or 2.3 percent), the Harrisonburg  
MSA (1,450 or 2.4 percent), the Winchester MSA (1,342 or 2.5 percent), the      
Blacksburg MSA (1,192 or 1.7 percent) and the Lynchburg MSA (633 or 0.6         
percent). The Danville MSA was the only MSA in the Commonwealth that did not    
show positive non-farm employment growth in fiscal year 2005 (-850 or -1.9      
percent).                                                                       

 Budgetary Process. The Governor is the chief planning and budget officer of
the Commonwealth. The Secretary of Finance and the Department of Planning and   
Budget assist the Governor in the preparation of executive budget documents. The
Governor's Secretaries advise the Governor and the Department of Planning and   
Budget on the relative priority of the budget requests from their respective    
agencies.                                                                       

The Governor is required by statute to present a bill detailing his budget
(the "Budget Bill") and a narrative summary of the bill to the General Assembly 
by December 20th in the year immediately prior to each even-year session. The   
Budget Bill is introduced in both the House of Delegates and the Senate. It is  
referred to the House Appropriations and Senate Finance Committees, which hold  
joint meetings to hear from citizens, from other General Assembly members and   
from agency representatives. The Budget Bill is then approved by each Committee 
in an open session and reported to the respective floors for consideration,     
debate, amendment and passage. After the bill has passed both houses,           
differences between the House and Senate versions are reconciled by a conference
committee with equal representation from both houses.                           

The Budget Bill and the corresponding act enacted by the General Assembly 
approving the budget and making appropriations provided for therein (the        
"Appropriation Act") relate to a biannual period commencing on July 1 in even   
number years. Advanced planning involving development of the Budget Bill begins 
over a year prior to the commencement of a biennium.                            

Under constitutional provisions, the Governor retains the right, in his   
review of legislative action on the Budget Bill, to suggest alterations to or to
veto appropriations made by the General Assembly.                               

 In the odd-year sessions of the General Assembly, amendments are considered
to the Appropriation Act enacted in the previous year. The Governor submits a   
Budget Bill by December 20th which includes his proposed amendments. It is then 
introduced in both houses and is considered in the same manner as the regular   
biennial Budget Bill. The Appropriation Act enacted in the odd-year session is  
effective upon passage, whereas the regular biennial Appropriation Act is       
effective July 1, the beginning of the biennium.                                

An appropriation for a project or service is initially contained in the   
Appropriation Act enacted by the General Assembly. An agency request for an     
increase or other adjustments to its legislative appropriation must be reviewed 
and approved by the Department of Planning and Budget. Under the Constitution,  
no money may be paid out of the State Treasury except pursuant to appropriations
made by law. No such appropriation may be made which is payable more than two   
years and six months after the end of the session of the General Assembly at    
which the appropriation was enacted.                                            

Government-wide Highlights. The Primary Government's assets exceeded its  
liabilities at June 30, 2005, by $14.3 billion. Net assets of governmental      
activities increased by $1.4 billion and net assets of business-type activities 
increased by $235.1 million. Component units reported an increase in net assets 
of $1.5 billion from June 30, 2004.                                             

Fund Highlights. At the end of the fiscal year, the Commonwealth's        
governmental funds reported a combined ending fund balance of $3.7 billion, an  
increase of $979.5 million in comparison with the prior year. Of this total fund
balance, $2.8 billion represents unreserved fund balance and the remaining      
$943.4 million represents amounts reserved for specific purposes, such as the   
Revenue Stabilization Fund and education. The enterprise funds reported net     
assets at June 30, 2005, of $417.5 million, an increase of $233.4 million during
the year.                                                                       

 Debt. The Constitution of Virginia, in Section 9 of Article X, provides for
the issuance of debt by or on behalf of the Commonwealth. Sections 9(a), (b) and
(c) provide for the issuance of debt to which the Commonwealth's full faith and 
credit is pledged and Section 9(d) provides for the issuance of debt not secured
by the full faith and credit of the Commonwealth, but which may be supported by 
and paid from Commonwealth tax collections subject to appropriations by the     
General Assembly. The Commonwealth may also enter into leases and contracts that
are classified on its financial statements as long-term indebtedness. Certain   
authorities and institutions of the Commonwealth may also issue debt.           

Section 9(a) of Article X provides that the General Assembly may contract 
general obligation debt: (1) to meet certain types of emergencies, (2) subject  
to limitations on amount and duration, to meet casual deficits in the revenue or
in anticipation of the collection of revenues of the Commonwealth and (3) to    
redeem a previous debt obligation of the Commonwealth. Total indebtedness issued
pursuant to Section 9(a)(2) shall not exceed 30 percent of an amount equal to   
1.15 times the annual tax revenues "derived from taxes on income and retail     
sales, as certified by the Auditor of Public Accounts, for the preceding fiscal 
year."                                                                          

Section 9(b) of Article X provides that the General Assembly may authorize
the creation of general obligation debt for capital projects. Such debt is      
required to be authorized by an affirmative vote of a majority of the members   
elected to each house of the General Assembly and approved in a statewide       
referendum. The outstanding amount of such debt is limited in the aggregate to  
an amount equal to 1.15 times the average annual tax revenues "derived from     
taxes on income and retail sales, as certified by the Auditor of Public         
Accounts," for the three immediately preceding fiscal years ("9(b) Debt Limit").
Thus, the amount of such debt that can be issued is the 9(b) Debt Limit less the
total amount of such debt outstanding ("Debt Margin"). An additional 9(b) debt  
authorization restriction is calculated in order to determine the amount of such
debt that the General Assembly may authorize for the current fiscal year. The   
additional borrowing authorization restriction is limited to 25% of the 9(b)    
Debt Limit less 9(b) debt authorized in the current and prior three fiscal      
years.                                                                          

The phrase "taxes on income and retail sales" is not defined in the       
Constitution or by statute. The record made in the process of adopting the      
Constitution, however, suggests an intention to include only income taxes       
payable by individuals, fiduciaries and corporations and the state sales and use
tax.                                                                            

Section 9(c) of Article X provides that the General Assembly may authorize
the creation of general obligation debt for revenue producing capital projects  
for executive branch agencies and institutions of higher learning. Such debt is 
required to be authorized by an affirmative vote of two-thirds of the members   
elected to each house of the General Assembly and approved by the Governor. The 
Governor must certify before the enactment of the bond legislation and again    
before the issuance of the bonds that the net revenues pledged are expected to  
be sufficient to pay principal and interest on the bonds issued to finance the  
projects.                                                                       

   The outstanding amount of Section 9(c) debt is limited in the aggregate to an
amount equal to 1.15 times the average annual tax revenues "derived from taxes  
on income and retail sales, as certified by the Auditor of Public Accounts," for
the three immediately preceding fiscal years ("9(c) Debt Limit"). While the debt
limits under Sections 9(b) and 9(c) are each calculated as the same percentage  
of the same average tax revenues, these debt limits are separately computed and 
apply separately to each type of debt.                                          

When the Commonwealth issues bonds to refund outstanding bonds issued     
pursuant to Section 9(b) or 9(c) of Article X of the Constitution, the refunded 
bonds are considered paid for purposes of the constitutional limitations upon   
debt incurrence and issuance and the refunding bonds are counted in the         
computations of such limitations. Section 9(a)(3) provides that in the case of  
the refunding of debt incurred in accordance with Section 9(c) of Article X, the
debt evidenced by the refunding bonds will be counted against the 9(c) Debt     
Limit unless the Governor does not provide the net revenue sufficiency          
certification, in which case the debt evidenced by the refunding bonds will be  
counted against the 9(b) Debt Limit.                                            

  Tax-supported debt of the Commonwealth includes both general obligation debt
and debt of agencies, institutions, boards and authorities for which debt       
service is expected to be made in whole or in part from appropriations of tax   
revenues.                                                                       

Outstanding Section 9(b) debt includes the unamortized portion of (a) $613
million and $50.4 million of general obligation bonds authorized and approved by
the voters in November 1992 and November 2002, respectively, and (b) refunding  
bonds issued in (i) 1996, 1998 and 2002 to refund certain 9(b) bonds issued in  
1993, 1994 and 1996 (ii) 1993 to refund certain 9(c) transportation bonds issued
in 1988, and (iii) 2003 to refund certain of the refunding bonds issued in 1993 
to refund certain 9(c) transportation bonds issued in 1988. Outstanding Section 
9(c) debt includes various series of Higher Educational Institutions Bonds      
(including refunding bonds) issued from 1979 to 2003, six series of             
Transportation Facilities Bonds (including refunding bonds) issued from 1989 to 
2003 and three series of Parking Facilities Bonds (including refunding bonds)   
issued in 1996, 2002 and 2003. Outstanding general obligation debt does not     
include 9(b) and 9(c) refunded bonds for which funds have been deposited in     
irrevocable escrow accounts in amounts sufficient to meet all required future   
debt service (advance refunded bonds).                                          

   Section 9(d) of Article X provides that the restrictions of Section 9 are not
applicable to any obligation incurred by the Commonwealth or any of its         
institutions, agencies or authorities if the full faith and credit of the       
Commonwealth is not pledged or committed to the payment of such obligation.     

   There are currently outstanding various types of 9(d) revenue bonds issued by
authorities, political subdivisions and agencies for which the Commonwealth's   
full faith and credit is not pledged. Certain of these bonds, however, are paid 
in part or in whole from revenues received as appropriations by the General     
Assembly from general tax revenues, while others are paid solely from revenues  
derived from enterprises related to the operation of the financed capital       
projects.                                                                       

Debt Management. The Debt Capacity Advisory Committee (the "Committee") is
charged by statute with annually estimating the amount of tax-supported debt,   
which may prudently be authorized, consistent with the financial goals, capital 
needs and policies of the Commonwealth. Such estimate is provided to the        
Governor and General Assembly. The Committee is also required to review annually
the amount and condition of bonds, notes and other security obligations of the  
Commonwealth's agencies, institutions, boards and authorities which are either  
secured by a moral obligation pledge to replenish reserve fund deficiencies or  
for which the Commonwealth has a contingent or limited liability. The Committee 
also provides its recommendations on the prudent use of such obligations to the 
Governor and the General Assembly.                                              

The Committee also reviews the amounts and provisions of bonds, notes and 
other security obligations of the Commonwealth's agencies, institutions, boards 
and authorities which are neither tax-supported debt or obligations secured by a
moral obligation pledge to replenish reserve fund deficiencies. The Committee   
may recommend limits, when appropriate, on these other obligations.             

  The Department of Planning and Budget has prepared a Six-Year Capital Outlay
Plan (the "Plan") for the Commonwealth. The Plan lists proposed capital         
projects, and it recommends how the proposed projects should be financed. More  
specifically, the Plan distinguishes between immediate demands and longer-term  
needs, assesses the state's ability to meet its highest priority needs, and     
outlines an approach for addressing priorities in terms of costs, benefits and  
financing mechanisms. The 2002 General Assembly set out new requirements for the
funding of capital projects at a level not less than 2 percent of the General   
Fund revenues for the biennium, and the portion of that amount that may be      
recommended for bonded indebtedness.                                            

 The total debt of the Commonwealth, as of June 30, 2005, was $20.3 billion.
Of that amount, $5.9 billion (29.1 percent) was tax-supported debt. Debt is     
considered tax supported if State tax revenues are used or pledged for debt     
service payments. This includes all debt issued pursuant to Article X, Sections 
9(a), 9(b) and 9(c) of the Constitution of Virginia, as well as selected Section
9(d) debt issues and other long-term obligations.                               

Outstanding general obligation debt backed by the full faith and credit of
the Commonwealth totaled $954.0 million at June 30, 2005. Included is Section   
9(b) debt totaling $520.7 million for Public Facilities and $34.8 million for   
Transportation Facilities. In 2002, Virginia voters approved two general        
obligation bond referenda authorizing $1,014.5 million in new capital projects  
for educational and park and recreational facilities of the Commonwealth. Of the
amount authorized, $50.4 million and $162.6 million was issued in June 2003 and 
August 2004, respectively. Principal and interest payments on Public Facilities 
Section 9(b) debt were less than one-half of one percent of total General Fund  
expenditures in fiscal year 2005.                                               

  The balance of general obligation debt of $398.5 million, also backed by the
full faith and credit of the Commonwealth, consisted of Section 9(c) bonds.     
Revenue-producing capital projects, primarily auxiliary enterprises of colleges 
and universities and transportation toll facilities, service these bond         
payments. Holders of Section 9(c) bonds have a legal claim to general tax       
revenues of the Commonwealth should revenues prove to be insufficient to meet   
principal and interest payments. Such claims on general tax revenue have not    
been made.                                                                      

The remaining $4.9 billion in tax-supported debt is made up of selected   
Section 9(d) bonded debt and other long-term obligations. Tax-supported Section 
9(d) debt totaling $3.2 billion includes transportation debt, as well as the    
Virginia Port Authority, Virginia Public Building Authority, Innovative         
Technology Authority, Virginia Biotechnology Research Park Authority, and       
certain Virginia College Building Authority bonds payable. Other tax-supported  
long-term obligations include capital leases, certain appropriation supported   
bonds, installment purchases, notes payable, pension liability, IDA obligations,
Virginia Public Broadcasting Board Notes, and compensated absences.             

 None of the remaining debt of the Commonwealth, which totals $14.4 billion,
is supported by tax revenues. The Commonwealth has no direct or indirect pledge 
of tax revenues to fund reserve deficiencies. However, in some cases, the       
Commonwealth has made a moral obligation pledge to consider funding deficiencies
in debt service reserves that may occur. At June 30, 2005, $1.3 billion, or 9.1 
percent, of debt not supported by taxes was considered moral obligation debt.   

Litigation. The Commonwealth, its officials and employees are named as    
defendants in legal proceedings which occur in the normal course of governmental
operations, some involving claims for substantial amounts. It is not possible at
the present time to estimate the ultimate outcome or liability, if any, of the  
Commonwealth with respect to these lawsuits. However, any ultimate liability    
resulting from these suits is not expected to have a material adverse effect on 
the financial condition of the Commonwealth.                                    

Risk Management. The Commonwealth maintains self-insurance programs for   
employee health, general (tort) liability, medical malpractice, workers'        
compensation, property, and automobile liability insurance. These are reported  
in the Internal Service Funds. The Commonwealth assumes the full risk for claims
filed under the employee health insurance program and the workers' compensation 
program. For the other programs, the risk assumed is limited to certain amounts 
per occurrence.                                                                 

The Commonwealth also provides employee health, errors and omissions      
liability and law enforcement professional liability insurance for local        
governmental units throughout the Commonwealth. These programs are reported in  
the Enterprise Funds.                                                           

Ratings. As of September 2006, all outstanding general obligation bonds of
the State of Virginia are rated AAA by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services and   
Aaa by Moody's Investor's Service, Inc. Any explanation concerning the          
significance of such ratings must be obtained from the rating agencies. There is
no assurance that any ratings will continue for any period of time or that they 
will not be revised or withdrawn.                                               

  Local Issuances. It should be noted that the creditworthiness of obligations
issued by local Virginia issuers may be unrelated to the creditworthiness of    
obligations issued by the State of Virginia, and there is no obligation on the  
part of the State to make payment on such local obligations in the event of     
default.                                                                        

The foregoing information constitutes only a brief summary of some of the 
general factors which may impact certain issuers of bonds contained in the      
Virginia IM-IT and does not purport to be a complete or exhaustive description  
of all adverse conditions to which the issuers of such obligations are subject. 
Additionally, many factors including national economic, social and environmental
policies and conditions, which are not within the control of the issuers of such
bonds, could affect or could have an adverse impact on the financial condition  
of the State and various agencies and political subdivisions thereof. The       
Sponsor is unable to predict whether or to what extent such factors or other    
factors may affect the issuers of the bonds contained in the Virginia IM-IT, the
market value or marketability of such bonds or the ability of the respective    
issuers of such bonds acquired by the Virginia IM-IT to pay interest on or      
principal of such bonds.                                                        

The Virginia IM-IT is susceptible to political, economic or regulatory    
factors affecting issuers of Virginia municipal obligations (the "Virginia      
Municipal Obligations"). These include the possible adverse effects of certain  
Virginia constitutional amendments, legislative measures, voter initiatives and 
other matters that are described. The information provided above is only a brief
summary of the complex factors affecting the financial situation in Virginia and
is derived from sources that are generally available to investors and are       
believed to be accurate. No independent verification has been made of the       
accuracy or completeness of any of the following information. It is based in    
part on information obtained from various State and local agencies in Virginia  
or contained in Official Statements for various Virginia Municipal Obligations. 

West Virginia Risk Factors

   Economic Information and Outlook. West Virginia ranks second in the nation in
coal production, and is also a leader in the chemical, steel, aluminum, natural 
gas, oil, and hardwood lumber industries. In addition, the State has a diverse  
economic base that includes energy, plastics, transportation equipment,         
biomedical technology, and distribution industries. Agriculture is an expanding 
element of the state's economy, annually producing $100 million worth of        
products, such as apples, peaches, turkeys, and broiler chickens.               

West Virginia is on the upswing economically, adding jobs and residents,  
pushing down the unemployment rate, and making progress in closing the per      
capita personal income gap. The State's unemployment rate fell from 6.1% in 2003
to 5.3% in 2004, while the national rate fell from 6.0% to 5.5%. The State added
17,600 jobs from the third quarter of 2003 to the second quarter of 2005, a     
great improvement over the 9,700 jobs lost from the fourth quarter of 2000      
through the third quarter of 2003. Finally, West Virginia's per capita personal 
income has risen from $23,256 in 2001 to $25,872 in 2004, which translates into 
an annual growth rate of 3.4% per year. That is well above the national rate of 
consumer price inflation during the period of 2.2% per year, and it implies that
the average standard of living of the State's residents has risen.              

 While goods-producing sectors, as a group, lost jobs at a rapid pace during
the 2000-2003 period, they have contributed to State job gains since 2003. In   
particular, job growth has been strong in the natural resources and mining and  
construction sectors. Gains in natural resources and mining reflect high coal   
and natural gas prices which are spurring activity. Natural resources and mining
job growth is expected to remain positive as energy production in the State     
rises. Coal production is forecast to rise from 154 million tons in 2005 to 163 
million tons by 2008 as additional coal mine investments come on-line. However, 
coal production will drift downward as rising emissions restrictions and the    
gradual installation of scrubbers at coal-burning electric power generating     
plants (as well as rising competition from coal produced in western states) eats
into the demand for lower sulfur coals produced in the southern part of the     
State. Manufacturing job losses continue, but slow, during the forecast as many 
of the State's largest sectors contend with intense international competition   
and high energy costs. However, those losses are partially offset by gains in   
wood and furniture products, transportation equipment (defense-related          
ammunition, auto parts, and aircraft), and plastics and rubber. Construction job
gains reflect low interest rates and an explosion of residential building       
activity in the Eastern Panhandle.                                              

The upward swing in the State's economy is forecast to continue during the
next five years, with expanding employment and rising inflation-adjusted income 
per capita, assuming continued national economic growth. The job forecast calls 
for the State to add 5,200 jobs per year during the next five years, which      
translates into an annual rate of growth of 0.7% per year. This is a great      
improvement over the average growth of 0.3% from the previous five years in West
Virginia.                                                                       

Financial Information. Last fiscal year ended with the State having a     
significant surplus and, as a result, the State was able to pay down part of its
unfunded pension liabilities. This fiscal year is also projected to have a      
significant budget surplus. Revenue collections in the short term have been much
better than the original estimates, mainly due to higher energy prices resulting
in greater severance tax collections, and to increased corporate profits. Also, 
the Excess                                                                      

Lottery Fund continues to provide substantial surplus funds in the short  
term. These economic conditions result in sizable projected surplus funds       
available for FY 2006 through FY 2008. During FY 2009 through FY 2011, projected
expenditures begin to outpace projected revenues. The main cost drivers are     
providing healthcare through the Medicaid and PEIA programs, and the increasing 
costs of maintaining adequate correctional facilities for juveniles and adults. 
It is the goal of the Manchin Administration to work to contain the growth of   
these key budget drivers in order to be able to set other priorities in         
education, tax reform and economic development.                                 

The State has traditionally held funds for unforeseen circumstances in two
primary funds, the Rainy Day Fund and the Tax Reduction and Federal Funding     
Increased Compliance (TRAFFIC) account maintained by the Legislature. During the
2006 Legislative Session, the Governor will request that the Legislature        
increase the allowable balance in the Rainy Day Fund to ten percent of the      
General Revenue Budget to provide the State with adequate reserves to meet      
unexpected challenges. In addition, the Governor will request surplus amounts   
above the ten percent General Revenue Fund amount be used for one-time          
expenditures, unfunded pension liabilities, and / or unfunded post employment   
health care liabilities.                                                        

  Assets. The assets of the primary government exceeded its liabilities at the
close of the fiscal year by $5.3 billion (reported as "net assets").            
Governmental activities reported $6.8 billion in net assets (a $188 million     
increase, up 2.9% from last year), while the business-type activities reported a
deficit of $1.4 billion, a $760 million decrease in the deficit. The State's net
assets improvements are primarily due to a better economy, more revenue from    
certain taxes, and reduced spending.                                            

 Governmental Funds. At year-end, the governmental funds reported a combined
ending fund balance of $2.4 billion, an increase of $328 million, or 15.7%, in  
comparison with the prior year. The unreserved fund balance for the general fund
was $403 million, or 5.8%, of total general fund expenditures. General Revenue  
surpluses allowed $45 million to be transferred to the Revenue Shortfall Reserve
Fund (Rainy Day Fund).                                                          

   Long-Term Debt. There was a net decrease in the State's long-term obligations
of $40 million. The decrease includes bond and lease principal payments of $76  
million and the refinancing of State road bonds of $348 million. This has been  
offset by new revenue bonds and capital leases of $575 million. Significant     
changes in the obligation included a decrease of Insurance and Compensation     
Benefits of $481 million and the environmental liabilities increased $136       
million primarily due to an increase in the estimated Special Reclamation Fund  
obligation.                                                                     

Major Initiatives. Governor Joe Manchin III has taken a "Responsible      
Government" initiative in the State to encourage new businesses. During the past
year, West Virginia has accomplished substantial improvements to its economy and
job growth. Working closely with the Legislature, workers' compensation reforms 
restored confidence in the State's economy and enabled the State to perform     
better in protecting its injured workers. As a result of insurance reforms, more
than $70 million dollars was returned to consumers in the form of reductions in 
their car and homeowner insurance premiums. Many lines of business insurance    
have been reopened and insurance companies that were considering reducing their 
operations and potentially laying off workers in West Virginia are now looking  
toward expansion.                                                               

   The State Legislature approved a one percent reduction in the State sales tax
on groceries from six cents on the dollar to five cents, resulting in a savings 
to taxpayers of $25 million. In addition, the State's gas tax was capped, saving
drivers between $40 and $50 million this year alone at the pump. Other          
"Responsible Government" initiatives have resulted in the following positive    
changes in State government: (1) reduction, through attrition, of approximately 
171 full-time permanent positions in the Department of Transportation alone,    
saving millions of dollars, (2) Refinancing the State's road bonds for a direct 
savings of $19 million, resulting in federal matching money of $76 million for  
highway projects, and (3) Renegotiating technology contracts, resulting in a    
savings to the state of $24.8 million over the next four years.                 

 Ratings. As of September, 2006, all outstanding general obligation bonds of
the State of West Virginia are rated AA- by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services  
and Aa3 by Moody's Investor's Service, Inc. There is no assurance that any      
ratings will continue for any period of time or that they will not be revised or
withdrawn.                                                                      

  Local Issuances. It should be noted that the creditworthiness of obligations
issued by local West Virginia issuers may be unrelated to the creditworthiness  
of obligations issued by the State of West Virginia, and there is no obligation 
on the part of the State to make payment on such local obligations in the event 
of default.                                                                     

The foregoing information constitutes only a brief summary of some of the 
general factors which may impact certain issuers of bonds contained in the West 
Virginia IM-IT and does not purport to be a complete or exhaustive description  
of all adverse conditions to which the issuers of such obligations are subject. 
Additionally, many factors including national economic, social and environmental
policies and conditions, which are not within the control of the issuers of such
bonds, could affect or could have an adverse impact on the financial condition  
of the State and various agencies and political subdivisions thereof. The       
Sponsor is unable to predict whether or to what extent such factors or other    
factors may affect the issuers of the bonds contained in the West Virginia      
IM-IT, the market value or marketability of such bonds or the ability of the    
respective issuers of such bonds acquired by the West Virginia IM-IT to pay     
interest on or principal of such bonds.
