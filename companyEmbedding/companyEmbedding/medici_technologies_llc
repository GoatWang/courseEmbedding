ABOUT MEDICI TECHNOLOGIES











OUR NAME
Our name is inspired by the Medici family, who were prominent in Europe from the 13th through the 17th centuries, as well as the more recent work of Harvard professor Frans Johansson on the Medici effect. The Medici effect refers to the phenomenon that occurs when a number of talented, creative and productive people from different fields are brought together, enabling collaboration, innovation and creation. The Medici effect draws on the history of the wealthy Medici family, whose patronage brought poets, philosophers, scientists, painters and other artisans from around Europe to Florence, Italy. Bringing these talented people together and allowing them to collaborate is believed to have kicked off the Renaissance, a period of human history marked by great innovation.















OUR TEAM
Guided by the Medici effect, the Medici Technologes team is assembled to combine scientific expertise from different disciplines in a collaborative environment. The team is composed of experts in machine learning, human physiology, optical sensing, operation management, chemometrics, statistical analysis, experiment design, computing system architecture, and biomedical engineering. The team is led by Dr. Ries Robinson. Dr. Robinson has founded several medical engineering companies including Inlight Solutions, Lumidigm, VeraLight and TruTouch Technologies. In addition to serving as Chief Executive Officer of Medici Technologies, he is also currently the Chief Innovation Officer at Presbyterian Healthcare Services.

You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.

If Clinton Phillips is correct, March 10 will be remembered as the date the disruption of America’s health-care provider system began.
The experienced entrepreneur launched the app for his fledgling Austin-based company, Medici Technologies LLC, that day to coincide with the start of this year’s South by Southwest conference and festival. Consumers can use the app to text physicians on call who can instantly answer concerns, for a fee of $25, similar to an office visit co-pay. Users also have the option of adding their own doctors to the app and inviting them to participate.

“We’re going to be as well-known as Uber,” Phillips, chiropractor-turned-startup guru, said without averting his eyes or breaking a smile during an interview at his downtown office. “Health care is desperate for change. We have an incredible product, an amazing group of investors, a very smart team and an enormous market.”
He also didn’t shy away from the possibility that this 10-day period could be Medici’s “Twitter moment.” The social-media site based in California mushroomed into prominence during SXSW 2007.
“We’re going to be a $10 billion company,” predicted the South African native, 42, whose wife Jade was formerly “Thunder” on the South African version of the "American Gladiators" reality TV show. “The only question is whether that happens in two years or four years. This is a ginormous opportunity. It’s really about building a new health care ecosystem.”
The startup, which began operating in stealth mode in April 2016, spent about $250,000 to introduce Medici at SXSW, said Phillips, who has founded two other health care companies. That money paid for the physicians on call, a branding statement with the Medici name on the lanyard worn by all SXSW Interactive badge holders and 20 people hired to roam the streets of Austin to showcase the app and explain how it works.




By late November 2016, the company had raised about $32.2 million from more than 10 investors — and had one of the biggest Austin-area capital raises during 2016. Phillips doesn’t plan to raise more funds until October, he said.

The company will move its 30 employees on April 1 to new offices on the 25th floor of the Bank of America financial center at 515 Congress Ave. from its current digs at the WeWork complex across the street at 600 Congress Avenue.
“Right now, we’re focused on execution,” he said. “We’re focused on patients and doctors using the app to solve problems. We want to know what people value, what they choose and how they choose. Then we’ll know what we have to do.”
SXSW-style afflictions
Those who download the app will have free access during the 10-day SXSW events to 15 Austin-area health care providers for 10 hours a day through the end of the festival. Users will be able to text any of those providers with questions for free during an initial consultation.
Phillips chose those physicians to address what might be expected afflictions amid an event like SXSW.
Internal-medicine specialist, Dr. Tobin Lim, for example, will be on hand to help alleviate hangover symptoms. Veterinarian Isaac Croudep can suggest remedies to those experiencing separation anxiety from their pets. Dr. Elaine Hamilton, a pediatrician, could talk parents through dealing with a sick child on Sixth Street. And nutritionist Carly Pollack may recommend foods that provide a healthy energy boost. Phillips himself is available for anyone experiencing back pain.




 


“Ninety percent of doctor visits we make for the rest of our lives will be this way,” Phillips said. “We won’t be sitting around in waiting rooms, filling out paperwork.”
No longer bound to office hours or unnecessary trips to urgent care centers or emergency rooms, patients could simply may text their doctors when a problem arises. The option allows the doctor to explain that the ailment can wait until the next day to be assessed in person.
That alone would result in significant savings to individuals, families, health care organizations and insurers. Inappropriate visits to emergency rooms are among many avoidable burdens Americans place on U.S. health care, experts say.
The app also provides flexibility for the providers, Hamilton said.
“This is a good way to stay connected with my patients and demonstrate I value that relationship,” said Hamilton, a veteran doctor of 26 years who works at Westlake Pediatrics in West Lake Hills. “We can still communicate when the office is not open. That’s advantageous to me and my patients. They can get a hold of me and I have the flexibility to get back to them on my schedule.”
HIPAA compliant
Medici’s platform is the first in Hamilton’s experience to offer texting. No telemedicine service she worked with had that option, she said. The app also provides for the sharing of photos and videos, and it complies with the 1996 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, commonly known as HIPAA. That and the cybersecurity of the app made Hamilton comfortable that her patients’ privacy would be protected.
“The direction medicine is moving in is one of more convenience to patients,” Hamilton said. “I want to be a part of that wave.”
Pollack, the nutritionist, pointed out another advantage: She would no longer have to share her personal cellphone number.
That has become a problem occasionally when Pollack's private time was invaded by client calls, she said. Another boundary the Medici app sets is a financial transaction each time someone contacts her.
“The app sets the expectations that each consultation will be $25, and for that money, the client will get the highest level of care,” Pollack said.
Plus, if someone is suffering gastrointestinal symptoms due to a detoxification regimen or is at the grocery store and uncertain of what specific food to buy, that person may contact Pollack and get an instant reply.
“Clients shouldn’t have to wait three weeks for an answer if they’re not feeling well now,” she said. “The app provides the ability for client support in real time.”
Regardless of this week’s outcomes, the Medici team already has major events scheduled as it rolls out its expansion during the upcoming months.
Already in the U.S. and France, Medici also will be operating in Brazil, India, Mexico and South Africa by the end of the year, Phillips said.
While Phillips framed the future of Medici in terms of what will happen, he did admit to one hope he has regarding the company. Elon Musk, the founder of SpaceX and Tesla, also is from South Africa. Phillips hasn’t met him, but he would like to.
“He’s my hero,” Phillips said. “A year from now, it’d be nice for people to be saying that I’m the Elon Musk of health care.”
