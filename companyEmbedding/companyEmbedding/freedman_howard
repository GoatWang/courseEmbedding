Biography[edit]
Career[edit]
Friedman was born in New York City and received his bachelor's degree from Binghamton University in applied physics in 1993. He received a master's in statistics in 1998 and PhD in biomedical engineering from Johns Hopkins University in 1999. His thesis work focused on neural representations of object color through neurophysiological records of awake, behaving monkeys. This research leveraged a visual phenomenon known as Troxler's fading which is related to color filling-in to explore how object color is represented in the visual cortex. He has also contributed to areas of changepoint detection as it applies to neurophysiology.
Friedman was awarded a number of awards during his undergraduate and graduate career including the National Merit Scholarship, Whitaker Foundation Fellowship[2] and the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship NSF-GRF
Following his dissertation work, Friedman took a position as a director at Capital One where he led teams of statisticians, analysts and programmers in various areas of operations and marketing. He left Capital One to form Analytic Solutions LLC in 2003 which provided consulting services in areas of designing, developing and modeling data.
He moved to a full-time position at the United Nations in 2007 where he has since been a lead on work including the ICPD @ 15 Costing, High Level Task Force on Innovative Financing, and the Adding It Up reports. He is credited with being the lead developer of the Integrated Health Model (used for costing the Health-related Millennium Development Goals within UNDP) and the Reproductive Health Costing Tool in UNFPA[3] He is a lead scientist for the interagency collaboration among UNICEF, World Bank, World Health Organization, UNFPA, UNAIDS and UNDP for the development of the Unified Health Model, a project sponsored by the IHP+.[4] In 2014, he was a Visiting Researcher at Oxford University's Department of Economics.
Friedman is the author of over 50 scientific articles and book chapters in areas of applied statistics, health economics and politics.
Personal[edit]
Friedman was born in New York City. His father worked as a math teacher, his mother worked as an early education teacher.
Literature and artwork[edit]
In addition to his scientific career, Friedman is an accomplished artist[5][6] and writer. His formal art training was at both Binghamton University and the School of Visual Arts. His first book, Angels and Stardust, featured original poetry and artwork. In his doctoral thesis, he quoted both Ozymandias and Angels and Stardust in the preface. His paintings have been displayed in a number of New York City venues.
His recent writing is focused on political analysis leveraging his statistics and United Nations experience have been published in numerous online venues including the Huffington Post,[7] and cnbc.com.[8]
In June 2012, Prometheus Books released his book Measure of a Nation. This book focuses on how to improve America by first comparing its performance with thirteen competitive industrial nations, then identifying the best practices found throughout the world that can be adopted here in the United States. Measure of a Nation was named by Jared Diamond as the best book of 2012 in an interview[9] published in the New York Times.
Friedman released an e-book, A Modest Proposal for America, in May 2013 through Foreword Literary that combines an opening satire on America with an analysis of US federal government finances.

Biography[edit]
Career[edit]
Friedman was born in New York City and received his bachelor's degree from Binghamton University in applied physics in 1993. He received a master's in statistics in 1998 and PhD in biomedical engineering from Johns Hopkins University in 1999. His thesis work focused on neural representations of object color through neurophysiological records of awake, behaving monkeys. This research leveraged a visual phenomenon known as Troxler's fading which is related to color filling-in to explore how object color is represented in the visual cortex. He has also contributed to areas of changepoint detection as it applies to neurophysiology.
Friedman was awarded a number of awards during his undergraduate and graduate career including the National Merit Scholarship, Whitaker Foundation Fellowship[2] and the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship NSF-GRF
Following his dissertation work, Friedman took a position as a director at Capital One where he led teams of statisticians, analysts and programmers in various areas of operations and marketing. He left Capital One to form Analytic Solutions LLC in 2003 which provided consulting services in areas of designing, developing and modeling data.
He moved to a full-time position at the United Nations in 2007 where he has since been a lead on work including the ICPD @ 15 Costing, High Level Task Force on Innovative Financing, and the Adding It Up reports. He is credited with being the lead developer of the Integrated Health Model (used for costing the Health-related Millennium Development Goals within UNDP) and the Reproductive Health Costing Tool in UNFPA[3] He is a lead scientist for the interagency collaboration among UNICEF, World Bank, World Health Organization, UNFPA, UNAIDS and UNDP for the development of the Unified Health Model, a project sponsored by the IHP+.[4] In 2014, he was a Visiting Researcher at Oxford University's Department of Economics.
Friedman is the author of over 50 scientific articles and book chapters in areas of applied statistics, health economics and politics.
Personal[edit]
Friedman was born in New York City. His father worked as a math teacher, his mother worked as an early education teacher.
Literature and artwork[edit]
In addition to his scientific career, Friedman is an accomplished artist[5][6] and writer. His formal art training was at both Binghamton University and the School of Visual Arts. His first book, Angels and Stardust, featured original poetry and artwork. In his doctoral thesis, he quoted both Ozymandias and Angels and Stardust in the preface. His paintings have been displayed in a number of New York City venues.
His recent writing is focused on political analysis leveraging his statistics and United Nations experience have been published in numerous online venues including the Huffington Post,[7] and cnbc.com.[8]
In June 2012, Prometheus Books released his book Measure of a Nation. This book focuses on how to improve America by first comparing its performance with thirteen competitive industrial nations, then identifying the best practices found throughout the world that can be adopted here in the United States. Measure of a Nation was named by Jared Diamond as the best book of 2012 in an interview[9] published in the New York Times.
Friedman released an e-book, A Modest Proposal for America, in May 2013 through Foreword Literary that combines an opening satire on America with an analysis of US federal government finances.

I was especially impressed with him because, unlike other realtors we have used in the past, he listened to what we actually want and never tried to show us something that was either out of our  desired price range or a house that had anything we did not want.  He was always receptive to our ideas and willing to work all hours to help accommodate our busy schedules.  I will continue to use his services in the future and would recommend him to anyone wanting a great realtor.More Less      Response from Howard and David Friedman on 12/27/2013 Thank you for the fantastic review. My father and I wish you the best of luck in the quickly upcoming year of 2014 and look forward to working with your family again in the future!       Highly likely to recommend     10/09/2013 -  user62689901    Written about  Howard and David Friedman   on 10/09/2013 Bought a Single Family home in 2013 for approximately $200K in Victorville, CA.   Local knowledge: Process expertise: Responsiveness: Negotiation skills:  Howard and David Friedman were key in helping us to discover our dream home.  They were patient through our indecisive periods, and encouraging when we decided to commit.  Their online method of making offers proved to be simple and fast.  Being able to make multiple offers on homes allowed us the  flexibility we needed in such a trying market.  Thank you to both Howard and David Friedman and all they did to help us in making the biggest decision of our lives!More Less       1 2 Next  Service AreasBanning, CABeaumont, CACabazon, CACathedral City, CACorona, CAFontana, CAHighland, CAIndian Wells, CALa Quinta, CALoma Linda, CAMira Loma, CAMoreno Valley, CANorco, CAPalm Desert, CAPalm Springs, CARancho Mirage, CARedlands, CARiverside, CASan Bernardino, CAYucaipa, CAView all service areasShow less service areas Print page  Contact  This Team Contact team Submitting contact...Professional Information01/05/2007Howard and David FriedmanAgent/BrokerRealicoreAddress:Realicore363 W. 6th StSan Bernardino, CA  92401Phone:(909) 486-2957Websites:Website, Twitter, Contributions:5Screen name:howardfcpaMember since:01/05/2007Licenses:California (Certified Public Accountant)howardfcpa's BoardsHome Design Ideas1 imageView all boards
