The Sub-Accounts that will no longer be available for new payment allocations or
transfers are collectively referred to as the "Closed Sub-Accounts." If you     
currently have Accumulated Value allocated to a Closed Sub-Account as of the    
Close Date, you may remain invested in that Closed Sub-Account until you        
transfer to other investment options. However, if you transfer out of a Closed  
Sub-Account after the Close Date, you will not be able to transfer back into any
of the Closed Sub-Accounts. The closing of the Closed Sub-Accounts to new       
payments and transfers does not affect the other Sub-Account investment options 
that are currently available under your Policy.

P-->497Last Page of 2TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 2nd
If you currently have in effect a Dollar Cost Averaging ("DCA") program, or an  
Automatic Account Rebalancing ("AAR") program that is directed to any of the    
Affected Sub-Accounts, it will terminate as of the Close Date. However, you may 
establish a new program using the other Sub-Accounts that are available under   
your policy. If you currently have a Monthly Automatic Payment ("MAP") program, 
or a Future Payment Allocation ("FPA") that is directed to any of the Affected  
Sub-Accounts, you will be required to change your allocation. AFTER THE CLOSE   
DATE, THE COMPANY WILL NOT ACCEPT ANY PAYMENTS THAT INCLUDE ALLOCATIONS TO THE  
AFFECTED SUB-ACCOUNTS.                                                          

For policy holders whose automated payment features (AAR, DCA, MAP and FPA) are 
impacted by the above Sub-Account closings, a subsequent mailing will be        
forwarded to you with instruction and a form to make the necessary changes to   
your allocations.                                                               

If you should have any questions, please call 1-800-533-7881 for assistance.

Applicants' Representations
1. Commonwealth is a life insurance company engaged in the business of writing individual and group annuity contracts and life insurance policies. Commonwealth was originally organized under the laws of Delaware in July 1974 and was subsequently re-domiciled in the state of Massachusetts effective December 31, 2002.
2. Prior to December 30, 2005, Commonwealth (formerly Allmerica Financial Life Insurance and Annuity Company) was an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of The Hanover Insurance Group (“THG”), formerly Allmerica Financial Corporation. On that date, THG completed the closing of the sale of Commonwealth to The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (“Goldman Sachs”). Effective September 1, 2006, Commonwealth changed its name from Allmerica Financial Life Insurance and Start Printed Page 20666Annuity Company to Commonwealth Annuity and Life Insurance Company. Effective April 30, 2013, Goldman Sachs completed the transfer of the common stock of Commonwealth to Global Atlantic (Fin) Company, which is a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Global Atlantic Financial Group Limited. Effective January 2, 2014, Forethought Services LLC acquired ownership of 79% of the shares of Commonwealth. Forethought Services LLC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Forethought Financial Group, Inc., which in turn is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Global Atlantic (Fin) Company. As of December 31, 2015, Goldman Sachs owns a total of approximately 22% of the outstanding shares of Global Atlantic; and other investors, none of whom own more than 9.9%, own the remaining 78% of the outstanding ordinary shares.
3. Each of the Separate Accounts meets the definition of “separate account,” as defined in Section 2(a)(37) of the 1940 Act and Rule 0-1(e) thereunder. The Separate Accounts are registered with the Commission under the 1940 Act as unit investment trusts. The assets of the Separate Accounts support the Contracts and interests in the Separate Accounts offered through such Contracts. Commonwealth is the legal owner of the assets in the Separate Accounts. The Separate Accounts are segmented into subaccounts, and each subaccount invests in an underlying registered open-end management investment company or a series thereof. A subaccount of one or more of the Separate Accounts corresponds to each of the Existing Portfolios. The business and affairs of the Separate Accounts, as unit investment trusts, are conducted by Commonwealth, as depositor thereof.
4. The Contracts are each registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “1933 Act”), on Form N-4 or Form N-6, as applicable. Each of the Contracts has particular fees, charges, and investment options, as described in the Contracts' respective registration statements.
5. The Contracts are individual or group deferred variable annuity contracts or variable life insurance policies. As set forth in the prospectuses for the Contracts, Commonwealth reserves the right to substitute shares of another registered investment company for the shares of any registered investment company already purchased or to be purchased in the future by the Separate Accounts.
6. Applicants propose, as set forth below, to substitute shares of the Replacement Portfolios for shares of the Existing Portfolios (“Substitutions”):

7. The Replacement Portfolios are all series of the Trust. The Trust is an insurance-dedicated Delaware statutory trust that was organized on June 17, 2013. The Trust is registered with the Commission as an open-end management investment company under the 1940 Act (File No. 811-22865) and its shares are registered under the 1933 Act (File No. 333-189870). The Trust is a series investment company and currently has 30 separate portfolios (each, a “Global Atlantic Fund,” and collectively, the “Global Atlantic Funds”). The following 13 Global Atlantic Funds comprise the Replacement Portfolios: Global Atlantic BlackRock Allocation Portfolio, Global Atlantic BlackRock Disciplined Core Portfolio, Global Atlantic BlackRock Disciplined Growth Portfolio, Global Atlantic BlackRock International Core Portfolio, Global Atlantic BlackRock Disciplined Mid Cap Growth Portfolio, Global Atlantic BlackRock Small Cap Portfolio, Global Atlantic BlackRock U.S. Core Portfolio, Global Atlantic BlackRock Disciplined Value Portfolio, Global Atlantic BlackRock High Yield Portfolio, Global Atlantic Goldman Sachs Core Fixed Income Portfolio, Global Atlantic Goldman Sachs Global Equity Insights Portfolio, Global Atlantic Goldman Sachs Large Cap Growth Insights Portfolio, and Global Atlantic Goldman Sachs Mid Cap Value Insights Portfolio.
8. Global Atlantic, an Indiana limited liability company and a registered investment adviser, serves as investment adviser for each of the Global Atlantic Funds pursuant to an investment advisory agreement between the Trust, on behalf of each Global Atlantic Fund, and Global Atlantic.
9. Each Replacement Portfolio is sub-advised by BlackRock Investment Management, LLC (“BlackRock”) or Goldman Sachs Asset Management, L.P. (“GSAM”). BlackRock is a wholly owned subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc. BlackRock is a registered investment adviser and a commodity pool operator organized in Princeton, New Jersey. BlackRock, Inc. and its affiliates had approximately $4.64 trillion in assets under management as of December 31, 2015. BlackRock is located at 1 University Square, Princeton, NJ 08536. GSAM is a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and an affiliate of Goldman Sachs. As of December 31, 2015, GSAM, including its investment advisory affiliates, had assets under supervision of approximately $1.08 trillion. GSAM's principal offices are located at 200 West Street, New York, NY 20182.
10. The Applicants believe that the Replacement Portfolios have investment objectives, principal investment strategies, and principle risks, as described in their prospectuses, that are substantially similar to, the corresponding Existing Portfolios to make those Replacement Portfolios appropriate candidates as substitutes.
11. Information for each Existing Portfolio and Replacement Portfolio, including investment objectives, principal investment strategies, principal risks, and comparative performance history, can be found in the application.
12. Applicants state that in selecting the Replacement Portfolios, Commonwealth sought to simplify fund lineups while reducing costs and maintaining a high-quality menu of investment options that would offer a similar diversity of investment options after the proposed Substitutions as is currently available under the Contracts. Contract owners with Contract value allocated to the subaccounts of the Existing Portfolios will have lower or equal net annual operating expenses immediately after the proposed Substitutions as before the proposed Substitutions. With respect to all of the proposed Substitutions, the combined management fee and Rule 12b-1 fees paid by the Replacement Portfolio are the same or lower than those of the corresponding Existing Portfolio. The application sets forth the fees and expenses of each Existing Portfolio and its corresponding Replacement Portfolio in greater detail.
13. Applicants represent that as of the Substitution Date (defined below), the Separate Accounts will redeem shares of the Existing Portfolios for cash or in-kind. Redemption requests and purchase orders will be placed simultaneously so that Contract values will remain fully invested at all times.
14. Each Substitution will be effected at the relative net asset values of the respective shares of the Replacement Portfolios in conformity with Section 22(c) of the 1940 Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder without the imposition of any transfer or similar charges by the Section 26 Applicants. The Substitutions will be effected without change in the amount or value of any Contracts held by affected Contract owners.[2] 

15. Contract owners will not incur any fees or charges as a result of the proposed Substitutions. The obligations of the Section 26 Applicants, and the rights of the affected Contract owners, under the Contracts of affected Contract owners will not be altered in any way. Commonwealth and/or its affiliates will pay all expenses and transaction costs of the Substitutions, including legal and accounting expenses, any applicable brokerage expenses and other fees and expenses. No fees or charges will be assessed to the affected Contract owners to effect the Substitutions. The proposed Substitutions will not cause the Contract fees and charges currently being paid by Contract owners to be greater after the proposed Substitution than before the proposed Substitution. In addition, the Substitutions will in no way alter the tax treatment of affected Contract owners in connection with their Contracts, and no tax liability will arise for Contract owners as a result of the Substitutions.
16. The Section 26 Applicants agree that, for a period of two years following the implementation of the proposed Substitution (the “Substitution Date”), and for those Contracts with assets allocated to the Existing Portfolio on the Substitution Date, Commonwealth or an affiliate thereof (other than the Trust) will reimburse, on the last business day of each fiscal quarter, the Contract owners whose subaccounts invest in the applicable Replacement Portfolio to the extent that the Replacement Portfolio's net annual operating expenses (taking into account fee waivers and expense reimbursements) for such period exceeds, on an annualized basis, the net annual operating expenses of the Start Printed Page 20669Existing Portfolio for the most recent fiscal year preceding the date of the most recently filed application. Commonwealth will not increase the Contract fees and charges that would otherwise be assessed under the terms of the Contracts for a period of at least two years following the Substitution Date.
17. From the date the Pre-Substitution Notice (defined below) through 30 days following the Substitution Date, Contract owners may make at least one transfer of Contract value from the subaccount investing in an Existing Portfolio (before the Substitution) or the Replacement Portfolio (after the Substitution) to any other available subaccount under the Contract without charge and without imposing any transfer limitations. Further, on the Substitution Date, Contract values attributable to investments in each Existing Portfolio will be transferred to the corresponding Replacement Portfolio without charge and without being subject to any transfer limitations. Moreover, Commonwealth will not exercise any rights reserved under the Contracts to impose restrictions on transfers between the subaccounts under the Contracts, including limitations on the future number of transfers, for a period beginning at least 30 days before the Substitution Date through at least 30 days following the Substitution Date.
18. At least 30 days prior to the Substitution Date, Contract owners will be notified via prospectus supplements that the Section 26 Applicants received or expect to receive Commission approval of the applicable proposed Substitutions and of the anticipated Substitution Date (the “Pre-Substitution Notice”). Pre-Substitution Notices sent to Contract owners will be filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 497 under the 1940 Act. The Pre-Substitution Notice will advise Contract owners that from the date of the Pre-Substitution Notice through the date 30 days after the Substitutions, Contract owners may make at least one transfer of Contract value from the subaccounts investing in the Existing Portfolios (before the Substitutions) or the Replacement Portfolios (after the Substitutions) to any other available subaccount without charge and without imposing any transfer limitations. Among other information, the notice will inform affected Contract owners that that, except as described in the disruptive transfers or market timing provisions of the relevant prospectus, Commonwealth will not exercise any rights reserved under the Contracts to impose restrictions on transfers among the subaccounts under the Contracts, including limitations on the future number of transfers, through at least 30 days after the Substitution Date. Additionally, all affected Contract owners will be sent prospectuses of the applicable Replacement Portfolios at least 30 days before the Substitution Date.
19. In addition to the Supplements distributed to the Contract owners, within five business days after the Substitution Date, Contract owners whose assets are allocated to a Replacement Portfolio as part of the proposed Substitutions will be sent a written notice (each, a “Confirmation”) informing them that the Substitutions were carried out as previously notified. The Confirmation also will restate the information set forth in the Pre-Substitution Notice. The Confirmation will also reflect the values of the Contract owner's positions in the Existing Portfolio before the Substitution and the Replacement Portfolio after the Substitution.
Legal Analysis
1. The Section 26 Applicants request that the Commission issue an order pursuant to Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act approving the proposed Substitutions. Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act prohibits any depositor or trustee of a unit investment trust that invests exclusively in the securities of a single issuer from substituting the securities of another issuer without the approval of the Commission. Section 26(c) provides that such approval shall be granted by order from the Commission if the evidence establishes that the substitution is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes of the 1940 Act.
2. The Section 26 Applicants submit that the Substitutions meet the standards set forth in Section 26(c) and that, if implemented, the Substitutions would not raise any of the concerns that Congress intended to address when the 1940 Act was amended to include this provision. Applicants state that each Substitution protects the Contract owners who have Contract value allocated to an Existing Portfolio by providing Replacement Portfolios with substantially similar investment objectives, strategies, and risks, and providing Contract owners with investment options that would have total and net annual operating expense ratios that are lower than, or equal to, their corresponding investment options before the Substitutions.
3. Commonwealth has reserved the right under the Contracts to substitute shares of another underlying fund for one of the current funds offered as an investment option under the Contracts. The Contracts and the Contracts' prospectuses disclose this right.
4. The Section 26 Applicants submit that the ultimate effect of the proposed Substitutions will be to streamline and simplify the investment line-ups that are available to Contract owners while reducing expenses and continuing to provide Contract owners with a wide array of investment options. The Section 26 Applicants state that the proposed Substitutions will not reduce in any manner the nature or quality of the available investment options and the proposed Substitutions also will permit Commonwealth to present information to its Contract owners in a simpler and more concise manner. The Section 26 Applicants also state it is anticipated that after the proposed Substitutions, Contract owners will be provided with disclosure documents that contain a simpler presentation of the available investment options under the Contracts. The Section 26 Applicants also assert that the proposed Substitutions are not of the type that Section 26 was designed to prevent because they will not result in costly forced redemption, nor will they affect other aspects of the Contracts. In addition, the proposed Substitutions will not adversely affect any features or riders under the Contracts because none of the features or riders have any investment restrictions. Accordingly, no Contract owner will involuntarily lose his or her features or riders as a result of any proposed Substitution. Moreover, the Section 26 Applicants will offer Contract owners the opportunity to transfer amounts out of the affected subaccounts without any cost or other penalty (other than those necessary to implement policies and procedures designed to detect and deter disruptive transfer and other “market timing” activity) that may otherwise have been imposed for a period beginning on the date of the Pre-Substitution Notice (which supplement will be delivered to the Contract owners at least thirty (30) days before the Substitution Date) and ending no earlier than thirty (30) days after the Substitution Date. The proposed Substitutions are also unlike the type of substitution that Section 26(c) was designed to prevent in that the Substitutions have no impact on other aspects of the Contracts.
5. The Section 17 Applicants request an order under Section 17(b) exempting them from the provisions of Section 17(a) to the extent necessary to permit the Section 17 Applicants to carry out some or all of the proposed Substitutions. The Section 17 Start Printed Page 20670Applicants state that because the proposed Substitutions may be effected, in whole or in part, by means of in-kind redemptions and purchases, the proposed Substitutions may be deemed to involve one or more purchases or sales of securities or property between affiliated persons.
6. Section 17(a)(1) of the 1940 Act, in relevant part, prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company, or any affiliated person of such person, acting as principal, from knowingly selling any security or other property to that company. Section 17(a)(2) of the 1940 Act generally prohibits the persons described above, acting as principals, from knowingly purchasing any security or other property from the registered investment company.
7. The Section 17 Applicants state that the proposed transactions may involve a transfer of portfolio securities by the Existing Portfolios to the Separate Accounts. Immediately thereafter, the Separate Accounts would purchase shares of the Replacement Portfolios with the portfolio securities received from the Existing Portfolios. Accordingly, the Section 17 Applicants provide that to the extent Commonwealth and the Existing Portfolios, and Commonwealth and the Replacement Portfolios, are deemed to be affiliated persons of one another under Section 2(a)(3) or Section 2(a)(9) of the 1940 Act, it is conceivable that this aspect of the proposed Substitutions could be viewed as being prohibited by Section 17(a). Accordingly, the Section 17 Applicants have determined to seek relief from Section 17(a).
8. The Section 17 Applicants submit that the terms of the proposed in-kind purchases of shares of the Replacement Portfolios by the Separate Accounts, including the consideration to be paid and received, as described in the application, are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned. The Section 17 Applicants submit that the terms of the proposed in-kind transactions, including the considered to be paid to each Existing Portfolio and received by each Replacement Portfolio involved, are reasonable, fair and do not involve overreaching principally because the transactions will conform with all but one of the conditions enumerated in Rule 17a-7 under the 1940 Act. The proposed transactions will take place at relative net asset value in conformity with the requirements of Section 22(c) of the 1940 Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder without the imposition of any transfer or similar charges by the Section 26 Applicants. The Substitutions will be effected without change in the amount or value of any Contract held by the affected Contract owners. The Substitutions will in no way alter the tax treatment of affected Contract owners in connection with their Contracts, and no tax liability will arise for Contract owners as a result of the Substitutions. The fees and charges under the Contracts will not increase because of the Substitutions. Even though the Separate Accounts, Commonwealth and the Trust may not rely on Rule 17a-7, the Section 17 Applicants believe that the rule's conditions outline the type of safeguards that result in transactions that are fair and reasonable to registered investment company participants and preclude overreaching in connection with an investment company by its affiliated persons.
9. The Section 17 Applicants also submit that the proposed in-kind purchases by the Separate Accounts are consistent with the policies of the Trust and the Replacement Portfolios, as provided in the Trust's registration statement and reports filed under the 1940 Act. Finally, the Section 17 Applicants submit that the proposed Substitutions are consistent with the general purposes of the 1940 Act.
Applicants' Conditions
The Section 26 Applicants, and Global Atlantic as applicable, agree that any order granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions:
1. The Substitutions will not be effected unless Commonwealth determines that: (i) The Contracts allow the substitution of shares of registered open-end investment companies in the manner contemplated by the application; (ii) the Substitutions can be consummated as described in the application under applicable insurance laws; and (iii) any regulatory requirements in each jurisdiction where the Contracts are qualified for sale have been complied with to the extent necessary to complete the Substitutions.
2. After the Substitution Date, Global Atlantic will not change a sub-adviser, add a new sub-adviser, or otherwise rely on the Manager of Managers Order (as defined in the application), or any replacement order from the Commission, with respect to any Replacement Portfolio without first obtaining shareholder approval of the change in sub-adviser, the new sub-adviser, or the Replacement Portfolio's ability to rely on the Manager of Managers Order, or any replacement order from the Commission.
3. Commonwealth or an affiliate thereof (other than the Trust) will pay all expenses and transaction costs of the Substitutions, including legal and accounting expenses, any applicable brokerage expenses and other fees and expenses. No fees or charges will be assessed to the affected Contract owners to effect the Substitutions. The proposed Substitutions will not cause the Contract fees and charges currently being paid by Contract owners to be greater after the proposed Substitution than before the proposed Substitution.
4. The Substitutions will be effected at the relative net asset values of the respective shares of the Replacement Portfolios in conformity with Section 22(c) of the 1940 Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder without the imposition of any transfer or similar charges by the Section 26 Applicants. The Substitutions will be effected without change in the amount or value of any Contracts held by affected Contract owners.
5. The Substitutions will in no way alter the tax treatment of affected Contract owners in connection with their Contracts, and no tax liability will arise for Contract owners as a result of the Substitutions.
6. The obligations of the Section 26 Applicants, and the rights of the affected Contract owners, under the Contracts of affected Contract owners will not be altered in any way.
7. Affected Contract owners will be permitted to make at least one transfer of Contract value from the subaccount investing in the Existing Portfolio (before the Substitution Date) or the Replacement Portfolio (after the Substitution Date) to any other available investment option under the Contract without charge for a period beginning at least 30 days before the Substitution Date through at least 30 days following the Substitution Date. Except as described in any market timing/short-term trading provisions of the relevant prospectus, the Section 26 Applicants will not exercise any rights reserved under the Contracts to impose restrictions on transfers between the subaccounts under the Contracts, including limitations on the future number of transfers, for a period beginning at least 30 days before the Substitution Date through at least 30 days following the Substitution Date.
8. All affected Contract owners will be notified, at least 30 days before the Substitution Date about: (i) The intended Substitution of Existing Portfolios with the Replacement Portfolios; (ii) the intended Substitution Date; and (iii) information with respect to transfers as set forth in Condition 7 Start Printed Page 20671above. In addition, the Section 26 Applicants will also deliver to affected Contract owners, at least thirty days before the Substitution Date, a prospectus for each applicable Replacement Portfolio.
9. The Section 26 Applicants will deliver to each affected Contract owner within five business days of the Substitution Date a written confirmation which will include: (i) A confirmation that the Substitutions were carried out as previously notified; (ii) a restatement of the information set forth in the Pre-Substitution Notice; and (iii) values of the Contract owner's positions in the Existing Portfolio before the Substitution and the Replacement Portfolio after the Substitution.
10. For a period of two years following the Substitution Date, for Contract owners who were Contract owners as of the Substitution Date, Commonwealth or an affiliate thereof (other than the Trust) will reimburse, on the last business day of each fiscal quarter, the Contract owners whose subaccounts invest in the applicable Replacement Portfolio to the extent that the Replacement Portfolio's net annual operating expenses (taking into account fee waivers and expense reimbursements) for such period exceeds, on an annualized basis, the net annual operating expenses of the Existing Portfolio for the most recent fiscal year preceding the date of the application. In addition, the Section 26 Applicants will not increase the Contract fees and charges that would otherwise be assessed under the terms of the Contracts for a period of at least two years following the Substitution Date.

2.
     The Section 26 Applicants state that, because the Substitutions will occur at relative net asset value, and the fees and charges under the Contracts will not change as a result of the Substitutions, the benefits offered by the guarantees under the Contracts will be the same immediately before and after the Substitutions. The Section 26 Applicants also state that what effect the Substitutions may have on the value of the benefits offered by the Contract guarantees would depend, among other things, on the relative future performance of the Existing Portfolios and Replacement Portfolios, which the Section 26 Applicants cannot predict. Nevertheless, the Section 26 Applicants note that at the time of the Substitutions, the Contracts will offer a comparable variety of investment options with as broad a range of risk/return characteristics.

(cont.)                                                                         

In most jurisdictions, values may be allocated to the Fixed Account, which is   
part of the Company's General Account. The Fixed Account is an investment option
that pays an interest rate guaranteed for one year from the time a payment is   
received.                                                                       

The Guarantee Period Accounts, another investment option, offer fixed rates of  
interest for specified periods ranging from 2 to 10 years. A Market Value       
Adjustment is applied to payments removed from a Guarantee Period Account before
the end of the specified period. The Market Value Adjustment may be positive or 
negative. Payments allocated to a Guarantee Period Account are held in the      
Company's Separate Account GPA (except in California where they are allocated to
the General Account).

which would be the Enhanced Earnings Rider with a charge of 0.20% annually and  
the Minimum Guaranteed Annuity Payout (M-GAP) Rider with a ten-year waiting     
period at a charge of 0.25% annually. Although your actual costs may be higher

retirement or other important financial goals on a tax-deferred basis. The      
Contract combines the concept of professional money management with the         
attributes of an annuity contract. Features available through the Contract      
include:                                                                        

-    a customized investment portfolio;                               

-    experienced professional investment advisers;                    

-    tax deferral on earnings;                                        

     -    guarantees that can protect your family during the accumulation phase;
and                                                         

-    income payments that you can receive for life.                   

I HAVE THE PIONEER VISION CONTRACT (FORM A3023-95) -- ARE THERE ANY DIFFERENCES 
BETWEEN THIS AND PIONEER VISION 2?                                              

Yes. If your Contract is issued on Form No. A3023-95, the first version of      
Pioneer Vision, it is basically similar to the Contract described in this       
Prospectus ("Pioneer Vision 2") except as specifically indicated in APPENDIX D  
-- DIFFERENCES UNDER THE PIONEER VISION CONTRACT (FORM A3023-95). Note that     
APPENDIX D also includes the cumulative expense tables for the Pioneer Vision   
Contract (Form A3023-95). The form number is located in the bottom left-hand    
corner of your Contract pages, and may include some numbers or letters in       
addition to A3023-95 in order to identify state variations.                     

WHAT HAPPENS IN THE ACCUMULATION PHASE?                                         

The Contract has two phases: an accumulation phase and, if you choose to        
annuitize, an annuity payout phase. During the accumulation phase, you may      
allocate payments among the available Sub-Accounts investing in the Underlying  
Portfolios (you may utilize up to seventeen Sub-Accounts at any one time, in    
addition to the Pioneer Money Market VCT Portfolio), and, in most jurisdictions,
to the Guarantee Period Accounts and the Fixed Account (collectively "the
investment options.") You select the investment options most appropriate for    
your investment needs. As those need change, you may also change your allocation
without incurring any tax consequences. Your Contract's Accumulated Value is    
based on the investment performance of the Portfolios and any accumulations in  
the Guarantee Period and Fixed Accounts. You do not pay taxes on any earnings   
under the Contract until you withdraw money. In addition, during the            
accumulation phase, your beneficiaries receive certain protections in the event 
of the Annuitant's death. See discussion below: WHAT HAPPENS UPON DEATH DURING  
THE ACCUMULATION PHASE?                                                         
WHAT HAPPENS IN THE ANNUITY PAYOUT PHASE?                                       

During the annuity payout phase, the Annuitant can receive income based on      
several annuity payout options. You choose the annuity payout option and the    
date for annuity benefit payments to begin. You also decide whether you want    
variable annuity benefit payments based on the investment performance of certain
Underlying Portfolios, fixed annuity benefit payments with payment amounts      
guaranteed by the Company, or a combination of fixed and variable annuity       
benefit payments. Among the payout options available during the annuity payout  
phase are:

-    periodic payments for the Annuitant's lifetime;                  

 -    periodic payments for the Annuitant's life and the life of another
person selected by you;                                     

-    periodic payments for the Annuitant's lifetime with any remaining
          guaranteed payments continuing to the beneficiary for ten years in the
event that the Annuitant dies before the end of ten years;  

   -    periodic payments over a specified number of years (1 to 30) - under
         the fixed version of this option you may reserve the right to convert
      remaining payments to a lump-sum payout by electing a "commutable"
         option. Variable period certain options are automatically commutable.

WHO ARE THE KEY PERSONS UNDER THE CONTRACT?                                     

The Contract is between you, (the "Owner"), and us, Commonwealth Annuity and    
Life Insurance Company. Each Contract has an Owner (or an Owner and a Joint     
Owner, in which case one of the two must also be the Annuitant), an Annuitant   
and one or more beneficiaries. As Owner, you make payments, choose investment   
allocations and select the Annuitant and one or more beneficiaries. The         
Annuitant is the individual who receives annuity benefit payments under the     
Contract. The beneficiary is the person who receives any payment on the death of
the Owner or Annuitant.                                                         

HOW MUCH CAN I INVEST AND HOW OFTEN?                                            

The number and frequency of your payments are flexible, subject only to a $5,000
minimum for your initial payment ($2,000 for IRA's) and a $50 minimum for any   
additional payments. (A lower initial payment amount may be permitted for       
certain qualified plans and where monthly payments are being forwarded directly 
from a financial institution.) In addition, a minimum of $1,000 is always       
required to establish a Guarantee Period Account.                               

WHAT ARE MY INVESTMENT CHOICES?                                                 

Prior to the Annuity Date, you may allocate payments among one or more of the   
variable Sub-Accounts investing in the Underlying Portfolios (up to a total of  
seventeen Sub-Accounts may be utilized at any one time, in addition to the      
Pioneer Money Market VCT Portfolio), the Guarantee Period Accounts and the Fixed
Account. Each Underlying Portfolio operates pursuant to different investment    
objectives and this range of investment options enables you to allocate your    
money among the Underlying Portfolios to meet your particular investment needs. 
For a more detailed description of the Underlying Portfolios, see INVESTMENT    
OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES.                                                        

Assets supporting the guarantees under the Guarantee Period Accounts are held in
the Company's Separate Account GPA, a non-unitized insulated separate account,  
except in California where assets are held in the Company's General Account.    
Values and benefits calculated on the basis of Guarantee Period Account         
allocations, however, are obligations of the Company's General Account. Amounts 
allocated to a Guarantee Period Account earn a Guaranteed Interest Rate declared
by the Company. The level of the Guaranteed Interest Rate depends on the number 
of years of the Guarantee Period selected. The Company may offer up to nine     
Guarantee Periods ranging from two to ten years in duration. Once declared, the 
Guaranteed Interest Rate will not change during the duration of the Guarantee   
Period. If amounts allocated to a Guarantee Period Account are transferred,     
surrendered or applied to any annuity option at any time other than the day     
following the last day of the applicable Guarantee Period, a Market Value       
Adjustment will apply that may increase or decrease the account's value;        
however, this adjustment will never be applied against your principal. In       
addition, earnings in the GPA after application of the Market Value Adjustment  
will not be less than an effective annual rate of 3%. For more information about
the Guarantee Period Accounts and the Market Value Adjustment, see GUARANTEE    
PERIOD ACCOUNTS.                                                                
THE GUARANTEE PERIOD ACCOUNTS MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ALL STATES.               

12

P-->485BPOS16th Page of 210TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 16th
The Fixed Account is part of the General Account which consists of all the      
Company's assets other than those allocated to the Variable Account and any     
other separate account. Allocations to the Fixed Account are guaranteed as to   
principal and a minimum rate of interest. Additional excess interest may be     
declared periodically at the Company's discretion. Furthermore, the initial rate
in effect on the date an amount is allocated to the Fixed Account is guaranteed 
for one year from that date. For more information about the Fixed Account, see  
APPENDIX A -- MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE FIXED ACCOUNT.                         
CAN I MAKE TRANSFERS AMONG THE INVESTMENT CHOICES?                              

Yes. Prior to the Annuity Date, you may transfer among the Sub-Accounts, the    
Guarantee Period Accounts, and the Fixed Account. Transfers may be made to and  
among all of the available Sub-Accounts as long as no more than seventeen       
Sub-Accounts, in addition to the Pioneer Money Market VCT Portfolio, are        
utilized at any one time. You will incur no current taxes on transfers while    
your money remains in the Contract. The first 12 transfers in a Contract year   
are guaranteed to be free of a transfer charge. For each subsequent transfer in 
a Contract year, the Company does not currently charge, but reserves the right  
to assess a processing charge guaranteed never to exceed $25. See "TRANSFER
PRIVILEGE" under DESCRIPTION OF THE CONTRACT.                                   

You also may elect at no additional charge Automatic Transfers (Dollar Cost     
Averaging) to gradually move money to one or more of the Underlying Portfolios  
or Automatic Account Rebalancing to ensure assets remain allocated according to 
your designated percentage allocation mix.                                      

WHAT IF I NEED MY MONEY BEFORE THE ANNUITY PAYOUT PHASE BEGINS?                 

Before the annuity payout phase begins, you may surrender your Contract or make 
withdrawals at any time. A 10% tax penalty may apply on all amounts deemed to be
income if you are under age 59 1/2. Each calendar year you can take without a   
surrender charge the greatest of 100% of Cumulative Earnings, 15% of the        
Contract's Accumulated Value or, if you are both an Owner and the Annuitant, an 
amount based on your life expectancy. (Similarly, no surrender charge will apply
if an amount is withdrawn based on the Annuitant's life expectancy if the Owner 
is a trust or other nonnatural person.) Additional amounts may be withdrawn at  
any time but payments that have not been invested in the Contract for more than 
seven years may be subject to a surrender charge. (A Market Value Adjustment,   
which may increase or decrease the value of the account, may apply to any       
withdrawal made from a Guarantee Period Account prior to the expiration of the  
Guarantee Period.)                                                              

In addition, you may withdraw all or a portion of your money without a surrender
charge if, after the Contract is issued, and before age 65, you become disabled.
Also, except in New Jersey where it is not permitted by state law, you may      
withdraw money without a surrender charge if, after the Contract is issued, you 
are admitted to a medical care facility or diagnosed with a fatal illness. For  
details and restrictions, see "Reduction or Elimination of Surrender Charge and 
Additional Amounts Credited" in "SURRENDER CHARGE" under CHARGES AND DEDUCTIONS.

WHAT HAPPENS UPON DEATH DURING THE ACCUMULATION PHASE?                          

If the Annuitant, Owner or Joint Owner should die before the Annuity Date, a    
death benefit will be paid to the beneficiary. Upon the death of the Annuitant  
(or an Owner who is also an Annuitant), the death benefit is equal to the       
greatest of:                                                                    

    -    The Accumulated Value on the Valuation Date that the Company receives
       proof of death, and all necessary claim paperwork, increased by any
positive Market Value Adjustment;                           

     -    Gross payments, with interest compounding daily at an effective annual
 yield of 5% starting on the date each payment is applied, and
      continuing throughout your investments' entire accumulation phase,
decreased proportionately to reflect withdrawals; or        

-    The death benefit that would have been payable on the most recent
         Contract anniversary, increased for subsequent payments and decreased
proportionately for subsequent withdrawals.                 

This guaranteed death benefit works in the following way assuming no withdrawals
are made. On the first anniversary, the death benefit will be equal to the      
greater of:                                                                     

(a)  the Accumulated Value (increased by any positive Market Value Adjustment); 

(b)  gross payments compounded daily at an effective annual yield of 5%.        

The higher of (a) or (b) will then be locked in until the second anniversary, at
which time the death benefit will be equal to the greatest of:                  

(a)  the Contract's then current Accumulated Value increased by any positive    
Market Value Adjustment;                                              

(b)  gross payments compounded daily at an effective annual yield of 5%; or     

(c)  the locked-in value of the death benefit at the first anniversary.         

The greatest of (a), (b) or (c) will be locked in until the next Contract       
anniversary. This calculation will then be repeated on each anniversary while   
the Contract remains in force and prior to the Annuity Date. As noted above, the
values of (b) and (c) will be decreased proportionately if withdrawals are      
taken.                                                                          

At the death of an Owner who is not also the Annuitant during the accumulation  
phase, the death benefit will equal the Contract's Accumulated Value on the     
Valuation Date that the Company receives proof of death and all necessary claim 
paperwork, increased by any positive Market Value Adjustment. If the Annuitant  
dies after the Annuity Date but before all guaranteed annuity benefit payments  
have been made, the remaining payments will be paid to the beneficiary at least 
as rapidly as under the annuity option in effect. See "DEATH BENEFIT."          

In addition, if you elected the optional Enhanced Earnings Rider at issue,      
additional amounts may be payable to your beneficiary if the Annuitant dies     
prior to the Annuity Date. For a detailed discussion of the benefits under the  
Enhanced Earnings Rider, see "OPTIONAL ENHANCED EARNINGS RIDER" under           
DESCRIPTION OF THE CONTRACT.                                                    
WHAT CHARGES WILL I INCUR UNDER MY CONTRACT?                                    

If the Accumulated Value on a Contract anniversary or upon surrender is less    
than $50,000, the Company will deduct a $30 Contract fee from your Contract. The
Contract fee is currently waived for Contracts issued to and maintained by a    
trustee of a 401(k) plan.                                                       

Should you decide to surrender your Contract, make withdrawals, or receive      
payments under certain annuity payout options, you may be subject to a surrender
charge. If applicable, this charge will be between 1% and 7% of payments        
withdrawn, based on when the payments were originally made.                     

14

P-->485BPOS18th Page of 210TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 18th
A deduction for state and local premium taxes, if any, may be made as described 
in "PREMIUM TAXES" under CHARGES AND DEDUCTIONS.                                

The Company will deduct, on a daily basis, an annual Mortality and Expense Risk 
Charge and an Administrative Expense Charge equal to 1.25% and 0.15%,           
respectively, of the average daily net assets invested in each Underlying       
Portfolio. The Portfolios will incur certain management fees and expenses which 
are more fully described in the prospectuses of the Underlying Portfolios, which
accompany this Prospectus. These charges vary among the Underlying Portfolios   
and may change from year to year.                                               

If you elected the optional Enhanced Earnings Rider at issue, a separate monthly
charge is deducted from the Contract's Accumulated Value. For specific charges, 
see "OPTIONAL RIDER CHARGE" under CHARGES AND DEDUCTIONS.                       

CAN I EXAMINE THE CONTRACT?                                                     

Yes. Your Contract will be delivered to you after your purchase. If you return  
the Contract to the Company within ten days of receipt, the Contract will be    
canceled. (There may be a longer period in certain states; see the "Right to    
Examine" provision on the cover of your Contract.) If you cancel the Contract,  
you will receive a refund of any amounts allocated to the Fixed and Guarantee   
Period Accounts and the Accumulated Value of any amounts allocated to the       
Sub-Accounts, plus any fees or charges that may have been deducted. However, if 
state law requires, or if the Contract was issued as an Individual Retirement   
Annuity (IRA) you will generally receive a refund of your entire payment. (In   
certain states this refund may be the greater of (1) your entire payment or (2) 
the amounts allocated to the Fixed and Guarantee Period Accounts plus the       
Accumulated Value of amounts in the Sub-Accounts, plus any fees or charges      
previously deducted.) See "RIGHT TO CANCEL INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ANNUITY" and   
"RIGHT TO CANCEL ALL OTHER CONTRACTS" under DESCRIPTION OF THE CONTRACT.

 DESCRIPTION OF THE COMPANY, THE VARIABLE ACCOUNT,
 AND THE UNDERLYING PORTFOLIOS

THE COMPANY. Effective September 1, 2006, Allmerica Financial Life Insurance and
Annuity Company was renamed Commonwealth Annuity and Life Insurance Company and 
the principal office was relocated to 132 Turnpike Road, Suite 210,             
Southborough, MA 01772, Telephone 508-460-2400. Unless otherwise specified, any 
reference to the "Company" refers to Commonwealth Annuity and Life Insurance    
Company ("Commonwealth Annuity ").                                              

Commonwealth Annuity is a life insurance company organized under the laws of    
Delaware in July 1974. Prior to December 31, 2002, Allmerica Financial was a    
direct subsidiary of First Allmerica Financial Life Insurance Company ("First   
Allmerica"), which in turn was a direct subsidiary of The Hanover Insurance     
Group ("THG," formerly Allmerica Financial Corporation). Effective December 31,
2002, Allmerica Financial became a Massachusetts domiciled insurance company and
a direct subsidiary of THG. On December 30, 2005, THG completed the closing of  
the sale of the Company to The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. ("Goldman Sachs"), 85  
Broad Street, New York, NY 10004.                                               

As of December 31, 2007, the Company had $10 billion in assets and $12 billion  
of life insurance in force.                                                     

The Company is subject to the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts         
governing insurance companies and to regulation by the Commissioner of Insurance
of Massachusetts. In addition, it is subject to the insurance laws and          
regulations of other states and jurisdictions in which it is licensed to        
operate. Its Principal Office is located at 132 Turnpike Road, Suite 210,       
Southborough, MA 01772, Telephone 508-460-2400.                                 

THE VARIABLE ACCOUNT. Each Company maintains a separate account called Separate 
Account VA-P (the "Variable Account"). The Variable Account of Commonwealth     
Annuity was authorized by vote of the Board of Directors of the Company on      
October 27, 1994. The Variable Account is registered with the SEC as a unit     
investment trust under the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("the 1940 Act"). This
registration does not involve the supervision or management of investment       
practices or policies of the Variable Account or the Company by the SEC.        

Separate Account VA-P is a separate investment account of the Company. The      
assets used to fund the variable portions of the Contract are set aside in the  
Sub-Accounts of the Variable Account, and are kept separate and apart from the  
general assets of the Company. Each Sub-Account is administered and accounted   
for as part of the general business of the Company. The income, capital gains or
capital losses of each Sub-Account, however, are allocated to each Sub-Account, 
without regard to any other income, capital gains or capital losses of the      
Company. Obligations under the Contract are obligations of the Company. Under   
Massachusetts law, the assets of the Variable Account may not be charged with   
any liabilities arising out of any other business of the Company.               

The Company reserves the right, subject to compliance with applicable law, to   
change the names of the Variable Account and the Sub-Accounts. The Company may  
offer other variable annuity contracts investing in the Variable Account which  
are not discussed in this Prospectus. The Variable Account also may invest in   
other Underlying Portfolios which are not available to the Contracts described  
in this Prospectus.                                                             

UNDERLYING PORTFOLIOS. Each Sub-Account invests in a corresponding investment   
portfolio ("Underlying Portfolio") of an open-end management investment company.
The Underlying Portfolios available through this contract are NOT publicly      
traded. They are only available as variable investment options in variable life 
insurance policies or variable annuity contracts issued by life insurance       
companies or, in some cases, through participation in certain qualified pension 
or retirement plans.                                                            

The investment advisers of the Underlying Portfolios may manage publicly traded 
mutual funds with similar names and objectives. However, the Underlying         
Portfolios are NOT directly related to any publicly traded mutual fund.         
Consequently, the investment performance of the Underlying Portfolios and any   
similarly named publicly traded mutual fund may differ substantially.

P-->485BPOS20th Page of 210TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 20th
A summary of investment objectives of each of the Underlying Portfolios is set  
forth below. Certain Underlying Portfolios have similar investment objectives   
and/or policies. Therefore, to choose the Sub-Accounts which best meet your     
needs and objectives, carefully read the Underlying Portfolio prospectuses along
with this Prospectus. There can be no assurance that the investment objectives  
of the Underlying Portfolios can be achieved. In some states, insurance         
regulations may restrict the availability of particular Portfolios.             

INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES

A summary of investment objectives of each of the Underlying Portfolios is set  
forth below. MORE DETAILED INFORMATION REGARDING THE INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES,     
RESTRICTIONS AND RISKS, EXPENSES PAID BY THE UNDERLYING FUNDS AND OTHER RELEVANT
INFORMATION REGARDING THE UNDERLYING FUNDS MAY BE FOUND IN THEIR RESPECTIVE     
PROSPECTUSES, WHICH SHOULD BE READ CAREFULLY BEFORE INVESTING. THE PROSPECTUSES 
AND STATEMENTS OF ADDITIONAL INFORMATION OF THE UNDERLYING FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE  
FROM THE SERVICE OFFICE UPON REQUEST.                                           

There can be no assurance that the investment objectives of the Underlying      
Portfolios can be achieved or that the value of the Contract will equal or      
exceed the aggregate amount of the purchase payments made under the Contract.   
Sub-Account values will fluctuate; even a Sub-Account investing in a money      
market portfolio may have negative returns, particularly if fees and charges are
deducted at the Sub-Account level.

change in the investment policy, or (2) the receipt of the notice of the Owner's
right to transfer.                                                              

 PERFORMANCE INFORMATION

The Pioneer Vision 2 Contract was first offered to the public by Commonwealth   
Annuity and Life Insurance Company in 1996. The Company, however, may advertise 
"total return" and "average annual total return" performance information based  
on (1) the periods that the Sub-Accounts have been in existence and (2) the     
periods that the Underlying Portfolios have been in existence. Both the total   
return and yield figures are based on historical earnings and are not intended  
to indicate future performance. Performance tables are included in the Statement
of Additional Information.                                                      

The total return of a Sub-Account refers to the total of the income generated by
an investment in the Sub-Account and of the changes in the value of the         
principal (due to realized and unrealized capital gains or losses) for a        
specified period, reduced by Variable Account charges, and expressed as a       
percentage.                                                                     

The average annual total return represents the average annual percentage change 
in the value of an investment in the Sub-Account over a given period of time. It
represents averaged figures as opposed to the actual performance of a           
Sub-Account, which will vary from year to year.                                 

The yield of the Sub-Account investing in the Pioneer Money Market VCT Portfolio
refers to the income generated by an investment in the Sub-Account over a       
seven-day period (which period will be specified in the advertisement). This    
income is then "annualized" by assuming that the income generated in the        
specific week is generated over a 52-week period. This annualized yield is shown
as a percentage of the investment. The "effective yield" calculation is similar 
but, when annualized, the income earned by an investment in the Sub-Account is  
assumed to be reinvested. The effective yield will be higher than the yield     
because of the compounding effect of this assumed reinvestment.                 

The yield of a Sub-Account investing in a Portfolio other than the Pioneer Money
Market VCT Portfolio refers to the annualized income generated by an investment 
in the Sub-Account over a specified 30-day or one-month period. The yield is    
calculated by assuming that the income generated by the investment during that  
30-day or one-month period is generated each period over a 12-month period and  
is shown as a percentage of the investment.                                     

PERFORMANCE INFORMATION FOR ANY SUB-ACCOUNT REFLECTS THE PERFORMANCE OF A       
HYPOTHETICAL INVESTMENT IN THE SUB-ACCOUNT DURING THE TIME PERIOD ON WHICH THE  
CALCULATIONS ARE BASED AS WELL AS CONTRACT LEVEL CHARGES (IF ANY) AND WITHDRAWAL
CHARGES (FOR MORE INFORMATION, SEE THE SAI). PERFORMANCE INFORMATION SHOULD BE  
CONSIDERED IN LIGHT OF THE INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES AND RISK          
CHARACTERISTICS OF THE UNDERLYING PORTFOLIO IN WHICH THE SUB-ACCOUNT INVESTS AND
THE MARKET CONDITIONS DURING THE GIVEN TIME PERIOD, AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED
AS A REPRESENTATION OF WHAT MAY BE ACHIEVED IN THE FUTURE.

Performance information for a Sub-Account may be compared in reports and        
promotional literature to:                                                      

(1)  the Standard & Poor's 500 Composite Stock Price Index (S&P 500), Dow Jones 
  Industrial Average (DJIA), Shearson Lehman Aggregate Bond Index or other
  unmanaged indices, so that investors may compare the Sub-Account results
    with those of a group of unmanaged securities widely regarded by investors
as representative of the securities markets in general; or            

(2)  other groups of variable annuity separate accounts or other investment     
   products tracked by Lipper Analytical Services, a widely used independent
 research firm which ranks mutual funds and other investment products by
     overall performance, investment objectives, and assets, or tracked by other
 services, companies, publications, or persons, who rank such investment
products on overall performance or other criteria; or                 

(3)  the Consumer Price Index (a measure for inflation) to assess the real rate 
of return from an investment in the Sub-Account. Unmanaged indices may
assume the reinvestment of dividends but generally do not reflect     
deductions for administrative and management costs and expenses. In   
 addition, relevant broad-based indices and performance from independent
sources may be used to illustrate the performance of certain Contract 
features.                                                             

At times, the Company may also advertise the ratings and other information      
assigned to it by independent rating organizations such as A.M. Best Company    
("A.M. Best"), Moody's Investors Service ("Moody's"), Standard & Poor's         
Insurance Rating Services ("S&P") and Duff & Phelps. A.M. Best's and Moody's    
ratings reflect their current opinion of the Company's relative financial       
strength and operating performance in comparison to the norms of the life/health
insurance industry. S&P's and Duff & Phelps' ratings measure the ability of an  
insurance company to meet its obligations under insurance policies it issues and
do not measure the ability of such companies to meet other non-policy           
obligations. The ratings also do not relate to the performance of the Underlying
Portfolios.

 DESCRIPTION OF THE CONTRACT

As of the date of this Prospectus, the Company has ceased issuing new Contracts 
except in connection with certain pre-existing contractual plans and programs.  
References to issue requirements and initial payments are included as           
information regarding general Company procedures. This Prospectus provides only 
a very brief overview of the more significant aspects of the Policy and of the  
Company's administrative procedures for the benefit of the Company's current    
Owners.                                                                         

DISRUPTIVE TRADING 

This Contract is not designed for use by individuals, professional market timing
organizations, or other entities that engage in short-term trading, frequent    
transfers, programmed transfers or transfers that are large in relation to the  
total assets of an Underlying Fund (collectively, "Disruptive Trading"). These  
activities may require the Underlying Fund to maintain undesirable large cash   
positions or frequently buy or sell portfolio securities. Such transfers may    
dilute the value of the Underlying Fund's shares, interfere with the efficient  
management of the Underlying Fund's portfolio, and increase brokerage and       
administrative costs of the Underlying Funds. As a result, Disruptive Trading   
may adversely affect an Underlying Fund's ability to invest effectively in      
accordance with its investment objectives and policies, and may harm other      
Contract Owners.                                                                

In order to protect our Contract Owners and the Underlying Funds from           
potentially harmful trading activity, we utilize certain policies and procedures
that are designed to detect and prevent disruptive trading among the Underlying 
Funds (the "Disruptive Trading Procedures"). Our Disruptive Trading Procedures  
consider certain factors in order to identify Disruptive Trading activity,      
including the following:                                                        

-    the number of transfers made over a period of time;                        

-    the length of time between transfers;                                      

-    whether the transfers follow a pattern that appears to be designed to take 
  advantage of short term market fluctuations, particularly within certain
Underlying Funds;                                                     

-    the dollar amount(s) requested for transfers; and                          

-    whether the transfers are part of a group of transfers made by a third     
party on behalf of several individual Contract Owners; and            

-    the investment objectives and/or size of the Underlying Funds.             

We may increase our monitoring of Contract Owners who engage in what we perceive
to be disruptive trading, including investigating the transfer patterns within  
multiple contracts owned by the same Contract Owners. We may also investigate   
any patterns of disruptive trading identified by the Underlying Funds that may  
not have been captured by our Disruptive Trading Procedures.                    

Our Disruptive Trading Procedures may vary from Sub-Account to Sub-Account. The 
Disruptive Trading Procedures limit the number of transfers a Contract Owner may
make during a given period, limit the number of times a Contract Owner may      
transfer into particular funds during a given period, and place restrictions as 
to the time and means of transfers (for example, transfer instructions are      
required by a certain daily time cutoff), among other things. Subject to the    
terms of the Contract, the Company reserves the right to impose, without prior  
notice, additional or alternate restrictions on allocations and transfers that  
it determines, in its sole discretion, will disadvantage or potentially hurt the
rights or interests of other Contract Owners or other holders of the Underlying 
Funds.                                                                          

Some of the Underlying Funds have reserved the right to temporarily or          
permanently refuse payments or transfer requests from the Company if, in the    
judgment of the Underlying Fund's investment adviser, the Underlying Fund would 
be unable to invest effectively in accordance with its investment objective or  
policies, or would otherwise potentially be adversely affected. If an Underlying
Fund refuses a transfer request from the Company, the Company may not be able to
effect certain allocations or transfers that a Contract Owner has requested. In 
the future, some Underlying Funds may impose redemption fees on short-term      
trading (i.e.,                                                                  

21

P-->485BPOS25th Page of 210TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 25th
redemptions of mutual fund shares within a certain number of business days after
purchase). We reserve the right to administer and collect any such redemption   
fees on behalf of the Underlying Funds.                                         

We will apply our Disruptive Trading Procedures consistently without special    
arrangement, waiver, or exception. However, the Company's ability to detect and 
deter Disruptive Trading and to consistently apply the Disruptive Trading       
Procedures may be limited by operational systems and technological limitations. 
Contract Owners seeking to engage in such transfer activities may employ a      
variety of strategies to avoid detection. Because identifying Disruptive Trading
involves judgments that are inherently subjective, the Company cannot provide   
assurances that its Disruptive Trading Procedures will detect every Contract    
Owner who engages in disruptive trading. In addition, the terms of some         
contracts previously issued by the Company, historical practices or actions,    
litigation, or certain regulatory restrictions may limit the Company's ability  
to apply transfer or other restrictions.                                        

If we are unable to detect Disruptive Trading or are unable to restrict         
Disruptive Trading because of contract provisions or other reasons, you may     
experience dilution in the value of your Underlying Fund shares. There may be   
increased brokerage and administrative costs within the Underlying Funds, which 
may result in lower long-term returns for your investments. Additionally,       
because other insurance companies and/or retirement plans may invest in the     
Underlying Funds, we cannot guarantee that the Underlying Funds will not suffer 
harm from disruptive trading within the variable contracts issued by other      
insurance companies or among investment options available to retirement plan    
participants.                                                                   

Under rules recently adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission,         
effective April 16, 2007, we will be required to: (1) enter into a written      
agreement with each Underlying Fund or its principal underwriter that will      
obligate us to provide to the Underlying Fund promptly upon request certain     
information about the trading activity of individual Contract Owners, and (2)   
execute instructions from the Underlying Fund to restrict or prohibit further   
purchases or transfers by specific Contract Owners who violate the frequent     
trading policies established by the Underlying Fund.                            

PAYMENTS 

The Company issues a Contract when its underwriting requirements, which include 
receipt of the initial payment and allocation instructions by the Company at its
Service Office, are met. These requirements also may include the proper         
completion of an application; however, where permitted, the Company may issue a 
Contract without completion of an application and/or signature for certain      
classes of Contracts. The Company reserves the right to reject an application or
request to issue a Contract. Any such rejection will not discriminate unfairly  
among purchasers.                                                               

Payments are to be made payable to the Company. A net payment is equal to the   
payment received less the amount of any applicable premium tax. The initial net 
payment is credited to the Contract and allocated among the requested investment
options as of the date that all issue requirements are properly met. If all     
issue requirements are not completed within five business days of the Company's 
receipt of the initial payment, the payment will be returned immediately unless 
the applicant authorizes the Company to retain it pending completion of all     
issue requirements. Subsequent payments will be credited as of the Valuation    
Date received at the Service Office, on the basis of accumulation unit value    
next determined after receipt.                                                  

Payments may be made to the Contract at any time prior to the Annuity Date, or  
prior to payment of the death benefit, subject to certain minimums:             

 -    Currently, the initial payment must be at least $5,000 ($2,000 for
        IRA's). A lower minimum amount may be permitted if monthly automatic
       payments are being forwarded directly from a financial institution.

-    Each subsequent payment must be at least $50.                    

 -    The minimum allocation to a Guarantee Period Account is $1,000. If
    less than $1,000 is allocated to a Guarantee Period Account, the
        Company reserves the right to apply that amount to the Pioneer Money
Market VCT Portfolio.                                       

22

P-->485BPOS26th Page of 210TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 26th
Generally, unless otherwise requested, all subsequent payments will be allocated
among investment options in the same proportion that the initial net payment is 
allocated or, if subsequently changed, according to the most recent allocation  
instructions. Prior to the Annuity Date, you may utilize up to seventeen        
variable Sub-Accounts at any one time, in addition to the Pioneer Money Market  
VCT Portfolio.                                                                  

RIGHT TO CANCEL INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ANNUITY 

An individual purchasing a Contract intended to qualify as an IRA may cancel the
Contract at any time within ten days after receipt of the Contract and receive a
refund. In order to cancel the Contract, the Owner must mail or deliver the     
Contract to the agent through whom the Contract was purchased, to the Company's 
Service Office, Security Benefit Life Insurance Company, located at One Security
Benefit Place, Topeka, KS 66675, Telephone 1-800-688-9915, or to an authorized  
representative. Mailing or delivery must occur within ten days after receipt of 
the Contract for cancellation to be effective.                                  

Within seven days, the Company will provide a refund equal to gross payment(s)  
received. In some states, however, the refund may equal the greater of (a) gross
payments or (b) the amounts allocated to the Fixed and Guaranteed Period        
Accounts plus the Accumulated Value of amounts in the Sub-Accounts plus any     
amounts deducted under the Contract or by the Underlying Portfolios for taxes,  
charges or fees. At the time the Contract is issued the "Right to Examine"      
provision on the cover of the Contract will specifically indicate whether the   
refund will be equal to gross payments or equal to the greater of (a) or (b) as 
set forth above.                                                                

The liability of the Variable Account under this provision is limited to the    
Owner's Accumulated Value in the Sub-Accounts on the date of cancellation. Any  
additional amounts refunded to the Owner will be paid by the Company.           

RIGHT TO CANCEL ALL OTHER CONTRACTS 

An Owner may cancel the Contract at any time within ten days after receipt of   
the Contract (or longer if required by state law) and receive a refund. In most 
states the Company will pay the Owner an amount equal to the sum of (1) the     
difference between the payment received, including fees, and any amount         
allocated to the Variable Account, and (2) the Accumulated Value of amounts     
allocated to the Variable Account as of the date the request is received. If the
Contract was purchased as an IRA or issued in a state that requires a full      
refund of the initial payment(s), the IRA cancellation right described above    
will be used. At the time the Contract is issued, the "Right to Examine"        
provision on the cover of the Contract will specifically indicate what the      
refund will be and the time period allowed to exercise the right to cancel.     

In order to cancel the Contract, the Owner must mail or deliver it to the       
Company's Service Office or to one of its authorized representatives. The       
Company will refund an amount equal to the Surrender Value plus all fees and    
charges and the Contract will be void from the beginning.                       

TELEPHONE TRANSACTIONS PRIVILEGE                                                

Subject to state law, you, or anyone you authorize, may initiate transactions   
over the telephone, unless you notify the Company of your election not to have  
this privilege. The policy of the Company and its agents and affiliates is that 
it will not be responsible for losses resulting from acting upon telephone      
requests reasonably believed to be genuine. The Company will employ reasonable  
procedures to confirm that instructions communicated by telephone are genuine;  
otherwise, the Company may be liable for any losses due to unauthorized or      
fraudulent instructions. Such procedures may include, among other things,       
requiring some form of personal identification prior to acting upon instructions
received by telephone. All telephone instructions are tape-recorded. The Company
reserves the right to modify or discontinue this privilege at any time without  
prior notice.                                                                   

The Company cannot guarantee that you, or any other person you authorize, will  
always be able to reach us to complete a telephone transaction. Under these     
circumstances, you should submit your request in writing or other form          
acceptable to us.

TRANSFER PRIVILEGE 

Prior to the Annuity Date and subject to the Disruptive Trading limitations     
described above under DESCRIPTION OF THE CONTRACT, the Owner may transfer       
amounts among investment options upon written or, in most jurisdictions,        
telephone request to the Company. Transfers may be made to and among all of the 
available Sub-Accounts as long as no more than seventeen Sub-Accounts, in       
addition to the Pioneer Money Market VCT Portfolio, are utilized at any one     
time. Transfer values will be based on the Accumulated Value next computed after
receipt of the transfer request.                                                

Transfers to a Guarantee Period Account must be at least $1,000. If the amount  
to be transferred to a Guarantee Period Account is less than $1,000, the Company
may transfer that amount to the Pioneer Money Market VCT Portfolio. Transfers   
from a Guarantee Period Account prior to the expiration of the Guarantee Period 
will be subject to a Market Value Adjustment.                                   

If an Owner requests a transfer of an amount from a Sub-Account that is higher  
than the amount in the Sub-Account on the Valuation Date (for example, if a     
request is made to transfer $100 from a Sub-Account but the Accumulated Value in
the Sub-Account on the Valuation Date is only $98), the Company will transfer   
all of the Accumulated Value in the Sub-Account.                                

The first twelve transfers in a Contract year are guaranteed to be free of any  
transfer charge. The Company does not currently charge for additional transfers 
but reserves the right to assess a charge, guaranteed never to exceed $25, to   
reimburse it for the expense of processing these additional transfers. If you   
authorize periodic transfers under an Automatic Transfer option (Dollar Cost    
Averaging), or an Automatic Account Rebalancing option, the first automatic     
transfer or rebalancing under a request counts as one transfer for purposes of  
the 12 transfers guaranteed to be free of a transfer charge in each Contract    
year. Each subsequent transfer or rebalancing under that request in the same or 
a subsequent Contract year is without charge and does not reduce the remaining  
number of transfers which may be made free of charge.                           

The Owner may authorize an independent third party to transact allocations and  
transfers in accordance with an asset allocation strategy or other investment   
strategy. The Company may provide administrative or other support services to   
these independent third parties, however, the Company does not engage any third 
parties to offer allocation or other investment services under this Contract,   
does not endorse or review any allocation or transfer recommendations and is not
responsible for the investment results of such allocations or transfers         
transacted on the Owner's behalf. In addition, the Company reserves the right to
discontinue services or limit the number of Portfolios that it may provide such 
services to. The Company does not charge the Owner for providing additional     
support services.                                                               

AUTOMATIC TRANSFERS AND AUTOMATIC ACCOUNT REBALANCING OPTIONS.                  

AUTOMATIC TRANSFERS (DOLLAR COST AVERAGING) OPTION. The Owner may elect         
automatic transfers of a predetermined dollar amount, not less than $100, on a  
periodic basis (monthly, bi-monthly, quarterly, semi-annually or annually) from 
either the Fixed Account, the Sub-Account investing in the Pioneer Money Market 
VCT Portfolio or the Sub-Account investing in the Pioneer Bond VCT Portfolio    
(the "source accounts") to one or more available Sub-Accounts. Automatic        
transfers may not be made into the Fixed Account, the Guarantee Period Accounts 
or, if applicable, the Portfolio being used as the source account. If an        
automatic transfer would reduce the balance in the source account to less than  
$100, the entire balance will be transferred proportionately to the chosen      
Sub-Accounts. Automatic transfers will continue until the amount in the source  
account on a transfer date is zero or the Owner's request to terminate the      
option is received by the Company. If additional amounts are allocated to the   
source account after its balance has fallen to zero, this option will not       
restart automatically, and the Owner must provide a new request to the Company. 

To the extent permitted by law, the Company reserves the right, from time to    
time, to credit an enhanced interest rate to certain initial and/or subsequent  
payments made to the Fixed Account when it is being used as the source account  
from which to process automatic transfers. For more information, see "Enhanced
Automatic Transfer (Dollar Cost Averaging) Program" in the SAI.                 

24

P-->485BPOS28th Page of 210TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 28th
AUTOMATIC ACCOUNT REBALANCING OPTION. The Owner may request automatic           
rebalancing of Sub-Account allocations on a monthly, bi-monthly, quarterly,     
semi-annual or annual basis in accordance with percentage allocations specified 
by the Owner. As frequently as requested, the Company will review the percentage
allocations in the Portfolios and, if necessary, transfer amounts to ensure     
conformity with the designated percentage allocation mix. If the amount         
necessary to re-establish the mix on any scheduled date is less than $100, no   
transfer will be made. Automatic Account Rebalancing will continue until the    
Owner's request to terminate or change the option is received by the Company. As
such, subsequent payments allocated in a manner different from the percentage   
allocation mix in effect on the date the payment is received will be reallocated
in accordance with the existing mix on the next scheduled date unless the       
Owner's timely request to change the mix or terminate the option is received by 
the Company.                                                                    

LIMITATIONS. The Company reserves the right to limit the number of Sub-Accounts 
that may be used for automatic transfers and rebalancing, and to discontinue    
either option upon advance written notice. Currently, Dollar Cost Averaging and 
Automatic Account Rebalancing may not be in effect simultaneously. Either option
may be elected at no additional charge when the Contract is purchased or at a   
later date.                                                                     

SURRENDER 

At any time prior to the Annuity Date, the Owner may surrender the Contract and 
receive its Surrender Value less any tax withholding. The request for surrender 
must be made on Company forms. You may obtain Company forms by calling          
1-800-688-9915.                                                                 

The Owner must return the Contract and a signed, written request for surrender  
on a Company surrender form to the Service Office. The Surrender Value will be  
calculated based on the Contract's Accumulated Value as of the Valuation Date on
which the request and the Contract are received at the Service Office.          

Before the Annuity Date, a surrender charge may be deducted when a Contract is  
surrendered if payments have been credited to the Contract during the last seven
full Contract years. See CHARGES AND DEDUCTIONS. The Contract fee will be       
deducted upon surrender of the Contract.                                        

After the Annuity Date, only a Contract annuitized under a commutable period    
certain option may be surrendered. The amount payable is the commuted value of  
any unpaid installments, computed on the basis of the assumed interest rate     
incorporated in such annuity benefit payments. No surrender charge is imposed   
after the Annuity Date.                                                         

Any amount surrendered is normally payable within seven days following the      
Company's receipt of the surrender request. The Company reserves the right to   
defer surrenders and withdrawals of amounts in each Sub-Account in any period   
during which (1) trading on the New York Stock Exchange is restricted as        
determined by the SEC or such Exchange is closed for other than weekends and    
holidays, (2) the SEC has, by order, permitted such suspension, or (3) an       
emergency, as determined by the SEC, exists such that disposal of portfolio     
securities or valuation of assets of a separate account is not reasonably       
practicable.                                                                    

The Company reserves the right to defer surrenders and withdrawals of amounts   
allocated to the Company's Fixed Account and Guarantee Period Accounts for a    
period not to exceed six months.                                                

The surrender rights of Owners who are participants under Section 403(b) plans  
or who are participants in the Texas Optional Retirement Program ("Texas ORP")  
are restricted; see "Tax-Sheltered Annuities" and "Texas Optional Retirement
Program."                                                                       

For important tax consequences which may result from surrender, see FEDERAL TAX 
CONSIDERATIONS.

WITHDRAWALS 

At any time prior to the Annuity Date, an Owner may withdraw a portion of the   
Accumulated Value of his or her Contract, subject to the limits stated below.   
The request for surrender must be made on Company forms. You may obtain Company 
forms by calling 1-800-688-9915. You may also obtain a Company withdrawal form  
at our Company web site, https://cwannuity.se2.com                              

The Owner must submit to the Service Office a signed, written request for       
withdrawal on a Company withdrawal form. The written request must indicate the  
dollar amount the Owner wishes to receive and the investment options from which 
such amount is to be withdrawn. Each withdrawal must be a minimum amount of     
$100. The amount withdrawn equals the amount requested by the Owner plus any    
applicable surrender charge, as described under CHARGES AND DEDUCTIONS. In      
addition, amounts withdrawn from a Guarantee Period Account prior to the end of 
the applicable Guarantee Period will be subject to a Market Value Adjustment, as
described under GUARANTEE PERIOD ACCOUNTS.                                      

Where allocations have been made to more than one investment option, a          
percentage of the withdrawal may be allocated to each such option. A withdrawal 
from a Sub-Account will result in cancellation of a number of units equivalent  
in value to the amount withdrawn, computed as of the Valuation Date that the    
request is received at the Service Office.                                      

For important restrictions on withdrawals which are applicable to Owners who are
participants under Section 403(b) plans or under the Texas ORP, see FEDERAL TAX 
CONSIDERATIONS, "Tax-Sheltered Annuities" and "Texas Optional Retirement
Program." For important tax consequences which may result from withdrawals, see 
FEDERAL TAX CONSIDERATIONS.                                                     

SYSTEMATIC WITHDRAWALS. The Owner may elect an automatic schedule of withdrawals
(systematic withdrawals) from amounts in the Sub-Accounts and/or the Fixed      
Account on a monthly, bi-monthly, quarterly, semi-annual or annual basis.       
Systematic withdrawals from Guarantee Period Accounts are not available. The    
minimum amount of each automatic withdrawal is $100, and will be subject to any 
applicable withdrawal charges. If elected at the time of purchase, the Owner    
must designate in writing the specific dollar amount of each withdrawal and the 
percentage of this amount which should be taken from each designated Sub-Account
and/or the Fixed Account. Systematic withdrawals then will begin on the date    
indicated on the application. If elected after the issue date, the Owner may    
elect, by written request, a specific dollar amount and the percentage of this  
amount to be taken from each designated Sub-Account and/or the Fixed Account, or
the Owner may elect to withdraw a specific percentage of the Accumulated Value  
calculated as of the withdrawal dates, and may designate the percentage of this 
amount which should be taken from each account. The first withdrawal will take  
place on the date the written request is received at the Service Office or, if  
later, on a date specified by the Owner.                                        

If a withdrawal would cause the remaining Accumulated Value to be less than     
$1,000, systematic withdrawals may be discontinued. Systematic withdrawals will 
cease automatically on the Annuity Date. The Owner may change or terminate      
systematic withdrawals only by written request to the Service Office.           

LIFE EXPECTANCY DISTRIBUTIONS. Each calendar year prior to the Annuity Date, an 
Owner who also is the Annuitant may elect to make a series of systematic        
withdrawals from the Contract according to the Company's life expectancy        
distribution ("LED") option. The Owner must return by returning a properly      
signed LED request form to the Service Office.                                  

The Owner may elect monthly, bi-monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, or annual LED  
distributions, and may terminate the LED option at any time.                    

26

P-->485BPOS30th Page of 210TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 30th
If an Owner elects the Company's LED option (based upon the applicable IRS      
tables), in each calendar year a fraction of the Accumulated Value is withdrawn 
without a surrender charge based on the Owner's then life expectancy (or the    
joint life expectancy of the Owner and a beneficiary.) The numerator of the     
fraction is 1 (one) and the denominator of the fraction is the remaining life   
expectancy of the Owner, as determined annually by the Company. The resulting   
fraction, expressed as a percentage, is applied to the Accumulated Value at the 
beginning of the year to determine the amount to be distributed during the year.
Under the Company's LED option, the amount withdrawn from the Contract changes  
each year, because life expectancy changes each year that a person lives. For   
example, actuarial tables indicate that a person age 70 has a life expectancy of
16 years, but a person who attains age 86 has a life expectancy of another 6.5  
years. Where the Owner is a trust or other nonnatural person, the Owner may     
elect the LED option based on the Annuitant's life expectancy.                  

(Note: this option may not produce annual distributions that meet the definition
of "substantially equal periodic payments" as defined under Code Section 72(t). 
As such, the withdrawals may be treated by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) as
premature distributions from the Contract and may be subject to a 10% federal   
tax penalty. Owners seeking distributions over their life under this definition 
should consult their tax advisor. For more information, see FEDERAL TAX         
CONSIDERATIONS, "TAXATION OF THE CONTRACT." In addition, if the amount necessary
to meet the substantially equal periodic payment definition is greater than the 
Company's LED amount, a surrender charge may apply to the amount in excess of   
the LED amount.)                                                                

The Company may discontinue or change the LED option at any time, but not with  
respect to election of the option made prior to the date of any change in the   
LED option.                                                                     

DEATH BENEFIT 

In the event that the Annuitant, Owner or Joint Owner, if applicable, dies while
the Contract is in force, the Company will pay the beneficiary a death benefit, 
except where the Contract is continued as provided below in "THE SPOUSE OF THE
OWNER AS BENEFICIARY." The amount of the death benefit and the time requirements
for receipt of payment may vary depending upon whether the Annuitant or an Owner
dies first, and whether death occurs prior to or after the Annuity Date.        

DEATH OF THE ANNUITANT PRIOR TO THE ANNUITY DATE. At the death of the Annuitant 
(including an Owner who is also the Annuitant), the death benefit is equal to   
the greatest of:                                                                

(a)  the Accumulated Value on the Valuation Date that the Company receives the  
death certificate and all necessary claim paperwork, increased by any 
positive Market Value Adjustment;                                     

(b)  gross payments compounded daily at an effective annual yield of 5% starting
on the date each payment is applied and continuing throughout that    
   payment's entire accumulation phase, decreased proportionately to reflect
withdrawals;                                                          

(c)  the death benefit that would have been payable on the most recent Contract 
anniversary, increased for subsequent payments and decreased          
proportionately for subsequent withdrawals.                           

For each withdrawal under (b) or (c), the proportionate reduction is calculated 
as follows:                                                                     

Amount of the Withdrawal
 -----------------------------------------------------
 Accumulated Value immediately prior to the withdrawal

This guaranteed death benefit works in the following way assuming no withdrawals
are made. On the first anniversary, the death benefit will be equal to the      
greater of:                                                                     

(a)  the Accumulated Value on the Valuation Date that the Company receives the  
death certificate and all necessary claim paperwork (increased by any 
positive Market Value Adjustment);                                    

27

P-->485BPOS31st Page of 210TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 31st
(b)  gross payments compounded daily at an effective annual yield of 5%.        

The higher of (a) or (b) will then be locked in until the second anniversary, at
which time the death benefit will be equal to the greatest of:                  

(a)  the Contract's then current Accumulated Value increased by any positive    
Market Value Adjustment;                                              

(b)  gross payments compounded daily at an effective annual yield of 5%;        

(c)  the locked-in value of the death benefit at the first anniversary.         

The greatest of (a), (b) or (c) will be locked in until the next Contract       
anniversary. This calculation will then be repeated on each anniversary while   
the Contract remains in force and prior to the Annuity Date. As noted above, the
values of (b) and (c) will be decreased proportionately if withdrawals are      
taken. See APPENDIX C -- THE DEATH BENEFIT for specific examples of death       
benefit calculations.                                                           

DEATH OF AN OWNER WHO IS NOT ALSO THE ANNUITANT PRIOR TO THE ANNUITY DATE. If an
Owner who is not also the Annuitant dies before the Annuity Date, the death     
benefit will be the Accumulated Value increased by any positive Market Value    
Adjustment. The death benefit never will be reduced by a negative Market Value  
Adjustment.                                                                     

PAYMENT OF THE DEATH BENEFIT PRIOR TO THE ANNUITY DATE. The death benefit       
generally will be paid to the beneficiary in one sum within seven business days 
of the receipt of due proof of death at the Service Office. Instead of payment  
in one sum, the beneficiary may, by written request, elect to:                  

(1)  defer distribution of the death benefit for a period no more than five     
years from the date of death; or                                      

(2)  receive distributions over the life of the beneficiary for a period certain
not extending beyond the beneficiary's life expectancy, with annuity  
benefit payments beginning one year from the date of death.           

However, if the Owner has specified a death benefit annuity option, the death   
benefit will be paid out accordingly. Any death benefit annuity option specified
by the Owner must comply with the requirements set forth in paragraph (2) above.

If distribution of the death benefit is deferred under (1) or (2), any value in 
the Guarantee Period Accounts will be transferred to the Sub-Account investing  
in the Pioneer Money Market VCT Portfolio. The excess, if any, of the death     
benefit over the Accumulated Value also will be transferred to the Sub-Account  
investing in the Pioneer Money Market VCT Portfolio. The beneficiary may, by    
written request, effect transfers and withdrawals during the deferral period and
prior to annuitization under (2), but may not make additional payments. The     
death benefit will reflect any earnings or losses experienced during the        
deferral period. If there are multiple beneficiaries, the consent of all is     
required.                                                                       

With respect to the death benefit, the Accumulated Value will be based on the   
unit values next computed after receipt of due proof of death.                  

DEATH OF THE ANNUITANT ON OR AFTER THE ANNUITY DATE. If the Annuitant's death   
occurs on or after the Annuity Date but before completion of all guaranteed     
annuity benefit payments, any unpaid amounts or installments will be paid to the
beneficiary. The Company must pay out the remaining payments at least as rapidly
as under the payment option in effect on the date of the Annuitant's death.     

THE SPOUSE OF THE OWNER AS BENEFICIARY 

The Owner's spouse, if named as the sole beneficiary, may by written request    
continue the Contract rather than receiving payment of the death benefit. Upon  
such election, the spouse will become the Owner and Annuitant subject to the    
following: (1) any value in the Guarantee Period Accounts will be transferred to
the Sub-Account investing in the Pioneer Money Market VCT Portfolio and (2) the 
excess, if any, of the death benefit over the Contract's Accumulated Value also 
will be transferred to the Sub-Account investing in the Pioneer Money Market VCT
Portfolio. The resulting value will never be subject to a surrender charge when 
withdrawn. The new Owner may also make additional payments; however, a surrender
charge will apply to these amounts if they are withdrawn before they have been  
invested in the Contract for at least seven years. All                          

28

P-->485BPOS32nd Page of 210TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 32nd
other rights and benefits provided in the Contract will continue, except that   
any subsequent spouse of such new Owner will not be entitled to continue the    
Contract when the new Owner dies.                                               

OPTIONAL ENHANCED EARNINGS RIDER 

The Enhanced Earnings Rider (EER) may have been elected at issue in most        
jurisdictions as long as the Annuitant had not yet attained age 76. The Rider   
provides for additional amounts to be paid to the beneficiary under certain     
circumstances in the event that the Annuitant dies prior to the Annuity Date.   
For specific charges see "OPTIONAL RIDER CHARGES" under CHARGES AND DEDUCTIONS. 

The Company reserves the right to terminate the availability of the EER at any  
time; however, such a termination would not effect Riders issued prior to the   
termination date.                                                               

CONDITIONS FOR PAYMENT OF THE EER BENEFIT                                       

For any benefit to be payable under the EER, certain conditions must be met, as 
follows:                                                                        

(1)  The Annuitant's death must occur prior to the Annuity Date; and            

(2)  The difference between (a) and (b) must be greater than zero, where (a) is 
   the Accumulated Value and (b) is gross payments not previously withdrawn.
IF (a) MINUS (b) IS ZERO OR LESS, NO BENEFIT WILL BE PAYABLE.         

Under the EER, Accumulated Value is determined on the Valuation Date on which   
due proof of death and all necessary documentation have been received at the    
Service Office.                                                                 

For purposes of the EER, withdrawals will be considered withdrawn from earnings 
first and then withdrawn from gross payments on a last-in, first-out basis.     
Therefore, the value of the EER largely depends on the amount of earnings that  
accumulate under the Contract. If you expect to withdraw the earnings from your 
Accumulated Value, electing the EER may not be appropriate. Your financial      
representative can help you determine if the EER is appropriate in your         
circumstances.                                                                  

AMOUNT OF EER BENEFIT                                                           

ANNUITANT'S AGE AT ISSUE - 0 TO 65 - If a benefit is payable under the EER and  
the Contract was issued prior to the Annuitant's 66th birthday, it will be equal
to the LESSER of:                                                               

(1)  80% of gross payments not previously withdrawn. (For purposes of this      
    calculation only, except for the Initial Payment, gross payments shall not
include payments made under the Contract during the 12-month period   
immediately prior to the date of death.); or                          

(2)  40% of the difference between the Accumulated Value and gross payments not 
previously withdrawn.                                                 

ANNUITANT'S AGE AT ISSUE - 66 TO 70 - If a benefit is payable under the EER and 
the Contract was issued on or after the Annuitant's 66th birthday and before his
or her 71st birthday, it will be equal to the LESSER of:                        

(1)  40% of gross payments not previously withdrawn. (For purposes of this      
    calculation only, except for the Initial Payment, gross payments shall not
include payments made under the Contract during the 12-month period   
immediately prior to the date of death.); or                          

(2)  40% of the difference between the Accumulated Value and gross payments not 
previously withdrawn.                                                 

ANNUITANT'S AGE AT ISSUE - 71 TO 75 - If a benefit is payable under the EER and 
the Contract was issued on or after the Annuitant's 71st birthday and before his
or her 76th birthday, it will be equal to the LESSER of:

(1)  25% of gross payments not previously withdrawn. (For purposes of this      
    calculation only, except for the Initial Payment, gross payments shall not
include payments made under the Contract during the 12-month period   
immediately prior to the date of death.); or                          

(2)  25% of the difference between the Accumulated Value and gross payments not 
previously withdrawn.                                                 

The EER benefit shall be paid in the same manner that the death benefit is paid 
prior to the Annuity Date.                                                      

EXAMPLES                                                                        

EXAMPLE 1. Assume that the Annuitant is 67 years old at the time the Contract is
issued and the Enhanced Earnings Rider is selected. The Owner makes an initial  
payment of $100,000 and does not make any subsequent payments or take any       
withdrawals. Further assume that the Annuitant dies five years later and on the 
date that due proof of death and all necessary documentation are received by the
Company the Accumulated Value is equal to $150,000.                             

The EER benefit on that date is equal to the LESSER of:                         

(1)  40% of the gross payments (not previously withdrawn) made to the Contract  
 (excluding payments made in the 12 months prior to the date of death) =
(40% x 100,000) = $40,000; or                                         

(2)  40% of the difference between the Accumulated Value and the gross payments 
(not previously withdrawn) made to the contract = (40% x (150,000 -   
100,000)) = $20,000                                                   

The EER benefit is equal to $20,000 under (2), which is the lesser of $40,000   
(40% x 100,000) and $20,000 (40% x (150,000 - 100,000)).                        

EXAMPLE 2. Assume that the Annuitant is 67 years old at the time the Contract is
issued and the Enhanced Earnings Rider is selected. The Owner makes an initial  
payment of $100,000 and does not make any subsequent payments or take any       
withdrawals. Further assume that the Annuitant dies ten years later and on the  
date that due proof of death and all necessary documentation are received by the
Company the Accumulated Value is equal to $250,000.                             

The EER benefit on that date is equal to the LESSER of:                         

(1)  40% of the gross payments (not previously withdrawn) made to the Contract  
 (excluding payments made in the 12 months prior to the date of death) =
(40% x $100,000) = $40,000; or                                        

(2)  40% of the difference between the Accumulated Value and the gross payments 
(not previously withdrawn) made to the Contract = (40% x ($250,000 -  
$100,000)) = $60,000                                                  

The EER benefit is equal to $40,000 under (1), which is the lesser of $40,000   
(40% x $100,000) and $60,000 (40% x ($250,000 - $100,000)).                     

EXAMPLE 3. Assume that the Annuitant is 67 years old at the time the Contract is
issued and the Enhanced Earnings Rider is selected. The Owner makes an initial  
payment of $100,000 and does not make any subsequent payments. Further assume   
that the Owner takes a $15,000 withdrawal and that the Accumulated Value was    
equal to $150,000 before the withdrawal was taken. Since there was $50,000 of   
earnings in the Contract at the time of withdrawal, for purposes of the Enhanced
Earnings Rider the withdrawal is considered to be a withdrawal of $15,000 of    
earnings. Immediately after the withdrawal, the Accumulated Value is $135,000   
and the gross payments (not previously withdrawn) is $100,000.

Immediately after the withdrawal, the EER benefit is equal to the LESSER of:    

(1)  40% of the gross payments (not previously withdrawn) made to the Contract  
 (excluding payments made in the 12 months prior to the date of death) =
(40% x $100,000) = $40,000; or                                        

(2)  40% of the difference between the Accumulated Value and the gross payments 
(not previously withdrawn) made to the contract = (40% x ($135,000 -  
$100,000)) = $14,000                                                  

The EER benefit is equal to $14,000 under (2), which is the lesser of $40,000   
(40% x 100,000) and $14,000 (40% x ($135,000 - $100,000)).                      

EXAMPLE 4. Assume that the Annuitant is 67 years old at the time the Contract is
issued and the Enhanced Earnings Rider is selected. The Owner makes an initial  
payment of $100,000 and does not make any subsequent payments. Further assume   
that the Owner takes a $65,000 withdrawal and that the Accumulated Value was    
equal to $150,000 before the withdrawal was taken. Since there was $50,000 of   
earnings in the Contract at the time of the withdrawal, for purposes of the     
Enhanced Earnings Rider the withdrawal of $65,000 is considered to be a         
withdrawal of $50,000 earnings and $15,000 of gross payments. Immediately after 
the withdrawal, the Accumulated Value is $85,000 and the gross payments (not    
previously withdrawn) is $85,000.                                               

Immediately after the withdrawal, the EER benefit is equal to the LESSER of:    

(1)  40% of the gross payments (not previously withdrawn) made to the Contract  
 (excluding payments made in the 12 months prior to the date of death) =
(40% x $85,000) = $34,000; or                                         

(2)  40% of the difference between the Accumulated Value and the gross payments 
(not previously withdrawn) made to the contract = (40% x ($85,000 -   
$85,000)) = $0                                                        

The EER benefit is equal to $0 under (2), which is the lesser of $34,000 (40% x 
$85,000) and $0 (40% x ($85,000 - $85,000)).                                    

TERMINATING THE EER                                                             

Once the EER is chosen, it cannot be discontinued unless the underlying contract
is surrendered, annuitized, or a death benefit is payable. The EER will         
terminate on the earliest of the following:                                     

1.   the Annuity Date;                                                          

2.   the date the Contract is surrendered;                                      

3.   the date the Company determines a death benefit is payable; or             

4.   if the deceased Owner's spouse, who is the sole beneficiary, continues the 
contract.                                                             

If the payment of the death benefit is deferred under the Contract or if the    
Contract is continued by the deceased Owner's spouse, the amount of the EER     
benefit, if any, will be applied to the Contract through an allocation to the   
Sub-Account investing in the Pioneer Money Market VCT Portfolio and the EER will
terminate.                                                                      

ASSIGNMENT                                                                      

The Contract, other than one sold in connection with certain qualified plans,   
may be assigned by the Owner at any time prior to the Annuity Date and while the
Annuitant is alive (see FEDERAL TAX CONSIDERATIONS). The Company will not be    
deemed to have knowledge of an assignment unless it is made in writing on a     
Company approved form and filed at the Service Office. The Company will not     
assume                                                                          

31

P-->485BPOS35th Page of 210TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 35th
responsibility for determining the validity of any assignment. If an assignment 
of the Contract is in effect on the Annuity Date, the Company reserves the right
to pay to the assignee, in one sum, that portion of the Surrender Value of the  
Contract to which the assignee appears to be entitled. The Company will pay the 
balance, if any, in one sum to the Owner in full settlement of all liability    
under the Contract. The interest of the Owner and of any beneficiary will be    
subject to any assignment.                                                      

ELECTING THE FORM OF ANNUITY AND THE ANNUITY DATE                               

The Owner selects the Annuity Date. To the extent permitted by law, the Annuity 
Date may be the first day of any month (1) before the Annuitant's 85th birthday,
if the Annuitant's age on the issue date of the Contract is 75 or under, or (2) 
within ten years from the issue date of the Contract and before the Annuitant's 
90th birthday, if the Annuitant's age on the issue date is between 76 and 90.   
The Owner may elect to change the Annuity Date by sending a request to the      
Service Office at least one month before the Annuity Date. The new Annuity Date 
must be the first day of any month occurring before the Annuitant's 90th        
birthday, and must be within the life expectancy of the Annuitant. The Company  
shall determine such life expectancy at the time a change in Annuity Date is    
requested. In no event will the latest possible annuitization age exceed 90.    

If the Annuity Date under a non-qualified Contract is deferred until the Owner  
reaches an age that is significantly beyond the Owner's life expectancy, it is  
possible that the Contract will not be considered an annuity for federal tax    
purposes. In addition, the Internal Revenue Code ("the Code") and the terms of  
qualified plans impose limitations on the age at which annuity benefit payments 
may commence and the type of annuity option selected. The Owner should carefully
review the selection of the Annuity Date with his/her tax adviser. See FEDERAL  
TAX CONSIDERATIONS for further information.                                     

Subject to certain restrictions described below, the Owner has the right (1) to 
select the annuity option under which annuity benefit payments are to be made,  
and (2) to determine whether payments are to be made on a fixed basis, a        
variable basis, or a combination fixed and variable basis. Certain annuity      
options may be commutable or noncommutable. A commutable option provides the    
Owner with the right to request a lump sum payment of any remaining balance     
after annuity payments have commenced. Under a noncommutable option, the Owner  
may not request a lump sum payment. Annuity benefit payments are determined     
according to the annuity tables in the Contract, by the annuity option selected,
and by the investment performance of the account(s) selected. See "ANNUITY
BENEFIT PAYMENTS AND ACCUMULATION UNIT CALCULATION" in the SAI.                 

To the extent a fixed annuity payout option is selected, Accumulated Value will 
be transferred to the Fixed Account of the Company, and the annuity benefit     
payments will be fixed in amount. SEE APPENDIX A - MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE   
FIXED ACCOUNT.                                                                  

Under a variable annuity payout option, a payment equal to the value of the     
fixed number of Annuity Units in the Sub-Account(s) is made monthly, quarterly, 
semi-annually or annually. Since the value of an Annuity Unit in a Sub-Account  
will reflect the investment performance of the Sub-Account, the amount of each  
annuity benefit payment will vary.                                              

The annuity option(s) selected must produce an initial payment of at least $50  
(a lower amount may be required in some states). The Company reserves the right 
to increase this minimum amount. If the annuity option(s) selected do(es) not   
produce an initial payment which meets this minimum, a single payment may be    
made. Once the Company begins making annuity benefit payments, the Annuitant    
cannot make withdrawals or surrender the annuity benefit, except where a        
commutable period certain option has been elected. Beneficiaries entitled to    
receive remaining payments under either a commutable or noncommutable period    
certain option may elect instead to receive a lump sum settlement. See          
"DESCRIPTION OF VARIABLE ANNUITY PAYOUT OPTIONS," below.                        

If the Owner does not elect an option, a variable life annuity with periodic    
payments guaranteed for ten years will be purchased. Changes in either the      
Annuity Date or annuity option can be made up to one month prior to the Annuity 
Date.

DESCRIPTION OF VARIABLE ANNUITY PAYOUT OPTIONS 

The Company provides the variable annuity payout options described below.       
Currently, variable annuity payout options may be funded through the            
Sub-Accounts investing in the Pioneer Fund VCT Portfolio, Pioneer Independence  
VCT Portfolio, Pioneer International Value VCT Portfolio, and the Pioneer Bond  
VCT Portfolio.                                                                  

The Company also provides these same options funded through the Fixed Account   
(fixed annuity payout). Regardless of how payments were allocated during the    
accumulation period, any of the variable payout options or the fixed payout     
options may be selected, or any of the variable payout options may be selected  
in combination with any of the fixed payout options. Other annuity options may  
be offered by the Company. IRS regulations may not permit certain of the        
available annuity payout options when used in connection with certain qualified 
Contracts.                                                                      

VARIABLE LIFE ANNUITY WITH PAYMENTS GUARANTEED FOR TEN YEARS. This variable     
annuity is payable periodically during the lifetime of the Annuitant with the   
guarantee that if the Annuitant should die before all payments have been made,  
the remaining annuity benefit payments will continue to the beneficiary.        

VARIABLE LIFE ANNUITY PAYABLE PERIODICALLY DURING LIFETIME OF THE ANNUITANT     
ONLY. This variable annuity is payable during the Annuitant's life. It would be 
possible under this option for the Annuitant to receive only one annuity benefit
payment if he/she dies prior to the due date of the second annuity benefit      
payment, two annuity benefit payments if he/she dies before the due date of the 
third annuity benefit payment, and so on. Payments will continue, however,      
during the Annuitant's lifetime, no matter how long he or she lives.            

UNIT REFUND VARIABLE LIFE ANNUITY. This is an annuity payable periodically      
during the lifetime of the Annuitant with the guarantee that if (1) exceeds (2),
then periodic variable annuity benefit payments will continue to the beneficiary
until the number of such payments equals the number determined in (1).          

Where:  (1)  is the dollar amount of the Accumulated Value at annuitization     
divided by the dollar amount of the first payment, and

(2)  is the number of payments paid prior to the death of the   
Annuitant.                                            

JOINT AND SURVIVOR VARIABLE LIFE ANNUITY. This variable annuity is payable      
jointly to the Annuitant and another individual during their joint lifetime, and
then continues thereafter during the lifetime of the survivor. The amount of    
each payment to the survivor is based on the same number of Annuity Units which 
applied during the joint lifetime of the two payees. One of the payees must be  
either the person designated as the Annuitant under the Contract or the         
beneficiary. There is no minimum number of payments under this option.          

JOINT AND TWO-THIRDS SURVIVOR VARIABLE LIFE ANNUITY. This variable annuity is   
payable jointly to the Annuitant and another individual during their joint      
lifetime, and then continues thereafter during the lifetime of the survivor. The
amount of each periodic payment to the survivor, however, is based upon         
two-thirds of the number of Annuity Units which applied during the joint        
lifetime of the two payees. One of the payees must be the person designated as  
the Annuitant under the Contract or the beneficiary. There is no minimum number 
of payments under this option.                                                  

PERIOD CERTAIN VARIABLE ANNUITY. This variable annuity has periodic payments for
a stipulated number of years ranging from one to 30. If the Annuitant dies      
before the end of the period, remaining payments will continue to be paid. A    
fixed period certain annuity may be either commutable or noncommutable. A       
variable period certain annuity is automatically commutable.                    

It should be noted that the period certain option does not involve a life       
contingency. In computing payments under this option, the Company deducts a     
charge for annuity rate guarantees, which includes a factor for mortality risks.
Although not contractually required to do so, the Company currently follows a   
practice of permitting persons receiving payments under a period certain option 
to elect to convert to a variable annuity involving a life contingency. The     
Company may discontinue or change this practice at any time, but not with       
respect to election of the option made prior to the date of any change in this  
practice.

ANNUITY BENEFIT PAYMENTS 

DETERMINATION OF THE FIRST VARIABLE ANNUITY BENEFIT PAYMENT. The amount of the  
first monthly payment depends upon the selected variable annuity option, the sex
(however, see "NORRIS DECISION" below) and age of the Annuitant, and the value  
of the amount applied under the annuity option ("annuity value"). The Contract  
provides annuity rates that determine the dollar amount of the first periodic   
payment under each variable annuity option for each $1,000 of applied value.    
From time to time, the Company may offer its Owners both fixed and variable     
annuity rates more favorable than those contained in the Contract. Any such     
rates will be applied uniformly to all Owners of the same class.                

The dollar amount of the first periodic annuity benefit payment is calculated   
based upon the type of annuity option chosen, as follows:                       

-    For life annuity options and noncommutable fixed period certain  
    options of ten years or more, the dollar amount is determined by
          multiplying (1) the Accumulated Value applied under that option (after
       application of any Market Value Adjustment and less premium tax, if
     any) divided by $1,000, by (2) the applicable amount of the first
monthly payment per $1,000 of value.                        

    -    For commutable period certain options, any noncommutable fixed period
          certain option of less than ten years, and all variable period certain
   options, the dollar amount is determined by multiplying (1) the
         Surrender Value less premium taxes, if any, applied under that option
      (after application of any Market Value Adjustment and less premium
       tax, if any) divided by $1,000, by (2) the applicable amount of the
first monthly payment per $1,000 of value.                  

   -    For a death benefit annuity, the annuity value will be the amount of
the death benefit.                                          

The first periodic annuity benefit payment is based upon the Accumulated Value  
as of a date not more than four weeks preceding the date that the first annuity 
benefit payment is due. The Company transmits variable annuity benefit payments 
for receipt by the payee by the first of a month. Variable annuity benefit      
payments are currently based on unit values as of the 15th day of the preceding 
month.                                                                          

THE ANNUITY UNIT. On and after the Annuity Date, the Annuity Unit is a measure  
of the value of the monthly annuity benefit payments under a variable annuity   
option. The value of an Annuity Unit in each Sub-Account initially was set at   
$1.00. The value of an Annuity Unit under a Sub-Account on any Valuation Date   
thereafter is equal to the value of such unit on the immediately preceding      
Valuation Date, multiplied by the net investment factor of the Sub-Account for  
the current Valuation Period and divided by the assumed interest rate for the   
current Valuation Period The assumed interest rate, discussed below, is         
incorporated in the variable annuity options offered in the Contract.           

DETERMINATION OF THE NUMBER OF ANNUITY UNITS. The dollar amount of the first    
variable annuity benefit payment is divided by the value of an Annuity Unit of  
the selected Sub-Account(s) to determine the number of Annuity Units represented
by the first payment. This number of Annuity Units remains fixed under all      
annuity options except the joint and two-thirds survivor annuity option.        

DOLLAR AMOUNT OF SUBSEQUENT VARIABLE ANNUITY BENEFIT PAYMENTS. The dollar amount
of each periodic variable annuity benefit payment after the first will vary with
the value of the Annuity Units of the selected Sub-Account(s). The dollar amount
of each subsequent variable annuity benefit payment is determined by multiplying
the fixed number of Annuity Units (derived from the dollar amount of the first  
payment, as described above) with respect to a Sub-Account by the value of an   
Annuity Unit of that Sub-Account on the applicable Valuation Date.              

The variable annuity options offered by the Company are based on a 3.5% assumed 
interest rate, which affects the amounts of the variable annuity benefit        
payments. Variable annuity benefit payments with respect to a Sub-Account will  
increase over periods when the actual net investment result of the Sub-Account  
exceeds the equivalent of the assumed interest rate. Variable annuity benefit   
payments will decrease over periods when the actual net investment results are  
less than the equivalent of the assumed interest rate.                          

For an illustration of a calculation of a variable annuity benefit payment using
a hypothetical example, see "ANNUITY BENEFIT PAYMENTS AND ACCUMULATION UNIT
CALCULATION" in the SAI.

NORRIS DECISION 

In the case of ARIZONA GOVERNING COMMITTEE V. NORRIS, the United States Supreme 
Court ruled that, in connection with retirement benefit options offered under   
certain employer-sponsored employee benefit plans, annuity options based on     
sex-distinct actuarial tables are not permissible under Title VII of the Civil  
Rights Act of 1964. The ruling requires that benefits derived from contributions
paid into a plan after August 1, 1983 be calculated without regard to the sex of
the employee. Annuity benefits attributable to payments received by the Company 
under a Contract issued in connection with an employer-sponsored benefit plan   
affected by the NORRIS decision will be based on the greater of (1) the         
Company's unisex non-guaranteed current annuity option rates, or (2) the        
guaranteed unisex rates described in such Contract, regardless of whether the   
Annuitant is male or female.                                                    

COMPUTATION OF VALUES 

THE ACCUMULATION UNIT. Each net payment is allocated to the investment options  
selected by the Owner. Allocations to the Sub-Accounts are credited to the      
Contract in the form of Accumulation Units. Accumulation Units are credited     
separately for each Sub-Account. The number of Accumulation Units of each       
Sub-Account credited to the Contract is equal to the portion of the net payment 
allocated to the Sub-Account, divided by the dollar value of the applicable     
Accumulation Unit as of the Valuation Date the payment is received at the       
Service Office. The number of Accumulation Units resulting from each payment    
will remain fixed unless changed by a subsequent split of Accumulation Unit     
value, a transfer, a withdrawal or surrender. The dollar value of an            
Accumulation Unit of each Sub-Account varies from Valuation Date to Valuation   
Date based on the investment experience of that Sub-Account, and will reflect   
the investment performance, expenses and charges of its Underlying Portfolios.  
The value of an Accumulation Unit was set at $1.00 on the first Valuation Date  
for each Sub-Account.                                                           

Allocations to the Guarantee Period Accounts and the Fixed Account are not      
converted into Accumulation Units, but are credited interest at a rate          
periodically set by the Company. See GUARANTEE PERIOD ACCOUNTS and APPENDIX A --
MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE FIXED ACCOUNT.                                       

The Accumulated Value under the Contract is determined by (1) multiplying the   
number of Accumulation Units in each Sub-Account by the value of an Accumulation
Unit of that Sub-Account on the Valuation Date, (2) adding the products, and (3)
adding the amount of the accumulations in the Fixed Account and Guarantee Period
Accounts, if any.                                                               

NET INVESTMENT FACTOR. The Net Investment Factor is an index that measures the  
investment performance of a Sub-Account from one Valuation Period to the next.  
This factor is equal to 1.000000 plus the result from dividing (1) by (2) and   
subtracting the sum of (3) and (4) where:                                       

(1)  is the investment income of a Sub-Account for the Valuation Period,        
including realized or unrealized capital gains and losses during the  
Valuation Period, adjusted for provisions made for taxes, if any;     

(2)  is the value of that Sub-Account's assets at the beginning of the Valuation
Period;                                                               

(3)  is a charge for mortality and expense risks equal to 1.25% on an annual    
basis of the daily value of the Sub-Account's assets; and             

(4)  is an administrative charge equal to 0.15% on an annual basis of the daily 
value of the Sub-Account's assets.                                    

The dollar value of an Accumulation Unit as of a given Valuation Date is        
determined by multiplying the dollar value of the corresponding Accumulation    
Unit as of the immediately preceding Valuation Date by the appropriate net      
investment factor.                                                              

For an illustration of an Accumulation Unit calculation using a hypothetical    
example see "Annuity Benefit Payments" in the SAI.

CHARGES AND DEDUCTIONS

Deductions under the Contract and charges against the assets of the Sub-Accounts
are described below. Other deductions and expenses paid out of the assets of the
Underlying Portfolios are described in the prospectuses and SAIs for the        
Underlying Portfolios.                                                          

VARIABLE ACCOUNT DEDUCTIONS                                                     

MORTALITY AND EXPENSE RISK CHARGE. The Company assesses a charge against the    
assets of each Sub-Account to compensate for certain mortality and expense risks
it has assumed. The charge is imposed during both the accumulation phase and the
annuity payout phase. The mortality risk arises from the Company's guarantee    
that it will make annuity benefit payments in accordance with annuity rate      
provisions established at the time the Contract is issued for the life of the   
Annuitant (or in accordance with the annuity payout option selected), no matter 
how long the Annuitant (or other payee) lives and no matter how long all        
Annuitants as a class live. Therefore, the mortality charge is deducted during  
the annuity payout phase on all Contracts, including those that do not involve a
life contingency, even though the Company does not bear direct mortality risk   
with respect to variable annuity settlement options that do not involve life    
contingencies. The expense risk arises from the Company's guarantee that the    
charges it makes will not exceed the limits described in the Contract and in    
this Prospectus.                                                                

If the charge for mortality and expense risks is not sufficient to cover actual 
mortality experience and expenses, the Company will absorb the losses. If       
expenses are less than the amounts provided to the Company by the charge, the   
difference will be a profit to the Company. To the extent this charge results in
a profit to the Company, such profit will be available for use by the Company   
for, among other things, the payment of distribution, sales and other expenses. 

The mortality and expense risk charge is assessed daily at an annual rate of    
1.25% of each Sub-Account's assets. This charge may not be increased. Since     
mortality and expense risks involve future contingencies which are not subject  
to precise determination in advance, it is not feasible to identify specifically
the portion of the charge which is applicable to each. The Company estimates    
that a reasonable allocation might be 0.80% for mortality risk and 0.45% for    
expense risk.                                                                   

ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE CHARGE. The Company assesses each Sub-Account with a     
daily charge equal to an annual rate of 0.15% of the average daily net assets of
the Sub-Account. This charge may not be increased. The charge is imposed during 
both the accumulation phase and the annuity payout phase. The daily             
administrative expense charge is assessed to help defray administrative expenses
actually incurred in the administration of the Sub-Account, without profits.    
There is no direct relationship, however, between the amount of administrative  
expenses imposed on a given Contract and the amount of expenses actually        
attributable to that Contract.                                                  

Deductions for the Contract fee (described below under "CONTRACT FEE") and for  
the administrative expense charge are designed to reimburse the Company for the 
cost of administration and related expenses and are not expected to be a source 
of profit. The administrative functions and expense assumed by the Company in   
connection with the Variable Account and the Contract include, but are not      
limited to, clerical, accounting, actuarial and legal services, rent, postage,  
telephone, office equipment and supplies, expenses of preparing and printing    
registration statements, expense of preparing and typesetting prospectuses and  
the cost of printing prospectuses not allocable to sales expense, filing and    
other fees.                                                                     

OTHER CHARGES. Because the Sub-Accounts purchase shares of the Underlying       
Portfolios, the value of the net assets of the Sub-Accounts will reflect the    
investment advisory fee and other expenses incurred by the Underlying           
Portfolios. Management fee waivers and/or reimbursements may be in effect for   
certain or all of the Underlying Portfolios. The prospectuses and SAIs of the   
Underlying Portfolios contain additional information concerning expenses of the 
Underlying Portfolios and should be read in conjunction with the Prospectus.

CONTRACT FEE 

A $30 Contract fee is deducted on the Contract anniversary date and upon full   
surrender of the Contract if the Accumulated Value on any of these dates is less
than $50,000. The Contract fee is currently waived for Contracts issued to and  
maintained by the trustee of a 401(k) plan. The Company reserves the right to   
impose a Contract Fee up to $30 on Contracts issued to 401(k) plans but only    
with respect to Contracts issued after the date the waiver is no longer         
available. Where amounts have been allocated to more than one investment option,
a percentage of the total Contract fee will be deducted from the value in each. 
The portion of the charge deducted from each investment option will be equal to 
the percentage which the value in that option bears to the Accumulated Value    
under the Contract. The deduction of the Contract fee from a Sub-Account will   
result in cancellation of a number of Accumulation Units equal in value to the  
percentage of the charge deducted from that Sub-Account.                        

Where permitted by law, the Contract fee also may be waived for Contracts where,
on the date of issue, either the Owner or the Annuitant is within the following 
classes of individuals:                                                         

(1)  employees and registered representatives of any broker-dealer which has    
entered into a sales agreement with the Company to sell the Contract; 

(2)  employees of the Company, its affiliates and subsidiaries;                 

(3)  officers, directors, trustees and employees of any of the Portfolios;      

(4)  investment managers or sub-advisers; and                                   

(5)  the spouses of and immediate family members residing in the same household 
with such eligible persons.                                           

"Immediate family members" means children, siblings, parents and grandparents.

OPTIONAL RIDER CHARGES 

Subject to state availability, the Company offers an optional Enhanced Earnings 
Rider that the Owner may elect at issue if the Annuitant has not yet attained   
age 76. A separate monthly charge is made for the Rider through a pro-rata      
reduction of the Accumulated Value of the Sub-Accounts, the Fixed Account and   
the Guarantee Period Accounts. The pro-rata reduction is based on the relative  
value that the Accumulation Units of the Sub-Accounts, the dollar amounts in the
Fixed Account and the dollar amounts in the Guarantee Period Accounts bear to   
the total Accumulated Value.                                                    

The applicable monthly charge for the Enhanced Earnings Rider is equal to the   
Accumulated Value on the last day of each month within which the Rider has been 
in effect multiplied by 1/12th of 0.20%. For a description of the Rider, see    
"OPTIONAL ENHANCED EARNINGS RIDER" under DESCRIPTION OF THE CONTRACT.           

If you elected one of the following riders prior to their discontinuance on     
1/31/02, the annual charge is:                                                  

 Optional Minimum Guaranteed Annuity Payout (M-GAP) Rider with a   0.25%
ten-year waiting period:                                        

 Optional Minimum Guaranteed Annuity Payout (M-GAP) Rider with a   0.15%
fifteen-year waiting period:                                    

For more information about the M-GAP Rider, see "DISCONTINUATION OF THE OPTIONAL
MINIMUM GUARANTEED ANNUITY PAYOUT (M-GAP) RIDER" in the Statement of Additional 
Information.                                                                    

PREMIUM TAXES 

Some states and municipalities impose a premium tax on variable annuity         
contracts. State premium taxes currently range up to 3.5%. The Company makes a  
charge for state and municipal premium taxes, when applicable, and deducts the  
amount paid as a premium tax charge. The current practice of the Company is to  
deduct the premium tax charge in one of two ways:                               

37

P-->485BPOS41st Page of 210TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 41st
(1)  if the premium tax was paid by the Company when payments were received, the
     premium tax charge may be deducted on a pro-rata basis when withdrawals are
made, upon surrender of the Contract, or when annuity benefit payments
 begin (the Company reserves the right instead to deduct the premium tax
charge for these Contracts at the time the payments are received); or 

(2)  the premium tax charge is deducted in total when annuity benefit payments  
begin.                                                                

In no event will a deduction be taken before the Company has incurred a tax     
liability under applicable state law.                                           

If no amount for premium tax was deducted at the time the payment was received, 
but subsequently tax is determined to be due prior to the Annuity Date, the     
Company reserves the right to deduct the premium tax from the Contract's        
Accumulated Value at the time such determination is made.                       

SURRENDER CHARGE 

No charge for sales expense is deducted from payments at the time the payments  
are made. A surrender charge, however, is deducted from the Accumulated Value in
the case of surrender and/or a withdrawal or at the time annuity benefit        
payments begin, within certain time limits described below.                     

For purposes of determining the surrender charge, the Accumulated Value is      
divided into three categories:                                                  

(1)  New Payments - payments received by the Company during the seven years     
preceding the date of the surrender;                                  

(2)  Old Payments - accumulated payments invested in the Contract for more than 
seven years; and                                                      

(3)  the amount available under the Withdrawal Without Surrender Charge         
provision.                                                            

See "Withdrawal Without Surrender Charge" below. For purposes of determining the
amount of any surrender charge, surrenders will be deemed to be taken first from
amounts available as a Withdrawal Without Surrender Charge, if any; then from   
Old Payments, and then from New Payments. Amounts available as a Withdrawal     
Without Surrender Charge, followed by Old Payments, may be withdrawn from the   
Contract at any time without the imposition of a surrender charge. If a         
withdrawal is attributable all or in part to New Payments, a surrender charge   
may apply.                                                                      

CHARGES FOR SURRENDER AND WITHDRAWAL. If the Contract is surrendered, or if New 
Payments are withdrawn while the Contract is in force and before the Annuity    
Date, a surrender charge may be imposed. The amount of the charge will depend   
upon the number of years that any New Payments, to which the withdrawal is      
attributed have remained credited under the Contract. For the purpose of        
calculating surrender charges for New Payments, all amounts withdrawn are       
assumed to be deducted first from the oldest New Payment and then from the next 
oldest New Payment and so on, until all New Payments have been exhausted        
pursuant to the first-in-first-out ("FIFO") method of accounting. (See FEDERAL  
TAX CONSIDERATIONS for a discussion of how withdrawals are treated for income   
tax purposes.)

The amount withdrawn equals the amount requested by the Owner plus the surrender
charge, if any. The charge is applied as a percentage of the New Payments       
withdrawn, but in no event will the total surrender charge exceed a maximum     
limit of 7% of total gross New Payments. Such total charge equals the aggregate 
of all applicable surrender charges for surrender, withdrawals and              
annuitization.                                                                  

WAIVER OF SURRENDER CHARGE(S) AND ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS CREDITED                   

PHYSICAL DISABILITY OR ADMISSION TO MEDICAL CARE FACILITY. Where permitted by   
law, the Company will waive the surrender charge in the event that an Owner (or 
the Annuitant, if the Owner is not an individual) becomes physically disabled   
after the issue date of the Contract and before attaining age 65. The Company   
may require proof of such disability and continuing disability, including       
written confirmation of receipt and approval of any claim for Social Security   
Disability Benefits and reserves the right to obtain an examination by a        
licensed physician of its choice and at its expense. In addition, except in New 
Jersey (where not permitted by state law), the Company will waive the surrender 
charge in the event that an Owner (or the Annuitant, if the Owner is not an     
individual) is: (1) admitted to a medical care facility after the issue date and
remains confined there until the later of one year after the issue date or 90   
consecutive days or (2) first diagnosed by a licensed physician as having a     
fatal illness after the issue date of the Contract.                             

For purposes of the above provision, "medical care facility" means any          
state-licensed facility or, in a state that does not require licensing, a       
facility that is operating pursuant to state law, providing medically necessary 
inpatient care which is prescribed by a licensed "physician" in writing and     
based on physical limitations which prohibit daily living in a non-institutional
setting; "fatal illness" means a condition diagnosed by a licensed physician    
which is expected to result in death within two years of the diagnosis; and     
"physician" means a person other than the Owner, Annuitant or a member of one of
their families who is state licensed to give medical care or treatment and is   
acting within the scope of that license.                                        

Where surrender charges have been waived under any one of the situations        
discussed above, no additional payments under the Contract will be accepted     
unless required by state law.                                                   

OTHER REDUCTIONS OR ELIMINATIONS OF SURRENDER CHARGES From time to time the     
Company may reduce or waive the surrender charge additional amounts on          
Contracts, when Contracts are sold to individuals or groups of individuals in a 
manner that reduces sales expenses. The Company will consider factors such as   
the following:                                                                  

39

P-->485BPOS43rd Page of 210TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 43rd
(1)  the size and type of group or class, and the persistency expected from that
group or class;                                                       

(2)  the total amount of payments to be received, and the manner in which       
payments are remitted;                                                

(3)  the purpose for which the Contracts are being purchased, and whether that  
purpose makes it likely that costs and expenses will be reduced;      

(4)  other transactions where sales expenses are likely to be reduced; or       

(5)  the level of commissions paid to selling broker-dealers or certain         
   financial institutions with respect to Contracts within the same group or
 class (for example, broker-dealers who offer the Contract in connection
with financial planning services offered on a fee-for-service basis). 

The Company also may reduce or waive the surrender charge, where either the     
Owner or the Annuitant on the date of issue is within the following classes of  
individuals ("eligible persons"):                                               

(1)  employees and registered representatives of any broker-dealer which has    
entered into a sales agreement with the Company to sell the Contract; 

(2)  employees of the Company, its affiliates and subsidiaries;                 

(3)  officers, directors, trustees and employees of any of the Underlying       
Portfolios, investment managers or Sub-Advisers of the Underlying     
Portfolios; and                                                       

(4)  the spouses of and immediate family members residing in the same household 
with such eligible persons. "Immediate family members" means children,
siblings, parents and grandparents.                                   

Finally, if permitted under state law, surrender charges will be waived under   
Section 403(b) Contracts where the amount withdrawn is being contributed to a   
life insurance policy issued by the Company as part of the individual's Section 
403(b) plan.                                                                    

Any reduction or elimination in the amount or duration of the surrender charge  
will not discriminate unfairly among purchasers of the Contract. The Company    
will not make any changes to this charge where prohibited by law.               

WITHDRAWAL WITHOUT SURRENDER CHARGE. In each calendar year, the Company will    
waive the surrender charge, if any, on an amount ("Withdrawal Without Surrender 
Charge Amount") equal to the greatest of (1), (2) or (3):                       

Where (1) is:   100% of Cumulative Earnings (calculated as the Accumulated Value
            as of the Valuation Date the Company receives the withdrawal
              request, or the following day, reduced by total gross payments
not previously withdrawn);                      

Where (2) is:   15% of the Accumulated Value as of the Valuation Date the       
              Company receives the withdrawal request, or the following day,
                reduced by the total amount of any prior withdrawals made in the
                same calendar year to which no surrender charge was applied; and

Where (3) is:   The amount calculated under the Company's life expectancy       
             distribution option (see Life Expectancy Distributions above)
           whether or not the withdrawal was part of such distribution
(applies only if Annuitant is also an Owner).   

For example, an 81-year-old Owner/Annuitant with an Accumulated Value of        
$15,000, of which $1,000 is Cumulative Earnings, would have a Withdrawal Without
Surrender Charge Amount of $2,250, which is equal to the greatest of:           

40

P-->485BPOS44th Page of 210TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 44th
(1)  Cumulative Earnings ($1,000);                                    

(2)  15% of Accumulated Value ($2,250); or                            

(3)  LED of 10.2% of Accumulated Value ($1,530).                      

The Withdrawal Without Surrender Charge Amount first will be deducted from      
Cumulative Earnings. If the Withdrawal Without Surrender Charge Amount exceeds  
Cumulative Earnings, the excess amount will be deemed withdrawn from payments   
not previously withdrawn on a LIFO (last-in/first-out) basis. This means that   
the last payments credited to the Contract will be withdrawn first. If more than
one withdrawal is made during the year, on each subsequent withdrawal the       
Company will waive the surrender charge, if any, until the entire Withdrawal    
Without Surrender Charge Amount has been withdrawn. Amounts withdrawn from a    
Guarantee Period Account prior to the end of the applicable Guarantee Period    
will be subject to a Market Value Adjustment. See GUARANTEE PERIOD ACCOUNTS.    

SURRENDERS. In the case of a complete surrender, the amount received by the     
Owner is equal to the entire Surrender Value under the Contract, net of any     
applicable tax withholding. Subject to the same rules applicable to withdrawals,
the Company will not assess a surrender charge on an amount equal to the        
Withdrawal Without Surrender Charge Amount, described above.                    

Where an Owner who is trustee under a pension plan surrenders, in whole or in   
part, a Contract on a terminating employee, the trustee will be permitted to    
reallocate all or a part of the Accumulated Value under the Contract to other   
contracts issued by the Company and owned by the trustee, with no deduction for 
any otherwise applicable surrender charge. Any such reallocation will be at the 
Accumulation Unit values for the Sub-Accounts as of the Valuation Date on which 
a written, signed request is received at the Service Office.                    

For further information on surrender and withdrawal, including minimum limits on
amount withdrawn and amount remaining under the Contract in the case of         
withdrawal, and important tax considerations, see "SURRENDER" and "WITHDRAWALS" 
under DESCRIPTION OF THE CONTRACT, and see FEDERAL TAX CONSIDERATIONS.          

CHARGE AT THE TIME ANNUITY BENEFIT PAYMENTS BEGIN. If the Owner chooses any     
commutable period certain option or a noncommutable fixed period certain option 
for less than ten years, a surrender charge will be deducted from the           
Accumulated Value of the Contract if the Annuity Date occurs at any time when a 
surrender charge would still apply had the Contract been surrendered on the     
Annuity Date.                                                                   

No surrender charge is imposed at the time of annuitization in any Contract year
under an option involving a life contingency or any noncommutable fixed period  
certain option for ten or more years. A Market Value Adjustment, however, may   
apply. See GUARANTEE PERIOD ACCOUNTS. If the Owner of a fixed annuity contract  
issued by the Company wishes to elect a variable annuity option, the Company may
permit such Owner to exchange, at the time of annuitization, the fixed contract 
for a Contract offered in this Prospectus. The proceeds of the fixed contract,  
minus any surrender charge applicable under the fixed contract if a period      
certain option is chosen, will be applied towards the variable annuity option   
desired by the Owner. The number of Annuity Units under the option will be      
calculated using the Annuity Unit values as of the 15th of the month preceding  
the Annuity Date.                                                               

TRANSFER CHARGE                                                                 

The Company currently makes no charge for processing transfers. The Company     
guarantees that the first 12 transfers in a Contract year will be free of       
transfer charge, but reserves the right to assess a charge, guaranteed never to 
exceed $25, for each subsequent transfer in a Contract year to reimburse it for 
the expense of processing transfers. For more information, see "TRANSFER
PRIVILEGE" under DESCRIPTION OF THE CONTRACT.

 GUARANTEE PERIOD ACCOUNTS

Due to certain exemptive and exclusionary provisions in the securities laws,    
interests in the Guarantee Period Accounts and the Company's Fixed Account are  
not registered as an investment company under the provisions of the 1933 Act or 
the 1940 Act. Accordingly, the staff of the SEC has not reviewed the disclosures
in this Prospectus relating to the Guarantee Period Accounts or the Fixed       
Account. Nevertheless, disclosures regarding the Guarantee Period Accounts and  
the Fixed Account of the Contract or any fixed benefits offered under these     
accounts may be subject to the provisions of the 1933 Act relating to the       
accuracy and completeness of statements made in the Prospectus.                 

INVESTMENT OPTIONS. In most jurisdictions, Guarantee Periods ranging from two   
through ten years may be available. Each Guarantee Period established for the   
Owner is accounted for separately in a non-unitized segregated account, except  
in California where it is accounted for in the Company's General Account. Each  
Guarantee Period Account provides for the accumulation of interest at a         
Guaranteed Interest Rate. The Guaranteed Interest Rate on amounts allocated or  
transferred to a Guarantee Period Account is determined from time to time by the
Company in accordance with market conditions. Once an interest rate is in effect
for a Guarantee Period Account, however, the Company may not change it during   
the duration of the Guarantee Period. In no event will the Guaranteed Interest  
Rate be less than 3%.                                                           

To the extent permitted by law, the Company reserves the right at any time to   
offer Guarantee Periods with durations that differ from those which were        
available when a Contract initially was issued and to stop accepting new        
allocations, transfers or renewals to a particular Guarantee Period.            

Owners may allocate net payments or make transfers from any of the Sub-Accounts,
the Fixed Account or an existing Guarantee Period Account to establish a new    
Guarantee Period Account at any time prior to the Annuity Date. Transfers from a
Guarantee Period Account on any date other than on the day following the        
expiration of that Guarantee Period will be subject to a Market Value           
Adjustment. The Company establishes a separate investment account each time the 
Owner allocates or transfers amounts to a Guarantee Period except that amounts  
allocated to the same Guarantee Period on the same day will be treated as one   
Guarantee Period Account. The minimum that may be allocated to establish a      
Guarantee Period Account is $1,000. If less than $1,000 is allocated, the       
Company reserves the right to apply that amount to the Pioneer Money Market VCT 
Portfolio. The Owner may allocate amounts to any of the Guarantee Periods       
available.                                                                      

At least 45 days (but not more than 75 days) prior to the end of a Guarantee    
Period, the Company will notify the Owner in writing of the expiration of that  
Guarantee Period. At the end of a Guarantee Period the Owner may transfer       
amounts to the Sub-Accounts, the Fixed Account or establish a new Guarantee     
Period Account of any duration then offered by the Company without a Market     
Value Adjustment. If reallocation instructions are not received at the Service  
Office before the end of a Guarantee Period, the account value automatically    
will be applied to a new Guarantee Period Account with the same duration unless 
(1) less than $1,000 would remain in the Guarantee Period Account on the        
expiration date, or (2) the Guarantee Period would extend beyond the Annuity    
Date or is no longer available. In such cases, the Guarantee Period Account     
value will be transferred to the Sub-Account investing in the Pioneer Money     
Market VCT Portfolio. Where amounts have been renewed automatically in a new    
Guarantee Period, the Company currently gives the Owner an additional 30 days to
transfer out of the Guarantee Period Account without application of a Market    
Value Adjustment. This practice may be discontinued or changed with notice at   
the Company's discretion.                                                       

42

P-->485BPOS46th Page of 210TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 46th
MARKET VALUE ADJUSTMENT. No Market Value Adjustment will be applied to          
transfers, withdrawals, or a surrender from a Guarantee Period Account on the   
expiration of its Guarantee Period. No Market Value Adjustment applies to       
amounts deducted for Contract fees or Rider charges. In addition, no negative   
Market Value Adjustment will be applied to a death benefit although a positive  
Market Value Adjustment, if any, will be applied to increase the value of the   
death benefit when based on the Contract's Accumulated Value. See "DEATH
BENEFIT" under DESCRIPTION OF THE CONTRACT. All other transfers, withdrawals, or
a surrender prior to the end of a Guarantee Period will be subject to a Market  
Value Adjustment, which may increase or decrease the account value. Amounts     
applied under an annuity option are treated as withdrawals when calculating the 
Market Value Adjustment. The Market Value Adjustment will be determined by      
multiplying the amount taken from each Guarantee Period Account before deduction
of any Surrender Charge by the market value factor. The market value factor for 
each Guarantee Period Account is equal to:                                      

                  [(1+i)/(1+j)](TO THE POWER OF n/365) - 1

 where:  i   is the Guaranteed Interest Rate expressed as a decimal (for
            example 3% = 0.03) being credited to the current Guarantee
Period;                                       

         j  is the new Guaranteed Interest Rate, expressed as a decimal,
               for a Guarantee Period with a duration equal to the number of
                 years remaining in the current Guarantee Period, rounded to the
        next higher number of whole years. If that rate is not
          available, the Company will use a suitable rate or index
allowed by the Department of Insurance; and   

          n   is the number of days remaining from the Effective Valuation
  Date to the end of the current Guarantee Period.

Based on the application of this formula, if the then current market rates are  
lower than the rate being credited to the Guarantee Period Account, the value of
a Guarantee Period Account will INCREASE after the Market Value Adjustment is   
applied. If the then current market rates are higher than the rate being        
credited to the Guarantee Period Account, the value of a Guarantee Period       
Account will DECREASE after the Market Value Adjustment is applied.             

The Market Value Adjustment is limited, however, so that even if the account    
value is decreased after application of a Market Value Adjustment, it will equal
or exceed the Owner's principal plus 3% earnings per year less applicable       
Contract fees. Conversely, if the then current market rates are lower and the   
account value is increased after the Market Value Adjustment is applied, the    
increase in value is also affected by the minimum guaranteed rate of 3%.. In    
this situation, the amount that will be added to the Guarantee Period Account is
limited to the difference between the amount earned and the 3% minimum          
guaranteed earnings. For examples of how the Market Value Adjustment works, see 
APPENDIX B -- SURRENDER CHARGES AND THE MARKET VALUE ADJUSTMENT.                

PROGRAM TO PROTECT PRINCIPAL AND PROVIDE GROWTH POTENTIAL. Under this feature,  
the Owner elects a Guarantee Period and one or more Sub-Accounts. The Company   
will then compute the proportion of the initial payment that must be allocated  
to the Guarantee Period selected, assuming no transfers or withdrawals, in order
to ensure that the value in the Guarantee Period Account on the last day of the 
Guarantee Period will equal the amount of the initial payment, LESS ANY CONTRACT
FEES OR CHARGES THAT ARE APPLICABLE TO THE GUARANTEE PERIOD ACCOUNTS. The       
required amount then will be allocated to the pre-selected Guarantee Period     
Account and the remaining balance to the other investment options selected by   
the Owner in accordance with the procedures described in "PAYMENTS" under       
DESCRIPTION OF THE CONTRACT. Unless the Company is notified otherwise, if a     
subsequent payment is made after the Program to Protect Principal and Provide   
Growth Potential has been selected and during the Guarantee Period, such payment
will be allocated among the selected Sub-Accounts only. If you want the         
subsequent payment to be allocated to a new Guarantee Period Account while      
enrolled in the Program, you must provide payment allocation instructions to the
Company that include (1) the Guarantee Period and (2) the dollar or percentage  
amount you want allocated to that Guarantee Period Account.                     

43

P-->485BPOS47th Page of 210TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 47th
WITHDRAWALS. Prior to the Annuity Date, the Owner may make withdrawals of       
amounts held in the Guarantee Period Accounts. Withdrawals from these accounts  
will be made in the same manner and be subject to the same rules as set forth   
under "SURRENDER" and "WITHDRAWALS" under DESCRIPTION OF THE CONTRACT. In       
addition, the following provisions also apply to withdrawals from a Guarantee   
Period Account: (1) a Market Value Adjustment will apply to all withdrawals,    
including Withdrawals Without Surrender Charge, unless made at the end of the   
Guarantee Period; and (2) the Company reserves the right to defer payments of   
amounts withdrawn from a Guarantee Period Account for up to six months from the 
date it receives the withdrawal request. If deferred for 30 days or more, the   
Company will pay interest on the amount deferred at a rate of at least 3%.      

In the event that a Market Value Adjustment applies to a withdrawal of a portion
of the value of a Guarantee Period Account, it will be calculated on the amount 
requested and deducted or added to the amount remaining in the Guarantee Period 
Account. If the entire amount in a Guarantee Period Account is requested, the   
adjustment will be made to the amount payable. If a surrender charge applies to 
the withdrawal, it will be calculated as set forth under "SURRENDER CHARGE"     
under CHARGES AND DEDUCTIONS after application of the Market Value Adjustment.

FEDERAL TAX CONSIDERATIONS

The effect of federal income taxes on the value of a Contract, on withdrawals or
surrenders, on annuity benefit payments, and on the economic benefit to the     
Owner, Annuitant, or beneficiary depends upon a variety of factors. The         
following discussion is based upon the Company's understanding of current       
federal income tax laws as they are interpreted as of the date of this          
Prospectus. No representation is made regarding the likelihood of continuation  
of current federal income tax laws or of current interpretations by the IRS. In 
addition, this discussion does not address state or local tax consequences that 
may be associated with the Contract.                                            

IT SHOULD BE RECOGNIZED THAT THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF FEDERAL INCOME TAX     
ASPECTS OF AMOUNTS PAID INTO AND RECEIVED FROM A CONTRACT IS NOT EXHAUSTIVE,    
DOES NOT PURPORT TO COVER ALL SITUATIONS, AND IS NOT INTENDED AS TAX ADVICE. A  
QUALIFIED TAX ADVISER ALWAYS SHOULD BE CONSULTED WITH REGARD TO THE APPLICATION 
OF LAW TO INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCES.                                             
GENERAL                                                                         

THE COMPANY. The Company is taxed as a life insurance company under Subchapter L
of the Code. The Company files a consolidated tax return with its affiliates.   
The Variable Account is considered a part of and taxed with the operations of   
the Company and is not taxed as a separate entity.                              

As of the date of this Prospectus, the Variable Account and Sub-Accounts are not
subject to tax, but the Company reserves the right to make a charge for any     
future tax liability it may incur as a result of the existence of the Contract, 
the Variable Account or the Sub-Accounts or for any tax imposed on the Company  
with respect to the income or assets of the Contract, the Variable Account or   
the Sub-Accounts held by the Company. Any such charge for taxes will be assessed
against the Variable Account or the Sub-Accounts on a fair and equitable basis  
in order to preserve equity among classes of Owners and with respect to each    
Sub-Account account as though that Sub-Account were a separate taxable entity.  

DIVERSIFICATION REQUIREMENTS. Section 817(h) of Code provides that the          
underlying investments held under a non-qualified annuity contract must satisfy 
certain diversification requirements in order for the contract to be treated as 
an annuity contract. If these requirements are not met, the Owner will be taxed 
each year on the annual increase in Accumulated Valued unless a waiver of the   
diversification failure is obtained from the IRS.                               

The IRS has issued regulations under Section 817(h) of the Code relating to the 
diversification requirements for variable annuity and variable life insurance   
contracts. The regulations prescribed by the Treasury Department provide that   
the investments of a segregated asset account underlying a variable annuity     
contract are adequately diversified if no more than 55% of the value of the     
assets of such account is represented by any one investment, no more than 70% by
any two investments, no more than 80% by any three investments, and no more than
90% by any four investments. These diversification requirements must be applied 
separately to each Sub-Account.                                                 

The Company believes that the Underlying Funds will comply with the current     
diversification requirements so that a non-qualified Contract that invests in   
one or more of those Funds will not be disqualified from annuity contract       
treatment by Section 817(h) of the Code. In the event that future IRS           
regulations and/or rulings would require Contract modifications in order to     
remain in compliance with the diversification standards, the Company will make  
reasonable efforts to comply, and it reserves the right to make such changes as 
it deems appropriate for that purpose.                                          

OWNER CONTROL. In some circumstances, owners of variable contracts who retain   
excessive control over the investment of the underlying separate account assets 
may be treated as the owners of those assets and may be subject to tax on income
produced by those assets. Although published guidance in this area does not     
address certain aspects of the Contracts, we believe that the Owner of a        
Contract should not be treated as the owner of any assets in the Separate       
Account. We reserve the right to modify the Contracts to bring them into        
conformity with applicable standards should such modification be necessary to   
prevent Owners of the Policies from being treated as the owners of the          
underlying Separate Account assets.

In order for a non-qualified variable annuity contract to qualify for tax       
deferral, assets in the segregated accounts underlying the contract must be     
considered to be owned by the insurance company and not by the contract owner.  
In three Revenue Rulings issued before the enactment of Section 817(h) of the   
Code in 1984, the IRS held that where a variable contract owner had certain     
forms of actual or potential control over the investments held under the        
variable annuity contract, the contract owner, rather than the issuing insurance
company, would be treated as the owner and would be taxable on the income and   
gains produced by those assets.                                                 

QUALIFIED AND NON-QUALIFIED CONTRACTS                                           

From a federal tax viewpoint there are two broad categories of variable annuity 
contracts: "qualified" contracts and "non-qualified" contracts. A qualified     
contract is one that is purchased in connection with a tax-qualified retirement 
plan or program eligible for special tax treatment under the Code. A            
non-qualified contract is one that is not purchased in connection with a        
retirement plan or program eligible for special tax treatment. The tax treatment
for certain withdrawals or surrenders will vary, depending on whether they are  
made from a qualified contract or a non-qualified contract. For more information
on the tax provisions applicable to qualified contracts, see "PROVISIONS
APPLICABLE ONLY TO TAX QUALIFIED PLANS" below.                                  

TAXATION OF THE CONTRACT 

IN GENERAL. The Company believes that the Contract described in this Prospectus,
with certain exceptions (see "Nonnatural Owner" below), will be considered an   
annuity contract under Section 72 of the Code which governs the taxation of     
annuities, and, if the Contract is a qualified contract, certain other          
provisions of the Code that will apply to it. However, if the Owner of a        
non-qualified Contract chooses an Annuity Date beyond the Owner's life          
expectancy, it is possible that the Contract may not be considered an annuity   
for tax purposes because there is no reasonable basis for expecting that annuity
payments will ever be made under the Contract. In that event, the Owner would be
taxed on the annual increase in Accumulated Value under the Contract. The Owner 
should consult a qualified tax adviser for more information. The following      
discussion assumes that a Contract will be treated as an annuity contract       
subject to Section 72 and, in the case of a qualified Contract, any other       
applicable provisions of the Code.                                              

MANDATORY DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS FOR QUALIFIED CONTRACTS. Under Section      
401(a)(9) of the Code, qualified Contracts will generally be subject both to    
mandatory minimum distribution requirements upon attainment of age 70 1/2 by the
Owner and to mandatory death benefit distribution requirements upon the death of
the Owner, either before or after the commencement of benefit payments. (Note:  
the rules for Roth IRAs do not currently require distributions to begin during  
the Owner's lifetime.) To comply with Section 401(a)(9), tax-qualified plans    
must include a provision for the commencement of benefits when a participant    
attains age 70 1/2 (or under certain plans when the participant retires, if     
later.)                                                                         

The regulations under Section 401(a)(9) provide that if the minimum distribution
requirements are applicable to an annuity contract for any year in which annuity
payments have not yet commenced on an irrevocable basis, except for             
acceleration, the required minimum distribution for that year must be computed  
by determining the entire interest of the Owner in the Contract as of the prior 
December 31 and dividing that amount by the applicable distribution period as   
determined under the regulations.                                               

The regulations further provide that if the minimum distribution requirements   
are applicable to an annuity contract for any year in which annuity payments    
have commenced on an irrevocable basis, payments under such contract must       
generally be non-increasing. According to the regulations, payments will not    
fail to satisfy the non-increasing payment requirement merely because payments  
are increased in one or more of the following ways:                             

(1)  By a constant percentage, applied not less frequently than annually;       

(2)  To provide a final payment upon the death of the employee that does not    
exceed the excess of the total value being annuitized over the total  
payments before the death of the employee;                            

46

P-->485BPOS50th Page of 210TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 50th
(3)  As a result of dividend payments or other payments that result from        
    actuarial gains, but only if actuarial gain is measured no less frequently
 than annually and the resulting dividend payments or other payments are
either paid no later than the year following the year for which the   
     actuarial experience is measured or paid in the same form as the payment of
  the annuity over the remaining period of the annuity, beginning no later
than the year following the year for which the actuarial experience is
measured; and                                                         

(4)  An acceleration of payments under the annuity, which is defined as a       
  shortening of the payment period with respect to an annuity or a full or
partial commutation of the future annuity payments. An increase in the
payment amount will be treated as an acceleration of payments in the  
annuity only if the total future expected payments under the annuity  
    (including the amount of any payment made as a result of the acceleration)
is decreased as a result of the change in payment period.             

Some forms of annuity payments permitted under the Contract may not meet the    
requirements under the final regulations issued pursuant to Section 401(a)(9).  
In the event that future IRS regulations and/or rulings would require Contract  
modifications in order for distributions to the Owner to remain in compliance   
with these distribution requirements, the Company will make reasonable efforts  
to comply and it reserves the right to make such changes as it deems appropriate
for that purpose.                                                               

To comply with Section 401(a)(9) of the Code, tax-qualified plans must also     
include provisions for the distribution of plan benefits after the death of the 
participant. If the surviving spouse of the participant is the beneficiary      
subject to the terms of such a plan, Section 401(a)(9) permits the surviving    
spouse to defer the commencement of benefits until he or she reaches age 70 1/2,
at which time the minimum distribution requirements will apply as though the    
spouse were a plan participant.                                                 

If the beneficiary of a qualified Contract is not the participant's surviving   
spouse, the operation of the death benefit distribution requirements of Section 
401(a)(9) will depend upon whether annuity payments have commenced. If the      
participant dies and annuity payments have commenced, the entire remaining      
interest must be distributed to the beneficiary at least as rapidly as under the
method of distribution being used as of the date of the participant's death. If 
the participant dies before annuity payments have commenced, the entire interest
must be distributed to the beneficiary either (i) within five years after the   
participant's death and/or (ii) in distributions that commence within one year  
after the date of death and are made in substantially equal amounts over a      
period not extending beyond the life or life expectancy of the beneficiary.     

If a beneficiary intends to comply with the substantially equal payment         
requirements without electing annuity payments, the required minimum            
distribution for any year must be computed by determining the entire interest of
the owner in the Contract as of the prior December 31 and dividing that amount  
by the life expectancy of the owner and beneficiary as determined under the     
regulations. If the beneficiary intends to comply with the requirement by       
electing to receive annuity payments, these payments must satisfy the           
"nonincreasing payment" requirement discussed above. Some forms of annuity      
payments offered under the Contract may not satisfy these requirements. In the  
event that future IRS regulations and/or rulings would require Contract         
modifications in order for distributions to a beneficiary to remain in          
compliance with these distribution requirements, the Company will make          
reasonable efforts to comply, and it reserves the right to make such changes as 
it deems appropriate for that purpose.                                          

MANDATORY DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS FOR NON-QUALIFIED CONTRACTS. Under Section  
72(s) of the Code, a non-qualified annuity contract must contain specified      
provisions with respect to the distribution of the amounts held under the       
contract following the death of the contract owner. If this requirement is not  
met, the owner will be taxed each year on the annual increase in Accumulated    
Value. This Contract contains provisions that are designed to meet the          
requirements of Section 72(s).                                                  

Under Section 72(s), if the deceased Owner's surviving spouse is the            
beneficiary, the surviving spouse may retain the contract and continue deferral 
during his or her lifetime. If the beneficiary of the Contract is not the       
deceased Owner's surviving spouse, the specific distribution requirement        
applicable under Section 72(s) will depend upon whether annuity payments have   
commenced. If any Owner dies after annuity payments have commenced, the entire  
remaining interest under the Contract must be distributed at least as rapidly as
under the                                                                       

47

P-->485BPOS51st Page of 210TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 51st
method of distribution being used as of the date of the Owner's death. If any   
Owner dies before annuity payments have commenced, then the entire amount held  
under the Contract must be distributed:                                         

(1)  within five years after the death of the Owner; and/or                     

(2)  in distributions that commence within one year after the date of death and 
    are made in substantially equal amounts over a period not extending beyond
the life or life expectancy of the beneficiary.                       

In a private letter ruling issued in 2001, the IRS held that distributions made 
to the designated beneficiary under a non-qualified variable annuity contract   
under a procedure that provided for payments over the life expectancy of the    
beneficiary would qualify under the "substantially equal" procedure described in
(2) above, even though the beneficiary had the right to accelerate payments     
under the distribution procedure so long as the payments continued automatically
unless and until such an acceleration occurred. In the event that future IRS    
regulations and/or rulings would require Contract modification in order to      
remain in compliance with these distribution requirements, the Company will make
reasonable efforts to comply and it reserves the right to make such changes as  
it deems appropriate for that purpose.                                          

WITHDRAWALS PRIOR TO ANNUITIZATION. With certain exceptions, increases in the   
Contract's Accumulated Value are not taxable to the Owner until withdrawn from  
the Contract. Under the current provisions of the Code, amounts received or     
deemed to have been received under an annuity contract prior to annuitization   
(including payments made upon the death of the annuitant or owner), generally   
are first allocable to any investment gains credited to the contract over the   
taxpayer's "investment in the contract" and, to that extent, are treated as     
ordinary income subject to federal income taxation. For this purpose, the       
"investment in the contract" is the total of all payments to the Contract that  
were not excluded from the Owner's income less any amounts previously withdrawn 
from the Contract which were excluded from income as recovery of the investment 
in the Contract. For purposes of computing the taxable amount of any            
distribution under these rules, Section 72(e)(11)(A)(ii) requires that all      
non-qualified deferred annuity contracts issued by the same insurance company to
the same owner during a single calendar year be treated as one contract.        
Different rules may apply to qualified Contracts.                               

ANNUITY PAYOUTS AFTER ANNUITIZATION. After annuity benefit payments begin under 
the Contract, a portion of each such payment received may generally be excluded 
from income as a recovery of the investment in the Contract. Different formulas 
apply to the computation of the excludable portion with respect to fixed annuity
payments and with respect to variable annuity payments, but the general effect  
of both formulas is to allocate the exclusion from income for the investment in 
the Contract ratably over the period during which annuity payments will be      
received. All annuity payments received in excess of this excludable amount are 
taxable as ordinary income. Once the investment in the Contract is fully        
recovered, because payments under the Contract have continued for longer than   
expected, the entire amount of all future payments will be taxable. If the      
annuitant dies before the entire investment in the Contract is recovered, a     
deduction for the remaining amount is generally allowed on the annuitant's final
tax return.                                                                     

PENALTY ON EARLY DISTRIBUTIONS. Under Section 72(q) of the Code, a 10% penalty  
tax may be imposed on the withdrawal of investment gains from a non-qualified   
Contract if the withdrawal is made prior to age 59 1/2. A similar 10% penalty   
tax is imposed under Section 72(t) of the Code on withdrawals or distributions  
of investment gains from a qualified Contract prior to age 59 1/2. The penalty  
tax will not be imposed on withdrawals:                                         

-    taken on or after age 59 1/2; or                                 

    -    if the withdrawal follows the death of the Owner (or, if the Owner is
        not an individual, the death of the primary Annuitant, as defined in
   the Code); or in the case of the Owner's "total disability" (as
defined in the Code); or                                    

   -    if withdrawals from a qualified Contract are made to an employee who
has terminated employment after reaching age 55; or         

-    irrespective of age, if the amount received is one of a series of
          "substantially equal" periodic payments made at least annually for the
        life or life expectancy of the payee or the payee and a beneficiary.

Some forms of annuity payments permitted under the Contracts may not meet the   
"substantially equal" payment requirements under Section 72(q) or Section 72(s).
Because of the uncertainties regarding these issues, a qualified tax adviser    
should be consulted prior to any request for a withdrawal from a Contract prior 
to age 59 1/2.                                                                  

ASSIGNMENTS OR TRANSFERS. If the Owner transfers (assigns) the Contract without 
receiving adequate and full consideration for the transfer, Section 72 of the   
Code generally requires the Owner to report taxable income equal to any         
investment gain in value over the Owner's cost basis at the time of the         
transfer. This acceleration rule applies to a transfer to another individual    
(other than the Owner's spouse) or to a nonnnatural person, such as a trust. If 
the transfer is to a charity, the Owner may be allowed a deduction for some or  
all of the value of the Contract transferred. If the transfer is not to a       
charity, the Owner may also be subject to gift tax on some or all of the value  
of the Contract transferred without adequate and full consideration.            

NONNATURAL OWNERS. As a general rule, deferred annuity contracts owned by       
"nonnatural persons" (e.g., a corporation) are not treated as annuity contracts 
for federal tax purposes, and the investment income attributable to             
contributions made after February 28, 1986 is taxed as ordinary income that is  
received or accrued by the owner during the taxable year. This rule does not    
apply to annuity contracts purchased with a single payment when the annuity date
is no later than a year from the Issue Date (an immediate annuity) or to        
deferred annuities owned by qualified employer plans, estates, employers with   
respect to a terminated pension plan, and entities other than employers, such as
a trust, holding an annuity as an agent for a natural person. This exception,   
however, will not apply in cases of any employer who is the owner of an annuity 
contract under a non-qualified deferred compensation plan.                      

TAX WITHHOLDING                                                                 

The Code requires withholding with respect to payments or distributions from    
non-qualified contracts and IRAs, unless a taxpayer elects not to have          
withholding. A mandatory 20% withholding requirement applies to distributions   
from most other qualified contracts if such distribution would have been        
eligible to be rolled over into another qualified plan. In addition, the Code   
requires reporting to the IRS of the amount of income received with respect to  
payment or distributions from annuities.                                        

OTHER TAX ISSUES                                                                

FEDERAL ESTATE TAXES. While no attempt is being made to discuss the federal     
estate tax implications of the Contract, you should keep in mind that the value 
of an annuity contract owned by a decedent and payable to a beneficiary by      
virtue of surviving the decedent is included in the decedent's gross estate.    
Depending on the terms of the annuity contract, the value of the annuity        
included in the gross estate may be the value of the lump sum payment payable to
the designated beneficiary or the actuarial value of the payments to be received
by the beneficiary. Consult an estate planning advisor for more information.    

GENERATION-SKIPPING TRANSFER TAX. Under certain circumstances, the Code may     
impose a "generation skipping transfer tax" when all or part of an annuity      
contract is transferred to, or a death benefit is paid to, an individual two or 
more generations younger than the Owner. Regulations issued under the Code may  
require us to deduct the tax from your Contract, or from any applicable payment,
and pay it directly to the IRS.                                                 

ANNUITY PURCHASES BY RESIDENTS OF PUERTO RICO. The Internal Revenue Service has 
ruled that income received by residents of Puerto Rico under life insurance or  
annuity contracts issued by a Puerto Rico branch of a United States life        
insurance company is U.S.-source income that is generally subject to United     
States federal income tax.                                                      

ANNUITY PURCHASES BY NONRESIDENT ALIENS AND FOREIGN CORPORATIONS. The discussion
above provides general information regarding U.S. federal income tax            
consequences to annuity owners that are U.S. citizens or residents. Owners that 
are not U.S. citizens or residents will generally be subject to U.S. federal    
withholding tax on taxable distributions from annuity contracts at a 30% rate,  
unless a lower treaty rate applies. In addition, Owners may be subject to state 
and/or municipal taxes and taxes that may be imposed by the Owner's country of  
citizenship or residence. Consult with a qualified tax adviser regarding U.S.   
state, and foreign taxation with respect to an annuity contract.

FOREIGN TAX CREDITS. We may benefit from any foreign tax credits attributable to
taxes paid by certain Funds to foreign jurisdictions to the extent permitted    
under federal tax law.                                                          

POSSIBLE TAX LAW CHANGES. Although the likelihood of legislative changes is     
uncertain, there is always the possibility that the tax treatment of the        
Contract could change by legislation or otherwise. Consult a tax adviser with   
respect to legislative developments and their effect on the Contract. We have   
the right to modify the contract in response to legislative changes that could  
otherwise diminish the favorable tax treatment that annuity contract Owners     
currently receive. We make no guarantee regarding the tax status of any contact 
and do not intend the above discussion as tax advice.                           

PROVISIONS APPLICABLE ONLY TO TAX QUALIFIED PLANS 

Federal income taxation of assets held inside a qualified retirement plan and of
earnings on those assets is deferred until distribution of plan benefits begins.
As such, it is not necessary to purchase a variable annuity contract solely to  
obtain its tax deferral feature. However, other features offered under this     
Contract and described in this Prospectus -- such as the minimum guaranteed     
death benefit, the guaranteed fixed annuity rates and the wide variety of       
investment options -- may make this Contract a suitable investment for your     
qualified retirement plan.                                                      

The tax rules applicable to qualified retirement plans, as defined by the Code, 
are complex and vary according to the type of plan. Benefits under a qualified  
plan may be subject to that plan's terms and conditions irrespective of the     
terms and conditions of any annuity contract used to fund such benefits. As     
such, the following is simply a general description of various types of         
qualified plans that may use the Contract. Before purchasing any annuity        
contract for use in funding a qualified plan, more specific information should  
be obtained.                                                                    

Qualified Contracts may include special provisions (endorsements) changing or   
restricting rights and benefits otherwise available to owners of non-qualified  
Contracts. Individuals purchasing a qualified Contract should carefully review  
any such changes or limitations that may include restrictions to ownership,     
transferability, assignability, contributions, and distributions.               

CORPORATE AND SELF-EMPLOYED ("H.R. 10" AND "KEOGH") PENSION AND PROFIT SHARING  
PLANS. Sections 401(a), 401(k) and 403(a) of the Code permit business employers 
and certain associations to establish various types of tax-favored retirement   
plans for employees, including self-employed individuals. Employers intending to
use qualified Contracts in connection with such plans should seek competent     
advice as to the suitability of the Contract to their specific needs and as to  
applicable Code limitations and tax consequences.                               

INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ANNUITIES. Sections 408 and 408A of the Code permit       
eligible individuals to contribute to an individual retirement program known as 
an Individual Retirement Annuity ("IRA"). Note: This term covers all IRAs       
permitted under Sections 408 and 408A of the Code, including Roth IRAs. IRAs are
subject to limits on the amounts that may be contributed, the persons who may be
eligible, and on the time when distributions may commence. In addition, certain 
distributions from other types of retirement plans may be "rolled over," on a   
tax-deferred basis, to an IRA. Purchasers of an IRA Contract will be provided   
with supplementary information as may be required by the IRS or other           
appropriate agency, and will have the right to cancel the Contract as described 
in this Prospectus. See "RIGHT TO CANCEL INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ANNUITY" under   
DESCRIPTION OF THE CONTRACT. The Contract, including all available riders, was  
filed with the IRS and its form approved as a prototype. Such an approval is an 
approval as to the form of the Contract and does not represent a determination  
of its merits.                                                                  

Eligible employers that meet specified criteria may establish simplified        
employee pension plans (SEP-IRAs) for their employees using IRAs. Employer      
contributions that may be made to such plans are larger than the amounts that   
may be contributed to regular IRAs and may be deductible to the employer.       

TAX-SHELTERED ANNUITIES ("TSAs"). Under the provisions of Section 403(b) of the 
Code, payments made to annuity Contracts purchased for employees under annuity  
plans adopted by public school systems and certain organizations which are tax  
exempt under Section 501(c)(3) of the Code are excludable from the gross income 
of such employees to the extent that total annual payments do not exceed the    
maximum contribution permitted                                                  

50

under the Code. Purchasers of TSA contracts should seek competent advice as to  
eligibility, limitations on permissible payments and other tax consequences     
associated with the contracts.                                                  

Withdrawals or other distributions attributable to salary reduction             
contributions (including earnings thereon) made to a TSA contract after December
31, 1988, may not begin before the employee attains age 59 1/2, separates from  
service, dies or becomes disabled. In the case of hardship, an Owner may        
withdraw amounts contributed by salary reduction, but not the earnings on such  
amounts. Even though a distribution may be permitted under these rules (e.g.,   
for hardship or after separation from service), it may be subject to a 10%      
penalty tax as a premature distribution, in addition to income tax.             

For Contracts issued after December 31, 2008, amounts attributable to           
contributions other than salary reduction contributions generally may not be    
distributed before severance of employment or occurrence of an event specified  
in the employer's Section 403(b) plan.                                          

DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLANS OF STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND TAX-EXEMPT       
ORGANIZATIONS. Under Section 457 of the Code, deferred compensation plans       
established by governmental and certain other tax-exempt employers for their    
employees may invest in annuity contracts. Contributions and investment earnings
are not taxable to employees until distributed; however, with respect to        
payments made after February 28, 1986, a Contract owned by a state or local     
government or a tax-exempt organization will not be treated as an annuity under 
Section 72 as well.                                                             

TEXAS OPTIONAL RETIREMENT PROGRAM. Distributions under a TSA contract issued to 
participants in the Texas Optional Retirement Program may not be received except
in the case of the participant's death, retirement or termination of employment 
in the Texas public institutions of higher education. These additional          
restrictions are imposed under the Texas Government Code and a prior opinion of 
the Texas Attorney General.                                                     

STATEMENTS AND REPORTS

An Owner is sent a report semi-annually which provides certain financial        
information about the Underlying Portfolios. At least annually, but possibly as 
frequent as quarterly, the Company will furnish a statement to the Owner        
containing information about his or her Contract, including Accumulation Unit   
Values and other information as required by applicable law, rules and           
regulations. The Company will also send a confirmation statement to Owners each 
time a transaction is made affecting the Contract's Accumulated Value. (Certain 
transactions made under recurring payment plans such as Dollar Cost Averaging   
may in the future be confirmed quarterly rather than by immediate               
confirmations.) The Owner should review the information in all statements       
carefully. All errors or corrections must be reported to the Company immediately
to assure proper crediting to the Contract. The Company will assume that all    
transactions are accurately reported on confirmation statements and             
quarterly/annual statements unless the Owner notifies the Service Office in     
writing within 30 days after receipt of the statement.                          

LOANS (QUALIFIED CONTRACTS ONLY)

Loans are available to owners of TSA contracts (i.e., contracts issued under    
Section 403(b) of the Code) and to contracts issued to plans qualified under    
Sections 401(a) and 401(k) of the Code. You must use a Company form to request a
loan. You may obtain Company forms by calling 1-800-688-9915. Loans are subject 
to provisions of the Code and to applicable qualified retirement plan rules. Tax
advisers and plan fiduciaries should be consulted prior to exercising loan      
privileges.                                                                     

Loaned amounts will be withdrawn first from Sub-Account and Fixed Account values
on a pro-rata basis until exhausted. Thereafter, any additional amounts will be 
withdrawn from the Guarantee Period Accounts (pro rata by duration and LIFO     
within each duration), subject to any applicable Market Value Adjustments. The  
maximum loan amount will be determined under the Company's maximum loan formula.
The minimum loan amount is $1,000. Loans will be secured by a security interest 
in the Contract and the amount borrowed will be transferred to a loan asset     
account within the Company's General Account, where it will accrue interest at a
specified rate below the then-current loan rate. Generally, loans must be repaid
within five years or less, and repayments must be made quarterly and in         
substantially equal amounts. Repayments will be allocated pro rata in accordance
with the most recent payment allocation, except that any allocations to a       
Guarantee Period Account will be allocated instead to the Money Market          
Portfolio.

 ADDITION, DELETION OR SUBSTITUTION OF INVESTMENTS

The Company reserves the right, subject to applicable law, to make additions to,
deletions from, or substitutions for the shares of a fund that are held in the  
Sub-Accounts or that the Sub-Accounts may purchase. If the shares of any        
Underlying Portfolio no longer are available for investment or if, in the       
Company's judgment, further investment in any Underlying Portfolio should become
inappropriate in view of the purposes of the Variable Account or the affected   
Sub-Account, the Company may withdraw the shares of that Underlying Portfolio   
and substitute shares of another registered open-end management company. The    
Company will not substitute any shares attributable to the Contract interest in 
a Sub-Account without notice to the Owner and prior approval of the SEC and     
state insurance authorities, to the extent required by the 1940 Act or other    
applicable law. The Variable Account may, to the extent permitted by law,       
purchase other securities for other contracts or permit a conversion between    
contracts upon request by an Owner.                                             

The Company also reserves the right to establish additional Sub-Accounts of the 
Variable Account, each of which would invest in shares corresponding to a new   
Underlying Portfolio or in shares of another investment company having a        
specified investment objective. Subject to applicable law and any required SEC  
approval, the Company may, in its sole discretion, establish new Sub-Accounts or
eliminate one or more Sub-Accounts if marketing needs, tax considerations or    
investment conditions warrant. Any new Sub-Accounts may be made available to    
existing Owners on a basis to be determined by the Company.                     

Shares of the Underlying Portfolios may be issued to variable accounts of the   
Company and its affiliates which issue variable life contracts ("mixed          
funding"). Shares of the Underlying Portfolios may be also issued to other      
unaffiliated insurance companies ("shared funding"). It is conceivable that in  
the future such mixed funding or shared funding may be disadvantageous for      
variable life owners or variable annuity owners. Although the Company and the   
underlying investment companies currently do not foresee any such disadvantages 
to either variable life owners or variable annuity owners, they intend to       
monitor events in order to identify any material conflicts between such owners, 
and to determine what action, if any, should be taken in response thereto. If it
were concluded that separate funds should be established for variable life and  
variable annuity separate accounts, the Company will bear the attendant         
expenses.                                                                       

The Company reserves the right, subject to compliance with applicable law, to:  

(1)  transfer assets from the Variable Account or any of its Sub-Accounts to    
     another of the Company's separate accounts or Sub-Accounts having assets of
the same class,                                                       

(2)  to operate the Variable Account or any Sub-Account as a management         
 investment company under the 1940 Act or in any other form permitted by
law,                                                                  

(3)  to deregister the Variable Account under the 1940 Act in accordance with   
the requirements of the 1940 Act,                                     

(4)  to substitute the shares of any other registered investment company for the
Underlying Portfolio shares held by a Sub-Account, in the event that  
Underlying Portfolio shares are unavailable for investment, or if the 
 Company determines that further investment in such Underlying Portfolio
shares is inappropriate in view of the purpose of the Sub-Account,    

(5)  to change the methodology for determining the net investment factor,       

(6)  to change the names of the Variable Account or of the Sub-Accounts, and    

(7)  to combine with other Sub-Accounts or other Separate Accounts of the       
Company.                                                              

If any of these substitutions or changes are made, the Company may endorse the  
Contract to reflect the substitution or change, and will notify Owners of all   
such changes. In no event will the changes described above be made without      
notice to Owners in accordance with the 1940 Act.                               

52

 CHANGES TO COMPLY WITH LAW AND AMENDMENTS

The Company reserves the right, without the consent of Owners, to suspend sales 
of the Contract and to make any change to provisions of the Contract to comply  
with, or give Owners the benefit of, any federal or state statute, rule or      
regulation, including but not limited to requirements for annuity contracts and 
retirement plans under the Code and pertinent regulations or any state statute  
or regulation. Any such changes will apply uniformly to all Contracts that are  
affected. Owners will be given written notice of such changes.                  

 VOTING RIGHTS

The Company will vote Underlying Portfolio shares held by each Sub-Account in   
accordance with instructions received from Owners and, after the Annuity Date,  
from the Annuitants. Each person having a voting interest in a Sub-Account will 
be provided with proxy materials of the Underlying Portfolio, together with a   
form with which to give voting instructions to the Company. Shares for which no 
timely instructions are received will be voted in proportion to the instructions
which are received. The Company also will vote shares in a Sub-Account that it  
owns and which are not attributable to Contracts in the same proportion. If the 
1940 Act or any rules thereunder should be amended or if the present            
interpretation of the 1940 Act or such rules should change, and as a result the 
Company determines that it is permitted to vote shares in its own right, whether
or not such shares are attributable to the Contract, the Company reserves the   
right to do so.                                                                 

The number of votes which an Owner or Annuitant may cast will be determined by  
the Company as of the record date established by the Underlying Portfolio.      
During the accumulation period, the number of Underlying Portfolio shares       
attributable to each Owner will be determined by dividing the dollar value of   
the Accumulation Units of the Sub-Account credited to the Contract by the net   
asset value of one Underlying Portfolio share. During the annuity period, the   
number of Underlying Portfolio shares attributable to each Annuitant will be    
determined by dividing the reserve held in each Sub-Account for the Annuitant's 
variable annuity by the net asset value of one Underlying Portfolio share.      
Ordinarily, the Annuitant's voting interest in the Underlying Portfolio will    
decrease as the reserve for the variable annuity is depleted.                   

DISTRIBUTION

Effective May 1, 2008, Epoch Securities, Inc. ("Epoch" or "Principal
Underwriter"), a Delaware company located at 132 Turnpike Road, Southborough,   
Massachusetts 01772, became principal underwriter for the Contracts. Epoch is   
a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.                      

The Company paid commissions not to exceed 7.0% of payments to broker-dealers   
which sold the Contract. The Company currently does not pay direct commissions  
on additional payments to the Contracts. However, alternative commission        
schedules may be in effect that paid lower initial commission amounts but with  
ongoing annual compensation of up to 1% of the Contract's Accumulated Value.    

To the extent permitted by NASD rules, overrides and promotional incentives or  
payments also may be provided to independent marketing organizations and        
broker-dealers based on the Contract's Accumulated Value, sales volumes, the    
performance of wholesaling functions, or other sales-related criteria.          
Additional payments may be made for other services not directly related to the  
sale of the Contract.                                                           

The Company intends to recoup commissions and other sales expenses through a    
combination of anticipated surrender charges and profits from the Company's     
General Account, which may include amounts derived from mortality and risk      
charges. Commissions paid on the Contract, including additional incentives or   
payments, do not result in any additional charge to Owners or to the Variable   
Account. The Company will retain any surrender charges assessed on a Contract.  

 LEGAL MATTERS

There are no legal proceedings to which we, the Separate Account or the         
Principal Underwriter is a party, or to which the assets of the Separate Account
are subject, that are likely to have a material adverse effect on:              

-    the Separate Account; or                                                   

53

P-->485BPOS57th Page of 210TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 57th
-    the ability of the principal underwriter to perform its contract with the  
Separate Account; or                                                  

-    on our ability to meet our obligations under the variable annuity contracts
funded through the Separate Account.

APPENDIX A
MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE FIXED ACCOUNT

Because of exemption and exclusionary provisions in the securities laws,        
interests in the Fixed Account are not generally subject to regulation under the
provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 or the Investment Company Act of 1940. 
Disclosures regarding the fixed portion of the annuity contract and the Fixed   
Account may be subject to the provisions of the Securities Act of 1933          
concerning the accuracy and completeness of statements made in this Prospectus. 
The disclosures in this APPENDIX A have not been reviewed by the Securities and 
Exchange Commission.                                                            

The Fixed Account is part of the Company's General Account and is made up of all
of the general assets of the Company other than those allocated to a separate   
account. Allocations to the Fixed Account become part of the assets of the      
Company and are used to support insurance and annuity obligations. A portion or 
all of net payments may be allocated to accumulate at a fixed rate of interest  
in the Fixed Account. Such net amounts are guaranteed by the Company as to      
principal and a minimum rate of interest. Currently, the Company will credit    
amounts allocated to the Fixed Account with interest at an effective annual rate
of at least 3%, compounded daily. Additional "Excess Interest" may or may not be
credited at the sole discretion of the Company.                                 

If the Contract is surrendered, or if an amount in excess of the Withdrawal     
Without Surrender Charge Amount is withdrawn, while the Contract is in force and
before the Annuity Date, a surrender charge is imposed if such event occurs     
before the payments attributable to the surrender or withdrawal have been       
credited to the Contract for at least seven full Contract years.                

STATE RESTRICTIONS. In Massachusetts, payments and transfers to the Fixed       
Account are subject to the following restrictions:                              

     If the Contract is issued prior to the Annuitant's 60th birthday,
allocations to the Fixed Account will be permitted until the
          Annuitant's 61st birthday. On and after the Annuitant's 61st birthday,
    no additional Fixed Account allocations will be accepted. If the
   Contract is issued on or after the Annuitant's 60th birthday up
      through and including the Annuitant's 81st birthday, Fixed Account
        allocations will be permitted during the first Contract year. On and
          after the first Contract anniversary, no additional allocations to the
      Fixed Account will be permitted. If a Contract is issued after the
       Annuitant's 81st birthday, no payments to the Fixed Account will be
permitted at any time.                                      

In Oregon, if the Contract is issued after the Annuitant's 81st birthday, no    
payments or transfers to the Fixed Account will be permitted at any time.       

If an allocation designated as a Fixed Account allocation is received at the    
Service Office during a period when the Fixed Account is not available due to   
the limitations outlined above, the monies will be allocated to the Money Market
Portfolio.

PART 2: MARKET VALUE ADJUSTMENT                                                 

The market value factor is: [(1+i)/(1+j)](TO THE POWER OF n/365) - 1            

For purposes of the examples below:                                             

i = the guaranteed interest rate being credited to the guarantee period.        

j = the guaranteed interest rate on the date of surrender for the guarantee     
    period with a duration equal to the number of years remaining in the current
guarantee period, rounded to the next higher number of whole years.     

n = the number of days from the date of surrender to the expiration date of the 
guarantee period.

The following examples assume:                                                  

    1.   The payment was allocated to a ten-year Guarantee Period Account with
a Guaranteed Interest Rate of 8%.                           

    2.   The date of surrender is seven years (2,555 days) from the expiration
date.                                                       

  3.   The value of the Guarantee Period Account is equal to $62,985.60 at
the end of three years.                                     

  4.   No transfers or withdrawals affecting this Guarantee Period Account
have been made.                                             

    5.   Surrender charges, if any, are calculated in the same manner as shown
in the examples in Part 1.

Value                                                                           

Adjustment. Death Benefit (b) is the gross payments accumulated daily at the    
Death Benefit Effective Annual Yield of 5% reduced proportionately to reflect   
withdrawals. Death Benefit (c) is the death benefit that would

APPENDIX D
 DIFFERENCES UNDER THE PIONEER VISION CONTRACT (FORM A3023-95)
 COMMONWEALTH ANNUITY AND LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY (FORM A3023-95)

1.   The Guarantee Period Accounts and the optional EER are not available under 
the Pioneer Vision Contract.                                          

2.   The waiver of surrender charge in Pioneer Vision 2 for disability prior to 
  age 65, diagnosis of a terminal illness or confinement to a nursing home
until the later of one year after issue or 90 days (see "Reduction or 
     Elimination of Surrender Charge") is not available under the Pioneer Vision
    Contract. Only the waiver for disability is available under Pioneer Vision
2 Contracts issued in New Jersey.                                     

3.   The death benefit under the Pioneer Vision Contract that is payable upon   
   the death of the Annuitant (or an Owner who is also the Annuitant) is the
   greatest of: (1) the Accumulated Value under the Contract next determined
following receipt of due proof of death at the Service Office; (2) the
total amount of gross payments made under the Contract reduced        
    proportionately to reflect the amount of all prior partial withdrawals, or
     (3) the death benefit that would have been payable on the most recent fifth
year policy anniversary, increased for subsequent payments and reduced
proportionately to reflect withdrawals after that date.               

4.   The Withdrawal Without Surrender Charge Amount (the "Free Withdrawal       
Amount") under the Pioneer Vision Contract is the greatest of (1)     
   cumulative earnings; (2) 10% of the Accumulated Value as of the Valuation
    Date coincident with or next following the date of the withdrawal request;
or (3) the amount calculated under the Company's life expectancy      
    distribution. The percentage available under the Pioneer Vision 2 Contract
is 15% rather than 10%.                                               

5.   The following transfer provision applies to the Pioneer Vision Contract:   

TRANSFER PRIVILEGE. At any time prior to the Annuity Date, subject to the       
seventeen fund Sub-Account limitation and the Disruptive Trading limitations    
described under DESCRIPTION OF THE CONTRACT, an owner may have amounts          
transferred among the Sub-Accounts or from the Sub-Accounts to the Fixed        
Account, where available. Transfer values will be effected at the Accumulation  
Value next computed after receipt of the transfer order. The Company will make  
transfers pursuant to a written or telephone request.                           

If an Owner requests a transfer of an amount from a Sub-Account that is higher  
than the amount in the Sub-Account on the Valuation Date (for example, if a     
request is made to transfer $100 from a Sub-Account but the Accumulated Value in
the Sub-Account on the Valuation Date is only $98), the Company will transfer   
all of the Accumulated Value in the Sub-Account.                                

The first 12 transfers in a Contract year are guaranteed to be free of any      
transfer charge. The Company does not currently charge for additional transfers 
but reserves the right to assess a charge, guaranteed never to exceed $25, to   
reimburse it for the expense of processing these additional transfers. If you   
authorize periodic transfers under an Automatic Transfer option (Dollar Cost    
Averaging), or an Automatic Account Rebalancing option, the first automatic     
transfer or rebalancing under a request counts as one transfer for purposes of  
the 12 transfers guaranteed to be free of a transfer charge in each Contract    
year. Each subsequent transfer or rebalancing under that request in the same or 
subsequent Contract year is without charge and does not reduce the remaining    
number of transfers which may be made free of charge.                           

AUTOMATIC TRANSFERS (DOLLAR COST AVERAGING) AND AUTOMATIC ACCOUNT REBALANCING   
OPTIONS. The Owner may elect automatic transfers of a predetermined amount, not 
less than $100, on a periodic basis (monthly, bi-monthly, or quarterly) from the
Sub-Account investing in the Pioneer Money Market VCT Portfolio or the Pioneer  
Bond VCT Portfolio (the source account) to one or more of the other             
Sub-Accounts. Automatic transfers may not be made into the Fixed Account or, if 
applicable, the Portfolio being used as the source account. The Fixed Account   
also may be used as the source account from which periodic automatic transfers  
will be made to any of the Sub-Accounts provided that (1) the amount of each    
monthly transfer cannot exceed 10% of the value in the Fixed Account as of the  
date of the first transfer; (2) each bimonthly transfer cannot                  

 D-1

P-->485BPOS66th Page of 210TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 66th
exceed 20% of the value in the Fixed Account as of the date of the first        
transfer, and (3) each quarterly transfer cannot exceed 25% of the value in the 
Fixed Account as of the date of the first transfer. If an automatic transfer    
would reduce the balance in the source account to less than $100, the entire    
balance will be transferred proportionately to the chosen Sub-Accounts.         
Automatic transfers will continue until the amount in the source account on a   
transfer date is zero or the Owner's request to terminate the option is received
by the Company. If additional amounts are allocated to the source account after 
its balance has fallen to zero, this option will not restart automatically and  
the Owner must provide a new request to the Company.                            

The Owner may request automatic rebalancing of Sub-Account allocations on a     
monthly, bi-monthly, quarterly, semi-annual or annual basis in accordance with  
specified percentage allocations. As frequently as requested, the Company will  
review the percentage allocations in the Portfolios and, if necessary, transfer 
amounts to ensure conformity with the designated percentage allocation mix. If  
the amount necessary to reestablish the mix on any scheduled date is less than  
$100, no transfer will be made. Automatic Account Rebalancing will continue     
until the Owner's request to terminate or change the option is received by the  
Company. As such, subsequent payments allocated in a manner different from the  
percentage allocation mix in effect on the date the payment is received will be 
reallocated in accordance with the existing mix on the next scheduled date      
unless the Owner's timely request to change the mix or terminate the option is  
received by the Company.                                                        

The Company reserves the right to limit the number of Portfolios that may be    
utilized for automatic transfers and rebalancing, and to discontinue either     
option upon advance written notice. Currently, Dollar Cost Averaging and Account
Rebalancing may not be in effect simultaneously.                                

6.   The surrender charge under Pioneer Vision Contract (Form A3023-95) is:

0 - 3                    7%                                           
4                      6%                                         
5                      5%                                         
6                      4%                                         
7                      3%                                         
More than 7                 0%                                              

7.   For Pioneer Vision Contracts issued in Maryland, the surrender charge for  
   monies surrendered out of the Variable Account is identical to the charge
  schedule shown in 6. above. Monies surrendered out of the Fixed Account,
however, are subject to the following additional charges: in Year 8,  
    measured from the date of payment, a 2% charge will apply, and in year 9 a
1% charge will apply.                                                 

8.   The Fixed Account under the Pioneer Vision Contract is not available in    
Oregon.                                                               

9.   Because of the differences between the surrender charge (see 6, above) and 
the amount of the free withdrawal (see 4. above) in the Pioneer Vision
Contract and Pioneer Vision 2 Contract, the following expense examples
   apply to Owners of the Pioneer Vision Contract, and should be referred to
rather than the expense examples on pages 7-9 of this Prospectus.

MAXIMUM EXPENSE EXAMPLE                                                         

The following example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Contract for the   
time periods indicated and that your investment has a 5% return each year. The  
example also assumes the maximum fees and expenses of any of the Underlying     
Portfolios and assumes that these fees and expenses remain the same in each of  
the 1, 3, 5, and 10-year intervals. Finally, the example assumes that you have  
chosen the optional rider with the maximum possible charges, which would be the 
Minimum Guaranteed Annuity Payout (M-GAP) Rider with a ten-year waiting period  
at a charge of 0.25% annually. Although your actual costs may be higher or      
lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:                          

(1)  If, at the end of the applicable time period, you surrender your Contract  
     or annuitize under any commutable period certain option or a non-commutable
fixed period certain option of less than ten years:                   

                           1 YEAR   3 YEARS   5 YEARS   10 YEARS

(2)  If you do NOT surrender your Contract or if you annuitize at the end of the
     applicable time period under a life option or a non-commutable fixed period
certain option of ten years or longer:

MINIMUM EXPENSE EXAMPLE                                                         

The following example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Contract for the   
time periods indicated and that your investment has a 5% return each year. The  
example also assumes the minimum fees and expenses of any of the Underlying     
Portfolios and assumes that these fees and expenses remain the same in each of  
the 1, 3, 5, and 10-year intervals. It also assumes that you have not chosen an 
optional rider. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on     
these assumptions your costs would be:                                          

(1)  If , at the end of the applicable time period, you surrender your Contract 
     or annuitize under any commutable period certain option or a non-commutable
fixed period certain option of less than ten years:                   

                           1 YEAR   3 YEARS   5 YEARS   10 YEARS

 GENERAL INFORMATION AND HISTORY

Effective September 1, 2006, Allmerica Financial Life Insurance and Annuity     
Company was renamed Commonwealth Annuity and Life Insurance Company (the        
"Company"). The Company is a life insurance company organized under the laws of 
Delaware in July 1974. Prior to December 31, 2002, the Company was a wholly     
owned subsidiary of First Allmerica Financial Life Insurance Company ("First    
Allmerica)", which in turn was a direct subsidiary of Allmerica Financial       
Corporation ("AFC"). Effective December 31, 2002, the Company became a          
Massachusetts domiciled insurance company and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary  
of The Hanover Insurance Group ("THG," formerly Allmerica Financial             
Corporation). On December 30, 2005, THG completed the closing of the sale of the
Company to The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. ("Goldman Sachs"), 85 Broad Street, New
York, NY 10004. The Company's principal office (the "Principal Office") was     
relocated to 132 Turnpike Road, Suite 210, Southborough, MA 01772, Telephone    
508-460-2400.                                                                   

The Company is subject to the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts         
governing insurance companies and to regulation by the Commissioner of Insurance
of Massachusetts. In addition, the Company is subject to the insurance laws and 
regulations of other states and jurisdictions in which it is licensed to        
operate. As of December 31, 2007, the Company and its subsidiaries had $10      
billion in assets and $12 billion of life insurance in force.                   

In connection with its purchase of the Company in December 2005, Goldman Sachs  
provided certain written assurances to the Commissioner of the Massachusetts    
Division of Insurance (the "Commissioner"). More specifically, Goldman Sachs    
agreed to make capital contributions to the Company, subject to a maximum of    
$350 million, if necessary to ensure that the Company maintains a risk-based    
capital ratio of at least 100%, pursuant to Massachusetts Insurance Law. Such   
assurances have been provided solely to the Commissioner by Goldman Sachs. These
assurances are not evidence of indebtedness or an obligation or liability of    
Goldman Sachs, and do not provide Contract Owners with any specific rights or   
recourse against Goldman Sachs.                                                 

Separate Account VA-P (the "Variable Account") is a separate investment account 
of Commonwealth Annuity and Life Insurance Company authorized by vote of its    
Board of Directors on October 27, 1994.                                         

Several Sub-Accounts of the Variable Account are available under the Pioneer    
Vision 2 contract (the "Contract") and Pioneer Vision contract (3023-95), a     
predecessor contract. (Pioneer Vision 2 and Pioneer Vision - 3023-95 are        
referred to collectively as "the contracts.") Each Sub-Account invests          
exclusively in shares of one of the following portfolios:

 TAXATION OF THE CONTRACTS, THE VARIABLE
 ACCOUNT AND THE COMPANY

The Company currently imposes no charge for taxes payable in connection with the
contracts, other than for state and local premium taxes and similar assessments 
when applicable. The Company reserves the right to impose a charge for any other
taxes that may become payable in the future in connection with the contracts or 
the Variable Account.                                                           

The Variable Account is considered to be a part of and taxed with the operations
of the Company. The Company is taxed as a life insurance company under          
subchapter L of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code"), and files a consolidated
tax return with its parent and affiliated companies.                            

The Company reserves the right to make a charge for any effect which the income,
assets or existence of the contracts or the Variable Account may have upon its  
tax. Such charge for taxes, if any, will be assessed on a fair and equitable    
basis in order to preserve equity among classes of Contract Owners ("Owners").  
The Variable Account presently is not subject to tax.

SERVICE PROVIDERS                                                               

CUSTODIAN OF SECURITIES. The Company serves as custodian of the assets of the   
Variable Account. Underlying Portfolio shares owned by the Sub-Accounts are held
on an open account basis. A Sub-Account's ownership of Underlying Portfolio     
shares is reflected on the records of the Underlying Portfolio, and is not      
represented by any transferable stock certificates.                             

MAIL ROOM AND ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES. Goldman Sachs and the Company have       
retained Security Benefit Life Insurance Company and its affiliates             
(collectively, "Security Benefit") to provide systems, administrative,          
accounting, mailroom and lockbox services and other services to the Company. The
principal administrative offices of Security Benefit are located at One Security
Benefit Place, Topeka, Kansas, 66636.

EXPERTS. The financial statements of the Company as of December 31, 2007 and    
2006 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007, and 
the financial statements of Separate Account VA-P of the Company as of December
31, 2007 and for the periods indicated, included in this Statement of Additional
Information constituting part of this Registration Statement, have been so      
included in reliance on the reports of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the Company's
independent registered public accounting firm, given on the authority of said   
firm as experts in auditing and accounting.                                     

The financial statements of the Company included herein should be considered    
only as bearing on the ability of the Company to meet its obligations under the 
Contract.                                                                       

OTHER SERVICE ARRANGEMENTS                                                      

The Company may enter into certain arrangements under which the Company (or its 
affiliates) are compensated by the investment advisers, distributors and/or     
affiliates of the underlying funds for the distribution and/or administrative   
services which we provide to the underlying funds. The amount of payments the   
Company receives from the Fund's service providers is based on a percentage of  
the assets of the particular Fund attributable to the Contract as well as       
certain other variable insurance products that the Company and/or our affiliates
may issue or administer. These percentages are negotiated and vary with each    
Fund. (These payments may be derived, in whole or in part, from the investment  
advisory fee deducted from Fund assets. Contract Owners, through their indirect 
investment in the Funds, bear the costs of these investment advisory fees; see  
the Funds' prospectuses for more information.) Some service providers may pay   
the Company significantly more than others and the amount the Company receives  
may be substantial. The percentages that we receive under these arrangements    
currently range from 0.10% to 0.45%.                                            

Certain of the Funds may also make payments to us or to Epoch under their       
distribution plans (12b-1 plans). The payment rates currently range up to 0.25% 
based on the amount of assets invested in those Funds. Payments made out of the 
assets of the Funds will reduce the amount of assets that otherwise would be    
available for investment, and will reduce the return on your investment. The    
dollar amount of future asset-based fees is not predictable because these fees  
are a percentage of the Fund's average net assets, which can fluctuate over     
time. If, however, the value of the Funds goes up, then so would the dollar     
amount of payment to the Company or to Epoch. Conversely, if the value of the   
Fund goes down, payments to the Company or to Epoch would decrease.             

The Company (and our affiliates) may profit from these payments. As of the date 
of this prospectus, we were receiving payments from each Fund's service         
providers. The Company and/or the Epoch also may directly or indirectly receive 
additional amounts or different percentages of assets under management from some
of the Funds' service providers with regard to other variable insurance products
the Company or our affiliates may issue or administer.                          

UNDERWRITERS

Effective May 1, 2008, Epoch Securities, Inc., a Delaware company located at    
132 Turnpike Road, Southborough, MA 01772 ("Epoch" or "Underwriter"), became    
principal underwriter for the Contracts. Epoch is a corporation organized and   
existing under the laws of the State of Delaware, and is a wholly-owned         
subsidiary of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. Epoch is a registered               
broker-dealer with the SEC, and a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory   
Authority ("FINRA"). Epoch replaced Security Distributors, Inc., located at     
One Security Benefit Place, Topeka, Kansas 66636, ("SDI"), which had served     
as principal underwriter from January 1, 2007. SDI had replaced VeraVest        
Investments, Inc., located at 440 Lincoln Street, Worcester, MA 01653           
("VeraVest," formerly Allmerica Investments, Inc.), which had served as         
principal underwriter and general distributor until December 31, 2006. The      
Company has effectively

ceased issuing new contracts except in connection with certain pre-existing     
contractual plans and programs.                                                 

The Company paid commissions, not to exceed 7.0% of initial purchase payments,  
to entities which sold the Contract. The Company currently does not pay direct  
commissions on additional payments to the Contracts. However, alternative       
commission schedules may be in effect that paid lower initial commission amounts
but with ongoing annual compensation of up to 1% of the Contract's Accumulated  
Value.                                                                          

To the extent permitted by NASD rules, overrides and promotional incentives or  
payments also may be provided to independent marketing organizations and        
broker-dealers based on the Contract's Accumulated Value, sales volumes, the    
performance of wholesaling functions, or other sales-related criteria.          
Additional payments may be made for other services not directly related to the  
sale of the Contract.                                                           

Commissions paid by the Company do not result in any charge to Owners or to the 
Variable Account, in addition to the charges described under CHARGES AND        
DEDUCTIONS in the Prospectus. The Company intends to recoup the commission and  
other sales expense through a combination of anticipated surrender, withdrawal  
and/or annuitization charges, profits from the Company's general account,       
including the investment earnings on amounts allocated to accumulate on a fixed 
basis in excess of the interest credited on fixed accumulations by the Company, 
and the profit, if any, from the mortality and expense risk charge.             

The aggregate amounts of commissions paid to VeraVest (2005 and 2006) and SDI   
(2007) for sales of all contracts funded by Separate Account VA-P (including    
contracts not described in the Prospectus) for the years 2005, 2006 and 2007    
were $-5,979.42, $7,271.32 and $1,264,335.15, respectively. No commissions      
were retained by VeraVest (2005 and 2006) or SDI (2007) for sales of all        
contracts funded by Separate Account VA-P (including contracts not described    
in the Prospectus) for the years 2005, 2006 and 2007. No commissions or other   
compensation were received by Epoch, directly or indirectly, from the           
Registrant during the Registrant's last fiscal year.

ANNUITY BENEFIT PAYMENTS AND ACCUMULATION UNIT CALCULATION

The method by which the Accumulated Value under the contracts is determined is  
described in detail under "Computation of Values" in the Prospectus.            

ILLUSTRATION OF ACCUMULATION UNIT CALCULATION USING HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLE. The   
Accumulation Unit calculation for a daily Valuation Period may be illustrated by
the following hypothetical example: Assume that the assets of a Sub-Account at  
the beginning of a one-day Valuation Period were $5,000,000; that the value of  
an Accumulation Unit on the previous date was $1.135000; and that during the    
Valuation Period, the investment income and net realized and unrealized capital 
gains exceed net realized and unrealized capital losses by $1,675. The          
Accumulation Unit Value at the end of the current Valuation Period would be     
calculated as follows:                                                          

                                                        [Enlarge/Download Table]
                                                                                          
(1) Accumulation Unit Value -- Previous Valuation Period                        $ 1.135000

(2) Value of Assets -- Beginning of Valuation Period                            $5,000,000

(3) Excess of Investment Income and Net Gains Over Capital Losses               $    1,675

(4) Adjusted Gross Investment Rate for the Valuation Period (3) divided by (2)    0.000335

(5) Annual Charge (one-day equivalent of 1.40% per annum)                         0.000039

(6) Net Investment Rate (4) - (5)                                                 0.000296

(7) Net Investment Factor 1.000000 + (6)                                          1.000296

(8) Accumulation Unit Value -- Current Period (1) x (7)                         $ 1.135336

Conversely, if unrealized capital losses and charges for expenses and taxes     
exceeded investment income and net realized capital gains by $1,675, the        
Accumulation Unit Value at the end of the Valuation Period would have been      
$1.134576.                                                                      

The method for determining the amount of annuity benefit payments is described  
in detail under "Annuity Benefit Payments" in the Prospectus.                   

ILLUSTRATION OF VARIABLE ANNUITY BENEFIT PAYMENT CALCULATION USING HYPOTHETICAL 
EXAMPLE. The determination of the Annuity Unit Value and the variable annuity   
benefit payment may be illustrated by the following hypothetical example: Assume
an Annuitant has 40,000 Accumulation Units in a Variable Account, and that the  
value of an Accumulation Unit on the Valuation Date used to determine the amount
of the first variable annuity payment is $1.120000. Therefore, the Accumulated  
Value of the Contract is $44,800 (40,000 x $1.120000). Assume also that the     
Owner elects an option for which the first monthly payment is $6.57 per $1,000  
of Accumulated Value applied. Assuming no premium tax or surrender charge, the  
first monthly payment would be $44.80 ($44,800 divided by $1,000) multiplied by 
$6.57, or $294.34.                                                              

Next, assume that the Annuity Unit value for the assumed interest rate of 3.5%  
per annum for the Valuation Date as of which the first payment was calculated   
was 1.100000. Annuity Unit values will not be the same as Accumulation Unit     
values because the former reflect the 3.5% assumed interest rate used in the    
annuity rate calculations. When the Annuity Unit value of $1.100000 is divided  
into the first monthly payment the number of Annuity Units represented by that  
payment is determined to be 267.5818. The value of this same number of Annuity  
Units will be paid in each subsequent month under most options. Assume further  
that the net investment factor for the Valuation Period applicable

to the next annuity payment is 1.000190. Multiplying this factor by .999906 (the
one-day adjustment factor for the assumed interest rate of 3.5% per annum)      
produces a factor of 1.000096. This then is multiplied by the Annuity Unit value
on the immediately preceding Valuation Date (assumed here to be $1.105000). The 
result is an Annuity Unit value of $1.105106 for the current monthly payment.   
The current monthly payment then is determined by multiplying the number of     
Annuity Units by the current Annuity Unit value, or 267.5818 times $1.105106,   
which produces a current monthly payment of $295.71.                            

METHOD FOR DETERMINING COMMUTED VALUE ON VARIABLE ANNUITY PERIOD CERTAIN OPTIONS
AND ILLUSTRATION USING HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLE. The Contract offers both commutable
and non-commutable fixed period certain annuity options and commutable variable 
period certain options. A commutable option gives the Annuitant the right to    
exchange any remaining payments for a lump sum payment based on the commuted    
value. The Commuted Value is the present value of remaining payments calculated 
at 3.5% interest. The determination of the Commuted Value may be illustrated by 
the following hypothetical example.                                             

Assume a commutable period certain option is elected. The number of Annuity     
Units on which each payment is based would be calculated using the Surrender    
Value less any premium tax rather than the Accumulated Value. Assume this       
results in 250.0000 Annuity Units. Assume the Commuted Value is requested with  
60 monthly payments remaining and a current Annuity Unit Value of $1.200000.    
Based on these assumptions, the dollar amount of remaining payments would be    
$300 a month for 60 months. The present value at 3.5% of all remaining payments 
would be $16,560.72.                                                            

 ENHANCED AUTOMATIC TRANSFER (DOLLAR COST AVERAGING) PROGRAM

To the extent permitted by law, the Company reserves the right to offer an      
Enhanced Automatic Transfer (Dollar Cost Averaging) Program from time to time.  
If an Owner elects automatic transfers while the enhanced program is in effect, 
the Company will credit an enhanced interest rate to eligible payments made to  
the Enhanced Automatic Transfer Program. Eligible payments:                     

    -    must be new payments to the Contract, including the initial
payment,                                          

         -    must be allocated to the Fixed Account, which will be the source
account,                                          

          -    must be automatically transferred out of the Fixed Account to one
   or more Sub-Accounts over a specified time period and

      -    will receive the enhanced rate while they remain in the Fixed
Account.                                          

Any new eligible payments made to an existing Enhanced Automatic Transfer       
program will start a new Enhanced Automatic Transfer program. In this case, the 
following rules apply:                                                          

   -    The money remaining in the Fixed Account from the original
       program will be combined with the new eligible payment to
determine the new monthly transfer amount.        

       -    The new monthly transfer amount will be transferred out of the
          Fixed Account in accordance with the allocation instructions
              specified for the new payment. If no allocation instructions are
     specified with the new eligible payment, the allocation
              instructions for the original eligible payment will be used. The
              new monthly transfer amount will be transferred out of the Fixed
          Account on a LIFO (last-in, first-out basis) to the selected
               Sub-Accounts on the date designated for the new eligible payment.

        -    A new enhanced interest rate may be applied to the new eligible
              payment, while the money remaining in the Fixed Account from the
            original program will continue to receive the enhanced rate in
effect at the time the older payment was received.

DISCONTINUATION OF THE
 MINIMUM GUARANTEED ANNUITY PAYOUT (M-GAP) RIDER

Effective January 31, 2002, the Company terminated the availability of the      
optional Minimum Guaranteed Annuity Payout (M-GAP) Rider. This termination does 
not affect M-GAP Riders issued prior to January 31, 2002 except that Owners who 
have previously elected the M-GAP Rider will not be able to purchase a new M-GAP
Rider under the repurchase feature.                                             

The M-GAP Rider provides a guaranteed minimum amount of fixed annuity lifetime  
income during the annuity payout phase, after a ten year or fifteen year waiting
period, subject to the conditions described below. On each Contract anniversary 
a Minimum Guaranteed Annuity Payout Benefit Base (less any applicable premium   
taxes) is determined. The Minimum Guaranteed Annuity Payout Benefit Base is the 
value that will be annuitized should you exercise the Rider. In order to        
exercise the Rider, a fixed annuitization option involving a life contingency   
must be selected. Annuitization under this Rider will occur at the Company's    
guaranteed annuity option rates listed under the Annuity Option Tables in the   
Contract. The Minimum Guaranteed Annuity Payout Benefit Base is equal to the    
greatest of:                                                                    

(a)  the Accumulated Value increased by any positive Market Value     
         Adjustment, if applicable, on the Contract Anniversary that the M-GAP
Benefit Base is being determined;                           

  (b)  the Accumulated Value on the effective date of the Rider compounded
     daily at an effective annual yield of 5% plus gross payments made
   thereafter compounded daily at an effective annual yield of 5%,
         starting on the date each payment is applied, proportionately reduced
to reflect withdrawals; or                                  

  (c)  the highest Accumulated Value on any Contract anniversary since the
 Rider effective date, as determined after being increased for
   subsequent payments and any positive Market Value Adjustment if
      applicable and proportionately reduced for subsequent withdrawals.

For each withdrawal described in (b) and (c) above, the proportionate reduction 
is calculated by multiplying the (b) or (c) value, whichever is applicable,     
determined immediately prior to the withdrawal by the following fraction:

EXERCISING THE M-GAP RIDER.                                                     

-    The Owner may only exercise the M-GAP Rider within thirty days after any   
Contract anniversary following the expiration of a ten or fifteen-year
waiting period from the effective date of the Rider.                  

-    The Owner may only annuitize under a fixed annuity payout option involving 
   a life contingency as provided in "DESCRIPTION OF VARIABLE ANNUITY PAYOUT
OPTIONS" under DESCRIPTION OF THE CONTRACT in the Prospectus.         

 9

P-->485BPOS83rd Page of 210TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 83rd
-    The Owner may only annuitize at the Company's guaranteed fixed annuity     
option rates listed under the Annuity Option Tables in the Contract.  

TERMINATING THE M-GAP RIDER.                                                    

The Owner may not terminate the M-GAP Rider prior to the seventh Contract       
anniversary after the effective date of the Rider. The Owner may terminate the  
Rider at any time after the seventh Contract anniversary following the effective
date of the Rider. The Rider will terminate automatically upon surrender of the 
Contract or the date that a death benefit is payable if the Contract is not     
continued under "THE SPOUSE OF THE OWNER AS BENEFICIARY" (see THE VARIABLE      
ANNUITY POLICIES).                                                              

From time to time the Company may illustrate minimum guaranteed income amounts  
under the M-GAP Rider for individuals based on a variety of assumptions,        
including varying rates of return on the value of the Contract during the       
accumulation phase, annuity payout periods, annuity payout options and M-GAP    
Rider waiting periods. Any assumed rates of return are for purposes of          
illustration only and are not intended as a representation of past or future    
investment rates of return.                                                     

For example, the illustration below assumes an initial payment of $100,000 for  
an Annuitant age 60 (at issue) and exercise of an M-GAP Rider with a ten-year   
waiting period. The illustration assumes that no subsequent payments or         
withdrawals are made and that the annuity payout option is a Life Annuity With  
120 Monthly Payments Guaranteed. The values below have been computed based on a 
5% net rate of return and are the guaranteed minimums that would be received    
under the M-GAP Rider. The minimum guaranteed benefit base amounts are the      
values that will be annuitized. Minimum guaranteed annual income values are     
based on a fixed annuity payout.                                                

                                                                [Download Table]

15              $207,892       $17,695 

(1)  Other fixed annuity options involving a life contingency other than Life   
Annuity With 120 Monthly Payments Guaranteed are available. See       
"DESCRIPTION OF VARIABLE ANNUITY PAYOUT OPTIONS." 

The M-GAP Rider does not create Accumulated Value or guarantee performance of   
any investment option. Because this Rider is based on guaranteed actuarial      
factors, the level of lifetime income that it guarantees may often be less than 
the level that would be provided by applying the then current annuity factors.  
Therefore, the Rider should be regarded as providing a guarantee of a minimum   
amount of annuity income. As described above, withdrawals will reduce the       
benefit base.

 PERFORMANCE INFORMATION

Performance information for a Sub-Account may be compared, in reports and       
promotional literature, to certain indices described in the Prospectus under    
PERFORMANCE INFORMATION. In addition, the Company may provide advertising, sales
literature, periodic publications or other material information on various      
topics of interest to Owners and prospective Owners. These topics may include   
the relationship between sectors of the economy and the economy as a whole and  
its effect on various securities markets, investment strategies and techniques  
(such as value investing, market timing, dollar cost averaging, asset           
allocation, constant ratio transfer and account rebalancing), the advantages and
disadvantages of investing in tax-deferred and taxable investments, customer    
profiles and hypothetical purchase and investment scenarios, financial          
management and tax and retirement planning, and investment alternatives to      
certificates of deposit and other financial instruments, including comparisons  
between the Contract and the characteristics of and market for such financial   
instruments. Total Return data and supplemental total return information may be 
advertised based on the period of time that an Underlying Portfolio and/or an   
underlying Sub-Account have been in existence, even if longer than the period of
time that the Contract has been offered. The results for any period prior to a  
Contract being offered will be calculated as if the Contract had been offered   
during that period of time, with all charges assumed to be those applicable to  
the Contract.                                                                   

Total return data, however, may be advertised based on the period of time that  
the underlying Sub-Accounts and the Underlying Portfolios have been in          
existence. The results for any period prior to the Contract being offered will  
be calculated as if the Contract had been offered during that period of time,   
with all charges assumed to be those applicable to the Contract.                

TOTAL RETURN 
"Total Return" refers to the total of the income generated by an investment in a
Sub-Account and of the changes of value of the principal invested (due to       
realized and unrealized capital gains or losses) for a specified period, reduced
by the Sub-Account's asset charge and any applicable surrender charge which     
would be assessed upon complete withdrawal of the investment.                   

Total Return figures are calculated by standardized methods prescribed by rules 
of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). The quotations are       
computed by finding the average annual compounded rates of return over the      
specified periods that would equate the initial amount invested to the ending   
redeemable values, according to the following formula:                          

P(1 + T) (TO THE POWER OF (n)) = ERV                  

       Where:     P = a hypothetical initial payment to the Variable
Account of $1,000       

T = average annual total return 

n = number of years             

           ERV = the ending redeemable value of the $1,000
                  payment at the end of the specified period

The calculation of Total Return includes the annual charges against the assets  
of the Sub-Account. This charge is 1.40% on an annual basis. The calculation of 
ending redeemable value assumes (1) the Contract was issued at the beginning of 
the period, and (2) a complete surrender of the Contract at the end of the      
period. The deduction of the surrender charge, if any, applicable at the end of 
the period is included in the calculation, according to the following schedule:

No surrender charge is deducted upon expiration of the periods specified above. 
In all Contract years, a certain amount (withdrawal without surrender charge    
amount, as described in the Prospectus) is not subject to the surrender charge. 

The calculations of Total Return include the deduction of the $30 annual        
Contract fee.                                                                   

SUPPLEMENTAL TOTAL RETURN INFORMATION                                           

The Supplemental Total Return Information in this section refers to the total of
the income generated by an investment in a Sub-Account and of the changes of    
value of the principal invested (due to realized and unrealized capital gains or
losses) for a specified period reduced by the Sub-Account's asset charges. It is
assumed, however, that the investment is NOT withdrawn at the end of each       
period.                                                                         

The quotations of Supplemental Total Return are computed by finding the average 
annual compounded rates of return over the specified periods that would equate  
the initial amount invested to the ending values, according to the following    
formula:

P(1 + T) (TO THE POWER OF (n)) = EV                   

       Where:     P = a hypothetical initial payment to the Variable
Account of $1,000       

T = average annual total return 

n = number of years             

                EV = the ending value of the $1,000 payment at the
    end of the specified period.

The calculation of Supplemental Total Return reflects the 1.40% annual charge   
against the assets of the Sub-Accounts. The ending value assumes that the       
Contract is NOT surrendered at the end of the specified period, and therefore   
there is no adjustment for the surrender charge that would be applicable if the 
Contract was surrendered at the end of the period. The calculation of           
supplemental total return does not include the deduction of the $30 annual      
Contract fee.                                                                   

PERFORMANCE TABLES. Quotations of average annual total return as shown in Table 
1A are calculated in the manner prescribed by the SEC and show the percentage   
rate of return of a hypothetical initial investment of $1,000 for the most      
recent one, five and ten year period or for a period covering the time the      
Sub-Account has been in existence, if less than the prescribed periods. The     
calculation is adjusted to reflect the deduction of the annual Sub-Account asset
charge of 1.40%, the $30 annual Contract fee, the Underlying Portfolio charges  
and the surrender charge which would be assessed if the investment were         
completely withdrawn at the end of the specified period. The calculation is not 
adjusted to reflect the deduction of any rider charge.                          

Quotations of supplemental average total returns, as shown in Table 1B, are     
calculated in exactly the same manner and for the same periods of time except   
that they do not reflect the Contract fee and assume that the Contract is not   
surrendered at the end of the periods shown.                                    

The performance shown in Tables 2A and 2B is calculated in exactly the same     
manner as that in Tables 1A and 1B, respectively; however, the period of time is
based on the Underlying Portfolio's lifetime, which may predate the             
Sub-Account's inception date. These performance calculations are based on the   
assumption that the Sub-Account corresponding to the applicable Underlying      
Portfolio was actually in existence throughout the stated period and that the   
contractual charges and expenses during that period were equal to those         
currently assessed under the Contract.

*    These portfolios include a charge for 12b-1 fees. These hypothetical       
  performance figures are based upon the historical performance of the non
    12b-1 class of shares, but adjusted to reflect the effect of the 12b-1 fee
on performance.                                                       

(1)  Many of the Underlying Portfolios in which the Sub-Accounts invest existed 
     prior to the date the Sub-Accounts commenced operations. In this table, the
specified period is based on the inception date of each Underlying    
   Portfolio rather than the inception date of the Sub-Account. As such, the
   table represents what the performance of a Sub-Account would have been if
the Sub-Account had been both in existence and invested in the        
corresponding Underlying Portfolio since the date indicated. In that  
    respect, these numbers are hypothetical and are not the actual performance
numbers for the Sub-Accounts or the Contract.

*    These portfolios include a charge for 12b-1 fees. These hypothetical       
  performance figures are based upon the historical performance of the non
    12b-1 class of shares, but adjusted to reflect the effect of the 12b-1 fee
on performance.                                                       

(1)  Many of the Underlying Portfolios in which the Sub-Accounts invest existed 
     prior to the date the Sub-Accounts commenced operations. In this table, the
specified period is based on the inception date of each Underlying    
    Portfolios rather than the inception date of the Sub-Account. As such, the
   table represents what the performance of a Sub-Account would have been if
the Sub-Account had been both in existence and invested in the        
corresponding Underlying Portfolio since the date indicated. In that  
    respect, these numbers are hypothetical and are not the actual performance
numbers for the Sub-Accounts or the Contract.

YIELD AND EFFECTIVE YIELD - THE PIONEER MONEY MARKET SUB-ACCOUNT                

Set forth below is yield and effective yield information for the Pioneer Money  
Market Sub-Account for the seven-day period ended December 31, 2007:            

                                                                [Download Table]
                       
Yield             1.69%
Effective Yield   1.71%

The yield and effective yield figures are calculated by standardized methods    
prescribed by rules of the SEC. Under those methods, the yield quotation is     
computed by determining the net change (exclusive of capital changes) in the    
value of a hypothetical pre-existing account having a balance of one            
accumulation unit of the Sub-Account at the beginning of the period, dividing   
the difference by the value of the account at the beginning of the same period  
to obtain the base period return, and then multiplying the return for a         
seven-day base period by (365/7), with the resulting yield carried to the       
nearest hundredth of one percent.                                               

The Pioneer Money Market Sub-Account computes effective yield by compounding the
unannualized base period return by using the formula:                           

 Effective Yield = [(base period return + 1)(TO THE POWER OF 365/7)] - 1

The calculations of yield and effective yield reflect the $30 annual Contract   
fee.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM       

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of                                   
Commonwealth Annuity and Life Insurance Company:                                

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related    
consolidated statements of income, shareholder's equity, comprehensive income   
and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial          
position of Commonwealth Annuity and Life Insurance Company at December 31,
2007 and 2006, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each    
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007 in conformity with     
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.       
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's              
management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial     
statements based on our audits.  We conducted our audits of these statements    
in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight     
Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the    
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements     
are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test      
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial         
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant            
estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement    
presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our    
opinion.

COMMONWEALTH ANNUITY AND LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY                                 
(A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.)                    
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS                                  
FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007 
1. ORGANIZATION                                                                 

Commonwealth Annuity and Life Insurance Company ("the Company") is a stock life 
insurance company organized under the laws of Massachusetts, and is a           
wholly-owned subsidiary of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. ("Goldman Sachs"). At  
December 31, 2007, the Company manages blocks of variable annuity, variable     
universal life and minor blocks of group retirement products. In 2007, the      
Company began issuance of 403(b) variable annuity products. This requires the   
Company to have an affiliated broker dealer to act as principal underwriter and 
distributor. The Company signed an agreement with Epoch Securities Inc.         
("Epoch"), a Delaware corporation, and a Financial Industry Regulatory Authority
("FINRA") member firm, to serve as principal underwriter for several of the     
Company's variable products. Epoch is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Goldman      
Sachs (see Note 21 - Related Party Transactions). On September 1, 2006, the     
Company changed its name from Allmerica Financial Life Insurance and Annuity    
Company ("AFLIAC") to the current name.                                         

On December 30, 2005, Goldman Sachs acquired all outstanding common shares of   
the Company from The Hanover Insurance Group ("THG") (the "Transaction"). Prior 
to December 1, 2005 THG was named Allmerica Financial Corporation. Immediately  
preceding the Transaction, the Company distributed its ownership in certain     
wholly-owned subsidiaries, First Allmerica Financial Life Insurance Company     
("FAFLIC"), VeraVest Investments, Inc. ("VeraVest"), and Allmerica Financial    
Investment Management Services, Inc ("AFIMS") directly to THG as a dividend to  
shareholders. The Company's remaining non-insurance subsidiaries were           
distributed to FAFLIC as a capital contribution prior to the Transaction.       

Concurrent with the Transaction, the Company entered into several servicing     
agreements to provide certain support of its business. Transitional service     
agreements with THG provided operational support, system and policy conversion  
support, accounting and other services until December 31, 2006. An operational  
servicing agreement was executed with Security Benefit Life Insurance Company   
("Se2") on December 30, 2005, to provide customer and agent support and perform 
other key policy administration and operational functions. As of December 31,
2006, these operational functions were transferred to Se2.                      

2. BASIS OF PRESENTATION                                                        

The accompanying audited financial statements have been prepared in accordance  
with generally accepted accounting principles ("US GAAP"). The Transaction was  
accounted for using the purchase method under Statement of Financial Accounting 
Standards ("SFAS") No. 141, "Business Combinations" ("SFAS No. 141") and SFAS   
No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" ("SFAS No. 142") and purchase   
accounting adjustments were "pushed down" to the Company's financial statements.
Under the purchase method of accounting, assets acquired and liabilities assumed
were recorded at estimated fair value at the date of purchase, and updated as of
December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006. Consequently, the Company experienced  
decreased amortization of acquisition expenses as compared to historical        
experience when it was owned by THG. See Note 5 - Proforma, for a proforma      
income statement containing the changes.                                        

Prior to December 30, 2005, the consolidated accounts of the Company included   
the accounts of FAFLIC and certain wholly-owned non-insurance subsidiaries      
(principally brokerage and investment advisory subsidiaries). In the            
accompanying financial statements, "predecessor" information includes these     
subsidiaries, while "successor" information represents the Company on a         
stand-alone basis and includes purchase accounting adjustments as indicated in  
Note 4 - Purchase Accounting.                                                   

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires the 
Company to make estimates and assumptions and disclosure of contingent assets   
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount 
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could      
differ from those estimates.

COMMONWEALTH ANNUITY AND LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY                                 
(A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.)                    
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS                                  
FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007 
3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES                                   
A. VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS                                           

The Company accounts for its investments in accordance with SFAS No. 115,       
"Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities", ("SFAS No.  
115"). At the time of purchase, fixed maturity securities are classified based  
on the Company's intent as either held-to-maturity, trading or                  
available-for-sale.                                                             

Fixed maturities and equity securities are classified as available-for-sale.    
Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value, with the unrealized    
gains and losses, net of tax, reported in accumulated other comprehensive       
income, a separate component of shareholder's equity. The amortized cost of     
fixed maturities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of      
discounts to maturity. Such amortization is included in investment income.      

Policy loans are carried primarily at unpaid principal balances.                

Realized investment gains and losses, other than those related to separate      
accounts for which the Company does not bear the investment risk and that meet  
the conditions for separate account reporting under American Institute of       
Certified Public Accountants ("AICPA") Statement of Position 03-1, "Accounting  
and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Non-Traditional Long-Duration
Contract and for Separate Accounts" ("SOP 03-1"), are reported as a component of
revenues based upon specific identification of the investment assets sold. When 
an other-than-temporary decline in value of a specific investment is deemed to  
have occurred, the Company reduces the cost basis of the investment to fair     
value. This reduction is permanent and is recognized as a realized investment   
loss. Realized investment gains and losses related to separate accounts that    
meet the conditions for separate account reporting under SOP 03-1 accrue to and 
are borne by the contract holder.                                               

B. CLOSED BLOCK                                                       

The predecessor Consolidated Statements of Operations include the activity of   
the FAFLIC Closed Block of participating policies. The FAFLIC Closed Block      
consists of certain individual life insurance participating policies, individual
deferred annuities and supplemental contracts not involving life contingencies, 
which were in force as of the October 16, 1995 demutualization.                 

The purpose of the Closed Block is to protect the policy dividend expectations  
of such FAFLIC dividend paying policies and contracts. Unless the Massachusetts 
Commissioner of Insurance consents to an earlier termination, the Closed Block  
will continue to be in effect until the date none of the Closed Block policies  
are in force. FAFLIC allocated to the Closed Block assets in an amount that is  
expected to produce cash flows which, together with future revenues from the    
Closed Block business, are reasonably sufficient to support the Closed Block    
business.                                                                       

Following the Transaction, there was no impact to the successor financial       
statements as the Closed Block remains with FAFLIC.                             

C. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS                                              

Financial instruments are reflected in the balance sheet on a trade-date basis. 
The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to
sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between 
market participants at the measurement date (the exit price). The Company       
evaluates and monitors each financial instrument individually and, when         
appropriate, obtains collateral or other security to minimize losses. Fair value
measurements are not adjusted for transaction costs.                            

In the normal course of business, the Company enters into transactions involving
various types of financial instruments, including U.S. government and agency    
securities, liquid mortgage products, investment-grade corporate bonds, money   
market securities, state, municipal and provincial obligations, swap contracts, 
option contracts, futures contracts and high yield mutual funds. The high yield 
fund invests in high yield, fixed income securities that, at the time of        
purchase, are non-investment grade. This is classified as Equity Securities on  
the Company's balance sheet.

C. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)                                  

The Company adopted SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements" ("SFAS 157"), as of 
the beginning of 2007. SFAS No. 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy that     
prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The  
hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active      
markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurements) and the      
lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements). The three levels 
of the fair value hierarchy under SFAS No. 157 are described below:             

BASIS OF FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT                                                 

Level 1   Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the 
       measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities;

Level 2   Quoted prices in markets that are not active or financial instruments 
       for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or
indirectly;                                                 

Level 3   Prices or valuations that require inputs that are both significant to 
the fair value measurement and unobservable.                

A financial instrument's level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the  
lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. See
"Note 3O - New and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements" for a discussion of the   
impact of adopting SFAS No. 157.                                                

In determining fair value, the Company separates its financial instruments into 
two categories: cash instruments and derivative contracts. See "Note 3D - Cash
Instruments" and "Note 3E - Derivatives and Hedging Activities" below.          

D. CASH INSTRUMENTS                                                   

The Company's cash instruments are generally classified within level 1 or level 
2 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market       
prices, broker or dealer quotations, or alternative pricing sources with        
reasonable levels of price transparency. The types of instruments valued based  
on quoted market prices in active markets include most U.S. government and      
agency securities, many other sovereign government obligations, and most money  
market securities. Such instruments are generally classified within level 1 of  
the fair value hierarchy. The Company does not adjust the quoted price for such 
instruments, even in situations where the company holds a large position and a  
sale could reasonably impact the quoted price.                                  

The types of instruments valued based on quoted prices in markets that are not  
active, broker or dealer quotations, or alternative pricing sources with        
reasonable levels of price transparency include most investment-grade and       
high-yield corporate bonds, most mortgage products, state, and municipal        
obligations. Such instruments are generally classified within level 2 of the    
fair value hierarchy.                                                           

Certain cash instruments are classified within level 3 of the fair value        
hierarchy because they trade infrequently and therefore have little or no price 
transparency. Such instruments include private equity and subordinated          
obligations. The transaction price is initially used as the best estimate of    
fair value. Accordingly, when a pricing model is used to value such an          
instrument, the model is adjusted so that the model value at inception equals   
the transaction price. This valuation is adjusted only when changes to inputs   
and assumptions are corroborated by evidence such as transactions in similar    
instruments, completed or pending third-party transactions in the underlying    
investment or comparable entities, subsequent rounds of financing,              
recapitalizations and other transactions across the capital structure, offerings
in the equity or debt capital markets, and changes in financial ratios or cash  
flows.                                                                          

For positions that are not traded in active markets or are subject to transfer  
restrictions, valuations are adjusted to reflect illiquidity and/or             
non-transferability, and such adjustments are generally based on available      
market evidence. In the absence of such evidence, management's best estimate is 
used.

(A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.)                    
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS                                  
FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007 
3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)                       
E. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES                                 

Derivative contracts can be exchange-traded or over-the-counter ("OTC").        
Exchange-traded derivatives typically fall within level 1 or level 2 of the fair
value hierarchy depending on whether they are deemed to be actively traded or   
not. The Company generally values exchange-traded derivatives within portfolios 
using models which calibrate to market clearing levels and eliminate timing     
differences between the closing price of the exchange-traded derivatives and    
their underlying cash instruments. In such cases, exchange-traded derivatives   
are classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.                      

As of the Transaction, the Company entered into certain OTC derivatives,        
primarily equity put options and interest rate swaptions, to hedge certain      
equity market, credit and interest rate risk. None of these post-transaction    
instruments qualify for hedge accounting, and are carried at fair value or      
amounts that approximate fair value.                                            

OTC derivatives are valued using market transactions and other market evidence  
whenever possible, including market-based inputs to models, model calibration to
market clearing transactions, broker or dealer quotations or alternative pricing
sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. Where models are used, the
selection of a particular model to value an OTC derivative depends upon the     
contractual terms of, and specific risks inherent in, the instrument as well as 
the availability of pricing information in the market. The firm generally uses  
similar models to value similar instruments. Valuation models require a variety 
of inputs, including contractual terms, market prices, yield curves, credit     
curves, measures of volatility, prepayment rates and correlations of such       
inputs. For OTC derivatives that trade in liquid markets, such as generic       
forwards, swaps and options, model inputs can generally be verified and model   
selection does not involve significant management judgment. Such instruments are
typically classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.                

Certain OTC derivatives trade in less liquid markets with limited pricing       
information, and the determination of fair value for these derivatives is       
inherently more difficult. Such instruments are classified within level 3 of the
fair value hierarchy. Where the Company does not have corroborating market      
evidence to support significant model inputs and cannot verify the model to     
market transactions, transaction price is initially used as the best estimate of
fair value. Accordingly, when a pricing model is used to value such an          
instrument, the model is adjusted so that the model value at inception equals   
the transaction price. The valuations of these less liquid OTC derivatives are  
typically based on level 1 and/or level 2 inputs that can be observed in the    
market, as well as unobservable level 3 inputs. Subsequent to initial           
recognition, the Company updates the level 1 and level 2 inputs to reflect      
observable market changes, with resulting gains and losses reflected within     
level 3. Level 3 inputs are only changed when corroborated by evidence such as  
similar market transactions, third-party pricing services and/or broker or      
dealer quotations, or other empirical market data. In circumstances where the   
Company cannot verify the model value to market transactions, it is possible    
that a different valuation model could produce a materially different estimate  
of fair value.                                                                  

When appropriate, valuations are adjusted for various factors such as liquidity,
bid/offer spreads and credit considerations. Such adjustments are generally     
based on available market evidence. In the absence of such evidence,            
management's best estimate is used.                                             

In November 2006, per an investment management agreement with Goldman Sachs     
Asset Management, L.P. ("GSAM"), the Company began to trade futures             
contracts. Exchange-traded futures and options are effected through a           
regulated exchange and positions are marked to market on a daily basis. The     
Company has little exposure to credit-related losses in the event of            
nonperformance by counterparties to such financial instruments. From time to    
time, futures contracts are terminated. The termination of such contracts       
would be recognized in income as they are marked to market on a daily basis.    
Terminations would not materially impact earnings as any payment due upon       
termination represents one day of market exposure. The clearinghouse            
guarantees the performance of both counterparties which mitigates credit risk.  

Prior to the Transaction, the Company formally documented all relationships     
between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk-management    
objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. This process 
included linking all derivatives that were designated as fair value, cash flow  
or foreign currency hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the balance    
sheet or to specific forecasted transactions. The Company also formally         
assessed, both at the hedge's inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the    
derivatives that were used in hedging transactions were highly effective in     
offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. When it was    
determined that a derivative was not highly effective as a hedge or that it has 
ceased to be a highly effective hedge, the Company discontinued hedge accounting
prospectively, as discussed below.

COMMONWEALTH ANNUITY AND LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY                                 
(A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.)                    
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS                                  
FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007 
3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)                       
E. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES (CONTINUED)                     

The Company discontinued hedge accounting prospectively when (1) it is          
determined that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in  
the fair value or cash flows of a hedge item, including forecasted transactions;
(2) the derivative expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised; (3) the        
derivative is no longer designated as a hedge instrument, because it is unlikely
that a forecasted transaction will occur; or (4) management determines that     
designation of the derivative as a hedge instrument is no longer appropriate.   

F. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS                                          

Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, amounts due from banks and      
highly liquid debt instruments held in the ordinary course of business. None of 
this is restricted or segregated for specific business reasons. Approximately   
$37.2 million is held at one financial institution at December 31, 2007.        

     G. DEFERRED POLICY ACQUISITION COSTS ("DAC") AND DEFERRED SALES INDUCEMENTS
("DSI")                                                               

DAC consists of commissions, ceding commissions, and other costs, which vary    
with, and are primarily related to, the production of revenues. The Company     
defers sales inducements generated by variable annuities that offer enhanced    
crediting rates or bonus payments. As part of the recording of fair value       
purchase accounting due to the acquisition of the Company, DAC and DSI were     
written down to zero as of the Transaction date.                                

Subsequent to the Transaction, DAC and DSI balances primarily were created via  
the deferral of ceding commissions and bonus interest credits paid in the       
reinsurance of in force contracts. DAC and DSI amortization is reviewed         
periodically and adjusted retrospectively when the Company revises its estimate 
of current or future gross profits to be recognized from these products.        
Acquisition costs and sales inducements related to variable annuity products are
amortized in proportion to total estimated gross profits from investment yields,
mortality, surrender charges and expense margins over the expected life of the  
contracts. (See Note 16 - Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs for further         
discussion).                                                                    

H. REINSURANCE                                                        

Reinsurance accounting is followed for ceded and assumed transactions when the  
risk transfer provisions of SFAS No. 113, "Accounting and Reporting for         
Reinsurance of Short-Duration and Long-Duration Contracts," have been met. To   
meet risk transfer requirements, a long duration reinsurance contract must      
transfer mortality or morbidity risks, and subject the reinsurer to a reasonable
possibility of a significant loss.                                              

With respect to ceded reinsurance, the valuation of claims recoverable depends  
on whether the underlying claim is a reported claim, or a future policy benefit.
For reported claims, the Company values reinsurance recoverables at the time the
underlying claim is recognized, in accordance with contract terms. For future   
policy benefits, the Company estimates the amount of reinsurance recoverables   
based on the terms of the reinsurance contracts and historical reinsurance      
recovery information and applies that information to the future policy benefit  
estimates. The reinsurance recoverables are based on what the Company believes  
are reasonable estimates and the balance is disclosed separately in the         
financial statements. However, the ultimate amount of the reinsurance           
recoverable is not known until all claims are settled. Reinsurance contracts do 
not relieve the Company from its obligations to policyholders. Failure of       
reinsurers to honor their obligations could result in losses to the Company;    
consequently, allowances are established for amounts deemed uncollectible.      

See Note 15 - Reinsurance for further discussion.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS                                  
FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007 
3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)                       
I. PROPERTY, EQUIPMENT AND CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE                       

Property, equipment, leasehold improvements and capitalized software are stated 
at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is        
provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the  
related assets. Certain costs of software developed or obtained for internal use
are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the useful life of  
the software. Amortization of leasehold improvements is provided using the      
straight-line method over the lesser of the term of the leases or the estimated 
useful life of the improvements.                                                

The Company tests for the potential impairment of long-lived assets whenever    
events or changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amounts may not be 
fully recoverable in accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the          
Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets." The Company recognizes impairment 
losses only when the carrying amounts of long-lived assets exceed the sum of the
undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition
of the assets. In such cases, the Company reduces the carrying value of the     
asset to fair value. Fair values are estimated using discounted cash flow       
analysis. As part of the recording of purchase accounting due to the acquisition
of the Company in 2005, $3.0 million of capitalized assets were written off.    

J. GOODWILL/VALUE OF BUSINESS ACQUIRED ("VOBA")                       

Goodwill is the cost of an acquired company in excess of the fair value of its  
identifiable net assets at acquisition date. Relating to the Transaction and in 
accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 142, an analysis was done to assign  
purchase price to the assets and liabilities of the business. The Company       
recorded a purchase price of $333.3 million as part of the Transaction,         
including the fair value allocation of other net assets and the establishment of
VOBA (See Note 4 - Purchase Accounting). As part of the purchase accounting and 
the fair value analysis described above, no separate or additional value related
to goodwill was recognized.                                                     

K. SEPARATE ACCOUNTS                                                  

Separate account assets and liabilities represent segregated funds administered 
and invested by the Company for the benefit of variable annuity and variable    
life insurance contractholders. Assets consist principally of mutual funds,     
bonds, common stocks, and short-term obligations at market value. The investment
income and gains and losses of these accounts generally accrue to the           
contractholders and, therefore, are not included in the Company's net income.   
However, the Company's net income reflects fees assessed and earned on fund     
values of these contracts. See Note 7 - Adoption of Statement of Position 03-1, 
Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Nontraditional    
Long-Duration Contracts and for Separate Accounts.                              

Separate account assets representing contract holder funds are measured at fair 
value and reported as a summary total in the Balance Sheet, with an equivalent  
summary total reported for related liabilities. The open-ended mutual funds in  
the separate accounts produce a daily net asset value that is validated with a  
sufficient level of observable activity to support classification of the fair   
value measurement as level 1, under SFAS No. 157.                               

L. POLICY LIABILITIES AND ACCRUALS                                    

Future policy benefits are liabilities for annuity, life, and health products.  
Such liabilities are established in amounts adequate to meet the estimated      
future obligations of policies in force. Future policy benefits for individual  
life insurance and annuity policies are computed using interest rates ranging   
from 3 1/2 % to 9 1/2 % for annuities and 3% to 6% for life insurance.          
Mortality, morbidity and withdrawal assumptions for all policies are based on   
the Company's own experience and industry standards. Liabilities for universal  
life, variable universal life and variable annuities include deposits received  
from customers and investment earnings on their fund balances, less             
administrative charges. Universal life fund balances are also assessed mortality
and surrender charges. Liabilities for variable annuities include a reserve for 
guaranteed minimum death benefits ("GMDB") in excess of contract values. The    
liabilities associated with traditional life insurance products are computed    
using the net level premium method for individual life and annuity policies, and
are based upon estimates as to future investment yield, mortality and           
withdrawals that include provisions for adverse deviation.

L. POLICY LIABILITIES AND ACCRUALS (CONTINUED)                        

Liabilities for outstanding claims and claims adjustment expenses are estimates 
of payments to be made on health insurance contracts for reported losses and    
claims adjustment expenses and estimates of losses and claims adjustment        
expenses incurred but not reported. These liabilities are determined using case 
basis evaluations and statistical analyses and represent estimates of the       
ultimate cost of all claims incurred but not paid. These estimates are          
continually reviewed and adjusted as necessary; such adjustments are reflected  
in current operations.                                                          

Contractholder deposit funds and other policy liabilities include deposit       
administration funds and immediate participation guarantee funds and consist of 
deposits received from customers and investment earnings on their fund balances.

Policy liabilities and accruals are based on the various estimates discussed    
above. Although the adequacy of these amounts cannot be assured, the Company    
believes that policy liability and accruals will be sufficient to meet future   
obligations of policies in force. The amount of liabilities and accruals,       
however, could be revised in the near-term if the estimates discussed above are 
revised.                                                                        

M. PREMIUM, FEE REVENUE AND RELATED EXPENSES                          

Premiums for individual life insurance and individual and group annuity         
products, excluding universal life and investment-related products, are         
considered revenue when due. Benefits, losses and related expenses are matched  
with premiums, resulting in their recognition over the lives of the contracts.  
This matching is accomplished through the provision for future benefits,        
estimated and unpaid losses and amortization of deferred policy acquisition     
costs. Revenues for investment-related products consist of net investment income
and contract charges assessed against the fund values. Related benefit expenses 
include annuity benefit claims for guaranteed minimum death benefits in excess  
of contract values, and net investment income credited to the fund values after 
deduction for investment and risk charges. Revenues for universal life products 
consist of net investment income, with mortality, administration and surrender  
charges assessed against the fund values. Related benefit expenses include      
universal life benefit claims in excess of fund values and net investment income
credited to universal life fund values. Certain policy charges such as enhanced 
crediting rates or bonus payments that represent compensation for services to be
provided in future periods are classified as deferred sales inducements and     
amortized over the period benefited using the same assumptions used to amortize 
deferred acquisition costs. See Note 16 - Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs, for
further information regarding revaluation of DAC and deferred sales inducements.

N. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES                                               

Deferred federal income taxes are generally recognized when assets and          
liabilities have different values for financial statement and tax reporting     
purposes, and for other temporary taxable and deductible differences as defined 
by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income  
Taxes" ("SFAS No. 109"). These differences result primarily from insurance      
reserves, net operating loss carryforwards, policy acquisition expenses, tax    
credit carryforwards and deferred sales inducements.                            

In June 2006, The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation No.
48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes - an Interpretation of FASB     
Statement No. 109" ("FIN No. 48"), to create a single model to address          
accounting for uncertainty in tax positions (See Note 3O - New Accounting and   
Adopted Pronouncements).

COMMONWEALTH ANNUITY AND LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY                                 
(A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.)                    
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS                                  
FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007 
3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)                       
O. NEW AND ADOPTED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS                          

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157. SFAS No. 157 clarifies that    
fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be exchanged    
to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between      
market participants. Under FAS No. 157, fair value measurements are not         
adjusted for transaction costs.                                                 

SFAS No. 157 nullifies the consensus reached in EITF Issue No. 02-3, "Issues    
Involved in Accounting for Derivative Contracts Held for Trading Purposes and   
Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities," ("EITF    
Issue No. 02-3") that prohibited the recognition of day one gain or loss on     
derivative contracts (and hybrid instruments measured at fair value under SFAS  
No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as     
modified by SFAS No. 155) where the Company could not verify all of the         
significant model inputs to observable market data and verify the model to      
market transactions. However, SFAS No. 157 requires that a fair value           
measurement reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an 
asset or liability based on the best information available. Assumptions include 
the risks inherent in a particular valuation technique (such as a pricing model)
and/or the risks inherent in the inputs to the model. The Company adopted SFAS  
157 as of January 1, 2007; adoption did not have a material effect on the       
Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.             

In June 2006, the FASB issued FIN No. 48. FIN No. 48 requires that the Company  
determine whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon   
examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation          
processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Once it is determined 
that a position meets this recognition threshold, the position is measured to   
determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in the financial statements.   
The Company adopted the provisions of FIN No. 48 as of January 1, 2007; adoption
did not have any impact on the Company's financial condition, results of        
operations or cash flows and did not result in any adjustments to retained      
earnings.                                                                       

In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155, "Accounting for Certain Hybrid  
Financial Instruments - an amendment of FASB Statements No. 133 and 140" ("SFAS 
No. 155"). SFAS No. 155 permits an entity to measure at fair value any financial
instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require    
bifurcation. As permitted, the Company early adopted SFAS No. 155 in the first  
quarter of 2006. Adoption did not have a material effect on the Company's       
financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.                       

In September 2005, the AICPA issued Statement of Position 05-1, "Accounting by  
Insurance Enterprises for Deferred Acquisition Costs in Connection with         
Modifications or Exchanges of Insurance Contracts" ("SOP 05-1"). SOP 05-1       
provides guidance on accounting by insurance companies for deferred acquisition 
costs on internal replacements of insurance and investment contracts other than 
those described in SFAS No. 97, "Accounting and Reporting by Insurance          
Enterprises for Certain Long-Duration Contracts and for Realized Gains and      
Losses from the Sale of Investments," ("SFAS No. 97"). This statement is        
effective for internal replacements occurring in fiscal years beginning after   
December 15, 2006. The Company adopted SOP 05-1 as of January 1, 2007; adoption 
did not have a material effect on the Company's financial condition, results of 
operations or cash flows.                                                       

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, "The Fair Value Option for      
Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities," which gives entities the option to 
measure eligible financial assets, financial liabilities and firm commitments at
fair value (i.e., the fair value option), on an instrument-by-instrument basis, 
that are otherwise not accounted for at fair value under other accounting       
standards. The election to use the fair value option is available at specified  
election dates, such as when an entity first recognizes a financial asset or    
financial liability or upon entering into a firm commitment. Subsequent changes 
in fair value must be recorded in earnings. Additionally, SFAS No. 159 allows   
for a one-time election for existing positions upon adoption, with the          
transition adjustment recorded to beginning retained earnings. The Company has  
not adopted SFAS No. 159 for any portion of its business.                       

P. ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NOT YET ADOPTED                               

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, "Disclosures about Derivative      
Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS No. 161"). SFAS 161 requires enhanced
disclosures about an entity's derivative and hedging activities, effective for  
financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008, 
with early application encouraged. The Company will adopt SFAS No. 161 in the   
first quarter of 2009. Adoption of SFAS No. 161 will not affect the Company's   
financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

P. ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NOT YET ADOPTED (CONTINUED)                   

In June 2007, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA)    
issued Statement of Position (SOP) No. 07-1, "Clarification of the Scope of the 
Audit and Accounting Guide `Audits of Investment Companies' and Accounting by   
Parent Companies and Equity Method Investors for Investments in Investment      
Companies." SOP No. 07-1 clarifies when an entity may apply the provisions of   
the Audit and Accounting Guide for Investment Companies (the Guide). In February
2008, the FASB issued FSP SOP No. 07-1-a, "The Effective Date of AICPA Statement
of Position 07-1," which indefinitely defers the effective date for SOP No.     
07-01.                                                                          

Q. RECLASSIFICATIONS                                                  

Certain reclassifications have been made to previously reported amounts to      
conform to the current presentation.                                            

4. PURCHASE ACCOUNTING                                                          

Goldman Sachs' acquisition of the Company is accounted for by applying SFAS No. 
141 through "push down" accounting. Included in the following table is VOBA,    
which represents the present value of future profits embedded in the acquired   
contracts. See Note 14 - Value of Business Acquired, for further explanation of 
VOBA. The assessment of fair value in accordance with SFAS No. 141 included the 
establishment of intangible assets for VOBA and various state licenses. No      
specific goodwill was recognized as a result of this assessment. See Note 3 -   
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for further discussion of Goodwill. 
In accordance with SFAS No. 141 the purchase allocation period to identify and  
record fair value for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed should usually
not exceed one year from the transaction date. At the conclusion of 2007 and    
2006, additional balance sheet adjustments were identified. The following table 
summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities     
assumed as of December 30, 2005 and purchase accounting adjustments made for the
year ended December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006.

On December 30, 2005 two material transactions occurred that are not reflected  
in the predecessor income statement presented for 2005. The divestiture of all  
subsidiaries of the Company will cause successor financial statements to be     
based upon unconsolidated activity. In addition, the establishment of a new fair
value balance sheet in accordance with SFAS No. 141, as part of the purchase    
accounting, will generate certain differences in amortization of VOBA levels in 
subsequent years.                                                               

The 2006 Consolidated Statement of Income reflects the two material transactions
described above. The following unaudited pro forma condensed information        
presents the results of operations for the Company assuming the divestiture of  
all subsidiaries occurred at December 31, 2004 and that the implications of the 
push down accounting was reflected in the 2005 income statement. This unaudited 
proforma information does not necessarily represent what the results would be   
for future periods, but provides a comparison by which to understand the 2006   
changes.

6. SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS                                                     

On May 25, 2007 the Company signed an agreement, effective retroactive to       
January 1, 2007, with Pacific Life Insurance Company ("Pacific Life") to assume 
8% of its variable annuity products sold in 2007. The base annuities were       
assumed on a modified coinsurance and the benefits provided via riders were     
assumed on a coinsurance basis. As separate account liabilities were assumed    
under modified coinsurance terms, ownership of the underlying separate account  
assets was not transferred and these assets are not reflected in the balance    
sheet. The Company assumed general account reserves of $58.2 million and, for   
the retroactive period prior to signing, recorded a payable to Pacific Life of  
$12.4 million for the period through May 2007. The assumed general account      
reserves as of December 31, 2007 were approximately $61.5 million (See Note 23 -
Subsequent Events).                                                             

On July, 1, 2006, the Company entered into a modified coinsurance agreement with
Chase Insurance Life and Annuity Company ("CILAC") to assume 100% of its        
variable annuity business on a modified coinsurance basis. The Company assumed  
general account reserves of $1.3 billion and paid a ceding allowance of $85.0   
million to CILAC. As separate account liabilities were assumed under modified   
coinsurance terms, ownership of the underlying separate account assets was not  
transferred and these assets are not reflected in the balance sheet. On April 1,
2007, CILAC was merged into Protective Life Insurance Company ("Protective").   

Effective December 30, 2005 the Company entered into a coinsurance agreement    
with FAFLIC, a subsidiary of THG. The Company assumed 100% of the FAFLIC        
variable annuity and variable life book of business. The Company assumed $124.6 
million of reserves and paid $8.6 million as a ceding allowance to FAFLIC. As   
part of this transaction, separate account liabilities were assumed under       
modified coinsurance terms, and, as such, ownership of the underlying separate  
accounts is not included in the Company's separate account assets and           
liabilities.

GUARANTEED MINIMUM DEATH BENEFITS                                               

The Company has issued variable annuity contracts with a GMDB feature. The GMDB 
feature provides annuity contractholders with a guarantee that the benefit      
received at death will be no less than a prescribed minimum amount. This amount 
is based on either the net deposits paid into the contract, the net deposits    
accumulated at a specified rate, the highest historical account value on a      
contract anniversary, or more typically, the greatest of these values. If the   
GMDB is higher than the current account value at the time of death, the Company 
incurs a cost equal to the difference.

The following summarizes the liability for GMDB contracts reflected in the      
general account. The GMDB exposure includes reinsurance assumed, however the    
modified coinsurance is excluded as it provides negligible GMDB reserves and    
significant account values:

(1)  Volatility reflects the difference between actual and expected investment  
 performance, persistency, age distribution, mortality and other factors
that are assumptions within the GMDB reserving model.                 

The reserve for the GMDB feature was computed using a risk neutral approach. The
reserve represents estimates, over a range of stochastic scenarios, of the      
present value of future GMDB net benefits expected to be paid less the present  
value of future GMDB net fees charged to the policyholders.                     

Starting in 2006, the GMDB reserves were calculated using best estimate, as     
opposed to risk neutral, scenarios for future projections and reflecting the    
December 31, 2005 reserve balance derived under purchase accounting. GMDB       
reserves were adjusted upwards by $229.2 million in 2005 as a result of the     
Transaction and revaluation based upon purchase accounting assumptions.         

The following information relates to the reserving methodology and assumptions  
for GMDB at December 31, 2007 and 2006.                                         

-    The projection model used 500 stochastically generated return    
       scenarios with mean performance ranging from 5% to 10% depending on
the underlying fund type.                                   

   -    Implied volatilities by duration were based on a combination of over
        the counter quotes (when available) and historical volatilities. For
         2007, volatility assumptions range from 20% to 34%, varying by equity
          fund type; 7% for bond funds; and 1% for money market funds. For 2006,
         volatility assumptions ranged from 13% to 32%, varying by equity fund
type; 3% for bond funds; and 1% for money market funds.     

-    The mortality assumption is 70% of the 1994 GMDB table.          

    -    The full surrender rate assumption varies from 1% to 50% depending on
      distribution channel, contract type, policy duration, and attained
       age. The aggregate projected full surrender rates for 2008 and 2009
     are approximately 14% and 13%, respectively (full surrender rates
          include annuitizations, but they do not reflect partial withdrawals or
deaths).

     -    The partial withdrawal rate assumption varies by distribution channel,
   tax qualified status, and attained age. Total projected partial
withdrawals are from 5% - 7% for all years.                 

The following table presents the account value, net amount at risk and average  
attained age of underlying contractholders for guarantees in the event of death 
as of December 31, 2007 and 2006. The net amount at risk is the death benefit   
coverage in force or the amount that the Company would have to pay if all       
contractholders had died as of the specified date, and represents the excess of 
the guaranteed benefit over the account value.

GUARANTEED MINIMUM INCOME BENEFIT                                               

Additionally, the Company previously issued variable annuity contracts with a   
guaranteed minimum income benefit ("GMIB") feature. The GMIB liability as of    
December 31, 2007 was $14.2 million with no benefits paid out. The GMIB         
liability at December 31, 2006 was $15.2 million with no benefits paid out. In  
conjunction with the Transaction and the application of SFAS No. 141, the GMIB  
liability was revalued to $16.5 million at December 31, 2005. Similarly to the  
approach employed to value the GMDB reserve, the fair value reserve for the GMIB
feature was computed using a risk neutral approach. The reserve was determined  
by estimating the present value of future GMIB benefits expected to be paid less
the present value of future GMIB fees charged to the policyholders, over a range
of stochastic scenarios.

The Company's variable annuity product offerings included contracts that offered
enhanced crediting rates or bonus payments. These enhanced rates are considered 
sales inducements under SOP 03-1. As such, the balance of sales inducement      
assets were required to be reclassified from DAC to other assets upon adoption  
of SOP 03-1, and amortization of these sales inducements over the life of the   
contract is required to be reflected as a policy benefit. Amortization of these 
contracts is required to be computed using the same methodology and assumptions 
used in amortizing DAC.                                                         

Deferrred sales inducements at December 31, 2007 reflect bonus interest payments

SEPARATE ACCOUNTS WITH CREDITED INTEREST GUARANTEES                             

The Company issued variable annuity and life contracts through its separate     
accounts for which net investment income and investment gains and losses accrue 
directly to, and investment risk is borne by, the contractholder. The Company   
also issued variable annuity and life contracts through separate accounts where 
the Company contractually guarantees to the contractholder the total deposits   
made to the contract less any partial withdrawals plus a minimum return.        

The market value adjusted ("MVA") product attributable to assumed variable      
annuity were assumed on a modified coinsurance basis. Therefore, the assets     
related to these liabilities are a recoverable from reinsurers and changes in   
fair value are not included in other comprehensive income.                      

The Company had the following variable annuities with guaranteed minimum        
returns:

A. FIXED MATURITIES AND EQUITY SECURITIES (CONTINUED)                 

In connection with AFLIAC's voluntary withdrawal of its license in New York,    
AFLIAC agreed with the New York Department of Insurance in 1994 to maintain,    
through a custodial account in New York, a security deposit, the market value of
which will equal 102% of all outstanding liabilities of AFLIAC for New York     
policyholders, claimants and creditors. At December 31, 2007, the amortized cost
and fair value of the assets on deposit were $42.4 million and $43.6 million,   
respectively. At December 31, 2006, the amortized cost and fair value of assets 
on deposit in New York were $43.0 million and $42.8 million, respectively. In   
addition, fixed maturities, excluding those securities on deposit in New York,  
with an amortized cost of $5.2 million and $5.8 million were on deposit with    
various state and governmental authorities at December 31, 2007 and 2006,       
respectively. Fair values related to these securities were $6.0 million and $5.7
million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.                            

The Company entered into various derivative and other arrangements that required
fixed maturities to be pledged as collateral. At December 31, 2007, the Company 
held $43.4 million compared to $31.5 million held as collateral at December 31,
2006. Corresponding liabilities for these items have also been recorded by the  
Company. There were no contractual investment commitments at December 31, 2007. 

The amortized cost and fair value by maturity periods for fixed maturities are  
shown below. Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities, because  
borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call 
or prepayment penalties, or the Company may have the right to put or sell the   
obligations back to the issuers. Mortgage backed securities are included in the 
category representing their ultimate maturity. In accordance with SFAS No. 141, 
the amortized cost of the investments is shown below.                           

                                                                [Download Table]

B. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS                                             

Simultaneous to the Transaction, the Company implemented a hedging strategy     
consisting of long duration equity and derivative put options. The hedge is     
primarily static consisting of quarterly put options. The purpose of the hedge  
is to protect against increases in GMDB liability in the event that the market  
grows at a rate below LIBOR. In addition, the Company invests in exchange traded
futures and options as part of its overall diversification and total return     
objectives.                                                                     

On May 25, 2007, the Company entered into a reinsurance contract which is       
accounted for on a coinsurance/modified-coinsurance ("co-modco") basis with     
respect to the annuity riders and base contracts. Insurance contracts in their  
entirety do not meet the definition of a derivative instrument, but may contain 
embedded derivatives. This reinsurance agreement states that the Company will   
pay its proportionate share of the present value of the guaranteed future income
stream in excess of account value. The riders are accounted for as an embedded  
derivative under Derivatives Implementation Group issue B25 ("DIG B25").        

On July 1, 2006, the Company entered into a reinsurance contract which is       
accounted for on a modified coinsurance basis. Under a traditional modified     
coinsurance arrangement, the ceding company owns the assets backing the         
liabilities and transfers their book investment returns to the reinsurer,       
including credited related gains or losses. The reinsurance contract represents 
a hybrid instrument that should be bifurcated into its host contract and        
embedded derivative components. An embedded derivative exists because the       
Company is exposed to third-party credit risk. This is accounted for as an      
embedded derivative under Derivatives Implementation Group issue B36            
("DIG B36").

COMMONWEALTH ANNUITY AND LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS                                  
FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007

B. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)                                 

Under THG, an overall risk management strategy incorporating the use of         
derivative instruments to minimize significant unplanned fluctuations in        
earnings that were caused by foreign currency, equity market and interest rate  
volatility was employed. As a result of the Company's issuance of trust         
instruments supported by funding obligations denominated in foreign currencies, 
as well as its investment in securities denominated in foreign currencies, the  
Company's operating results were exposed to changes in exchange rates between   
the U.S. dollar, the Japanese Yen, and the British Pound. The Company used      
foreign currency exchange swaps and futures to mitigate the short-term effect of
changes in currency exchange rates and to manage the risk of cash flow          
variability. Until August 22, 2005, the Company was also exposed to changes in  
the equity market due to increases in GMDB reserves that resulted from declines 
in the equity market. The Company used exchange-traded equity market futures    
contracts to reduce the volatility in statutory capital reserves from the       
effects of the equity market movements. Finally, for the period between August
22, 2005 and December 30, 2005, the closing date of the Transaction, the Company
was exposed to changes in its surplus value, which was driven by a combination  
of equity market and interest rate movements. To economically hedge against     
fluctuations in the purchase price of the variable life insurance and annuity   
business, the Company used exchange-traded futures contracts and interest rate  
swap contracts.                                                                 

On December 12, 2007, the Company implemented an enhancement to its existing    
hedging strategy by selling short-duration S&P futures to reduce our long delta 
position. This strategy would help reduce expected volatility from changes in   
the market and protects the Company from adverse market movements.              

C. FAIR VALUE HEDGES                                                  

During 2007 and 2006, no fair value hedges were established. In 2005, the       
Company entered into exchange-traded equity futures contracts to hedge the      
embedded gains on certain bonds identified to be liquidated to settle the       
maturity of a particular long-term funding agreement. The Company also entered  
into cross-currency swaps to convert its foreign denominated fixed rate trust   
instruments supported by funding obligations to U.S. dollar floating rate       
instruments. The Company recognized gains of $2.2 million for the year ended    
December 31, 2005, reported in net realized investment gains in the Consolidated
Statements of Operations. These derivative instruments were determined to be    
effective hedges in accordance with FASB issued SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for   
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS No. 133"). All components 
of each derivative's gain or loss are included in the assessment of hedge       
effectiveness, unless otherwise noted.                                          

D. CASH FLOW HEDGES                                                   

During 2007 and 2006, no cash flow hedges were established. Prior to 2006, the  
Company entered into cross-currency swaps to hedge foreign currency and interest
rate exposure on specific trust instruments supported by funding obligations.   
Under the swap contracts, the Company agreed to exchange interest and principal 
related to trust obligations payable in foreign currencies, at current exchange 
rates, for the equivalent payment in U.S. dollars translated at a specific      
currency exchange rate. Additionally, the Company used foreign exchange futures 
contracts to hedge foreign currency exposure on specific trust instruments      
supported by funding obligations. Finally, the Company also entered into foreign
exchange forward contracts to hedge its foreign currency exposure on specific   
fixed maturity securities. Under the foreign exchange futures and forward       
contracts, the Company has the right to purchase the hedged currency at a fixed 
strike price in U.S. dollars.                                                   

The Company recognized no gains or losses in 2005 on ineffective cash flow      
hedges. All components of each derivative's gain or loss are included in the    
assessment of hedge effectiveness, unless otherwise noted.

E. TRADING ACTIVITIES                                                 

For 2007, the Company recognized a net loss of $6.8 million on its derivatives. 
For 2006, the Company recognized a net loss of $46.7 million on its derivatives.
The derivatives in this program included exchange-traded futures contracts and  
interest rate swap contracts. The hedges did not qualify for hedge accounting   
under SFAS No. 133. The core risk the Company seeks to address with its hedging 
strategy is GMDB exposure. The objective is to protect against increases in GMDB
liability in the event that the market grows at a rate below LIBOR, while       
maintaining some upside potential in rising markets.                            

On May 25, 2007, the Company entered into a reinsurance contract which is       
accounted for on a co-modco basis with respect to the annuity riders and base   
contracts. Insurance contracts in their entirety do not meet the definition of a
derivative instrument, and may contain embedded derivatives. This reinsurance   
agreement states that the Company will pay its proportionate share of the       
present value of the guaranteed future income stream in excess of account value.
The riders are accounted for as an embedded derivative as defined by DIG B25.   

On August 23, 2005, the Company implemented a new derivative program designed to
economically hedge against fluctuations in the purchase price of the variable   
life insurance and annuity businesses. The Transaction purchase price was       
determined on December 30, 2005 and was subject to changes in interest rate,    
equity market, implied equity market volatility and surrender activity. The     
derivatives were terminated concurrent with the sale closing on December 30,
2005. The derivatives in this program included exchange-traded futures contracts
and interest rate swap contracts. The hedges did not qualify for hedge          
accounting under SFAS No. 133. The core risk the Company seeks to address with  
its hedging strategy is GMDB exposure. The objective is to protect against      
increases in GMDB liability in the event that the market grows at a rate below  
LIBOR, while maintaining some upside potential in rising markets.               

During 2005 the Company recognized net losses of $36.1 million on all trading   
derivatives. The net loss recognized in 2005 included $13.3 million in losses   
related to the derivatives used to economically hedge the purchase price and    
were reflected within other operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of
Operations. Additionally, the net loss in 2005 included $19.6 million of net    
losses representing the ineffectiveness on equity-linked swap contracts, which  
were recorded within other income in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 

Further, the 2005 net loss also included a $2.3 million loss related to embedded
derivatives on equity-linked trust instruments supported by funding obligations,
which was reported in losses on derivative instruments in the Consolidated      
Statements of Operations. Finally, the 2005 net loss included $0.9 million in   
losses recorded within other operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements  
of Operations related to the GMDB hedges.

The Company employs a systematic methodology to evaluate declines in fair values
below amortized cost for all investments. The methodology utilizes a            
quantitative and qualitative process ensuring that available evidence concerning
the declines in fair value below amortized cost is evaluated in a disciplined   
manner. In determining whether a decline in fair value below amortized cost is  
other-than-temporary, the Company evaluates the ability and intent to hold the  
investment to maturity; the issuer's overall financial condition; the issuer's  
credit and financial strength ratings; the issuer's financial performance,      
including earnings trends, dividend payments, and asset quality; a weakening of 
the general market conditions in the industry or geographic region in which the 
issuer operates; the length of time in which the fair value of an issuer's      
securities remains below cost; and with respect to fixed maturity

10. FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS                              

SFAS No. 107, DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, as amended 
by SFAS No. 157, requires disclosure of fair value information about certain    
financial instruments (insurance contracts, real estate, goodwill and taxes are 
excluded) for which it is practicable to estimate such values, whether or not   
these instruments are included in the balance sheet. The fair values presented  
for certain financial instruments are estimates which, in many cases, may differ
significantly from the amounts which could be realized in an orderly            
transaction.                                                                    

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of   
each class of financial instruments:                                            

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS                                             

For these short-term investments, the carrying amount approximates fair value.  

FIXED MATURITIES                                                      

Fair values are based on quoted market prices, if available. If a quoted market 
price is not available, fair values are estimated using independent pricing     
sources or internally developed pricing models using discounted cash flow       
analyses which utilize current interest rates for similar financial instruments 
which have comparable terms and credit.                                         

EQUITY SECURITIES                                                     

Fair values are based on quoted market prices, if available. If a quoted market 
price is not available, fair values are estimated using independent pricing     
sources or internally developed pricing models.                                 

POLICY LOANS                                                          

The carrying amount reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets approximates    
fair value since policy loans have no defined maturity dates and are inseparable
from the insurance contracts.                                                   

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS                                                

Fair values of the Company's derivatives are generally determined using model   
inputs to observable market data. Derivative instruments include embedded       
derivatives related to insurance contracts.                                     

INVESTMENT CONTRACTS (WITHOUT MORTALITY FEATURES)                     

Liabilities under supplemental contracts without life contingencies are         
estimated based on current fund balances and other individual contract funds    
represent the present value of future policy benefits.                          

SEPARATE ACCOUNT ASSETS                                               

The estimated fair value of assets held in separate accounts is based on quoted 
market prices.

LEVEL 3 GAINS AND LOSSES                                                        

The table below sets forth a summary of changes in the fair value of the        
Company's level 3 financial assets and liabilities for the year ended December  
2007. The table reflects gains and losses for the full year for all financial   
assets and liabilities categorized as level 3 as at December 31, 2007. As       
reflected in the table below, the net unrealized loss on level 3 financial      
assets and liabilities was $31.5 million for the year ended December 2007.      

CASH INSTRUMENTS 

The Company's cash instruments are generally classified within level 1 or level 
2 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market       
prices, broker or dealer quotations, or alternative pricing sources with        
reasonable levels of price transparency. Certain cash instruments are classified
within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy because they trade infrequently and  
therefore have little or no price transparency.                                 

Total financial assets at fair value classified within level 3 were $3.7 million
as of December 31, 2007. This includes a tax credit investment and a surplus    
note.                                                                           

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS                                                            

-    A derivative contract with level 1 and/or level 2 inputs is classified as a
level 3 financial instrument in its entirety if it has at least one   
significant level 3 input.                                            

-    If there is one significant level 3 input, the entire gain or loss from    
adjusting only observable inputs (i.e. level 1 and level 2) is still  
classified as level 3.

The federal income tax benefit attributable to the consolidated results of      
operations is different from the amount determined by multiplying income before 
federal income taxes by the statutory federal income tax rate at 35%. The       
sources of the difference and the tax effects of each were as follows:

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences      
between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. These  
temporary differences result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years   
and are measured using the tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such  
differences are expected to reverse. Gross deferred income tax assets totaled   
approximately $277.5 million and $334.3 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006,  
respectively. Gross deferred income tax liabilities totaled approximately $130.2
million and $144.8 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.         

The Company has recorded a valuation allowance against tax benefits from capital
losses and tax credit carryforwards. A portion of the valuation allowance       
against the December 31, 2007 deferred tax asset is due to limitations under    
Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code against certain tax benefits. If the   
tax benefits established at the inception of the Transaction offset currently by
the valuation allowance were to be subsequently realized, the entire benefit    
would reduce intangible assets. Any adjustment to the valuation allowance for   
events subsequent or unrelated to the Transaction would be realized through the 
income statement. During 2007, a reduction of $14.0 million was made to the     
valuation allowance. Of this amount, $1.7 million relates to foreign tax credits
generated in 2006 and thus reduces income tax expense. In management's judgment,
the gross deferred tax asset will more likely than not be realized through      
reductions of future taxes, except as otherwise noted. This conclusion is based 
primarily on a review of expected taxable income and considers all available    
evidence, both positive and negative.                                           

At December 31, 2007, there are available foreign tax credit carryforwards of   
$7.8 million which will expire beginning in 2013. At December 31, 2007, the     
Company has net operating loss carryforwards of $144.9 million and capital loss 
carryforwards of $35.2 million, which begin to expire in 2016 and 2010,         
respectively. All tax credits, net operating loss carryforwards, and capital    
loss carryforwards generated prior to 2006 are subject to annual limitations on 
utilization. This includes $6.1 million of foreign tax credits and $127.3       
million of net operating and capital loss carryforwards.

COMMONWEALTH ANNUITY AND LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY                                 
(A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.)                    
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS                                  
FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007 
11. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES (CONTINUED)                                            

The Company's federal income tax returns are routinely audited by the IRS, and  
when appropriate, provisions are made in the financial statements in            
anticipation of the results of these audits. THG has agreed to indemnify the    
Company and Goldman Sachs with respect to tax liabilities for periods before the
acquisition as provided in the Stock Purchase Agreement. However, the tax       
attributes carried over from THG are not guaranteed under the Stock Purchase    
Agreement, and accordingly, such attributes may be adjusted in the future. At   
the end of 2007, THG disclosed an audit adjustment of approximately $7.5 million
to the company's pre-acquisition net operating loss balance. As a result, the   
Company has reduced the gross net operating loss carryforward by $21.4 million. 
No post-acquisition periods are currently under audit.                          

In June 2006, the FASB issued FIN No. 48 (See Note 3O - New Accounting and      
Adopted Pronouncements for further discussion around FIN No. 48). The Company   
adopted the provisions of FIN No. 48 as of January 1, 2007. The Company believes
it does not have any tax positions that fail to meet the more likely than not   
standard and does not expect any material adverse effects from audit            
examination, including interest and penalties. The Company believes that its    
income tax filing positions and deductions will be sustained on audit and does  
not anticipate any adjustments that will result in a material adverse effect on 
the Company's financial condition, results of operations, or cash flow.         
Therefore, no reserves for uncertain income tax positions have been recorded    
pursuant to FIN 48.                                                             

The dividends received deduction claimed by the Company is generated by the     
separate accounts of variable annuity contracts. In Revenue Ruling 2007-61, the 
IRS issued notice that it intends to publish regulations dealing with the       
computation of separate account dividends received deductions. The impact and   
timing of such regulations is unknown at this time, but it is possible that the 
regulations could reduce the amount of dividends received deduction tax benefit 
that the Company claims. It is anticipated that any regulations would have a    
public comment period and would be effective prospectively.                     

The Company will file a stand-alone tax return for the period January 1, 2007   
through December 31, 2007. The Company's tax return is ineligible for           
consolidation in the Goldman Sachs Group until fiscal year end 2012. Any net    
operating loss carryforwards, capital loss carryforwards or foreign tax credits 
from prior to the acquisition date of December 30, 2005 can only be used against
the income of the Company.                                                      

12. PENSION AND OTHER POST RETIREMENT BENEFITS                                  
DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS                                                           

Goldman Sachs maintains a defined benefit pension plan for substantially all US 
employees hired prior to November 1, 2003. As of November 2004, this plan has   
been closed to new participants and no further benefits will be accrued to      
existing participants. The Company and its employees are not members of a       
Goldman Sachs sponsored pension program and the December 31, 2007 and 2006      
balance sheets contain no pension liabilities and no postretirement benefit     
liabilities.                                                                    

Prior to the Transaction and prior to 2005, FAFLIC, a subsidiary of AFLIAC      
through December 30, 2005, provided retirement benefits to substantially all of 
its employees under defined benefit pension plans. These plans were based on a  
defined benefit cash balance formula, whereby the Company annually provided an  
allocation to each covered employee based on a percentage of that employee's    
eligible salary, similar to a defined contribution plan arrangement. In addition
to the cash balance allocation, certain transition group employees who had met  
specified age and service requirements as of December 31, 1994, were eligible   
for a grandfathered benefit based primarily on the employees' years of service  
and compensation during their highest five consecutive plan years of employment.
The Company's policy for the plans was to fund at least the minimum amount      
required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA").      

As a result of the Transaction, the Company is no longer required to contribute 
any funds to the benefit plans, nor is it required to make any benefit payments.

DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS                                                      

The Company participates in the Goldman Sachs employee-sponsored defined        
contribution plans for the employees of the Company. The Company matches a      
portion of employees' annual contributions. Matching contributions vest after   
three years of service. The Company incurred expenses relating to the defined   
contribution plan of $0.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006
respectively. FAFLIC, a subsidiary of the Company through December 30, 2005,    
also provided a defined contribution 401(k) plan for its employees, whereby the 
Company matched employee elective 401(k) contributions, up to a maximum         
percentage determined annually by the Board of Directors. Effective January 1,
2005, the Company enhanced its 401(k) plan to match 100% of employees' 401(k)   
plan contributions up to 5% of eligible compensation. During 2005, the expense  
for this matching provision was $11.5 million, of which $10.2 million was       
allocated to its affiliates. In addition to this matching provision, the Company
made an annual contribution to employees' accounts equal to 3% of the employee's
eligible compensation. This annual contribution was made regardless of whether  
the employee contributed to the plan, as long as the employee was employed on   
the last day of the year. The cost for this additional contribution was $8.3    
million for 2005, of which $7.3 million was allocated to affiliated companies.

COMMONWEALTH ANNUITY AND LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY                                 
(A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.)                    
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS                                  
FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007 
13. DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS                                                       

Massachusetts has enacted laws governing the payment of dividends to            
shareholders by insurers. Massachusetts laws affect the dividend paying ability 
of the Company.                                                                 

Massachusetts' statute limits the dividends a life insurer may pay in any twelve
month period, without the prior permission of the Massachusetts Commissioner of 
Insurance (the "Commissioner"), to the greater of (i) 10% of its statutory      
policyholder surplus as of the preceding December 31 or (ii) the individual     
company's statutory net gain from operations for the preceding calendar year. In
addition, under Massachusetts law, no domestic insurer may pay a dividend or    
make any distribution to its shareholders from other than unassigned funds      
unless the Commissioner has approved such dividend or distribution.             

The Company must meet minimum capital and surplus requirements under a          
risk-based capital ("RBC") formula. RBC is the standard measurement of an       
insurance company's required capital on a statutory basis. It is based on a     
formula calculated by applying factors to various assets, premium and statutory 
reserve items. The formula takes into account the risk characteristics of the   
insurer, including asset risk, insurance risk, interest rate risk and business  
risk. Regulatory action is tied to the amount of a company's surplus deficit    
under the RBC formula. Goldman Sachs has agreed with the Commissioner to        
continue the previous THG commitment to maintain total adjusted capital levels  
at a minimum of 100% of the Company's Company Action Level ("CAL") as determined
under the risk-based capital formula, which was $116.3 million at December 31,
2007. Total adjusted capital for life insurance companies is defined as         
statutory capital and surplus, plus asset valuation reserve, plus 50% of        
dividends apportioned for payment and was $466.8 million at December 31, 2007   
for the Company. The Company's CAL RBC ratio of 401% is eight times greater than
the level at which the Commissioner could be authorized to take an insurer into 
receivership.                                                                   

There were no dividends declared by the Company to Goldman Sachs in 2007 and    
2006. In 2005, in connection with the Transaction and with permission from the  
Commissioner, the Company distributed FAFLIC and its other non-insurance        
subsidiaries to THG.                                                            

14. VALUE OF BUSINESS ACQUIRED                                                  

VOBA represents the present value of future profits embedded in the acquired    
contracts related to the Transaction. VOBA is determined by estimating the net  
present value of future cash flows expected to result from contracts in force at
the date of the Transaction. Future positive cash flows include fees and other  
charges assessed to the contracts for as long as they remain in force as well as
fees collected upon surrender, while future negative cash flows include costs to
administer the contracts, and benefit payments including payments under the GMDB
provisions of the contracts. VOBA will be amortized over the expected life of   
the contracts in proportion to estimated gross profits arising principally from 
investment results, mortality and expense margins, and surrender charges based  
upon historical and estimated future experience, which is updated periodically. 

At December 31, 2007, the gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization of 
VOBA was $300.3 million and $81.6 million, respectively.                        

VOBA is adjusted for amounts relating to unrealized investment gains and losses.
This adjustment, net of tax, is included with unrealized investment gains and   
losses that are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. VOBA was      
increased by $0.9 million at December 31, 2007 and $0.8 million at December 31,
2006 to account for unrealized investment losses. On November 1, 2006, VOBA of  
$1.9 million attributable to the future profits of the deferred fixed annuity   
business was written off following reinsurance of the block to Columbia (see    
Note 15 - Reinsurance).

15. REINSURANCE                                                                 

The Company seeks to diversify risk and limit its overall financial exposure by 
reinsuring certain levels of risk in various areas of exposure through          
acquisition and cessions with other insurance companies or reinsurers. In       
addition, consistent with the overall business strategy, the Company assumes    
certain policy risks written by other insurance companies on a coinsurance and  
modified coinsurance basis. Under a coinsurance arrangement, depending upon the 
terms of the contract, the reinsurer may share in the risk of loss due to       
mortality or morbidity, lapses, and the investment risk, if any, inherent in the
underlying policy. Modified coinsurance differs from coinsurance in that the    
assets supporting the reserves are retained by the ceding company while the risk
is transferred to the reinsurer.                                                

On May 25, 2007 the Company entered into an agreement, retroactive to January 1,
2007, to assume 8% of the variable annuity products sold by Pacific Life in     
2007. The base annuities were assumed on a modified coinsurance and the benefits
provided via riders were assumed on a coinsurance basis. General account        
reserves of $58.2 million were assumed. The Company has evaluated the           
applicability of DIG B25 to products assumed from Pacific Life and an embedded  
derivative requiring bifurcation has been identified. A liability of $8.3       
million as at December 31, 2007 is reflected on the balance sheet. The assumed  
general account reserves as of December 31, 2007 were approximately $61.5       
million.                                                                        

As of November 1, 2006, the Company entered into a coinsurance agreement to cede
100% of its deferred fixed annuity insurance business to its affiliate,         
Columbia. The Company ceded reserves of $53.9 million. In consideration of      
Columbia's assumption of $53.9 million in reserves, the Company received a $1.9 
million ceding commission. As at December 31, 2007 the Company ceded reserves of
$46.7 million.                                                                  

On July, 1, 2006, the Company assumed on a modified coinsurance basis, 100% of  
the variable annuity business of CILAC. As of April 1, 2007 CILAC was merged    
into Protective. General account reserves of $1.3 billion were assumed. In      
consideration, the Company paid an $85.0 million ceding commission. The Company 
has evaluated the applicability of DIG B36 to its modified coinsurance agreement
with Protective. An embedded derivative requiring bifurcation has been          
identified and a liability of $22.8 million and an asset of $0.5 million as of  
December, 31 2007 and December, 31 2006 respectively is reflected on the balance
sheet. As at December 31, 2007, the Company assumed reserves of $1.2 billion.   

On December 30, 2005 subsequent to the Transaction, the Company assumed on a    
coinsurance basis 100% of the General Account liabilities related to FAFLIC's   
Variable Annuity and Variable Life policies. In consideration of the Company's  
assumption of these liabilities, FAFLIC transferred to the Company the statutory
assets related to this block of business and received from the Company an $8.6  
million ceding commission. The assumed reserves were approximately $83.7 million
and $96.5 million as of December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006 respectively.   
The Company also assumed on a modified coinsurance basis, essentially all of the
Separate Account liabilities of FAFLIC. In addition, the MVA product was assumed
on a modified coinsurance basis. In accordance with SOP 03-1, MVA liabilities   
are included as general account liabilities. Reserve liabilities of $2.2 million
as of December 31, 2007 have been included in policy liabilities and a          
reinsurance recoverable of $2.2 million recognized. The December 30, 2005 value 
of the FAFLIC MVA was recognized in the 2006 adjustments to purchase accounting 
included within other assets and future policy benefits (See Note 4 - Purchase  
Accounting). The Company has evaluated the applicability of DIG

15. REINSURANCE (CONTINUED)                                                     

B36 to its modified coinsurance arrangement to reinsure FAFLIC MVA and has      
determined that an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation does exist but is  
not considered to be material.                                                  

Prior to the Transaction, the Company entered into other reinsurance treaties   
including non core traditional life and health business; the largest being a    
universal life insurance treaty representing reinsurance recoverables of $475.5 
million and $506.0 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.         

The Company determines the appropriate amount of reinsurance based on evaluation
of the risks accepted and analyses prepared by consultants and reinsurers and on
market conditions (including the availability and pricing of reinsurance). The  
Company also believes that the terms of its reinsurance contracts are consistent
with industry practice in that they contain standard terms with respect to lines
of business covered, limit and retention, arbitration and occurrence. The       
Company evaluates the financial condition of its reinsurers and monitors        
concentrations of credit risk. Based on its review of its reinsurers' financial 
statements and reputations in the reinsurance marketplace, the Company believes 
that its counterparties are financially sound.                                  

The effects of reinsurance were as follows:                                     

                                                                [Download Table]

In 2007, the Company acquired 8% of the 2007 variable annuity business of       
Pacific Life through a modified coinsurance agreement and a block of variable   
life insurance from Protective through a modified coinsurance agreement,        
resulting in initial DAC balances of $18.2 million and $6.0 million             
respectively.                                                                   

In 2006, the Company acquired the variable annuity business of CILAC, whose     
booked of business was subsequently merged into Protective during 2007, through 
a modified coinsurance agreement, resulting in an initial DAC asset of $106.7   
million upon contract date. Activity of $3.3 million related to deferral of     
acquisition expenses and amortization of $6.4 million, resulting in a $103.6    
million DAC asset at December 31, 2006.                                         

In accordance with SFAS No. 141, the Company revalued its DAC asset to zero as  
of December 30, 2005 under purchase accounting. As such, any assets related to  
deferred policy acquisition costs relate to transactions occurring in 2007 and  
2006.                                                                           

17. LIABILITIES FOR OUTSTANDING CLAIMS, LOSSES AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES     

The Company regularly updates its reserve estimates as new information becomes  
available and further events occur which may impact the resolution of unsettled 
claims. Reserve adjustments are reflected in results of operations as           
adjustments to losses and LAE. Often these adjustments are recognized in periods
subsequent to the period in which the underlying policy was written and loss    
event occurred. These types of subsequent adjustments are described as "prior   
year reserve development". Such development can be either favorable or          
unfavorable to the Company's financial results and may vary by line of business.

The liability for future policy benefits and outstanding claims, and claims     
adjustment expenses, excluding the effect of reinsurance, related to the        
Company's accident and health business was $228.0 million and $233.5 million at 
December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. This business consists of the         
Company's exited individual health businesses. Reinsurance recoverables related 
to this business were $227.9 million and $233.6 million at December 31, 2007 and
2006 respectively.

The Company was allocated certain rental expenses, primarily for the building   
lease in Southborough, MA. Rental expenses for these operating leases amounted  
to $0.3 million and $0.1 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively. Prior to the  
Transaction, the Company was allocated rental expenses of $0.6 million in 2005. 
The Company does not have lease commitments for the Southborough, MA location.

premise. As of December 31, 2007, lease commitments relating to the Elgin, IL   
were $60.5 thousand for 2008 to 2010 inclusive.

contract/policy administration for a period of not less than ten years.

19. COMMITMENTS (CONTINUED)                                                     

On October 31, 2007, the Company signed a third party administrator agreement   
with Transaction Applications Group, Inc ("TAG") and an application service     
provider agreement with Professional Data Management Again, Inc ("PDMA").       
Commencing January 1, 2008 TAG will act as third party administrator for        
the Company's fixed block of business, utilizing a PDMA platform.               

As of December 31, 2007, the purchase commitments relating to agreements with   
Se2, TAG and PDMA were as follows:

20. CONTINGENCIES                                                               
REGULATORY AND INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENTS                                            

Unfavorable economic conditions may contribute to an increase in the number of  
insurance companies that are under regulatory supervision. This may result in an
increase in mandatory assessments by state guaranty funds, or voluntary payments
by solvent insurance companies to cover losses to policyholders of insolvent or 
rehabilitated companies. Mandatory assessments, which are subject to statutory  
limits, can be partially recovered through a reduction in future premium taxes  
in some states. The Company is not able to reasonably estimate the potential    
impact of any such future assessments or voluntary payments.                    

LITIGATION                                                                      

The Company is involved from time to time in judicial, regulatory and           
arbitration proceedings concerning matters arising in connection with the       
conduct of its business. THG has agreed to indemnify the Company and Goldman    
Sachs with respect to certain of these matters as provided in the Stock Purchase
Agreement. Management believes, based on currently available information, that  
the results of such proceedings, in the aggregate, will not have a material     
adverse effect on the Company's financial condition. Given the inherent         
difficulty of predicting the outcome of the Company's litigation and regulatory 
matters, particularly in cases or proceeding in which substantial or            
indeterminate damages or fines are sought, the Company cannot estimate losses or
ranges of losses for cases or proceedings where there is only a reasonable      
possibility that a loss may be incurred. However, the Company believes that at  
the present time there are no pending or threatened lawsuits that are reasonably
likely to have a material adverse effect on the its consolidated financial      
position.                                                                       

In 1997, a lawsuit on behalf of a putative class was instituted against the     
Company alleging fraud, unfair or deceptive acts, and breach of contract,       
misrepresentation, and related claims in the sale of life insurance policies. In
November 1998, the Company and the plaintiffs entered into a settlement and in  
May 1999, the Federal District Court in Worcester, Massachusetts approved the   
settlement and certified the class for this purpose. In 2007, the Company       
released $0.4 million in liabilities related to this litigation representing the
remaining expenses of its obligation under the settlement.                      

On July 24, 2002, an action was commenced in the United States District Court   
for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division. The Plaintiffs, who    
purchased two variable annuities, were subsequently identified as engaging in   
frequent transfers of significant sums between sub-accounts that in the         
Company's opinion constituted "market timing," and were subject to restrictions 
upon such trading that the Company imposed in December 2001. Plaintiffs allege  
that such restrictions constituted a breach of the terms of the annuity         
contracts. In December 2006, a jury returned a verdict of $1.3 million in favor 
of the plaintiffs, both parties have appealed. The outcome of this matter is not
expected to be material to the Company's annual results of operations or        
financial position. In addition, THG has agreed to indemnify the Company and    
Goldman Sachs with respect to this litigation for amounts over $250,000. The    
Company released $0.2 million to THG for the year 2007 related to this          
litigation, leaving $0.1 million to cover

FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007

current and estimated future contingent liabilities. THG, on behalf of the      
Company, continues to vigorously defend this matter, and regards plaintiffs'    
claims for lost trading profits as being speculative and, in any case,          
subject to an obligation to mitigate damages. In February 2008, the Court of    
Appeals vacated the $1.1 million verdict. Plaintiffs may appeal, but it is      
unlikely that the Court of Appeals will hear the case en banc or that the       
Supreme Court of the United States will take the case.                          

In addition, the Company is involved, from time to time, in investigations and  
proceedings by governmental and self-regulatory agencies, which currently       
include investigations relating to "market timing" in sub-accounts of variable  
annuity and life products, "revenue sharing" and other matters, and regulatory  
inquiries into compensation arrangements with brokers and agents. A number of   
companies have announced settlements of enforcement actions related to such     
matters with various regulatory agencies, including the SEC, which have included
a range of monetary penalties and restitution. In February 2006, THG reached a  
settlement agreement with the SEC regarding its investigation related to "market
timing", "revenue sharing" and other matters, including the marketing support   
and administrative services arrangements entered into by VeraVest Investments,  
Inc. in connection with the distribution of life insurance and annuity products 
issued by unaffiliated insurance companies. The total amount of the settlement  
is $5.0 million. The Company's share of this settlement was $2.8 million, of    
which $2.1 million was paid during 2006 and $0.7 million was paid during 2007   
representing all outstanding liabilities under this settlement.                 

21. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS                                                  

In 2007, the Company signed a distribution and service agreement with its       
affiliate, Epoch, to serve as principal underwriter and common remitter for     
certain variable annuity products issued by the Company and its separate        
accounts. This resulted in expense of $0.1 million for 2007 for these services. 
The Company performs certain administrative services on its behalf. No income   
was generated for the year ended December 31, 2007.                             

The Company has a management services agreement with its affiliate, Goldman     
Sachs & Co ("GSCO"). Under this service agreement, GSCO provides support to the 
Company in administrative, legal, compliance, technology, operations, financial 
reporting, human resources, risk management and other areas, and the Company is 
allocated costs for services received. GSCO charged the Company approximately   
$3.0 million and $3.8 million in 2007 and 2006 respectively, for these services.
These amounts are shown within other operating expenses.                        

In 2005, the Company entered into several derivative transactions with its      
affiliate, Goldman Sachs International ("GSI"). These derivative positions      
resulted in income of $10.2 million and expense of $47.4 million, for 2007 and  
2006 respectively, due to mark to market of the positions. During 2007, the     
Company entered into several derivative transactions with its affiliate, Goldman
Sachs Financial Markets L.L.C ("GSFM"), which resulted in income of $9.5 million
for 2007.                                                                       

The service agreement entered into with GSAM, an affiliate organization that    
provides investment management services, generated expense of $2.6 million and  
$2.1 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. No expense was generated for the   
year ended December 31, 2005.                                                   

As part of the variable products in the separate account, the Company offers    
underlying Goldman Sachs Variable Investment Trust funds. Management fees are   
paid directly to GSAM and certain of these distribution and administration fees 
are passed to the Company. This resulted in revenue of $6.9 million and $7.0    
million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006.            

As of November 1, 2006, the Company entered into a coinsurance agreement to cede
100% of its deferred fixed annuity insurance business to its South Carolina     
domiciled affiliate, Columbia. In consideration of Columbia's assumption of the 
liabilities, the Company received a $1.9 million ceding commission. As of       
December 31, 2007 the Company ceded reserves of $46.7 million.                  

In 2006, the employees of the Company became participants in The Goldman Sachs  
Amended and Restated Stock Incentive Plan (the "SIP"). Pursuant to the SIP,     
Goldman Sachs issued restricted stock units (RSU's) to certain employees of the 
Company as part of their overall compensation for 2006. Unvested RSU's require  
future service as a condition of delivery of the underlying shares of Goldman   
Sachs' common stock generally over a three year period. Delivery of the         
underlying shares of common stock is also conditioned on the grantee's          
satisfying certain other requirements as outlined in the award agreement. The   
Company incurred expenses of $0.7 million and $1.5 million relating to RSU's for
the years ended December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS                                  
FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007 
21. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS (CONTINUED)                                      

Prior to the Transaction, the Company provided, through its wholly-owned        
subsidiary FAFLIC, management, space and other services, including accounting,  
electronic data processing, human resources, benefits, legal and other staff    
functions to affiliates. These entities ceased to be affiliates as of December
30, 2005 and effectively on that date the Company stopped providing these       
services. Amounts charged by the Company to its affiliates in periods prior to  
the Transaction for services were based on full cost including all direct and   
indirect overhead costs that amounted to $165.7 million in 2005. Net amounts due
from predecessor affiliates for accrued expenses and various other liabilities  
and receivables was $0.4 million at December 31, 2006. There were no amounts due
from affiliates at December 31, 2007.                                           

22. STATUTORY FINANCIAL INFORMATION                                             

The Company is required to file annual statements with state regulatory         
authorities prepared on an accounting basis prescribed or permitted by such     
authorities (statutory basis), as codified by the National Association of       
Insurance Commissioners. Statutory surplus differs from shareholders' equity    
reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles primarily  
because policy acquisition costs are expensed when incurred. Statutory          
accounting principles require asset valuation and interest maintenance reserves,
postretirement benefit costs are based on different assumptions and reflect a   
different method of adoption, life insurance reserves are based on different    
assumptions and the recognition of deferred tax assets is based on different    
recoverability assumptions.                                                     

Statutory net (loss) income and surplus are as follows:                         

                                                                [Download Table]

Effective January 1, 2008, the Company assumption reinsured the book of business
from Fidelity Mutual Life Insurance Company ("FML") comprising primarily whole, 
term and universal life insurance policies. FML is currently in rehabilitation  
under the governance of the State of Pennsylvania, and the Company will have no 
responsibility for the dissolution or future state of FML and any of its        
remaining legal entity obligations or liabilities. As part of this transaction, 
the Company paid a ceding commission of $4.3 million and assumed general account
reserves of $0.7 billion.                                                       

On October 31, 2007, the Company signed a third party administrator agreement   
with TAG and an application service provider agreement with PDMA. Commencing    
January 1, 2008 TAG began to provide administration for the Company's block     
of traditional insurance business reinsured from FML, utilizing a PDMA          
platform to administer the block.                                               

During the first quarter of 2008, the Company effectively ceded the entire FML  
block of business to Columbia. In consideration of Columbia's assumption of the 
business, the Company received a ceding commission of approximately $4.1        
million.                                                                        

In the first quarter of 2008, Epoch replaced Security Distributors, Inc. ("SDI")
as principal underwriter for several of the Company's previously issued variable
products. However, SDI remains the principal underwriter of several previously  
issued variable annuity products.

1, 2008. Concurrent with the recapture, certain derivative options hedging the  
rider benefits of this treaty will be disposed. The recapture of the Pacific    
Life block will result in a settlement receivable of $25.5 million with a       
subsequent reduction in policyholder liabilities and DAC.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM           

To the Board of Directors of Commonwealth Annuity and Life Insurance Company    
and the Contract Owners of Separate Account VA-P of Commonwealth Annuity and    
Life Insurance Company:                                                         

In our opinion, the accompanying statements of assets and liabilities and the   
related statements of operations and of changes in net assets present fairly,   
in all material respects, the financial position of each of the sub-accounts    
constituting Separate Account VA-P of Commonwealth Annuity and Life Insurance   
Company at December 31, 2007, the results of each of their operations for the   
year then ended and the changes in each of their net assets for each of the     
two years in the period then ended, in conformity with accounting principles    
generally accepted in the United States of America.  These financial            
statements are the responsibility of Commonwealth Annuity and Life Insurance    
Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these     
financial statements based on our audits.  We conducted our audits of these     
financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company     
Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we    
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the     
financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes      
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures     
in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and       
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall            
financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits, which included   
confirmation of securities at December 31, 2007 by correspondence with the      
mutual funds, provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS                                                   
NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION                                                           

   Separate Account VA-P (the "Separate Account"), which funds the
Pioneer Vision, Pioneer Vision 2, Pioneer XtraVision and Pioneer C-Vision       
variable annuity contracts, is a separate investment account of Commonwealth    
Annuity and Life Insurance Company ("Commonwealth Annuity"), established on     
October 27, 1994 for the purpose of separating from the general assets of       
Commonwealth Annuity those assets used to fund the variable portion of certain  
variable annuity contracts (the "Contracts") issued by Commonwealth Annuity.    
Prior to September 1, 2006, Commonwealth Annuity was Allmerica Financial Life   
Insurance and Annuity Company.                                                  

        Prior to December 30, 2005 ("the Closing Date") Commonwealth Annuity
was a wholly owned subsidiary of The Hanover Insurance Group, Inc. ("THG").     
Prior to December 1, 2005 THG was named Allmerica Financial Corporation ("AFC").
On the Closing Date, THG sold Commonwealth Annuity and its closed block of      
variable annuity and variable life business ("the Transaction") to The Goldman  
Sachs Group, Inc. ("Goldman Sachs").                                            

     Under applicable insurance law, the assets and liabilities of the
Separate Account are clearly identified and distinguished from the other assets 
and liabilities of Commonwealth Annuity. The Separate Account cannot be charged 
with liabilities arising out of any other business of Commonwealth Annuity.     
Commonwealth Annuity's General Account is subject to the claims of creditors.   

       The Separate Account is registered as a unit investment trust under
the Investment Company Act of 1940, as Amended (the "1940 Act"). Twenty-two

NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES                             

         The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires          
management to make estimates at the date of the financial statements. Actual    
results could differ from those estimates.

NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)                 

          The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed
by the Separate Account in the preparation of its financial statements.         

          INVESTMENTS - Security transactions are recorded as of the trade date.
Investments held by the Sub-Accounts are stated at the net asset value per share
of the Underlying Funds. Realized investment gains and losses are determined    
using the average cost method. Dividend income and capital gain distributions   
are recorded on the ex-distribution date and are reinvested in additional shares
of the Underlying Funds at net asset value.                                     

     FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS - Commonwealth Annuity adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements," ("SFAS No.   
157") as of the beginning of 2007. SFAS No. 157 clarifies that fair value is an 
exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or  
paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market           
participants. Under SFAS No. 157, fair value measurements are not adjusted for  
transaction costs. SFAS No. 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy that         
prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The  
hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active      
markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurements) and the      
lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements). The effect of    
adopting SFAS No. 157 was not material to Commonwealth Annuity's financial      
position or results of operations. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy 
under SFAS No. 157 are described below:                                         

 Basis of Fair Value Measurement

     Level 1   Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at
        the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or
liabilities;                                      

Level 2   Quoted prices in markets that are not active or financial   
          instruments for which all significant inputs are observable,
either directly or indirectly;                    

Level 3   Prices or valuations that require inputs that are both      
         significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.

     A financial instrument's level within the fair value hierarchy is
based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value    
measurement. The open-ended mutual funds in the Separate Account produce a      
daily NAV that is validated with a sufficient level of observable activity to   
support classification of the fair value measurement as level 1.                

      STATEMENTS OF CHANGES IN NET ASSETS - Contract Owners may allocate
their Contract Values to variable investment options in the Separate Account,   
the Fixed Account and the Guaranteed Period Account. The Fixed Account is a part
of Commonwealth Annuity's General Account that guarantees principal and a fixed 
minimum interest rate. The Guaranteed Period Account is included in Separate    
Account GPA, a non-registered separate account offered by Commonwealth Annuity, 
which offers fixed rates of interest for specified periods. Net Purchase        
Payments represent payments under the Contracts (excluding amounts allocated to 
the Fixed and Guaranteed Period Accounts) reduced by applicable deductions,     
charges, and state premium taxes. Contract Charges are deductions from Contract 
Values for optional rider benefits and annual contract fees. Contract benefits  
are payments made to Contract Owners and beneficiaries under the terms of the   
Contracts.

NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)                 

Transfers between Sub-Accounts (including Separate Account GPA), net, are       
amounts that Contract Owners have directed to be moved among variable           
Sub-Accounts and the Guaranteed Period Account. Other transfers from (to) the   
General Account include certain transfers from and to contracts in the          
annuitization phase, reserve adjustments, and withdrawal charges.               

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS - Statement of Position 03-5 "FINANCIAL
HIGHLIGHTS OF SEPARATE ACCOUNTS: An Amendment to the Audit and Accounting Guide 
AUDITS OF INVESTMENT COMPANIES" was effective for fiscal years ending after     
December 15, 2003. This resulted in additional disclosures as detailed in Note  
6, Financial Highlights.                                                        

     FEDERAL INCOME TAXES - The operations of the Separate Account are
included in the federal income tax return of Commonwealth Annuity, which is     
taxed as a life insurance company under Subchapter L of the Internal Revenue    
Code ("IRC"). Under the current provisions of the IRC, Commonwealth Annuity does
not expect to incur federal income taxes on the earnings or realized capital    
gains attributable to the Separate Account. Based on this, no Federal income tax
provision is required. Commonwealth Annuity will review periodically the status 
of this policy during the year in the event of changes in the tax law. A charge 
may be made in future years for any federal income taxes that would be          
attributable to the Contracts.                                                  

         Under the provisions of Section 817(h) of the IRC, a variable annuity
contract will not be treated as an annuity contract for federal income tax      
purposes for any period for which the investments of the segregated asset       
account on which the contract is based are not adequately diversified. The IRC  
provides that the "adequately diversified" requirement may be met if the        
underlying investments satisfy either a statutory safe harbor test or           
diversification requirements set forth in regulations issued by the Secretary of
the Treasury. The Internal Revenue Service has issued regulations under Section 
817(h) of the IRC. Commonwealth Annuity believes that the Separate Account      
satisfies the current requirements of the regulations, and it intends that it   
will continue to meet such requirements.                                        

NOTE 3 - EXPENSES AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS                                

       Commonwealth Annuity makes a daily charge against the net assets of
each Sub-Account to compensate for certain mortality and expense risks it has   
assumed. If the charge for mortality and expense risks isn't sufficient to cover
actual mortality experience and expenses, Commonwealth Annuity will absorb the  
losses. If costs are less than the amounts charged, the difference will be a    
profit to Commonwealth Annuity. Commonwealth Annuity also makes a daily         
administrative charge against the net assets of each Sub-Account. Both of these 
charges are imposed during the accumulation and annuity payout phase.           

          A Contract fee may be deducted from the contract value annually during
the accumulation phase and upon full surrender of the Contract, if the          
accumulated value is below certain levels. This fee is currently waived for     
certain types of contracts, and, where permitted by law, for contracts whose    
owner or annuitant has certain affiliations with Commonwealth Annuity, or has   
certain family members with such an affiliation. When contract value has been   
allocated to more than one investment option, Contract Deductions are made from 
each on a pro-rata basis.                                                       

          Subject to state availability, Commonwealth Annuity offers a number of
optional riders. A separate monthly charge is made for each rider.

A surrender charge may be deducted from the accumulated value of the  
Contract in the case of surrender or partial redemption of the Contract, or at  
the time annuity payments begin. The amount charged is determined by the        
product, the length of time the Contract has been in force, the category of     
accumulated value surrendered or redeemed, the time elapsed since the amount    
surrendered or redeemed was credited to the Contract, and whether the Contract  
Owner or annuitant are included in certain classes exempt from these charges.   
The maximum charge will not exceed 7% of the amount surrendered or redeemed.    

    Some states and municipalities impose premium taxes, which currently range
up to 3.5%, on variable annuity contracts.                                      

  The disclosures above include charges currently assessed to the Contract
Owner. There are certain other charges that may be assessed in future periods,  
at the discretion of Commonwealth Annuity, in accordance with Contract terms.   
Detailed descriptions of all fees and charges are available in the product      
prospectuses.

(1)  These amounts represent the dividends, excluding distributions of capital  
gains, received by the Sub-Account from the Underlying Fund, net of   
  management fees assessed by the fund manager, divided by the average net
    assets. These ratios exclude those expenses, such as mortality and expense
charges, that result in direct reductions in the unit values. The     
recognition of investment income by the Sub-Account is affected by the
    timing of the declaration of dividends by the Underlying Fund in which the
Sub-Accounts invest.                                                  

(2)  These ratios represent the annualized contract expenses of the Separate    
  Account, consisting primarily of mortality and expense charges, for each
   period indicated. The ratios include only those expenses that result in a
  direct reduction to unit values. Charges made directly to contract owner
 accounts through the redemption of units and expenses of the Underlying
Fund are excluded.                                                    

(3)  These amounts represent the total return for the periods indicated,        
including changes in the value of the Underlying Fund, and reflect    
  deductions for all items included in the expense ratio. The total return
 does not include any expenses assessed through the redemption of units;
    inclusion of these expenses in the calculation would result in a reduction
in the total return presented. Investment options with a date notation
indicate the effective date of that investment option in the variable 
  account. The total return is calculated for the period indicated or from
the effective date through the end of the reporting period.

the full extent permitted by applicable law any person made or threatened to be 
made a party to any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,        
administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that such person's       
testator or intestate is or was a director, officer or employee of the          
Corporation or serves or served at the request of the Corporation any other     
enterprise as a director, officer or employee. Expenses, including attorneys'   
fees, incurred by any such person in defending any such action, suit or         
proceeding shall be paid or reimbursed by the Corporation promptly upon receipt 
by it of an undertaking of such person to repay such expenses if such person if 
finally adjudicated not to have acted in good faith in the reasonable belief

enterprise. The Corporation shall accept such undertaking without reference to  
the financial ability of such person to make repayment. Notwithstanding the     
foregoing, no indemnification shall be provided for any person with respect to

in a criminal proceeding, shall of itself be deemed an adjudication of not      
having

P-->485BPOS207th Page of 210TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 207th
ITEM 32. UNDERTAKINGS 

     (a)  The Registrant hereby undertakes to file a post-effective amendment to
       this registration statement as frequently as is necessary to ensure
       that the audited financial statements in the registration statement
       are never more than 16 months old for so long as payments under the
variable annuity contracts may be accepted.                 

(b)  The Registrant hereby undertakes to include in the prospectus a  
     postcard that the applicant can remove to send for a Statement of
Additional Information.                                     

    (c)  The Registrant hereby undertakes to deliver a Statement of Additional
          Information and any financial statements promptly upon written or oral
request, according to the requirements of Form N-4.         

  (d)  Insofar as indemnification for liability arising under the 1933 Act
      may be permitted to Directors, Officers and Controlling Persons of
          Registrant under any registration statement, underwriting agreement or
      otherwise, Registrant has been advised that, in the opinion of the
          SEC, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the
        1933 Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim
        for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment
        by Registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a Director, Officer or
     Controlling Person of Registrant in the successful defense of any
        action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such Director, Officer or
          Controlling Person in connection with the securities being registered,
        Registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has
been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of 
         appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by
        it is against public policy as expressed in the 1933 Act and will be
governed by the final adjudication of such issue.           

(e)  The Company hereby represents that the aggregate fees and charges
 under the Policies are reasonable in relation to the services
        rendered, expenses expected to be incurred, and risks assumed by the
Company.                                                    

ITEM 33. REPRESENTATIONS CONCERNING WITHDRAWAL RESTRICTIONS ON SECTION 403(b)   
PLANS AND UNDER THE TEXAS OPTIONAL RETIREMENT PROGRAM 

   Registrant, a separate account of Commonwealth Annuity and Life Insurance
   Company ("Company"), states that it is (a) relying on Rule 6c-7 under the
   1940 Act with respect to withdrawal restrictions under the Texas Optional
  Retirement Program ("Program") and (b) relying on the "no-action" letter
   (Ref. No. IP-6-88) issued on November 28, 1988 to the American Council of
     Life Insurance, in applying the withdrawal restrictions of Internal Revenue
Code Section 403(b)(11). Registrant has taken the following steps in  
reliance on the letter:                                               

1.   Appropriate disclosures regarding the redemption/withdrawal      
      restrictions imposed by the Program and by Section 403(b)(11) have
          been included in the prospectus of each registration statement used in
  connection with the offer of the Company's variable contracts.

2.   Appropriate disclosures regarding the redemption/withdrawal      
      restrictions imposed by the Program and by Section 403(b)(11) have
          been included in sales literature used in connection with the offer of
the Company's variable contracts.                           

3.   Sales Representatives who solicit participants to purchase the   
     variable contracts have been instructed to specifically bring the
    redemption/withdrawal restrictions imposed by the Program and by
  Section 403(b)(11) to the attention of potential participants.

P-->485BPOS208th Page of 210TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 208th
  4.   A signed statement acknowledging the participant's understanding of
        (I) the restrictions on redemption/withdrawal imposed by the Program
  and by Section 403(b)(11) and (ii) the investment alternatives
         available under the employer's arrangement will be obtained from each
        participant who purchases a variable annuity contract prior to or at
the time of purchase.                                       

Registrant hereby represents that it will not act to deny or limit a  
transfer request except to the extent that a Service-Ruling or written
   opinion of counsel, specifically addressing the fact pattern involved and
   taking into account the terms of the applicable employer plan, determines
   that denial or limitation is necessary for the variable annuity contracts
    to meet the requirements of the Program or of Section 403(b). Any transfer

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
