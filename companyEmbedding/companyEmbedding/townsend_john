Townsend, John (Author)	
									        	
									




The person who pushes your buttons is likely someone who matters to you – a spouse, a parent, a boss, a fellow church member.




Description


Button-pushers come in all shapes and sizes, but they have one thing in common: Their behavior drives us crazy and makes us dream of ways to escape the mess we're in.The person who pushes your buttons is likely someone who matters to you – a spouse, a parent, a boss, a fellow church member. Almost always this difficult person is connected to you by blood, love, faith, or money, so you can't just end the relationship without causing pain and upheaval in your life.Our friends and today's culture will often advise us to abandon such relationships quickly – to end this unpleasant chapter and get on with our lives. Psychologist and author Dr. John Townsend disagrees, "Your button-pusher is not someone you would easily and casually leave. You are intertwined at many levels. It is worth the trouble to take a look at the ways the relationship you had, and want, can be revived and reborn."In this easy-to-read book he offersExpert insights to help you understand your own button-pusherWise assistance in determining the nature of the problemCompassionate help in identifying your failed attempts to fix thingsA hope-filled vision for what can be and how to make it come trueRich resources to help you navigate the necessary changes

Indiana attorneys prosecuting personal injury and wrongful-death cases nationwide
Empathetic Law Practice Aggressively Pursues Your Rights and Recompense Due
Townsend & Townsend, LLP vigorously and relentlessly prosecutes personal injury and wrongful-death cases for clients throughout the United States.
Founded in 1941, our Indianapolis, Indiana, family-based firm has grown to span three generations of attorneys. Their combined experience includes the presentation of more than 1,000 jury trials in personal injury and wrongful-death cases.
People know us by the work we do
Townsend & Townsend aggressively pursues all types of personal injury and wrongful-death cases, including motor vehicle collisions, medical malpractice, and products and premises liability claims.
We believe that an attorney should be chosen based on the skill they have demonstrated in prior cases: The majority of our cases represent referrals by clients — many, but not all, of whom reside in Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky, Michigan or Ohio — or by other attorneys. You are invited to review some of the Supreme Court and Court of Appeals opinions from cases we have worked on, so that you can have a better feel for what we do and what we can achieve.
We do not get paid until you win
We frequently enter into co-counsel or referral-fee arrangements. No matter the arrangement, any attorney fees we collect are contingent upon the successful outcome of your case. You need not worry about legal bills compounding any financial stress imposed by your injuries: As our client, you do not pay any attorney fees unless and until we win the case and collect monetary damages on your behalf.
About the attorneys in our longtime family practice 
Our attorneys represent more than 90 combined years of legal experience. Also, they offer multilingual skills — Spanish and Italian.
John F. Townsend, Jr. is a son of one of the firm’s two cofounders, and he has more than 45 years of legal experience. He is a graduate of Harvard Law School and is a past president of the Indiana Trial Lawyers Association. Also, he is a recipient of that organization’s Lifetime Achievement Award. John’s son, John F. Townsend, III, has more than 15 years of legal experience, and he currently serves on the Indiana Trial Lawyers Association Board of Directors.
Earl C. Townsend, III is a son of the firm’s other cofounder and has more than 25 years of legal experience.

            Perhaps this book has some helpful information regarding friendships,  but I had to stop reading at page 29. Never is it OK for an opposite sex "friend" to be an "advocate" in resolving marriage issues between a husband and wife. No married person should be having those type of intimate conversations with a friend of the opposite sex.

            How to Be a Best Friend Forever


Dr. John Townsend


Book Summary: Our world has diluted the meaning of friendship, but the reality is, there's nothing like the sustaining strength of true-blue, forever friends. Still, many people are convinced that they'll never find such lifelong connectionsÃ¢â¬âor that they don't need them. In this encouraging book, best-selling author and psychologist John Townsend delivers hope and help for making these relationships a realityÃ¢â¬âand for making them even better if you've already got a "bestie." His eight principles for building the very best kind of friendship, along with his shared experiences within his own friendships (including mistakes he's made), will move every reader to aspire to deeper connections and to stay the course when challenges arise. Townsend's simple but profound concepts are sure to transform readers' relationships and keep them from missing out on one of life's greatest and most essential joys: the joy of having a best friend.


Review: I found this book to be a good help for how to be a better friend and how to nurture a friendship. I really liked the aspect of the book referring to the how we need a variety of friends. It was a tremendous help with understanding the varied aspects of friendship. The book draws on the author's own experiences. It was very detailed with the varied aspects of friendship and how to grow a friendship even deeper through shared experiences and suffering. It also help with explaining how friendships may suffer from experiences that can stall a growing friendship.


I would like to thank Net Galley and Worthy Publishing for allowing me to read and review this book in return for a free copy and I was never asked to write a favorable review by anyone.

            I enjoyed the book and found a lot of interesting insights. It was good to get a "guys" perspective on best friends.

            "In How to Be a Best Friend Forever: Making and Keeping Lifetime Relationships (Jan. 2012, Worthy Publishing), clinical psychologist and bestselling author Dr. John Townsend shows us the sustaining strength of forever friendships, helps us break through barriers, and reveals eight vital skills necessary for building long-term, rewarding friendships.


The book covers things like:


Ã¢â¬Â¢ The anatomy of a B.F.F. and 3 must-have qualities


Ã¢â¬Â¢ How to find and keep a BFF


Ã¢â¬Â¢ Learning to connect deeply in a friendship


Ã¢â¬Â¢ The trouble with family or spousal BFFs


Ã¢â¬Â¢ Does Facebook make friendships better?"


In modern times, the word "friend" has taken on a variety of meanings. With Facebook and Twitter, friends can be anything from vague acquaintances to people who truly are our BFFs. With the growth of digital technology it's getting harder and harder to maintain quality in our relationships.


Dr. Townsend believes we thrive on quality friendships and that these friendships bring tremendous joy into our lives. In his book, Dr. Townsend shows you how to build relationships that will last using research and stories from his own experiences and provides eight skills necessary to build long-lasting, rewarding friendships.


Much of what Dr. Townsend offers in his book are tools we should already and probably do know. The book is an easy read and one probably best read by teenagers and young adults or those who have found it difficult to maintain quality friendships.


Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from Worthy Publishing as part of their Book Review Blogger Program. I was not required to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission's 16 CFR, Part 255: "Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising."

            How important is a best friend to you? We know deep friendships are important but Townsend says many people do not know how to form them. Many people are isolated and have learned to live with just shallow friendships. Some just don't have the skill and abilities to go deep. Others put their energy into the opposite sex or family members.


Townsend has written this book to help you with friendship in general and particularly those few deep friendships. He wants you to experiences the highest level of good from our friendships.


Townsend clarifies what he means by friend, involving knowing, liking, and presence. They are people with whom you entrust yourself.


You'll need more than one person to provide all of the qualities you need. Different people have different strengths to offer. (He has caution and advice for pursuing friends of the opposite sex.) He explains that friendships need maintenance or will suffer and decline.


Townsend believes that most best friendships are being underutilized, not providing for either what they could. With exploration and effort the friendship can be maximized.


Townsend says your spouse as your only best friend is not enough. "We were not designed to have one person meet our deepest needs. We were designed for community." (50)


Townsend explains how to "connect" with people, how to deepen the attachment (such as venting, talking about core values). He also gives suggestions with respect to helping your friends, not give them excuses for their behavior. He writes about the social media world (such as Facebook) and its role in friendship. It may be great for updates but not for confrontations or serious dialogue.


Townsend writes about relational honesty. You are first to be truthful about yourself. You are to be truthful about the other person. He writes about fighting - the right way. Of healing, he says, "Time, plus relationship and truth, can heal just about everything." (114) He has recommendations for creating an honest environment. Time is essential. "Best Friendships require time to grow and produce the great relationships we need." (121)


Townsend says it is not good to have only family as best friends. "Love your home, love your family, but you were designed to let nonfamily members into the deeper recesses of your heart and life." (140) Do all you can to befriend those in your family who will be the kind of friends Townsend has described. "But beyond that," he says, "make sure you are connected to people outside the comfort zone of your family." (145)


He ends his book with a challenge. Best friends are powerful because you have made yourself vulnerable. They can be life-changing, positively or negatively. The same goes for your influence on them. Choose your words carefully. Pay attention to their care.


There is a discussion guide at the end of the book although the advanced egalley I received did not have it included.


This short book is packed with encouragement and ideas for creating and sustaining best friends. Teens and young adults would certainly benefit from this book


I received an advanced egalley of this book from Worthy Publishing for the purpose of this review

            I have read both this one and boundaries in dating. These two gentlemen are excellent writers and teachers. A great message for all, whether young or mature. Its just what I needed. It helps us define who we are as people and that no one has the right to control our life. Only God is in control. But we can gently move away from or let people know that we are competent and confident and have our boundaries.  I highly recommend this book.

            This book goes well with the text book. This book is wonderful to use to pull out the major points of text book, boundaries. This book is excellent to use for the leader leading a Bible study group. I also used the dvd companion. This was excellent and have a spot to pause to engage the group for discussion. This is excellent and will allow your class the opportunity to become transparet and see the need for biblical and wholesome boundaries in our lives.

            This is a subject that needs to be part of every Christian's education. Setting Boundaries is an important part of the Love your Neighbor and Obedience and Repentance, and Forgiveness part of life, which God has asked us to put into action in our lives. As soon as we adults have this working for us, we need to start with the children and work up to the Patriarchs in our families to develop boundaries that are God given, and strive to honor God in this special way.

Product DescriptionLearn when to say yes and when to say no--to your spouse and to others--to make the most of your marriage. 
 
Only when a husband and wife know and respect each other's needs, choices, and freedom can they give themselves freely and lovingly to one another. Boundaries are the "property lines that define and protect husbands and wives as individuals. Once they are in place, a good marriage can become better, and a less-than-satisfying one can even be saved.
 
Drs. Henry Cloud and John Townsend, counselors and authors of the award-winning best-seller Boundaries, show couples how to apply the 10 laws of boundaries that can make a real difference in relationships. They help husbands and wives understand the friction points or serious hurts and betrayals in their marriage — and move beyond them to the mutual care, respect, affirmation, and intimacy they both long for.
 
Boundaries in Marriage helps couples:   Set and maintain personal boundaries and respect those of their spouse   Establish values that form a godly structure and architecture for their marriage   Protect their marriage from different kinds of intruders   Work with a spouse who understands and values boundaries or work with one who doesn't.

Product DescriptionHaving clear boundaries is essential to a healthy, balanced lifestyle. A boundary is a personal property line that marks those things for which we are responsible. In other words, boundaries define who we are and who we are not. Boundaries impact all areas of our lives: Physical boundaries help us determine who may touch us and under what circumstancesMental boundaries give us the freedom to have our own thoughts and opinionsEmotional boundaries help us to deal with our own emotions and disengage from the harmful, manipulative emotions of othersSpiritual boundaries help us to distinguish God's will from our own and give us renewed awe for our CreatorOften, Christians focus so much on being loving and unselfish that they forget their own limits and limitations. When confronted with their lack of boundaries, they ask: Can I set limits and still be a loving person? What are legitimate boundaries? What if someone is upset or hurt by my boundaries?How do I answer someone who wants my time, love, energy, or money? Aren't boundaries selfish?Why do I feel guilty or afraid when I consider setting boundaries? Dr. Henry Cloud and Dr. John Townsend offer biblically-based answers to these and other tough questions, showing us how to set healthy boundaries with our parents, spouses, children, friends, co-workers, and even ourselves.More Product InformationPublisher: Zondervan
