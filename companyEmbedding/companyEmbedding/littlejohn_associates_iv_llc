Investment Strategies



Private EquitySpotlightPortfolioSpecial SituationsPerforming Credit




Littlejohn’s investment platform is focused on our integrated core strategies—private equity and credit. Each strategy employs the same disciplined investment philosophy, and we seek to capitalize on the related synergies. This approach is particularly powerful in the middle market.

Private Equity
investments that Littlejohn targets range from solid performing
middle market companies, to complicated corporate carve-outs, to
businesses facing operating difficulties, inadequate capital
resources or an inability to drive growth.  Littlejohn focuses
on a limited number of situations and looks to develop a strong
partnership with management to drive a step-change in growth,
performance, and enterprise value.
Special Situations
that the Fund will consider include leveraged loans, second lien
debt, mezzanine debt, high yield bonds, equities, and related
securities, and obligations of leveraged or financially distressed
companies and/or other special situations. A key element of the
Firm's investment strategy with respect to Distressed Investments
is to become active in the restructuring process in order to drive
increases in enterprise value for all company stakeholders.
Performing
Credit  investments are generally investments
in secured term loan obligations of non-investment grade corporate
borrowers.  These investments are in loans to borrowers not
experiencing financial distress that are rated and sourced by
Littlejohn in the broadly syndicated loan market. 
Investments focus on generating income while avoiding credit
losses.

Our StoryInvestment Strategies








Our Story



Building ValueLeadership




Littlejohn utilizes its unique culture and capabilities to make transformative equity and debt investments in a broad range of middle market companies. We complement this effort through our investments in the performing credit of large corporate borrowers.

The Firm is a private equity and
special situations investor focused on investing in companies
through all economic cycles.  The Firm has a long track record
of successfully investing in the middle market where it can help
management teams to drive meaningful improvements in strategy,
growth, and operations.
Littlejohn has always invested
exclusively in middle market companies, which it defines as
businesses, with revenues typically between $100M and $800M. 
The companies we invest in are all facing the opportunities and
challenges of significant change, and we partner with management to
transform these businesses.  Our approach includes:

Expand All | Collapse All

Transforming good companies into great companies












Littlejohn has extensive experience
in partnering with management teams who are leading companies with
solid performance at the time of the transaction. We work with
management to drive a step-change in sustainable growth and
operating performance through both organic initiatives and
strategic acquisitions.








Carving out divisions of large corporations












Littlejohn has acquired many
operating divisions from some of the world's most well-known
multinational corporations.  We have deep experience in
managing an efficient and confidential acquisition process,
negotiating and performing appropriate transition arrangements, and
executing the carve-out to minimize disruption for the parent while
maximizing the potential of the newly independent
business. 








Operational and financial restructurings












Littlejohn has a unique perspective
on companies dealing with financial and operational distress. 
We have deep experience dealing with the complicated and often
contentious, multi-party financial restructuring process.
 Given our experience in building long term value at our
companies, however, we focus beyond short-sighted recovery actions
in order to rebuild corporate momentum and maximize enterprise
value for the benefit of all stakeholders.








Rescue financings












Littlejohn's primary goal in
structured capital transactions is to deliver a solution that
provides business owners and management with the liquidity, time,
and capital for success.  In these situations, however,
Littlejohn looks to bring more to the table than capital.  Our
culture and experience in working closely with management teams to
drive long-term commercial and operational success differentiates
us from many players in structured capital investments.








Distressed securities investing












Littlejohn takes positions in the
securities of stressed and distressed middle market
companies.  We do this with an eye toward taking a leadership
role in working with management and all other stakeholders to craft
a financial solution that provides adequate "runway" for long term
strategic recovery and growth.








Performing credit investing












Littlejohn makes investments in performing debt instruments,
principally syndicated leveraged loans of corporate
borrowers.  Through active portfolio management, we seek to
generate attractive risk adjusted returns through a combination of
current income, capital appreciation and preservation of
principal.

        Know all by these presents, that the undersigned hereby constitutes and

      the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules thereunder;

(2)   do and perform any and all acts for and on behalf of the undersigned which
      may be necessary or desirable to complete and execute any such Form 3, 4,

      the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and any stock
      exchange or similar authority; and

(3)   take any other action of any type whatsoever in connection with the
      foregoing which, in the opinion of such attorney-in-fact, may be of
      benefit to, in the best interest of, or legally required by, the
