Company History
Morris and Sigmund Stern immigrated to the United States from Germany at the end of the 19th century because their Bavarian village was too small to contain their dreams for a better life. Even as teenagers, the brothers knew that people who succeed in business create their own opportunities.

It is run by a very knowledgeable group of senior managers who care about the firm's growth, it's future and careers of it's employees. I feel I have plenty of room for growth with the firm, future opportunities and promotions. The employees work very well together and are always available to help.ConsI have not found any yet. The firm really only deals in tax-exempt bonds so if someone was looking for a career in corporate finance or M&A this isn't the place; that could be viewed as a downside to an outsider. We are running out of room in our Saint Louis office! But that should be fixed in the near future as we expand in our current location.Advice to ManagementKeep up the great work, the future looks great for the firm.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (2) Stern Brothers & Co.

However, the firm is run by deal junkies and not managers, which might not sounds like an issue but it really creates more problems under the hood than one would believe. The high amount of turnover is evidence of this. It is also a very old schooled finance firm in its culture - you eat what you kill. So, for junior or support professionals, you will never be well paid or given much of a bonus. Until you are in a position to bring in transactions, you will be hard pressed to find advancement opportunities. This also creates a lot of tension between lead bankers, which puts junior staff in awkward positions more often than they need to be. The firm's operational, IT infrastructure lacks investment, which means you will be shifting through many files, pulling your hair to find answers to many questions (in RFPS) that should really be housed better. That also translates into a competitive disadvantage as compared with other firms who will be able to pull more accurate and robust data to be used for client pitches.Advice to ManagementThe lack of strategic vision creates a chaotic approach to the day to day business, high turnover, and more roadblocks than necessary for future growth. Find a focus in public finance and become the market leader in that space - wasting time and resources to chase everything ensures that nothing happens. There is an opportunity with the firm's platform for a lot of growth, but the current mgmt is not able to capitalize on it. The firm is a prime example of a small business that has a lot of potential to unlock value but is unable to due so because of the inabilities and resistance from its owner/operator. Finding a competent leadership team with the experience, desire, and ambition to revamp the firm's platform is needed more each day. Until then, expect the firm to continue to experience high turnover, infighting between its lead bankers, inability to compete on par with other public finance firms, stunted growth, ruined relationships, and most disastrous: failure to best serve current and future clients.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (1) Stern Brothers & Co.
