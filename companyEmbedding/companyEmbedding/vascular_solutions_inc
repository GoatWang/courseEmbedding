The FDA has identified this as a Class I recall, the most serious type of recall. Use of these devices may cause serious injuries or death. 
Recalled Product

Venture RX Catheter (Model 5820), Venture OTW (Model 5821), and Venture CS  Catheter (Model 5822)
Lot Numbers: See Full List Below
Distribution Dates: May 7, 2015 to April 19, 2017
Manufacturing Dates: May 7, 2015 to March 31, 2017
Devices Recalled in the U.S.: 7054 nationwide

Device Use
The Venture catheter is intended for directing, steering, controlling, and supporting a guidewire to access veins and arteries in the arms, legs, hands, feet, and heart muscle (myocardium). Certain models may also administer saline fluids or drugs into blood vessels.

Reason for Recall
Vascular Solutions Inc. is recalling the Venture catheter because there is a risk of the catheter tip splitting or separating during use. Excess material at the tip of the catheter may separate and could enter the patient's bloodstream. This can result in serious adverse health consequences such as the development of blood clots, embolism of the excess material to vital organs, or death.
Who May be Affected

Health care providers using this device during vascular procedures
All patient groups undergoing procedures involving Venture catheters

What to Do
On April 25, 2017, Vascular Solutions Inc. sent an Urgent Medical Device Recall letter to all affected customers. The letter asked distributors and customers to:

Identify and remove any affected Venture catheters from inventory and quarantine.
Ensure all customers who received any affected Venture catheters receive the Field Safety Notice and complete the Customer Inventory Form.
After all the affected catheters are returned, complete the Vascular Solutions Inc. Distributor Inventory Form, and return it via email to regops@vasc.com.
Upon receipt of the Vascular Solutions Inc. Distributor Inventory Form, Vascular Solutions' Customer Service Department will provide a Return Authorization number and arrange for return of affected Venture catheters. A credit will be offered after affected devices have been returned.

Contact Information
Health care professionals and consumers may contact Vascular Solutions at 1-888-240-6001 Monday through Friday, between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. Central Time or by email at customerservice@vasc.com with any questions related to this recall.
Date Recall Initiated
April 25, 2017

Announcement




Vascular Solutions, Inc. voluntarily initiates a worldwide recall of Venture Catheters on April 25, 2017Teleflex Incorporated (NYSE: TFX), announces a worldwide recall of Venture® Catheters was voluntarily initiated by its Vascular Solutions, Inc. subsidiary on April 25, 2017. Vascular Solutions, Inc. is the manufacturer of Venture Catheters, which are designed for use in catheterization procedures, to direct, steer, control, and support a guidewire to access discrete regions of the coronary and peripheral vasculature. Two versions may also be used for manual delivery of saline solution or diagnostic contrast agents.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) classified this as a Class I recall. The FDA defines Class I recall as, "a situation in which there is a reasonable probability that the use of, or exposure to, a violative product will cause serious adverse health consequences or death."The worldwide recall affects 4,679 units distributed in the United States. All unexpired lots of the Rapid Exchange (RX), Over-the-Wire (OTW), and Coronary Sinus (CS) versions of the product have been recalled due to the potential for excess material to be present within the inner lumen of the distal catheter tip. It is possible that the excess material may separate from the catheter during use and pose a potential risk of embolism, which could result in serious injury. No serious injuries or death have been reported in association with this issue to date.Vascular Solutions, Inc. initiated the recall through an Urgent Medical Device Recall notification distributed to purchasers of the affected products. Healthcare facilities with affected Venture Catheters should remove the products from their inventory and return them to Vascular Solutions, Inc. The notification identified the specific unexpired lots subject to the recall and included instructions on how to return the affected products to Vascular Solutions, Inc.Vascular Solutions, Inc. has notified the FDA of this action.Vascular Solutions, Inc.

Description

Code Information

Twin-Pass® Dual Access Catheter
Vascular Solutions Model Number 5200
lot numbers: 
540787, 541342, 542253, 542962, 543508, 543775, 544597, 540909,541881, 542302, 542994, 543590, 543922, 544831, 541079, 541992, 542693, 543173, 543591, 544188, 541304, 542111, 542875, 543304, 543698, 544315.


Reason of Recall

There have been two similar reports, representing 0.05% of the device investigations for the Twin-Pass catheter, in which Twin-Pass catheters contained a piece of PTFE beading material within the OTW lumen of the catheter. During the manufacturing process, the PTFE beading is placed in the patent OTW lumen to avoid exposing the inside of the lumen to the hydrophilic coating that is applied to the outside of the catheter. The PTFE beading is then to be removed prior to packaging. It has been concluded that there is potential that the PTFE beading was not removed prior to packaging in some catheters within the lots listed above.

Although, there have been no adverse events associated with these internal Device Experience Reports, due to the potential harm that this could cause a patient in the event that the PTFE beading is inadvertently flushed into a vessel (vessel injury, vessel occlusion and/or embolization), Vascular Solutions has made the decision to remove and replace the affected Twin-Pass catheters.


Date Recall Initiated

July 6, 2009


Action

We ask that you immediately check your Twin-Pass catheter inventory and distribution records, and follow the steps outlined below:
1. Remove any affected Twin-Pass catheters, indicated in the chart above, from your current inventory.
2. Place affected Twin-Pass catheters in a secure location.
3. Contact your customers that received affected Twin-Pass product according to your distribution records. If the customers have any remaining affected product, please request that they return to your location.
No other lot numbers or models are affected by this recall. Twin-Pass catheters, not affected by this action, are available from Vascular Solutions for immediate order.
Vascular Solutions Inc. would like to take the opportunity to remind you to refer to the Instructions for Use for the Indications, Contraindications, Warnings, Precautions and Guidelines for prepping and deploying the Twin-Pass catheter.
