A Core PrincipaL
Our socially progressive approach to the markets means that we are investors first, but we view all opportunities through a lens of social impact.  We do not screen out industries or companies based on a social track record, rather we seek opportunities that demonstrate financial strength and contributions to improving the world around us. 
Reynders McVeigh's strategy is deeply rooted in fundamental beliefs that combine to create a sustainable investment:





OUR PAPERS
"Capital And Climate Change: Progressive Investments In A Changing Global Landscape"
"Socially Responsible Investing Comes of Age"

OUR PHILOSOPHY
Reynders, McVeigh is a carbon-neutral organization and links anyone interested to the SELF program: www.self.org


Long-term strategy based on disruption
Perhaps the most important quality an enterprise can have today is a value proposition that speaks to forward-thinking trends and understands that great opportunity comes through disruption. Keeping sights set on long term investments, there is enormous potential for meaningful monetary and social gains around new technology, innovative delivery mechanisms, and cutting edge research and application.

Low debt ratio
Long an indicator of a strong balance sheet, carrying a low debt/asset ratio frees management to pursue initiatives it believes will benefit its stakeholders. A strong balance sheet affords well-managed companies flexibility to keep all options open and to grow market share in weaker market periods. 

Consistent increases in dividend returns
Management that gives back to its investors consistently and with regular dividend increases demonstrates a key ethical value: the company’s leadership is in for the long haul, and wants its investors to remain as committed as they are. That fosters trust, participation, and a strong long-term position.

Investment in social change that furthers corporate goals
Not all social change is justification for investment. A constant flow of news briefs report on initiatives taken up in the name of the environment, but social change that supports management or a business model is where the market should be looking.

Sustainability disclosure
The previously noted elements are indications that a company is establishing itself as a productive investment, but transparency is the piece that embodies an honest commitment. This line of thinking has already been made evident in financial disclosure, as companies cultivate a sense of trust in the wake of the early 2000’s widely publicized corporate accounting scandals (Enron, WorldComm, etc.). Sustainability disclosure similarly provides stakeholders with a window into the company’s ethical priorities and management.

Thorough, independent research underlies all of our investment recommendations.
Reynders, McVeigh advises on over $4 billion, and each client benefits from our strict adherence to fundamental investment beliefs.  As we personalize portfolios to meet our clients’ individual needs, our focus is on finding value within companies that have clean balance sheets, sustainable growth opportunities, and a clear sense of purpose and ethics. Our discipline is based on:

A LONG-TERM OUTLOOK
We do not believe that any short-term trading strategy can overcome the risks and volatility inherent in the financial markets. All of our investments are based on a multi-year investment scenario and the long-term goals of our clients.

ETHICS
We will only invest in companies that we believe are committed to running their firms in an ethical manner. We look for fair treatment of employees, the environment, suppliers, customers, and shareholders because we believe that it is the right way to do business and because we believe it leads to competitive advantage.

QUALITY
We invest in companies that have strong balance sheets with minimal debt. We seek out firms that can fund their own growth and, where appropriate, pay out a growing stream of dividends. We focus on our very best ideas. Portfolios will normally hold between 30 and 40 equity positions.

SUSTAINABILITY
We seek to invest in companies that offer sustainable earnings growth over extended periods of time. This growth should be built upon proprietary business practices, a strong balance sheet, and ethical management.

CREATIVITY
We push ourselves to be creative and to be open to new ideas. We do all of our own research and regularly meet with an independent group of outside advisors to challenge our thinking. We will invest in large-, mid-, small- and micro-cap equities, and in both domestic and international companies.

CHANGE
While we have low turnover in our portfolios, we know that change is constant in the world and for our clients. Our portfolios are personalized to meet the varying needs of each client and to anticipate significant changes in the markets and in the complex global landscape.

MINIMIZING COSTS
Our job is to help meet each client’s financial goals over a long period of time. We are aware that high costs erode returns, and we are committed to keeping transaction costs and our management fees as low as possible.

INDEPENDENCE
We are contrarian in discipline, investing in companies when they are out of favor in the marketplace. We look for opportunities where others aren’t looking. And we do not seek to balance our industry weightings against any market index.

Zacks Investment Research lowered shares of CA Inc. (NASDAQ:CA) from a buy rating to a hold rating in a research report released on Monday morning. 
According to Zacks, “CA is a leading information technology (IT) management software company. We are optimistic about CA’s acquisition strategy, which has enhanced its IT management, software and services portfolio. Moreover, we believe that the diversity of its products and the increased efficiency offered by them will attract customers across sectors, lending stability to its business model. Additionally, CA’s “go to market” sales strategy integrates the commercial functions of sales, marketing, brand management, pricing and consumer insight, which helps it in lowering costs, thereby improving the bottom line. Nonetheless, intensifying competition from peers, an uncertain economic environment, currency headwinds and the weak IT spending forecast by Gartner are other concerns.

QUARTERLY INSIGHTS


Download to receive your copy of The Long Run, our quarterly newsletter. Past issues include:


THE LONG RUN QUARTERLY NEWSLETTER: July 2017
Companies need earnings and innovation for their stock price to grow. Earnings have been flowing quite nicely over the past six months due to lower energy prices and interest rates that had been in place for some time. In fact, earnings for the S&P 500 companies spurted 14.5% in the first quarter of this year versus last year, a sizable improvement from the 4.2% and 5.9% growth rates of the third and fourth quarters, respectively. Yet, conflicting pieces of data give us some pause.


THE LONG RUN QUARTERLY NEWSLETTER: April 2017
As we enter the second quarter of the Trump presidency, consumer confidence remains high, but it is not necessarily translating into economic activity. US equity indices have priced in significant economic growth that might not be immediately on the horizon. Recent history suggests that we should be careful about our expectations.


THE LONG RUN QUARTERLY NEWSLETTER: January 2017
It is not unusual for elections to have an immediate impact on stock prices as optimism is a powerful force in the short-term. Between election day and the end of 2016, the S&P 500 index rose by 4.6%. In the same time frame, it rose by 3.8% for Clinton, 4.2% for Carter, 5.2% for Reagan, 5.4% for Kennedy, 8% for Eisenhower and 8.2% for Hoover.


THE LONG RUN QUARTERLY NEWSLETTER: October 2016
Post-crash (or post-apocalyptic) investors have made mistakes by investing only
to avoid volatility or to guard against the factors that contributed to the last crisis in 2008. This rear-view mirror approach has led many to lose their discipline and balance – worse, many have missed out on significant equity gains.


THE LONG RUN QUARTERLY NEWSLETTER: July 2016
England currently runs a large trade deficit with Europe and this is business that the EU will not want to give up. Agreements will be worked out and business will go on. Read more.


THE LONG RUN QUARTERLY NEWSLETTER: April 2016
The extraordinarily sharp 25% rise in the value of the dollar against a global basket of currencies in a nine-month period beginning in the summer of 2014 was, to us, a clear sign of capitulation on the China industrial dream and resulting commodity super cycle. And we expect that it will take many years for the enormous amounts of capital invested in these trades to bleed out. Read more.


THE LONG RUN QUARTERLY NEWSLETTER: JANUARY 2016
The year began on a note of volatility, but iIs there a crack in this story that could let enough light in to change the gloomy outlook? Read more about our outlook.

THE LONG RUN QUARTERLY NEWSLETTER: OCTOBER 2015
A complicated global landscape caused some unexpected challenges this year, but what can we expect to see next year? Read more about what we think the future will hold for the markets.


 THE LONG RUN QUARTERLY NEWSLETTER: JULY 2015
Financial markets have stalled as sluggish global economic growth, the specter of a Fed rate increase here at home, corporate corruption in China and Brazil, and likely defaults by the debt-heads (Greece, Puerto Rico, and others to come) have taken their toll. Read why it's important for investors to remain balanced in order to surf positive trends as they emerge.


THE LONG RUN QUARTERLY NEWSLETTER: APRIL 2015
We are seeing big moves across currencies, commodities, and global economic policies that will express themselves in continued market volatility. Read more about why we welcome the idea of a return to normalcy in markets as this volatility rises.


THE LONG RUN QUARTERLY NEWSLETTER: JANUARY 2015
While we continue to remain positive on the U.S. economy and think it should lead to a rewarding stock market this year, read why we have concerns that the magnitude of changes in oil prices and the Dollar could lead to some unforeseen shocks in the world economy.


THE LONG RUN QUARTERLY NEWSLETTER: OCTOBER 2014
Falling oil and commodity prices offer an important benefit: Lower inflation risks. Read more about how a strengthening U.S. consumer, low inflation, and low interest rates create powerful support for stocks.


THE LONG RUN QUARTERLY NEWSLETTER: JULY 2014
“Bad” inflation is down due to Millennials’ change in living habits, a trend we see continuing. Read more about this trend and the potential for alternative energies to impact traditional use of energies in the near future.


THE LONG RUN QUARTERLY NEWSLETTER: APRIL 2014
Read why it is important to study and understand the macroeconomic environment in order to avoid areas of unusual risk and to uncover industries and geographies where transparency, growth, and reasonable stability combine to deliver sustainable long-term investment opportunities.
