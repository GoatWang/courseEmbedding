New York  21 July 2017 Reporter: Jenna Lomax 






BNY Mellon recruits for alternative investment team





BNY Mellon has made two senior appointments to its alternative investment services (AIS) team.

Jamie Gleeson as head of relationship management for alternative investment services. 

Gleeson has joined from State Street, where he was managing director. He has been recruited to help with BNY Mellon’s expanding client base in the alternatives space. 

Edwin Parker has also joined the team, taking over as director of business development for private equity, real estate and debt for Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Parker was most recently head of the AIS team at Northern Trust. 

BNY Mellon has increased its involvement in real estate and private equity following an increase in demand. 

Earlier this year, the bank announced its plans to provide fund administration services for PGIM Real Estate - a subsidiary of Prudential Financial. 

In 2015, BNY Mellon signed an agreement with Deutsche Asset and Wealth Management to become its outsourced provider of direct real estate. The inclusion of Gleeson and Parker will help BNY Mellon to grow even further.

Gleeson said: “BNY Mellon already has a very strong market position in the alternative investments arena and is well placed to grow even further. A large part of my role will be working with our clients to help them navigate this new landscape.”

Parker commented: “It is exciting to join BNY Mellon when it’s positioning itself actively to be the strategic asset serving partner of choice for investment firms in this space. I look forward to working as part of the wider AIS team to develop our capabilities and our client base in this market.”

Last week, BNY Mellon announced it has also appointed Charles Scharf as new CEO and director, effective immediately. Sharf is also set to become chairman of the board from January 2018.

The appointments follow a successful Q2 for the bank. It saw record figures of assets under custody and administration, reaching $31.1 trillion, and record assets under management of $1.77 trillion.

Bank of New York Mellon Corp. on Thursday posted a quarterly profit that beat estimates, renewing investor attention on a disappointing second quarter for rival Northern Trust Corp. 







Continue Reading Below


The shares of Northern Trust tumbled 8% on Wednesday and were down an additional 2% Thursday morning following a disclosure of profit that was below analysts' expectations. Bank of New York Mellon's shares rose 2% Thursday morning. 
A key difference between the two trust banks: How each navigated the rise in short-term interest rates in the U.S. The U.S. Federal Reserve raised the benchmark federal-funds rate in March, and again in June. 
BNY Mellon's net interest revenue rose 4% to $826 million from the first quarter. At Northern Trust, revenue on interest fell 7% from the same period. 
Northern Trust attributed the decline to a drop in U.S. deposits and an increase in those from the U.K. and Europe, where lending rates have remained at historic lows. The shift in mix squeezed interest margins at the firm. 
BNY Mellon has a smaller wealth-management business, whose clients tend to move their deposits more quickly than large institutions, said longtime finance chief Todd Gibbons in an interview Thursday. Contractual obligations with some of those clients limited defections even as rates rose, he said.

Bank of New York's net income rose to $926 million, or 88 cents a share, in the second quarter from $825 million, or 75 cents, a year earlier. Analysts had predicted per-share profit of 84 cents a share. 
Fees from investment services, the bank's core custody business, rose 4% to $1.86 billion. Money-management fees climbed 6% to $879 million. 
The results were the last for Gerald Hassell as BNY Mellon's chairman and chief executive. Mr. Hassell, who turns 66 this year, on Monday ceded his post to Charles Scharf, the former CEO of payments giant Visa Inc. Mr. Hassell has spent more than four decades at the bank. 
"Charlie is the right guy, and people are excited about Charlie," Mr. Gibbons said, adding, "They will miss Gerald. There's a touch of apprehension, but also excitement. A little new blood can be a good thing."

        LONDON, July 19, 2017 - Jamie Gleeson has been appointed as EMEA Head of Relationship Management for Alternative Investment Services (AIS) and Edwin Parker has joined as Director of Business Development for EMEA Private Equity, Real Estate and Debt at BNY Mellon, both based in London. The appointments are part of the ongoing strategy to build the AIS capability and follow a number of senior appointments in this area, including those of Chandresh Iyer as Global CEO of Alternative Investment Services and Structured Products, Jeff McCarthy as CEO of Exchange Traded Funds, Peter Salvage as Global Head of Hedge Fund Services and Scott Coey as Head of Business Development for Hedge Funds, ETF and Structured Products in EMEA.
      

        Jamie joins from State Street where he was Managing Director and EMEA Head of Relationship Management for the company's alternatives business and will be responsible for building deeper relationships with BNY's growing list of clients in the alternatives space. He reports to Jim Whitaker, Global Head of Relationship Management.
      

        Edwin, who was previously head of AIS sales for Northern Trust in EMEA, joins BNY Mellon's AIS Private Equity, Real Estate and Debt Business Development team led by Brian McMahon. As well as the strategic priority of developing its alternatives offering generally, BNY Mellon is investing significantly into building its presence in the Real Estate and Private Equity arenas where it perceives a strong market opportunity and a growth in investor demand.
      

        In April 2017, BNY Mellon Alternative Investment Services announced it will provide fund administration services for the U.S. real estate funds of PGIM Real Estate - the property arm of PGIM, the global investment management businesses of Prudential Financial - representing approximately $33 billion in net assets under management. This follows the announcement in 2015 where BNY Mellon signed an agreement with Deutsche Asset & Wealth Management to become its outsourced provider of direct real estate and infrastructure fund finance, fund accounting, asset management accounting, and client and financial reporting functions. These deals have made BNY Mellon one of the largest real estate fund administrators in the market.
      

        Jamie Gleeson said: 'BNY Mellon already has a very strong market position in the alternative investments arena and is well placed to continue to grow even further. The impact of new, disruptive technologies and a wave of incoming regulatory requirements presents challenges - but, crucially, also many opportunities for alternative investment managers - and a large part of my role will be working with our clients to help them navigate this new landscape.'
      

        Edwin Parker comments: 'In a low growth and low yield environment, institutional investors are increasingly looking at alternative asset classes for higher returns. It is exciting to join BNY Mellon at a time when it is positioning itself actively to be the strategic asset servicing partner of choice for investment firms in this space. We expect to see inflows not only into hedge funds and private equity as institutions seek uncorrelated returns but also into real estate as they search for yield with the added security of real assets. I look forward to working as part of the wider AIS team to develop our capabilities and our client base in this market.'

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
