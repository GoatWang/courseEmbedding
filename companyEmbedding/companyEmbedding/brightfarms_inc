Urban greenhouse grower BrightFarms Inc. of New York City is recalling an undisclosed volume of packaged salad greens and herbs because they may be contaminated with pieces of metal “as a result of construction.”
The recall covers only leafy greens and herbs grown at BrightFarms’ greenhouse farm in Elkwood, VA, according to the recall notice posted on the Food and Drug Administration’s website. Several grocery retailers in the Northeast and Washington D.C. and the Capital Area Food Bank may have received the recalled produce.

“BrightFarms chose to take this action out of an abundance of caution after discovering that certain produce may have been compromised. Affected retailers have been instructed to remove all affected products from store shelves,” according to the recall notice.
“Consumers who have purchased the affected products should discard (them) or return the product to its place of purchase for a full refund. Consumers with questions are encouraged to call 646-480-5262 between 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. EST Monday through Friday, or email info@brightfarms.com with the subject line: Recall.”
Founder and CEO Paul Lightfoot states on the BrightFarms website that the company’s goal is to provide local produce to urban markets.
“BrightFarms finances, designs, builds and operates greenhouse farms at or near supermarkets, cutting time, distance, and cost from the produce supply chain,” according to the company website.
