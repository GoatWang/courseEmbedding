Personal life[edit]
McGuire was born in Troy, New York, and grew up in League City, Texas.[1] He attended college at the University of Texas at Austin and medical school at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, Texas. After medical school, he worked in California and Colorado before moving to Minnesota.
UnitedHealth[edit]
McGuire joined UnitedHealthcare in November 1988 as an executive vice president when the Peak Health Plan, of which he was then president and chief operating officer, was acquired by United.[2] In May 1989, he was appointed to the board of directors and became chief operating officer of United. In November 1989, he became president of the company, a position he held until May 1991. He was named chief executive officer in February 1991, and chairman of the board of directors in May of the same year.
When McGuire joined United, it was an unprofitable regional health maintenance organization with annual revenues around $400 million.[3] When he left, United was one of the largest, most profitable, and most diversified healthcare companies in the world, with more than $70 billion in annual revenues, more than 50,000 employees, and more than sixty million health plan members.
In 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission began investigating the conduct of UnitedHealth's management and directors, including McGuire, as did the Internal Revenue Service and prosecutors in the United States Attorneys' office for the Southern District of New York.
The investigations came to light after a series of probing stories in the Wall Street Journal in May 2006, discussing the apparent "backdating" of stock options, in a then-common process called options backdating. Backdating involves manipulating the timing of options grants so they look as though they were made on days when the stock's value was lower. Doing that boosts recipients' windfall when they sell the stock. The backdating was approved by the board of directors, according to the Journal. Several shareholder classes filed lawsuits accusing former UnitedHealth's directors of failing in their fiduciary duty to properly notify shareholders of the scheme.[4][5]
On October 15, 2006, it was announced that McGuire would step down immediately as chairman and director of UnitedHealth. McGuire remained as chief executive officer through December 1, and was succeeded by Stephen Hemsley (then president and chief operating officer, and a member of the board of directors). From 1989 until 2006, McGuire received compensation from UnitedHealth in the form of stock options that eventually became worth around $1.6 billion.[6] However, in the course of the litigations that followed his departure from the company, McGuire was temporarily enjoined from exercising the options. The injunction was later released in late 2008.[7]
On December 6, 2007, the Securities and Exchange Commission announced a settlement, under which McGuire was to repay $468 million as a partial settlement of the backdating prosecution. McGuire was fined $7 million[8] and agreed to not serve as an officer or director of a public company for ten years.[9][10][11][12]

Philanthropy[edit]

In 2007, Dr. and Mrs. McGuire established the McGuire Scholar Program at the University of Minnesota, which provides scholarships to talented students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds.[14]
In 2004, Dr. and Mrs. McGuire made a $10 MM gift to the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota.[15]
In 2004, Dr. and Mrs. McGuire made a $7.5 MM gift to Amherst College in Amherst, Massachusetts. The college renamed its life sciences building in their honor.[16]
In 2003, Dr. and Mrs. McGuire made a $10 MM gift to the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, Minnesota.[17]
In December 2000, Dr. and Mrs. McGuire made a $4.2 MM gift to the University of Florida to construct and establish the McGuire Center for Lepidoptera Research and the McGuire Center for Insect Conservation.[18]

UnitedHealth[edit]
McGuire joined UnitedHealthcare in November 1988 as an executive vice president when the Peak Health Plan, of which he was then president and chief operating officer, was acquired by United.[2] In May 1989, he was appointed to the board of directors and became chief operating officer of United. In November 1989, he became president of the company, a position he held until May 1991. He was named chief executive officer in February 1991, and chairman of the board of directors in May of the same year.
When McGuire joined United, it was an unprofitable regional health maintenance organization with annual revenues around $400 million.[3] When he left, United was one of the largest, most profitable, and most diversified healthcare companies in the world, with more than $70 billion in annual revenues, more than 50,000 employees, and more than sixty million health plan members.
In 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission began investigating the conduct of UnitedHealth's management and directors, including McGuire, as did the Internal Revenue Service and prosecutors in the United States Attorneys' office for the Southern District of New York.
The investigations came to light after a series of probing stories in the Wall Street Journal in May 2006, discussing the apparent "backdating" of stock options, in a then-common process called options backdating. Backdating involves manipulating the timing of options grants so they look as though they were made on days when the stock's value was lower. Doing that boosts recipients' windfall when they sell the stock. The backdating was approved by the board of directors, according to the Journal. Several shareholder classes filed lawsuits accusing former UnitedHealth's directors of failing in their fiduciary duty to properly notify shareholders of the scheme.[4][5]
On October 15, 2006, it was announced that McGuire would step down immediately as chairman and director of UnitedHealth. McGuire remained as chief executive officer through December 1, and was succeeded by Stephen Hemsley (then president and chief operating officer, and a member of the board of directors). From 1989 until 2006, McGuire received compensation from UnitedHealth in the form of stock options that eventually became worth around $1.6 billion.[6] However, in the course of the litigations that followed his departure from the company, McGuire was temporarily enjoined from exercising the options. The injunction was later released in late 2008.[7]
On December 6, 2007, the Securities and Exchange Commission announced a settlement, under which McGuire was to repay $468 million as a partial settlement of the backdating prosecution. McGuire was fined $7 million[8] and agreed to not serve as an officer or director of a public company for ten years.[9][10][11][12]

Personal life[edit]
McGuire was born in Troy, New York, and grew up in League City, Texas.[1] He attended college at the University of Texas at Austin and medical school at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, Texas. After medical school, he worked in California and Colorado before moving to Minnesota.

McHale, Glenn J. Hansen, P. M. Pier, John P.

These forms include political advertisements on television and radio, debates, television talk show appearances, campaign web pages, and convention speeches by candidates and their spouses. The authors also look at the election outcomes and explore lessons to apply to future campaign discourse.  Bookseller Inventory # B9780742529144

Capital One® Secured Mastercard®


                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time. I've been really satisfied for the most part. They report quickly and accurately, remind me when my bill is due, and the customer service has been kind and thorough....show more

PenFed Credit Union


                                            Applied for a credit card and was denied based on what they said was a loss from a personal loan in 1978. I have never had an account with PenFed, so I questioned the accuracy of this denial. Considering, as a business owner, my scores are well north of 700, I thought this...show more

Amazon.com Store Card


                                            IF I COULD GIVE IT A ZERO I WOULD! Amazon/Synchrony Bank will cut your limit out of no where, even when making monthly payments. I've spent almost a year trying to pay off a card THEY maxed out and now they have sent to collections AS IM PAYING IT! DO NOT APPLY FOR THIS CARD!
