Notes
Moshers - submitted by George Mosher


While browsing your site I ran across 
		several Moshers without birth & death dates.  The data that I am sending 
		is from a book titled: "Descendants of Hugh Mosher & Rebecca Maxson 
		Through Seven Generations" by Chamberlain & Clarenbach.

		 

Ella Cora (Alpaugh) Mosher b: 3 May 1862; d: 
		8 Jul 1946

		 

Charles Mosher h/o of Ella b: 1 May 1860; d: 
		2 Mar 1941

		 

Chauncey Barney Mosher b: 5 Dec 1822

		 

Nellie Mosher b: 30 May 1885; d: 9 Nov 1931

		 

Betsey Mouser w/o Henry J is really 
		Elizabeth Burhans b: 9 Dec 1799; d: 28 Feb 1846

		 

Margaret d/o of Henry J & Betsey is really 
		Maryette b: 3 Jul 1824; d: 9 Nov 1852.  Don't know what the headstone 
		reads; Margaret or Maryette.
