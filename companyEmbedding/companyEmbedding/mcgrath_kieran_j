 CA Technologies Names Kieran J. McGrath Chief Financial Officer 











NEW YORK, November 7, 2016 - CA Technologies (NASDAQ:CA) today announced that Kieran J. McGrath has been appointed executive vice president and chief financial officer, effectively immediately.  McGrath, who most recently served as interim CFO, will report to Chief Executive Officer Mike Gregoire.
“I am delighted to announce Kieran McGrath as CFO of CA Technologies,” said Mr. Gregoire.  “Kieran has become an integral part of our management team, demonstrating both the strategic vision and the business acumen to capitalize on our opportunities and help shape the future of CA Technologies.   Kieran has led initiatives to improve processes, accelerate velocity, and drive scale at CA.  His effectiveness comes from his combined experience in driving new, higher growth software businesses while maintaining vibrancy in more mature product platforms, along with his collaborative and results-oriented spirit.
“We compete in a dynamic and competitive industry.  The changes made across the executive leadership team over the past 18 months reflect the evolution of our company.  As an organization, we will continue to be agile and make adjustments across the enterprise so that we can best serve our customers, our employees, and our shareholders.  Looking ahead, I am energized by our opportunities and by our heightened ability to achieve our potential in the years ahead.”
McGrath, 57, joined CA Technologies in 2014 as corporate controller and served in that role until being named interim-CFO in July 2016.  Prior to that, McGrath spent more than 30 years at IBM, where he honed his financial, operational and transformational management experience, ultimately overseeing the finance team for the company’s $25 billion global software business. During that time, IBM software became a growth business for IBM as they shifted into higher-value market segments including cloud computing, security and business analytics software.  McGrath received his bachelor of science in accounting from St. John’s University.

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
Certain statements in this communication (such as statements containing the words "believes," "plans," "anticipates," "expects," "estimates," "targets" and similar expressions relating to the future) constitute "forward-looking statements" that are based upon the beliefs of, and assumptions made by, the Company's management, as well as information currently available to management. These forward-looking statements reflect the Company's current views with respect to future events and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. A number of important factors could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements, including: the ability to achieve success in the Company’s business strategy by, among other things, ensuring that any new offerings address the needs of a rapidly changing market while not adversely affecting the demand for the Company’s traditional products or the Company’s profitability to an extent greater than anticipated, enabling the Company’s sales force to accelerate growth of sales to new customers and expand sales with existing customers, including sales outside of the Company’s renewal cycle and to a broadening set of purchasers outside of traditional information technology operations (with such growth and expansion at levels sufficient to offset any decline in revenue and/or sales in the Company’s Mainframe Solutions segment and in certain mature product lines in the Company’s Enterprise Solutions segment), effectively managing the strategic shift in the Company’s business model to develop more easily installed software, provide additional SaaS offerings and refocus the Company’s professional services and education engagements on those engagements that are connected to new product sales, without affecting the Company’s financial performance to an extent greater than anticipated, and effectively managing the Company’s pricing and other go-to-market strategies, as well as improving the Company’s brand, technology and innovation awareness in the marketplace; the failure to innovate or adapt to technological changes and introduce new software products and services in a timely manner; competition in product and service offerings and pricing; the ability of the Company’s products to remain compatible with ever-changing operating environments, platforms or third party products; global economic factors or political events beyond the Company’s control and other business and legal risks associated with non-U.S. operations; the failure to expand partner programs and sales of the Company’s solutions by the Company’s partners; the ability to retain and attract qualified professionals; general economic conditions and credit constraints, or unfavorable economic conditions in a particular region, business or industry sector; the ability to successfully integrate acquired companies and products into the Company’s existing business; risks associated with sales to government customers; breaches of the Company’s data center, network, as well as the Company’s software products, and the IT environments of the Company’s vendors and customers; the ability to adequately manage, evolve and protect the Company’s information systems, infrastructure and processes; the failure to renew license transactions on a satisfactory basis; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; discovery of errors or omissions in the Company’s software products or documentation and potential product liability claims; the failure to protect the Company’s intellectual property rights and source code; access to software licensed from third parties; risks associated with the use of software from open source code sources; third-party claims of intellectual property infringement or royalty payments; fluctuations in the number, terms and duration of the Company’s license agreements, as well as the timing of orders from customers and channel partners; events or circumstances that would require the Company to record an impairment charge relating to the Company’s goodwill or capitalized software and other intangible assets balances; potential tax liabilities; changes in market conditions or the Company’s credit ratings; changes in generally accepted accounting principles; the failure to effectively execute the Company’s workforce reductions, workforce rebalancing and facilities consolidations; successful and secure outsourcing of various functions to third parties; and other factors described more fully in the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties occur, or should the Company’s assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from the forward-looking information described herein as believed, planned, anticipated, expected, estimated, targeted or similarly identified. We do not intend to update these forward-looking statements, except as otherwise required by law. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof.

McGrath, 57, joined CA Technologies in 2014 as corporate controller and 
      served in that role until being named interim-CFO in July 2016. Prior to 
      that, McGrath spent more than 30 years at IBM, where he honed his 
      financial, operational and transformational management experience, 
      ultimately overseeing the finance team for the company’s $25 billion 
      global software business. During that time, IBM software became a growth 
      business for IBM as they shifted into higher-value market segments 
      including cloud computing, security and business analytics software. 
      McGrath received his bachelor of science in accounting from St. John’s 
      University.

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements









Certain statements in this communication (such as statements containing 
      the words "believes," "plans," "anticipates," "expects," "estimates," 
      "targets" and similar expressions relating to the future) constitute 
      "forward-looking statements" that are based upon the beliefs of, and 
      assumptions made by, the Company's management, as well as information 
      currently available to management. These forward-looking statements 
      reflect the Company's current views with respect to future events and 
      are subject to certain risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. A number 
      of important factors could cause actual results or events to differ 
      materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements, 
      including: the ability to achieve success in the Company’s business 
      strategy by, among other things, ensuring that any new offerings address 
      the needs of a rapidly changing market while not adversely affecting the 
      demand for the Company’s traditional products or the Company’s 
      profitability to an extent greater than anticipated, enabling the 
      Company’s sales force to accelerate growth of sales to new customers and 
      expand sales with existing customers, including sales outside of the 
      Company’s renewal cycle and to a broadening set of purchasers outside of 
      traditional information technology operations (with such growth and 
      expansion at levels sufficient to offset any decline in revenue and/or 
      sales in the Company’s Mainframe Solutions segment and in certain mature 
      product lines in the Company’s Enterprise Solutions segment), 
      effectively managing the strategic shift in the Company’s business model 
      to develop more easily installed software, provide additional SaaS 
      offerings and refocus the Company’s professional services and education 
      engagements on those engagements that are connected to new product 
      sales, without affecting the Company’s financial performance to an 
      extent greater than anticipated, and effectively managing the Company’s 
      pricing and other go-to-market strategies, as well as improving the 
      Company’s brand, technology and innovation awareness in the marketplace; 
      the failure to innovate or adapt to technological changes and introduce 
      new software products and services in a timely manner; competition in 
      product and service offerings and pricing; the ability of the Company’s 
      products to remain compatible with ever-changing operating environments, 
      platforms or third party products; global economic factors or political 
      events beyond the Company’s control and other business and legal risks 
      associated with non-U.S. operations; the failure to expand partner 
      programs and sales of the Company’s solutions by the Company’s partners; 
      the ability to retain and attract qualified professionals; general 
      economic conditions and credit constraints, or unfavorable economic 
      conditions in a particular region, business or industry sector; the 
      ability to successfully integrate acquired companies and products into 
      the Company’s existing business; risks associated with sales to 
      government customers; breaches of the Company’s data center, network, as 
      well as the Company’s software products, and the IT environments of the 
      Company’s vendors and customers; the ability to adequately manage, 
      evolve and protect the Company’s information systems, infrastructure and 
      processes; the failure to renew license transactions on a satisfactory 
      basis; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; discovery of errors or 
      omissions in the Company’s software products or documentation and 
      potential product liability claims; the failure to protect the Company’s 
      intellectual property rights and source code; access to software 
      licensed from third parties; risks associated with the use of software 
      from open source code sources; third-party claims of intellectual 
      property infringement or royalty payments; fluctuations in the number, 
      terms and duration of the Company’s license agreements, as well as the 
      timing of orders from customers and channel partners; events or 
      circumstances that would require the Company to record an impairment 
      charge relating to the Company’s goodwill or capitalized software and 
      other intangible assets balances; potential tax liabilities; changes in 
      market conditions or the Company’s credit ratings; changes in generally 
      accepted accounting principles; the failure to effectively execute the 
      Company’s workforce reductions, workforce rebalancing and facilities 
      consolidations; successful and secure outsourcing of various functions 
      to third parties; and other factors described more fully in the 
      Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Should 
      one or more of these risks or uncertainties occur, or should the 
      Company’s assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary 
      materially from the forward-looking information described herein as 
      believed, planned, anticipated, expected, estimated, targeted or 
      similarly identified. We do not intend to update these forward-looking 
      statements, except as otherwise required by law. Readers are cautioned 
      not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which 
      speak only as of the date hereof.

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--CA Technologies (NASDAQ:CA) today announced that Kieran J. McGrath has 
      been appointed executive vice president and chief financial officer,

      CFO, will report to Chief Executive Officer Mike Gregoire.
    


      “I am delighted to announce Kieran McGrath as CFO of CA Technologies,” 
      said Mr. Gregoire. “Kieran has become an integral part of our management 
      team, demonstrating both the strategic vision and the business acumen to 
      capitalize on our opportunities and help shape the future of CA 
      Technologies. Kieran has led initiatives to improve processes, 
      accelerate velocity, and drive scale at CA. His effectiveness comes from 
      his combined experience in driving new, higher growth software 
      businesses while maintaining vibrancy in more mature product platforms, 
      along with his collaborative and results-oriented spirit.
    

      “We compete in a dynamic and competitive industry. The changes made 
      across the executive leadership team over the past 18 months reflect the 
      evolution of our company. As an organization, we will continue to be 
      agile and make adjustments across the enterprise so that we can best

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements


      Certain statements in this communication (such as statements containing 
      the words "believes," "plans," "anticipates," "expects," "estimates," 
      "targets" and similar expressions relating to the future) constitute 
      "forward-looking statements" that are based upon the beliefs of, and 
      assumptions made by, the Company's management, as well as information 
      currently available to management. These forward-looking statements 
      reflect the Company's current views with respect to future events and 
      are subject to certain risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. A number 
      of important factors could cause actual results or events to differ 
      materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements, 
      including: the ability to achieve success in the Company’s business 
      strategy by, among other things, ensuring that any new offerings address 
      the needs of a rapidly changing market while not adversely affecting the 
      demand for the Company’s traditional products or the Company’s 
      profitability to an extent greater than anticipated, enabling the 
      Company’s sales force to accelerate growth of sales to new customers and 
      expand sales with existing customers, including sales outside of the 
      Company’s renewal cycle and to a broadening set of purchasers outside of 
      traditional information technology operations (with such growth and 
      expansion at levels sufficient to offset any decline in revenue and/or 
      sales in the Company’s Mainframe Solutions segment and in certain mature 
      product lines in the Company’s Enterprise Solutions segment), 
      effectively managing the strategic shift in the Company’s business model 
      to develop more easily installed software, provide additional SaaS 
      offerings and refocus the Company’s professional services and education 
      engagements on those engagements that are connected to new product 
      sales, without affecting the Company’s financial performance to an 
      extent greater than anticipated, and effectively managing the Company’s 
      pricing and other go-to-market strategies, as well as improving the 
      Company’s brand, technology and innovation awareness in the marketplace; 
      the failure to innovate or adapt to technological changes and introduce 
      new software products and services in a timely manner; competition in 
      product and service offerings and pricing; the ability of the Company’s 
      products to remain compatible with ever-changing operating environments, 
      platforms or third party products; global economic factors or political 
      events beyond the Company’s control and other business and legal risks 
      associated with non-U.S. operations; the failure to expand partner 
      programs and sales of the Company’s solutions by the Company’s partners; 
      the ability to retain and attract qualified professionals; general 
      economic conditions and credit constraints, or unfavorable economic 
      conditions in a particular region, business or industry sector; the 
      ability to successfully integrate acquired companies and products into 
      the Company’s existing business; risks associated with sales to 
      government customers; breaches of the Company’s data center, network, as 
      well as the Company’s software products, and the IT environments of the 
      Company’s vendors and customers; the ability to adequately manage, 
      evolve and protect the Company’s information systems, infrastructure and 
      processes; the failure to renew license transactions on a satisfactory 
      basis; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; discovery of errors or 
      omissions in the Company’s software products or documentation and 
      potential product liability claims; the failure to protect the Company’s 
      intellectual property rights and source code; access to software 
      licensed from third parties; risks associated with the use of software 
      from open source code sources; third-party claims of intellectual 
      property infringement or royalty payments; fluctuations in the number, 
      terms and duration of the Company’s license agreements, as well as the 
      timing of orders from customers and channel partners; events or 
      circumstances that would require the Company to record an impairment 
      charge relating to the Company’s goodwill or capitalized software and 
      other intangible assets balances; potential tax liabilities; changes in 
      market conditions or the Company’s credit ratings; changes in generally 
      accepted accounting principles; the failure to effectively execute the 
      Company’s workforce reductions, workforce rebalancing and facilities 
      consolidations; successful and secure outsourcing of various functions 
      to third parties; and other factors described more fully in the 
      Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Should 
      one or more of these risks or uncertainties occur, or should the 
      Company’s assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary 
      materially from the forward-looking information described herein as 
      believed, planned, anticipated, expected, estimated, targeted or 
      similarly identified. We do not intend to update these forward-looking 
      statements, except as otherwise required by law. Readers are cautioned
