Testimonials




I contacted them for a free consultation. Samantha scheduled to meet with me the following week. I cannot express how happy I am I went to this meeting. The woman working in the front desk was friendly and energetic, and I felt very welcomed....




I personally want to tell you Thank You! I was a complete reck and on my last leg. I was so scared when I came to you, just about my life and learning how to live being divorced. But, after meeting you and you assisting me I learned how to smile again and I'm now living again....




This is the first time in years I've written a review for any reason. These are the most competent people ever. I was lucky enough to work with me on a custody case. I cannot put into words just how much I appreciate everything she's done....




Samantha and everyone on her team was amazing during our entire process. I couldn't have asked for anyone better. Very professional, yet down to earth, I will definitely recommend this office to all of my friends and family!....




I recommend The Smith Law Offices. She worked with me being on Social Security and kept her retainer low and has let me pay her off in 2 installments instead of demanding all the money before filing papers. The Friend of the Court is no longer double dipping me....
