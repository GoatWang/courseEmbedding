– USA, NY – CIFC Corp. (NASDAQ:  CIFC) today announced the appointment of Jeffrey S. Serota to its Board of Directors.
Mr. Serota is a senior executive with significant principal investing and management experience. Currently, he serves on the Boards of Directors of SandRidge Energy and Exco Resources and has served on the boards of over a dozen other public and private companies. Mr. Serota was a Senior Partner at, and Senior Advisor to, Ares Management, LLC until his retirement earlier in the year. He holds an MBA in finance from the Anderson Graduate School of Management at UCLA and a BS in economics from The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.
Commenting on the appointment, Bob Machinist, CIFC’s Chairman stated, “We are delighted to have Mr. Serota join our Board of Directors. He brings years of relevant business and management experience to our Board and we welcome being able to work with him at CIFC.”
Concurrent with the appointment, Frank C. Puleo resigned from the Board. Commenting on his tenure as a Director, Mr. Puleo stated, “It has been a pleasure to be involved with CIFC and its original CEO, Peter Gleysteen, since its inception as a startup through its growth, with the support of Charlesbank Capital Partners and more recently Columbus Nova, into one of the largest CLO managers. While I am a big believer in the company’s prospects, my other business activities require increasing time commitments. I wish the current team continued success not only as a CLO manager but in its continuing development of a diverse array of credit asset management products.”
