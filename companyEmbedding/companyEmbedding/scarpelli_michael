OverviewFree PreviewAbout The AuthorCustomer ReviewEditorial Review






Carmine Angelo Scarpelli, a tormented widower and devoted father and grandfather, was the respected head of a New York crime family, which he ran from his backroom office in the Bronx pizzeria and from his vacation home in Lower Saranac Lake, New York. With the blessing of the Columbian drug lord, Santiago Garcia, Scarpelli’s largest criminal enterprise was moving pure cocaine from Colombia, South America, to New York then further on to Boston forcing the blackmailed chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Congressman Jonathan Burnham to front the distribution point: the Brooklyn wholesale fruit warehouse. Scarpelli didn’t stop there. He knew enough about the congressman’s son, Johnny Burnham, a DEA Special Agent in the Manhattan Division DEA interdiction team, headed by Special Agent in Charge, Jack Finch, to turn Johnny into an informant for the Scarpelli family’s local drug operations. But like Finch, Scarpelli also had a problem: a DEA informant within his own family. How both men were to solve both problems so that Finch’s career would be saved; and Scarpelli’s operations would continue to succeed, that was the question.
