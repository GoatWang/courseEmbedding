The entrepreneur journey is one of the most rewarding experiences in life. However, anyone who tells you that following your passion and working four hours a week is all it takes, is selling something. Your business can be profitable and rewarding, but it can also take everything from you if you don’t have a good grasp of boundaries, systems and focus.Related: 3 Aspects of Work-Life Balance You Won't Find in Company PresentationsKnowing what to focus on will make you a decent income. But if you want to reach the next level of finances and work-life balance, you need to know what things to ignore. If you focus on the wrong things, you will waste time, sleep, focus and creative energy that could be used on building a team and a successful business. Raise your company to the next level, and avoid focusing on these four things that are outside of your control.1. Mistakes you have made.We are all human and make mistakes daily, yet when we screw up, we often beat ourselves up for days. We should learn from our mistakes, but many entrepreneurs obsess over them. You cannot redo the past. Learn from it. If you need to apologize, do it and move on. If you are focusing on your mistakes, you aren’t dedicating the mental energy to your business.2. Economic conditions.Many of my fellow entrepreneur friends obsess over the economic environment, of which they have no control over. Policy and market forces do impact your business, and they should be paid attention to at the point of which you can pivot your company. Beyond your change in action, focusing on economic conditions produces fear and inaction -- and that's the last thing a business should do. Stop obsessing over the news, and make something happen for your company.Related: To Become a Fearless Entrepreneur Learn These 6 Truths3. Your competitors.Know your competitors well enough to know how you are different. Beyond that, you are comparing, and no one wins the game of comparison. Major businesses saw what their competitors were doing and flew in the face of conventional wisdom. Instead of focusing on themselves, they focused on being the best version of what they wanted to create, not a second rate version of their competitors. Focus on your business, not someone else’s company.4. The future.When we have one eye on the future and one eye on today, we waste today. It is impossible to be the best version of yourself when you aren’t fully present today. It is easy to worry about what the next day holds or the next business. Unfortunately when we do this, we rob this moment and this business. There are so many opportunities today to make what you are doing better, stronger and more efficient.Related: You're More Likely to Succeed If You Enjoy the ProcessAs you stop focusing on these things outside of your control, you will see your business take off to the next level. Obsess over what is within your control, and relinquish those things that are not contributing to your success. You may not see progress today, but eventually, controlling what you can and leaving alone what you cannot will lead your company to bigger profits and more freedom.

Starting a Business
















			LLC Basics
		

				This hybrid entity brings together some of the best features of partnerships and corporations, and is a great choice for entrepreneurs who want to move beyond the sole proprietorship.
			





---Shares










					June 1, 2005
				

Probably the single greatest disadvantage of the corporate form is the burdensome range of formalities that corporate managers must observe. A modern corporation's heavy administrative burden is a remnant of the more traditional and formal legal system under which corporate law was cultivated. The LLC changed all that.
Limited liability companies (LLCs) have been around since 1977, but their popularity among small-business owners is a relatively recent phenomenon. The LLC offers the liability protection benefits of the corporation without the corporation's burdensome formalities. This simplicity has made the LLC an instantly popular business form for smaller companies.
LLCs are the favorite choice for small businesses with one to three owners working who don't plan to grow the business significantly and don't expect to raise significant amounts of cash. But as the number of owners grows, the corporation often becomes a more attractive choice as a business form.
An LLC is a hybrid entity, bringing together some of the best features of partnerships and corporations. LLCs were created to provide business owners with the liability protection that corporations enjoy without the double taxation. Earnings and losses pass through to the owners and are included on their personal tax returns.
Sound similar to an S corporation? It is, except an LLC offers small-business owners even more attractions than an S corporation. For example, there is no limitation on the number of shareholders an LLC can have, unlike an S corporation, which has a limit of 75. In addition, any member or owner of the LLC is allowed a full participatory role in the business's operation; in a limited partnership, on the other hand, partners are not permitted any say in the operation.
Unlike corporations (and like partnerships), LLCs do not have perpetual life. Some state statutes stipulate that the company must dissolve after 30 or 40 years. Technically, the company dissolves when a member dies, quits or retires.

	More Pros and Cons
Here are more advantages of the LLC form of business organization:

An LLC allows for an unlimited number of members; however, if the LLC has just one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietorship.


The LLC allows for the "special allocation" of profits--the disproportionate splitting of member profits and losses (in different percentages than their respective percentages of ownership). This means that members can enjoy the benefits of receiving profits (and writing off losses) in excess of their individual ownership percentage.


The members enjoy limited liability, which means they are personally protected from any liability of the LLC and successful judgments, as well as from the LLC itself.


Managing members' share of bottom-line profit is considered earned income because the managing member is considered to be an active owner--therefore qualifying the managing member for special "fringe benefit" treatment.


The members' share of the bottom-line profit of an LLC is not considered earned income, and therefore is not subject to self-employment tax.


Members are compensated using either distributions of profit or guaranteed payments. A distribution of profit allows each member to pay themselves by merely writing checks--whenever they need the money (provided the business has the available cash). Guaranteed payments represent earned income to the members, thereby qualifying them to enjoy the benefits of tax-favored fringe benefits.


The managing member of an LLC can deduct 100 percent of the health insurance premiums he or she pays--up to the extent of their pro-rata share of the LLC's net profit, because the profit is considered earned income. Note: If a member has earned income, he or she will also qualify.


A corporation can be a member of an LLC. This allows you to create an additional level of ownership, which is designed to create an entity that can offer such traditional fringe benefits as retirement plans and an additional level of protection from liability.


As a member, you can contribute capital or other assets to the LLC, or loan the LLC money to put dollars or value into the business. You can take dollars out by taking a repayment of your loan (plus interest), a distribution of profit or a guaranteed payment. If any of the members die, the LLC can continue to exist--subject to the unanimous positive vote on the part of all remaining members.

Some of the disadvantages of an LLC include:

Each member's pro-rata share of profits represents taxable income--whether or not a member's share of profits is distributed to him or her.


The managing member's share of the bottom-line profit of the LLC is considered earned income, and therefore is subject to self-employment tax.


The members' share of bottom-line profit is not considered earned income because the members are considered to be inactive owners; therefore, the members do not qualify for special tax-favored "fringe benefit" treatment.


As a member of an LLC, you are not allowed to pay yourself wages.


Some states do not allow the organization of LLCs for certain professional vocations.
For companies that wish to pursue venture capital, accumulate a large number of shareholders, and/or eventually pursue an initial public offering, the LLC is not an appropriate alternative to a corporation.

Setting It Up
To set up an LLC, you must file articles of organization with the secretary of state in the state where you intend to do business. Some states also require you to file an operating agreement, which is similar to a partnership agreement.
Before deciding upon an LLC, remember to check with your lawyer or accountant about the advantages of the LLC in your particular state. Ask up front what it would cost to form a corporation versus the cost of forming an LLC. You may be surprised to learn that in some states an LLC could be established by filing a simple, one-page document, which lays out the Articles of Organization of your LLC, with the secretary of state.
You can form an LLC for any lawful business as long as the nature of the business is not banking, insurance, and certain professional service operations, such as doctor, lawyers or accountants. By simply filing articles of organization with the respective state agency, an LLC takes on a separate identity. Similar to a corporation, but without the tax problems of the corporation, it will be taxed like a partnership.
Also, you'll need two people (members) to meet the state requirement in many states and to meet the basic federal tax law requirements to obtain the flow-through tax provisions that are one of the advantages of an LLC.
The cost of setting up an LLC is roughly equivalent to setting up a corporation. The secretary of state's fees for filing articles of organization and for filing annual reports are often the same for both LLCs and corporations. Entrepreneurs who wish to seek help in organizing an LLC through an LLC formation service or through an attorney will find the fees to be roughly the same.
Even after you settle on a business structure, remember that the circumstances that make one type of business organization favorable are always subject to changes in the laws. It makes sense to reassess your form of business from time to time to make sure you are using the one that provides the most benefits.

	Outgrowing Your Business Structure
What should the owners of an LLC do if their company grows in size such that an LLC is no longer the appropriate business form? The answer is simple: it is possible to convert an LLC into a corporation. Thus, some small companies begin life as LLCs, outgrow the LLC form, and then the LLC's owners transfer the assets of the LLC to a newly formed corporation with the same owners as the LLC.
As one might imagine, it is also possible to convert a corporation into an LLC, or nearly any business form into any other. It is also possible to reorganize a business in another state by transferring the assets of a business into a newly chartered entity. Converting business forms does require some sophisticated legal and tax analysis and should not be attempted without the services of a qualified attorney and accountant.
This article was excerpted from the books Start Your Own Business and Entrepreneur Magazine's Ultimate Book on Forming Corporations, LLC's, Sole Proprietorships and Partnerships, and the article "Pros and Cons of the LLC Model" by David Meier.

As the home-sharing movement grows in popularity, so does the reality that homeowners renting out their properties are essentially small business owners. And as with any small business, there are numerous legal and financial issues that that must be taken into consideration. Not the least of these involves risk and liability protection. Unfortunately, many using their homes as small businesses are in the dark when it comes to understanding their risk.According to a recent survey by global risk solutions provider Assurant, nearly two-thirds of homeowners are not certain whether their homeowners’ insurance policy covers vacation renters. Additionally, 55 percent said they have no idea who is responsible or liable if something goes wrong.Related: What You'll Really Earn on Uber, Airbnb and TaskRabbit Every MonthWhile the survey found that most people claim not to break rules when home sharing -- and that when they do it’s generally on the order of exceeding the maximum number of guests or staying past check out time -- there are always exceptions that can result in significant damage. Whether it is kids swinging from a dining room chandelier or indoor water balloon fights, owners need to be prepared for the worst.Depending on the policy, this can simply mean checking with the insurer to determine if the policy allows brief stays or securing an endorsement or rider to an existing homeowner’s policy to cover losses from having a limited number of short-term rentals. By contacting the insurer, the policyholder will determine coverage limits, although that conversation could result in higher premiums or a policy being canceled. With that in mind, if a budding home-sharing business takes off and owners begin hosting guests on a regular basis, an insurance policy upgrade will probably be required.Major MisconceptionsThe biggest misunderstanding when it comes to home-sharing protection is the need for commercial use exclusion clauses and $1 million policies marketed by home-sharing companies.Related: 10 Weird and Wonderful Airbnb Listings, Including a New York Taxi and an IglooMost insurance companies view renting out a home on a regular basis as commercial usage and deny claims based on a commercial use exclusion clause in the homeowners’ policy. That means the owner is on the hook if someone gets injured. To make things even more complicated, different insurance companies approach commercial use exclusions in different ways. For example, some policies may indicate that “occasional home-sharing” is allowed without really defining what that means. Unfortunately, the homeowner doesn’t find out the true definition until something bad happens and they’re not covered.Just as important is understanding the protection options that various home-sharing companies are offering. While $1 million certainly is appealing, and the general sense is that it should be more than enough to cover anything major, that’s not always the case. The reality is that many of these offerings are not real insurance, and often include long lists of terms, conditions, and exclusions. Bottom line: read the fine print.Policy CustomizationThe one-size-fits-all approach generally does not work when it comes to commercial usage insurance for home-sharing.Related: 11 Ways to Make Money While You SleepFor most owners renting their homes, the key to having the right protection is to identify home-sharing companies that can customize products that best fit individual needs. For example:If an owner is only renting out a home seven nights a month, then only seven nights of coverage is needed.Coverage for condominium residents should look different than it does for someone living in a single family homeFor those using home-sharing to build a small business with meaningful revenue generation, having a policy that will reimburse lost future revenue due to guest damage is imperative.Regardless of the particulars, working with a home-sharing company that has both damage and liability is critical to mitigating financial ruin in the event a guest is injured and pursues litigation.As home-sharing increasingly becomes a small business opportunity, homeowners must make sure they understand the risks and rewards, and that they are protected. The key is to work with the home-sharing companies that are taking the lead in educating homeowners about risks and offering protection options that ensure the rewards of home-sharing outweigh the risks.

Healthy gummi bears? Inside one young entrepreneur's delicious business

                Gummi bears are finally getting a makeover after nearly 100 years. A 22-year-old Canadian entrepreneur has taken the popular 1920s confectionery candy and turned it into a healthier treat without any processed sugar. 
                
            




The 22-year-old Canadian entrepreneur behind a new "healthy" gummi bear says she got the idea from her grandmother.

“We use no sugar or sugar alcohols or artificial sweeteners so it’s just plant-based, non-GMO stevia. Also, we don’t use any artificial ingredients like colors or flavors,” Tara Bosch, founder and CEO of SmartSweets, tells FOX Business.
The treats have 24 grams of fiber, Bosch says, and only 2 grams of sugar and 9 grams of net carbs per bag, whereas traditional gummi bears contain between 21 and 22 grams of sugar in about 17 to 18 pieces.

Bosch founded SmartSweets in Vancouver last year after dropping out of college to pursue her mission of kicking sugar in popular, every day sweets. She says she came up with the idea after her grandmother told her that she regretted eating so much sugar over the years because of her sweet tooth.
“It impacted her health and how she felt about herself. And that really sparked my exploration in looking for natural confectionery products that addressed sugar. From then on, I wanted to innovate candy that tasted like candy because if people are going to make a healthier choice, my belief is that it should taste like the real thing,” she says. 
And in less than a year’s time, she says her company has already generated over $1 million in sales.

“Some of the large players in the confectionery space have already reached out to us. I think they are finally seeing consumers’ awareness about sugar,” Bosch adds.
The company is also working to raise a $2 million seed round, which she says would be used to expand to the United States by fall of this year.

“We already have $470,000 in financing to date with investors like the vice president of Lululemon (LULU) as well as the chairman of Daiya Foods and a few other folks that we are talking to about this seed round but are not finalized yet,” Bosch says.
SmartSweets are already sold at Whole Foods (WFM) and Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) throughout Canada.

Entrepreneur is a North American magazine and website that carries news stories about entrepreneurship, small business management, and business.

It is published under license internationally in Mexico, Russia, India, Hungary, the Philippines, South Africa, and others.[5] Its editor-in-chief is Jason Feifer and its owner is Peter Shea.[6]

History[edit]
Every year since 1979, Entrepreneur has published a list of its top 500 franchise companies based on a submission and review process.[7] The magazine also published many other lists and awards.
In 1987, the magazine launched its website, Entrepreneur.com, which expanded to include features, contests and other publications and spin-offs.[8] As of 2013, the website received more than 6 million unique visitors each month.[9]
Spin-offs[edit]
Entrepreneur publishes the Entrepreneur StartUps magazine, available through subscription and on newsstands.[10]
The magazine publishes a blog managed by a dedicated online staff.[11] It is also published in digital editions through its mobile apps.[12]
In 1999, the website YoungEntrepreneur.com was created as a spin-off of Entrepreneur.com. It is an online forum for young entrepreneurs.[13]
In 2010, Entrepreneur launched the website SecondAct.com, which is targeted towards an older audience. When launched, the site used advertising as its sole source of revenue.[14]
Entrepreneur also publishes books through its Entrepreneur Press division. The company has a backlist of over 200 titles on business and entrepreneurship.[15]
Controversies[edit]
In 2006, unusual web traffic measurements led to allegations that Entrepreneur.com used pop-ups to artificially boost its number of readers.[16]
The company has been involved in many lawsuits regarding its trademark on the word 'entrepreneur', suing a wide variety of entities for using the word.[17] The trademark has generally attracted criticism for being on a commonly used word for which there is no substitute, and the aggressiveness with which it is applied has been noted as somewhat ironic; Business Week asked "why would the publisher of Entrepreneur magazine be bullying entrepreneurs?"[18]

As a budding entrepreneur, you may face the issue of whether to start out as a sole proprietorship or a limited liability company (LLC). There are key advantages and disadvantages to each form of business and the nature of your enterprise and other business and personal circumstances may impact your choice. Here are some important factors to consider when assessing the main pros and cons of a sole proprietorship versus an LLC. 

Ease and Costs of Formation. In the United States, a sole proprietorship is the most popular business entity because it is the easiest to form. Compared to an LLC, a sole proprietorship is less complex and less expensive and demands less paperwork to start. You only need to begin transacting business and make sure you have any required licenses and permits and you have started your new enterprise. To establish an LLC, you must form and register your LLC entity with the applicable state agency, often the secretary of state’s office. You must draft and file articles of organization and pay a filing fee which can be hundreds of dollars in some states. Your LLC filing typically spells out your LLC’s name, principal office’s location, your owners’ or members’ names, the expected term of your LLC, and any other state-mandated information. If there are two or more owners of your LLC, you may want to seek the assistance of a legal professional to draft an operating agreement which spells out such details as each member’s duties, capital contributions, and rights to profits. Setting up an LLC requires more upfront time, money, and effort than a sole proprietorship so you’ll have to factor that in when deciding which entity is best for you.
Raising Capital for Your Start-Up. Every business needs capital in order to start and maintain its operations. With a sole proprietorship, you will need to fund your own business using your personal resources or by seeking out loans. Establishing a line of credit or receiving loan approval from a bank or other lending institution may be a daunting challenge for a new entrepreneur. Often, you will be required to provide a personal guaranty for any loan to your business. However, if your LLC has other members, you and your fellow owners can pool together your resources and reach out to a broader network of potential business contacts. Bringing in additional members may also help to fund your new LLC. Reviewing your financial resources, credit history, and business investment potential will help determine if you can afford to go it alone as a sole proprietor or if you will need the additional resources that other owners can provide.
Taxation of Your Business.  For federal tax purposes, a sole proprietor’s income is taxed on an individual income tax return. Similarly, LLCs receive “pass through” treatment allowing allocated profits to be taxed on each member’s individual income tax return. If your LLC qualifies as a partnership or S corporation, it may also receive “pass through” treatment. Since federal income tax treatment is similar, this factor may not play a major role in choosing between a sole proprietorship and LLC. Consult a tax professional to determine if state or local taxes will impact your start-up’s tax situation.
Your Role in Daily Business Management. If you like being your own boss, then a sole proprietorship or a single member LLC may be right up your alley. Under either of these approaches, you have the opportunity to go solo in managing, marketing, financing, and determining the policies and direction of your business. You won’t have to consult with or receive prior approval from other owners on your business decisions. However, if you have fellow LLC owners you will need to delineate your roles and expectations in running your LLC under an operating agreement. If you are not an experienced business person, you might find it helpful to collaborate with other owners on business decisions. It may be useful to have other LLC members so you may learn from their professional experiences, share management and marketing duties, and draw additional funding from your fellow LLC owners. Determine if you prefer to operate your business solo or manage it with other owners.
Risks of Personal Liability. Under the sole proprietorship, you and your business are viewed as one in the same. Therefore, you have unlimited personal liability for all of the debts and legal liabilities of your sole proprietorship. Your personal assets, such as your home or personal bank account, could be at risk to satisfy unpaid debts, legal judgments, and other legal obligations of your start-up. On the other hand, an LLC is a separate legal entity and an LLC member is normally not personally liable for the LLC’s debts or legal liabilities. As an LLC owner, you are mainly putting your financial contribution to your LLC, not your other personal assets, on the line. However, as an LLC owner, you may still be personally liable for your own conduct or LLC loans in some cases. For example, you may still be responsible if you personally guaranteed repayment of an LLC loan or if your own acts cause harm to a third party or to your LLC. Like any business person, it is important to consider appropriate liability and other forms of insurance to help protect your personal assets and your business. Overall, the sole proprietorship tends to expose a business owner to greater risks of personal liability. Assessing your comfort level with personal liability risks should be an important aspect of your decision-making process.

History[edit]
Every year since 1979, Entrepreneur has published a list of its top 500 franchise companies based on a submission and review process.[7] The magazine also published many other lists and awards.
In 1987, the magazine launched its website, Entrepreneur.com, which expanded to include features, contests and other publications and spin-offs.[8] As of 2013, the website received more than 6 million unique visitors each month.[9]
Spin-offs[edit]
Entrepreneur publishes the Entrepreneur StartUps magazine, available through subscription and on newsstands.[10]
The magazine publishes a blog managed by a dedicated online staff.[11] It is also published in digital editions through its mobile apps.[12]
In 1999, the website YoungEntrepreneur.com was created as a spin-off of Entrepreneur.com. It is an online forum for young entrepreneurs.[13]
In 2010, Entrepreneur launched the website SecondAct.com, which is targeted towards an older audience. When launched, the site used advertising as its sole source of revenue.[14]
Entrepreneur also publishes books through its Entrepreneur Press division. The company has a backlist of over 200 titles on business and entrepreneurship.[15]
Controversies[edit]
In 2006, unusual web traffic measurements led to allegations that Entrepreneur.com used pop-ups to artificially boost its number of readers.[16]
The company has been involved in many lawsuits regarding its trademark on the word 'entrepreneur', suing a wide variety of entities for using the word.[17] The trademark has generally attracted criticism for being on a commonly used word for which there is no substitute, and the aggressiveness with which it is applied has been noted as somewhat ironic; Business Week asked "why would the publisher of Entrepreneur magazine be bullying entrepreneurs?"[18]

     The Birth of the "Blues" 


In the 1930s and 1940s, a competitive market for health insurance developed in many places in the United States. Typically, premiums tended to reflect risks, and insurers aggressively monitored claims to keep costs down and prevent abuses. Following World War II, however, the market changed radically. Hospitals had created Blue Cross in 1939, and doctors started Blue Shield at about the same time. Under pressure from hospital and physician organizations, the"Blues" won competitive advantages from state governments and special discounts from medical providers....

| Entrepreneurship








An entrepreneur is someone who organizes, manages, and assumes the risks of a business or enterprise. An entrepreneur is an agent of change. Entrepreneurship is the process of discovering new ways of combining resources. When the market value generated by this new combination of resources is greater than the market value these resources can generate elsewhere individually or in some other combination, the entrepreneur makes a profit. An entrepreneur who takes the resources necessary to produce a pair of jeans that can be sold for thirty dollars and instead turns them into a denim backpack that sells for fifty dollars will earn a profit by increasing the value those resources create. This comparison is possible because in competitive resource markets, an entrepreneur’s costs of production are determined by the prices required to bid the necessary resources away from alternative uses. Those prices will be equal to the value that the resources could create in their next-best alternate uses. Because the price of purchasing resources measures this opportunity cost— the value of the forgone alternatives—the profit entrepreneurs make reflects the amount by which they have increased the value generated by the resources under their control.


Entrepreneurs who make a loss, however, have reduced the value created by the resources under their control; that is, those resources could have produced more value elsewhere. Losses mean that an entrepreneur has essentially turned a fifty-dollar denim backpack into a thirty-dollar pair of jeans. This error in judgment is part of the entrepreneurial learning, or discovery, process vital to the efficient operation of markets. The profit-and-loss system of capitalism helps to quickly sort through the many new resource combinations entrepreneurs discover. A vibrant, growing economy depends on the efficiency of the process by which new ideas are quickly discovered, acted on, and labeled as successes or failures. Just as important as identifying successes is making sure that failures are quickly extinguished, freeing poorly used resources to go elsewhere. This is the positive side of business failure.


Successful entrepreneurs expand the size of the economic pie for everyone. Bill Gates, who as an undergraduate at Harvard developed BASIC for the first microcomputer, went on to help found Microsoft in 1975. During the 1980s, IBM contracted with Gates to provide the operating system for its computers, a system now known as MS-DOS. Gates procured the software from another firm, essentially turning the thirty-dollar pair of jeans into a multibillion-dollar product. Microsoft’s Office and Windows operating software now run on about 90 percent of the world’s computers. By making software that increases human productivity, Gates expanded our ability to generate output (and income), resulting in a higher standard of living for all.


Sam Walton, the founder of Wal-Mart, was another entrepreneur who touched millions of lives in a positive way. His innovations in distribution warehouse centers and inventory control allowed Wal-Mart to grow, in less than thirty years, from a single store in Arkansas to the nation’s largest retail chain. Shoppers benefit from the low prices and convenient locations that Walton’s Wal-Marts provide. Along with other entrepreneurs such as Ted Turner (CNN), Henry Ford (Ford automobiles), Ray Kroc (McDonald’s franchising), and Fred Smith (FedEx), Walton significantly improved the everyday life of billions of people all over the world.


The word “entrepreneur” originates from a thirteenth-century French verb, entreprendre, meaning “to do something” or “to undertake.” By the sixteenth century, the noun form, entrepreneur, was being used to refer to someone who undertakes a business venture. The first academic use of the word by an economist was likely in 1730 by Richard Cantillon, who identified the willingness to bear the personal financial risk of a business venture as the defining characteristic of an entrepreneur. In the early 1800s, economists Jean-Baptiste Say and John Stuart Mill further popularized the academic usage of the word “entrepreneur.” Say stressed the role of the entrepreneur in creating value by moving resources out of less productive areas and into more productive ones. Mill used the term “entrepreneur” in his popular 1848 book, Principles of Political Economy, to refer to a person who assumes both the risk and the management of a business. In this manner, Mill provided a clearer distinction than Cantillon between an entrepreneur and other business owners (such as shareholders of a corporation) who assume financial risk but do not actively participate in the day-to-day operations or management of the firm.


Two notable twentieth-century economists, Joseph Schumpeter and Israel Kirzner, further refined the academic understanding of entrepreneurship. Schumpeter stressed the role of the entrepreneur as an innovator who implements change in an economy by introducing new goods or new methods of production. In the Schumpeterian view, the entrepreneur is a disruptive force in an economy. Schumpeter emphasized the beneficial process of creative destruction, in which the introduction of new products results in the obsolescence or failure of others. The introduction of the compact disc and the corresponding disappearance of the vinyl record is just one of many examples of creative destruction: cars, electricity, aircraft, and personal computers are others. In contrast to Schumpeter’s view, Kirzner focused on entrepreneurship as a process of discovery. Kirzner’s entrepreneur is a person who discovers previously unnoticed profit opportunities. The entrepreneur’s discovery initiates a process in which these newly discovered profit opportunities are then acted on in the marketplace until market competition eliminates the profit opportunity. Unlike Schumpeter’s disruptive force, Kirzner’s entrepreneur is an equilibrating force. An example of such an entrepreneur would be someone in a college town who discovers that a recent increase in college enrollment has created a profit opportunity in renovating houses and turning them into rental apartments. Economists in the modern austrian school of economics have further refined and developed the ideas of Schumpeter and Kirzner.


During the 1980s and 1990s, state and local governments across the United States abandoned their previous focus on attracting large manufacturing firms as the centerpiece of economic development policy and instead shifted their focus to promoting entrepreneurship. This same period witnessed a dramatic increase in empirical research on entrepreneurship. Some of these studies explore the effect of demographic and socioeconomic factors on the likelihood of a person choosing to become an entrepreneur. Others explore the impact of taxes on entrepreneurial activity. This literature is still hampered by the lack of a clear measure of entrepreneurial activity at the U.S. state level. Scholars generally measure entrepreneurship by using numbers of self-employed people; the deficiency in such a measure is that some people become self-employed partly to avoid, or even evade, income and payroll taxes. Some studies find, for example, that higher income tax rates are associated with higher rates of self-employment. This counterintuitive result is likely explained by the higher tax rates encouraging more tax evasion through individuals filing taxes as self-employed. Economists have also found that higher taxes on inheritance are associated with a lower likelihood of individuals becoming entrepreneurs.


Some empirical studies have attempted to determine the contribution of entrepreneurial activity to overall economic growth. The majority of the widely cited studies use international data, taking advantage of the index of entrepreneurial activity for each country published annually in the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor. These studies conclude that between one-third and one-half of the differences in economic growth rates across countries can be explained by differing rates of entrepreneurial activity. Similar strong results have been found at the state and local levels.


Infusions of venture capital funding, economists find, do not necessarily foster entrepreneurship. Capital is more mobile than labor, and funding naturally flows to those areas where creative and potentially profitable ideas are being generated. This means that promoting individual entrepreneurs is more important for economic development policy than is attracting venture capital at the initial stages. While funding can increase the odds of new business survival, it does not create new ideas. Funding follows ideas, not vice versa.


One of the largest remaining disagreements in the applied academic literature concerns what constitutes entrepreneurship. Should a small-town housewife who opens her own day-care business be counted the same as someone like Bill Gates or Sam Walton? If not, how are these different activities classified, and where do we draw the line? This uncertainty has led to the terms “lifestyle” entrepreneur and “gazelle” (or “high growth”) entrepreneur. Lifestyle entrepreneurs open their own businesses primarily for the nonmonetary benefits associated with being their own bosses and setting their own schedules. Gazelle entrepreneurs often move from one start-up business to another, with a well-defined growth plan and exit strategy. While this distinction seems conceptually obvious, empirically separating these two groups is difficult when we cannot observe individual motives. This becomes an even greater problem as researchers try to answer questions such as whether the policies that promote urban entrepreneurship can also work in rural areas. Researchers on rural entrepreneurship have recently shown that the Internet can make it easier for rural entrepreneurs to reach a larger market. Because, as Adam Smith pointed out, specialization is limited by the extent of the market, rural entrepreneurs can specialize more successfully when they can sell to a large number of online customers.


What is government’s role in promoting or stifling entrepreneurship? Because the early research on entrepreneurship was done mainly by noneconomists (mostly actual entrepreneurs and management faculty at business schools), the prevailing belief was that new government programs were the best way to promote entrepreneurship. Among the most popular proposals were government-managed loan funds, government subsidies, government-funded business development centers, and entrepreneurial curriculum in public schools. These programs, however, have generally failed. Government-funded and -managed loan funds, such as are found in Maine, Minnesota, and Iowa, have suffered from the same poor incentives and political pressures that plague so many other government agencies.


My own recent research, along with that of other economists, has found that the public policy that best fosters entrepreneurship is economic freedom. Our research focuses on the public choice reasons why these government programs are likely to fail, and on how improved “rules of the game” (lower and less complex taxes and regulations, more secure property rights, an unbiased judicial system, etc.) promote entrepreneurial activity. Steven Kreft and Russell Sobel (2003) showed entrepreneurial activity to be highly correlated with the “Economic Freedom Index,” a measure of the existence of such promarket institutions. This relationship between freedom and entrepreneurship also holds using more widely accepted indexes of entrepreneurial activity (from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor) and economic freedom (from Gwartney and Lawson’s Economic Freedom of the World) that are available selectively at the international level. This relationship holds whether the countries studied are economies moving out of socialism or economies of OECD countries. Figure 1 shows the strength of this relationship among OECD countries.


The dashed line in the figure shows the positive relationship between economic freedom and entrepreneurial activity. When other demographic and socioeconomic factors are controlled for, the relationship is even stronger. This finding is consistent with the strong positive correlation between economic freedom and the growth of per capita income that other researchers have found. One reason economic freedom produces economic growth is that economic freedom fosters entrepreneurial activity.

Economists William Baumol and Peter Boettke popularized the idea that capitalism is significantly more productive than alternative forms of economic organization because, under capitalism, entrepreneurial effort is channeled into activities that produce wealth rather than into activities that forcibly take other people’s wealth. Entrepreneurs, note Baumol and Boettke, are present in all societies. In government-controlled societies, entrepreneurial people go into government or lobby government, and much of the government action that results—tariffs, subsidies, and regulations, for example—destroys wealth. In economies with limited governments and rule of law, entrepreneurs produce wealth. Baumol’s and Boettke’s idea is consistent with the data and research linking economic freedom, which is a measure of the presence of good institutions, to both entrepreneurship and economic growth. The recent academic research on entrepreneurship shows that, to promote entrepreneurship, government policy should focus on reforming basic institutions to create an environment in which creative individuals can flourish. That environment is one of well-defined and enforced property rights, low taxes and regulations, sound legal and monetary systems, proper contract enforcement, and limited government intervention.
