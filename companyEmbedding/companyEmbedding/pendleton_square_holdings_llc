About


Welcome to Pendleton Square. We are an independent trust and family office guiding generations forward to protect and sustain wealth and ensure enduring and life-enhancing legacies.

We wanted to create a customized relationship model. We felt listening was paramount.
At Pendleton Square, we feel we have created that model. Our team is a steward to guide and navigate established estate plans in collaboration with other family advisors, such as investment advisors, attorneys, CPAs, and insurance partners.
Our mission at Pendleton Square is to help guide generations forward with integrity, excellence, independence, compassion, leadership, and trust.

“The only thing you take with you when you’re gone is what you leave behind. “
-John Allston

At Pendleton Square Trust Company, we do not engage in investment management. To avoid a potential conflict of interest, we believe the role of trustee should be separated from money management.

This model combines the family’s long-term investment advisor with their trusted estate planning attorney, CPA, insurance partner and independent trustee. The result is a true strategic partnership that focuses on communication, performance, efficiency and creativity.

“The only thing you take with you when you’re gone is what you leave behind. “
-John Allston









Private Family Trust Company


Our commitment at Pendleton Square Trust and Family Office is to assist families in establishing and operating a Tennessee-chartered Private Family Trust Company. The Pendleton Square leadership team has extensive experience with this process, and our goal is to help families and their attorneys navigate the regulatory requirements and to provide ongoing support and infrastructure.
A private family trust company (PFTC) is a legal entity that provides trust and fiduciary services to a single-family group. It is a state-chartered, regulated entity, and therefore, is not permitted to do business with the public. For families of sufficient wealth, the PFTC is an attractive alternative to the use of either corporate or individual trustees, as the PFTC is owned entirely by members of the same family. A PFTC is not necessarily a family office, but can include the functions of a family office or act as an affiliate of an existing family office.
An existing or newly formed corporation or limited liability company can form a Tennessee Private Family Trust Company through an application with the Tennessee Department of Financial Institutions.
Tennessee has been selected by several families and their advisors as the jurisdiction for their private family trust companies, based on Tennessee’s favorable trust statutes and income tax structure. Tennessee has demonstrated a commitment to families to offer a jurisdiction which accommodates the unique issues facing a family.
Private Family Trust Companies offer many advantages to families
Continuity in Fulfilling Fiduciary Obligations: The PFTC can provide continuity as well as provide a means to provide structure in administering the many trusts of the family. Traditionally, families have chosen trustees who are family members, advisors, or commercial trustees with whom they have personal, professional or business relationships. PFTCs allow the family to continue to involve these family members, advisors and institutions in similar functions while serving the PFTC.
Stability of Staff: Commercial fiduciaries can undergo mergers, modifications to their service models and may be unable to retain qualified personnel with whom the beneficiaries have established a strong ongoing relationship. The PFTC provides a known successor as the family trustee.
Limits Liability: A family member or other individual serving as trustee will have personal liability for their decisions. The PFTC eliminates fiduciary liability risk for family members and other individuals serving as trustee, but still allows these individuals to maintain an active role in the governance of the PFTC.
Flexibility in Investing: A PFTC has the flexibility to invest in various types of investments that a commercial trust company may prefer not to hold (e.g. concentrated positions, alternative investments, real estate, private equity, etc.). Additionally, the PFTC has the ability to manage unique assets, such as a family operating business or family investment partnerships.
Better Organized: A PFTC provides a structure for the administration of families’ trusts through a corporate organization, including a board, an investment committee, and a distribution committee; thereby providing long-term governance and a succession plan for the family. The PFTC will usually retain professional service providers to manage the trusts, but allow for family involvement in the various operational committees and governance.
Cost Effective: A PFTC has no profit motive and no conflicts of interest, so the trust administration costs can be more effectively managed. Since a PFTC may structure its services to the family’s needs and retain outsourced service providers, the operational costs may be significantly reduced.
Confidentiality: A PFTC provides the family confidentiality of wealth transfer strategies, investment activities and distributions (vs. a large bank trust department atmosphere).
Pendleton Square Trust and Family Office will customize services to support families in the formation, administration and management of their PFTC and will coordinate the service model with the family’s team of advisors and/or family office. Should a family already have a family office in place, Pendleton Square will provide the private family trust company with the needed services to complement those being provided by the family office.
Services that Pendleton Square Trust and Family Office provides in establishing a Private Family Trust Company

Assistance in completing a Private Trust Company application with the Tennessee Department of Financial Institutions.
Assistance in preparing a policy manual for the PFTC.
Introductions to local qualified attorneys, CPAs, real estate agents and other advisors and resources.

Services that we provide an established Private Family Trust Company

Leasing or locating office space in Tennessee for the Company to maintain its books and records (Tennessee law requires a physical location in the State).
Providing administrative support to the Company, such as answering phones, processing mail, and paying bills.
Arranging for an officer of Pendleton Square to serve as an independent board member of the Company.
Acting as a liaison to the Tennessee Department of Financial Institutions to coordinate regulatory matters.
Coordinating board meetings for the Company in Tennessee.
Providing family education and succession planning.

George Washington law professor and economist praises Democrats for coming up with a message that preserves the party’s commitment to social justice issues, rather than attempting to woo Trump voters by appealing to what Trump appealed to.

What is Form D? What It Is Used For
Form D disclosures could be used to track and understand better your competitors. The information in Form D is usually highly confidential for ventures and startups and they don’t like revealing it. This is because it reveals amount raised or planned to be raised as well as reasons for the financing. This could help competitors.
