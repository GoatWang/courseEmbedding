Shafroth, J.J. Duda, and J.R. Foreman. 2011. Baseline Hydrologic Studies in the Lower Elwha River Prior to Dam Removal [Chapter 4]. In: Coastal habitats of the Elwha River, Washington—Biological and physical patterns and processes prior to dam removal. Scientific Investigations Report 2011–5120. U.S. Geological Survey. 75-110 p. After the removal of two large, long‑standing dams on the Elwha River, Washington, the additional load of sediment and wood is expected to affect the hydrology of the lower river, its estuary, and the alluvial aquifer underlying the surrounding flood plain. To better understand the surface-water and groundwater characteristics of the river and estuary before dam removal, several hydrologic data sets were collected and analyzed. An experiment using a dye tracer characterized transient storage, and it was determined that the low-flow channel of the lower Elwha River was relatively simple; 1–6 percent of the median travel time of dye was attributed to transient-storage processes...

One of the reasons why this tool is so popular is because the plasma cutter is able to create precise cuts in metal regardless of how thick the workpiece. There are a number of plasma cutters available, so it is helpful to learn more about the tool so you can choose one to fit your needs. Cutting it OutPlasma cutting torches and bodies have a wide range of applications across many industries. Plasma arc cutting torches are popular models contractor use to install refrigeration, heating, plumbing and air conditioner systems. Many artists enjoy using plasma cutters for intricate detail work because the heat from the cutter does not melt or warp thin metal that is close to the edges of the material being cut. Clean cuts are possible and little to no debris is left behind to clean. Take it With You When You GoPortable plasma cutters vary in size, but the most common size in use by contractors are ones that weigh around 50 pounds. Although gas welding torches may weigh less, the benefits of cutting 20-inches of metal in a minute with a plasma cutter usually tend to surpass any issues with extra weightiness. Be sure to purchase accessories to carry and protect the cutter as you travel with it. Plumbing Made EasierBeing able to cut material while on a job site is a definite advantage for those who work in trades like plumbing. This type of machinery can create swift cuts with clean edges, so pipefitting work is faster and more efficient. Tear it Up Unlike MIG welders or other types of cutting tools, a plasma cutter is hot enough to perform metal demolition jobs at a fast pace. Don't want that fender? Take plasma cutter to it and in seconds the bumper is on the ground. On the opposite end of the spectrum, a plasma cutter is also a good choice for making repairs to outdoor machinery and equipment like lawnmowers and grills. No matter how you slice it, plasma cutters are a notch above many other cutting choices.Tell us what you think - opens in new window or tabSide Refine PanelShop by CategoryWelders, Cutters & TorchesPlasma CuttersMIG WeldersMIG Guns & TorchesTIG WeldersTIG TorchesStick WeldersMultiprocess Welders & CuttersPlasma Cutter Torches & BodiesSpot WeldersGas Welding TorchesGas Cutting TorchesGas Welding & Cutting KitsBrandsee allESABHobartHyperthermMillerThermal DynamicsUnbranded/GenericConditionsee allNewNew other (see details)Manufacturer refurbishedSeller refurbishedUsedFor parts or not workingNot SpecifiedPricePlease provide a valid price range$-$Buying Formatsee allAll ListingsAuctionBuy It NowItem Locationsee allDefaultWithindistance2 miles5 miles10 miles15 miles20 miles50 miles75 miles100 miles150 miles200 miles500 miles750 miles1000 miles1500 miles2000 milesofGoUS OnlyNorth AmericaWorldwideDelivery Optionssee allFree ShippingFree In-store PickupShow onlysee allReturns AcceptedCompleted ItemsSold ItemsDeals & SavingsMore refinements...
