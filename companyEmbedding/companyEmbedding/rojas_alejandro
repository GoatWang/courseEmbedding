Description



Product Description
Roast Level:  Light
Region:  San Jose Lourdes, Cajamarca
Farm: Campos de Pajuro, Laurel y Chorro
Varietal: Caturra
Altitude: 1900 M
Processing Method: Washed (21 hour ferment, 25 days shade-dried)
In our Producer Select series, we focus on rare, unique, delicious coffees from some of the most sought-after producers on the planet.
Alejandro is known for his meticulously produced lots, which often receive scores of 87+ from export cuppers in Jaen, the region’s principal Coffee Processing town, and are separated out as microlots.
This cup in particular has an extremely smooth and airy mouthfeel, which helps its delicate tangy, fruit notes stand out even more than they already would. Alejandro’s coffee is world-class, and we’re super excited to be able to share it with you.
