Ronda Rousey Travis Browne




 
 Share497 Tweet Reddit WhatsApp +1 EmailFormer UFC women’s bantamweight champion Ronda Rousey recently said ‘yes’ to hubby Travis Browne when he popped the big question during the pair’s vacation to New Zealand.




Prior to the couple going on their vacation however, the pair’s house in Venice, California was robbed by local skateboarders, who were caught on camera. According to Ronda Rousey, Browne quickly headed straight to the skatepark to find the thieves:


MMA Weekly has the transcription:

“We stopped by the house right before we were going to go to the airport and he was going to sneak away and go ask my mom for permission but right when we got to the house, we realized we were robbed. Someone had been squatting in my house for like three days, sleeping in my bed.”
“[They] stole my Olympic rings, stole my guns, stole all my precious jewelry, every headphone in the house, credit cards.”
“We have security cameras so we looked back at them and we saw that they were a bunch of kids with skateboards and there’s a famous skate park right across the street cause we’re in Venice. So my man’s 6’7” like 260 [pounds], he like beelines it straight to the skateboard park, finds the guys right away.”
“He’s smart enough not to [hit them], we’ll get sued pretty hard, but he found the police right then and they caught them.”

Browne then went on to propose to Rousey during the vacation ahead of his UFC 213 fight with Oleksiy Oliynyk this Saturday. He recently recalled the moments leading up to the proposal as “nerve-wracking” revealing that he had been quite on edge for several days prior to the proposal.
Knowing what we do now, Browne likely was on edge due to the pair’s house being robbed before they left for vacation to New Zealand.
