Product Description▼▲
The Way of the Master is the flagship work of Ray Comfort and Kirk Cameron's organization. It anchors their award-winning television program as well as their radio show and website. Considered by many to be the definitive text on evangelism, this book has been updated, expanded and illustrated with photographs for this edition. It is anecdotal, loaded with commentary that is more conversational than academic. It's an easy read with a hard message that has already changed the face of sharing faith. Free Audio Download available of "Hell's Best Kept Secret."

            The subject matter is something all Christians should study and apply if they plan to mature in their Christian walk. I was unable to download the audio despite several attempts.

            I have been a Christian for a long time and have witnessed to others, but NEVER in this way! The churches need to share this with us! It makes SOO much sense!


Praise the Lord for these men and this book!

            If you want to be better equipped to "always be ready to give a reason for the hope that is is in you," I recommend you read this book. It has been invaluable in helping me to share Christ with others. And when you are "ready" to share, there is no fear in sharing. Proverbs 16:6 states that "By mercy and truth iniquity is purged." Ray Comfort brings together both in this book.

            This is the single most important book i own in my library only next to the bible (Which of course is the most important). Every Christian should read this book, and read it with an open mind. I have multiple copies of this book, and pass them out as i see needed.. thanks Ray Comfort, God has truly blessed you and worked wonders in your life

Praise

    “THE ARTIST’S WAY by Julia Cameron is not exclusively about writing—it is about discovering and developing the artist within whether a painter, poet, screenwriter or musician—but it is a lot about writing. If you have always wanted to pursue a creative dream, have always wanted to play and create with words or paints, this book will gently get you started and help you learn all kinds of paying-attention techniques; and that, after all, is what being an artist is all about. It’s about learning to pay attention.”–Anne Lamott, Mademoiselle “This  book has been around for a long time, and I hope it sticks around  forever. It guides the reader through a fascinating (and fun)  12-week-long program of exercises and explorations that help loosen up  one’s artistic self. It takes you on a journey that will cost you  nothing (aside from the guidebook) and it brings much insight, gently  helping you see what is holding you back, and showing you how to move  forward. Three times in the last decade I’ve committed to doing The  Artist’s Way’s program, and each time I’ve learned something important  and surprising about myself and my work. Just to show how influential  it’s been to me—the first time I did the program, I had decided by end  of it that I wanted to 1) travel to Italy and learn Italian, 2) Go to an  Ashram in India, and 3) Return to Indonesia to study with the old  medicine man I’d once met there. We all know what THAT decision led to. .  . Without The Artist’s Way, there would have been no Eat, Pray, Love.”—Elizabeth Gilbert“The premise of the book is that creativity and spirituality are the same thing, they come from the same place. And we were created to use this life to express our individuality, and that over the course of a lifetime that gets beaten out of us. [THE ARTIST’S WAY] helped me put aside my fear and not worry about whether the record would be commercial.”–Grammy award-winning singer Kathy Mattea “Julia Cameron brings creativity and spirituality together with the same kind of step-by-step wisdom that Edgar Cayce encouraged. The result is spiritual creativity as a consistent and nourishing part of daily life.”–Venture Inward “I never knew I was a visual artist until I read Julia Cameron’s THE ARTIST’S WAY.”–Jannene Behl in Artist’s Magazine “Julia Cameron’s landmark book THE ARTIST’S WAY helped me figure out who I really was as an adult, not so much as an artist but as a person. And award-winning journalist and poet, Cameron’s genius is that she doesn’t tell readers what they should do to achieve or who they should be—instead she creates a map for readers to start exploring these questions themselves.”–Michael F. Melcher, Law Practice magazine “This is not a self-help book in the normative sense. It is simply a powerful book that can challenge one to move into an entirely different state of personal expression and growth.”–Nick Maddox, Deland Beacon “THE ARTIST’S WAY (with its companion volume THE ARTIST’S WAY MORNING PAGES JOURNAL) becomes a friend over time, not just a journal. Like a journal, it provokes spontaneous insights and solutions; beyond journaling, it establishes a process that is interactive and dynamic.”–Theresa L. Crenshaw, M.D., San Diego Union-Tribune  “If you really want to supercharge your writing, I recommend that you get a copy of Julia Cameron’s book THE ARTIST’S WAY. I’m not a big fan of self-help books, but this book has changed my life for the better and restored my previously lagging creativity.”–Jeffrey Bairstow, Laser Focus World “Working with the principle that creative expression is the natural direction of life, Cameron developed a three month program to recover creativity. THE ARTIST’S WAY shows how to tap into the higher power that connects human creativity and the creative energies of the universe.”–Mike Gossie, Scottsdale Tribune “THE ARTIST’S WAY is the seminal book on the subject of creativity and an invaluable guide to living the artistic life. Still as vital today—or perhaps even more so—than it was when it was first published in 1992, it is a provocative and inspiring work. Updated and expanded, it reframes THE ARTIST’S WAY for a new century.”–Branches of Light “THE ARTIST’S WAY has sold over 3 million copies since its publication in 1992. Cameron still teaches it because there is sustained demand for its thoughtful, spiritual approach to unblocking and nurturing creativity. It is, dare we say, timeless.”–Nancy Colasurdo, FOXBusinessPraise for VEIN OF GOLD, the second volume in the ARTIST’S WAY trilogy “For those seeking the wellspring of creativity, this book, like its predecessor, is a solid gold diving rod.”–PUBLISHERS WEEKLY
