	Credit Suisse Securities
	(USA) LLC


	As Representative of the several Underwriters named in Schedule A


	c/o Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC


	Eleven Madison Avenue


	New York, New York 10010-3629


	Ladies and Gentlemen:


	Annaly Capital Management, Inc., a Maryland corporation (the 

	Company

	), proposes to issue and sell to the several
	underwriters named in

	Schedule A

	hereto (the 

	Underwriters

	), for whom Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC is acting as representative (

	Credit Suisse

	 or the 

	Representative

	), an aggregate
	of 60,000,000 shares (the 

	Firm Securities

	) of common stock, $0.01 par value (the 

	Common Stock

	), of the Company. In addition, the Company proposes to grant to the Underwriters the option to purchase from the
	Company up to an additional 9,000,000 shares of Common Stock (the 

	Additional Securities

	). The Firm Securities and the Additional Securities are hereinafter collectively sometimes referred to as the 

	Securities

	.
	The Securities are described in the Prospectus which is referred to below. To the extent there is only one underwriter for the sale of the Securities, the term Underwriters shall mean

	Credit Suisse

	.


	The Company has filed, in accordance with the provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder
	(collectively, the 

	Securities Act

	), with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the 

	Commission

	) an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-209447), as amended, including a base
	prospectus, with respect to the Securities, and which incorporates by reference documents which the Company has filed or will file in accordance with the provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations
	thereunder (collectively, the 

	Exchange Act

	), which registration statement became effective upon filing under Rule 462(e) of the Securities Act. Promptly after execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Company will prepare and
	file a prospectus supplement (the 

	Prospectus Supplement

	) to the base prospectus included as part of such registration statement setting forth the terms of the offering, sale and plan of distribution of the Securities and
	additional information concerning the Company and its business. The Company has furnished to the Representative, for use by the Underwriters and by dealers, copies of one or more preliminary prospectuses, containing the base prospectus included as
	part of such registration statement, as supplemented by a preliminary Prospectus Supplement, and including the documents incorporated by reference in such base prospectus or preliminary






	Prospectus Supplement (each, a 

	Preliminary Prospectus

	), relating to the Securities. Except where the context otherwise requires, such registration statement (as amended when it
	became effective) including all documents filed as part thereof or incorporated by reference therein, and including any information contained in a Prospectus (as defined below) subsequently filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the
	rules and regulations of the Commission under the Securities Act (the 

	Securities Act Regulations

	), collectively, are herein called the 

	Registration Statement

	. The base prospectus, including all documents
	incorporated by reference therein, included in the Registration Statement, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, in the form filed by the Company with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) and Rule 430B under the Securities Act on or before
	the second Business Day (as defined below) following the date of this Agreement (or on such other day as the parties may mutually agree), is herein called the 

	Prospectus

	. The information included in such prospectus that was
	omitted from such registration statement at the time it became effective but that is deemed to be part of such registration statement at the time it became effective pursuant to Rule 430B is referred to as 

	Rule 430B Information

	.
	Any reference herein to the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents incorporated by reference therein, and any reference herein
	to the terms amend, amendment or supplement with respect to the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or any Preliminary Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the filing after the execution hereof of
	any document with the Commission deemed to be incorporated by reference therein. For purposes of this Agreement, all references to the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or to any amendment or supplement to any of the
	foregoing shall be deemed to include any copy filed with the Commission pursuant to its Electronic Data Gathering Analysis and Retrieval System (

	EDGAR

	), and such copy shall be identical in content to any Prospectus or Preliminary
	Prospectus delivered to the Underwriters for use in connection with the offering of the Securities.


	All references in this Agreement to
	financial statements and schedules and other information which is contained, included or stated in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus (or other references of like import)
	shall be deemed to mean and include all such financial statements and schedules and other information which is incorporated by reference in or otherwise deemed by Securities Act Regulations to be a part of or included in the Registration Statement,
	any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus, as the case may be; and all references in this Agreement to amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to mean and include the
	filing of any document under the Exchange Act which is incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, such Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus, as the case may be.


	The Company and the Underwriters agree as follows:


	1.


	Sale and Purchase


	. Upon the basis of the warranties and representations and subject to the terms and conditions herein set
	forth, the Company agrees to issue and sell the Firm Securities to the several Underwriters, and each of the Underwriters, severally and not jointly, agrees to purchase from the Company the respective number of Firm Securities (subject to such
	adjustment as the Representative may determine to avoid fractional shares) set forth opposite the name of such Underwriter in

	Schedule A

	hereto at a purchase price of $11.66 per share. The Company is advised by the Representative that the
	Underwriters intend (i) to make a


	 


	2






	public offering of the Securities as soon as the Underwriters deem advisable after this Agreement has been executed and delivered and (ii) initially to offer the Firm Securities upon the
	terms set forth in the Prospectus. The Underwriters may from time to time increase or decrease the public offering price after the initial public offering to such extent as they may determine.


	In addition, the Company hereby grants to the several Underwriters the option to purchase, and upon the basis of the warranties and
	representations and subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, the Underwriters shall have the right to purchase, severally and not jointly, from the Company ratably in accordance with the number of Firm Securities to be purchased by each
	of them (subject to such adjustment as the Representative may determine to avoid fractional shares) all or a portion of the Additional Securities, at the same purchase price per share to be paid by the Underwriters to the Company for the Firm
	Securities; provided that the purchase price per share for any Additional Securities shall be reduced by an amount per share equal to any dividends or distributions declared by the Company and payable on the Firm Securities but not payable on such
	Additional Securities. This option may be exercised by the Representative on behalf of the several Underwriters at any time and from time to time on or before the thirtieth day following the date hereof, by written notice to the Company. Each such
	notice shall set forth the aggregate number of Additional Securities as to which the option is being exercised and the date and time when Additional Securities are to be delivered (any such date and time being herein referred to as an
	

	additional time of purchase

	); provided, however, that an additional time of purchase shall not be (i) earlier than the time of purchase (as defined below) or (ii) later than the tenth Business Day after the date on which
	the option shall have been exercised. The number of Additional Securities to be sold to each Underwriter shall be the number which bears the same proportion to the aggregate number of Additional Securities being purchased as the number of Firm
	Securities set forth opposite the name of such Underwriter on

	Schedule A

	hereto bears to the aggregate number of Firm Securities (subject, in each case, to such adjustment as the Representative may determine to eliminate fractional shares).
	As used herein 

	Business Day

	 shall mean a day on which the New York Stock Exchange (the 

	NYSE

	) is open for trading and commercial banks in the City of New York are open for business.


	2.


	Payment and Delivery


	. Payment of the purchase price for the Firm Securities shall be made to the Company by federal funds
	wire transfer against delivery of the certificates for the Firm Securities to the Representative through the facilities of the Depository Trust Company (

	DTC

	) for the respective accounts of the Underwriters. Such payment and
	delivery shall be made at 10:00 A.M., New York City time, on July 21, 2017 (unless another time shall be agreed to by the Representative and the Company or unless postponed in accordance with the provisions of

	Section 10

	hereof).
	The time at which such payment and delivery are actually made is herein sometimes called the 

	time of purchase

	. Delivery of the Firm Securities and Additional Securities shall be made through the facilities of the DTC and shall be
	in global form, as one or more global certificates representing the Securities, unless the Representative shall otherwise instruct. The Firm Securities so to be delivered or evidence of their issuance will be made available for checking at least 24
	hours prior to the time of purchase. Payment of the purchase price for Additional Securities shall be made at each additional time of purchase in the same manner and at the same office as the payment for the Firm Securities. The Additional
	Securities being purchased on each additional time of purchase or evidence of their issuance will be made available for checking at a reasonable time in advance of such additional time of purchase.

	. The Company represents and
	warrants to each of the Underwriters as of the date hereof, the Applicable Time referred to in

	prospectus), (3) at the time the Company or any person acting on its behalf (within the meaning, for this clause only, of Rule 163(c) of the Securities Act) made any offer relating to the Securities in reliance on the exemption of Rule 163 of

	and remain eligible for registration by the Company on a Rule 405 automatic shelf registration statement. The Company has not received from the Commission any notice pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) of the Securities Act objecting to the use
	of the automatic shelf registration statement form.


	At the time the Registration Statement was initially filed, at the earliest time
	thereafter that the Company or another offering participant made a bona fide offer (within the meaning of Rule 164(h)(2) of the Securities Act) of the Securities and at the date hereof, the Company was not and is not an ineligible

	or the Prospectus or to be filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement have been so described or filed. The Prospectus Supplement has been or will be so prepared and will be filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the Securities Act on or before the
	second Business Day following the date of this Agreement or on such other day as the parties may mutually agree. The Preliminary Prospectus, at the time of filing thereof, conformed in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities Act.

	(including one fully executed copy of each of the Registration Statement and of each amendment thereto for the Underwriters) have been delivered to the Underwriters and their counsel (except for documents incorporated by reference that have
	otherwise been filed and are publicly available on EDGAR). The Company has not distributed any offering material in connection with the offering or sale of the Securities other than the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus, the
	Prospectus, Issuer General Use Free Writing Prospectuses (as defined below) or any other materials, if any, permitted by the Securities Act.

	of the Registration Statement, and any post-effective amendment thereto, when such part became effective and at each deemed effective date with respect to the Underwriters or when such part was or is filed with the Commission, did not or will not
	contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading. The Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus and any amendment or supplement
	thereto, at their respective times of issuance and at the time of purchase and, if applicable, at each additional time of purchase, did not or will not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make
	the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that the foregoing shall not apply to statements in, or omissions from, any such document in reliance upon, and in conformity with, written
	information concerning the Underwriters that was furnished in writing to the Company by the Representative on behalf of the several Underwriters, specifically for use in the preparation thereof.

	disclosure controls and procedures are effective to perform the functions for which they were established; any significant material weaknesses in internal controls have been identified for the Companys Chief Executive Officer and its Chief

	similar insurers as may be necessary to continue its business at a cost that would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect.


	(ii) Except as set forth in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, the Company is not
	in violation, and has not received notice of any violation with respect to, any applicable environmental, safety or similar law applicable to the business of the Company. The Company has received all permits, licenses or other approvals required of

	such violation of law or regulation, failure to receive required permits, licenses or other approvals or failure to comply with the terms and conditions of such permits, licenses or approvals which could not, singly or in the aggregate, have a
	Company Material Adverse Effect.


	(jj) Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has incurred any liability for any
	finders fees or similar payments in connection with the transactions herein contemplated, except as may otherwise exist with respect to the Underwriters pursuant to this Agreement.

	(ll) No relationship, direct or indirect, exists between or among the Company or
	any of its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the directors, officers and stockholders of the Company, on the other hand, which is required by the Securities Act to be described in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus that is not so

	and the regulations and published interpretations thereunder (collectively, the 

	Code

	), for all taxable years commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 1997. The proposed method of operation of the Company as
	described in the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus will enable the Company to continue to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code, and no actions have been taken (or not taken which are required to
	be taken) which would cause such qualification to be lost. The Company intends to continue to operate in a manner which would permit it to qualify as a REIT under the Code. The Company has no intention of changing its operations or engaging in
	activities which would cause it to fail to qualify, or make economically undesirable its continued qualification, as a REIT.

	Company or any subsidiary, on the one hand, and the officers, 5% stockholders or directors of the Company or any subsidiary, on the other hand, which is required by the rules of FINRA to be described in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus
	which is not so described.


	(pp) The Company has not, directly or indirectly, including through any subsidiary, extended
	credit, arranged to extend credit, or renewed any extension of credit, in the form of a personal loan, to or for any director or executive officer of the Company, or to or for any family member or affiliate of any director or executive officer of
	the Company.


	(qq) Neither the Company nor any of the subsidiaries nor, to the Companys knowledge, any employee or
	agent of the Company or the subsidiaries has made any payment of funds of the Company or the subsidiaries or received or retained any funds in violation of any law, rule or regulation, which payment, receipt or retention of funds is of a character
	required to be disclosed in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus.


	(rr) The Company is in compliance with all
	applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the 

	the Underwriters will be identical to the version created to be transmitted to the Commission for filing via EDGAR, except to the extent permitted by Regulation S-T.


	 


	18






	(c) The Company will advise the Representative promptly, confirming such advice
	in writing, of (i) the receipt of any comments from the Commission relating to any filing of the Company under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, (ii) any request by the Commission for amendments or supplements to the Registration
	Statement or the Prospectus or for additional information with respect thereto, (iii) the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or of any order preventing or suspending the use
	of any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus or of any examination pursuant to Section 8(e) of the Securities Act concerning the Registration Statement, (iv) the suspension of the qualification of the Securities for offering or sale in
	any jurisdiction, and (v) the initiation, threatening or contemplation of any proceedings for any of such purposes and, if the Commission or any other governmental agency or authority should issue any such order, the Company will make every

	Representative promptly of any proposal to amend or supplement the Registration Statement or the Prospectus including by filing any documents that would be incorporated by reference therein, and will furnish the Representative with copies of any
	such documents a reasonable amount of time prior to such proposed filing or use, as the case may be, and will not file or use any such document to which the Representative or counsel for the Underwriters shall object in writing, in each case until
	such time that all of the Securities have been resold by the Underwriters as contemplated by the Prospectus. The Company has given the Representative notice of any filings made pursuant to the Exchange Act within 48 hours prior to the Applicable
	Time; the Company will give the Representative notice of its intention to make any such filing from the Applicable Time to the time of purchase and, if applicable, each additional time of purchase, and will furnish the Representative with copies of
	any such documents a reasonable amount of time prior to such proposed filing, as the case may be, and will not file or use any such document to which the Representative or counsel for the Underwriters shall object in writing.

	(f) The Company will advise the Representative promptly of the happening of any
	event known to the Company within the time during which a Prospectus relating to the Securities is required to be delivered under the Securities Act which would require the making of any change in the Prospectus then being used, or in the
	information incorporated by reference therein, so that the Prospectus would not include an untrue statement of material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of
	the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or if it is necessary at any time to amend or supplement the Prospectus to comply with any law. If within the time during which a Prospectus relating to the Securities is required to be

	Underwriters copies of the proposed amendment or supplement before filing any such amendment or supplement with the Commission and thereafter promptly furnish, at the Companys own expense, to the Underwriters and to dealers copies in such
	quantities and at such locations as the Representative may from time to time reasonably request of an appropriate amendment to the Registration Statement or supplement to the Prospectus so that the Prospectus as so amended or supplemented will not,
	in the circumstances when it is so delivered, be misleading or so that the Prospectus will comply with the law. If at any time following issuance of an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus there occurred or occurs an event or development as a result of
	which such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus conflicted or would conflict with the information contained in the Registration Statement relating to the Securities or the Statutory Prospectus or any preliminary prospectus or included or would include an
	untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or would omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances, prevailing at that subsequent time, not misleading, the Company will promptly
	notify the Representative and will promptly amend or supplement, at its own expense, such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus to eliminate or correct such conflict, untrue statement or omission.

	Prospectus is filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act that shall satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and Rule 158 thereunder and will advise the Underwriters in writing when such statement has been made
	available.

	each additional time of purchase, as the case may be, (i) no material and unfavorable change, financial or otherwise (other than as referred to in the Registration Statement, and the Prospectus and the General Disclosure Package, in each case
	as of the Applicable Time), in the business, condition, net worth or prospects of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, shall occur or become known and (ii) no transaction which is material and unfavorable to the Company or any of

	purchase, as the case may be, and that the conditions set forth in

	in the rating accorded any securities of or guaranteed by the Company by any nationally recognized statistical rating organization, as that term is defined under Section 3(a)(62) of the Exchange Act.

	9.


	Termination

	.

	The obligations of the several Underwriters hereunder shall be
	subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representative, at any time prior to the time of purchase or, if applicable, each additional time of purchase, (i) if any of the conditions specified in

	Section 8

	shall not
	have been fulfilled when and as required by this Agreement to be fulfilled, (ii) if any material adverse and unfavorable change occurs (financial or otherwise), or any development involving a material adverse and unfavorable change occurs
	(financial or otherwise) (in each case, other than as disclosed in, or incorporated by reference into, the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package, and the Prospectus as of the Applicable Time (exclusive of any supplement thereto)),
	in the operations, business, net worth, condition or prospects of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or the Manager, or a material change in management of the Company or the Manager occurs, whether or not arising in the ordinary
	course of business, which would, in the sole judgment of the Representative, make it impracticable to market the Securities, (iii) if (a) the United States shall have declared war in accordance with its constitutional processes or there
	has occurred an outbreak or escalation of hostilities or other national or international calamity or crisis or change or development in economic, political or other conditions the effect of which on, or (b) any material adverse change in the
	financial markets of the United States or the international financial markets is such as to make it, in the sole judgment of the Representative, impracticable or inadvisable to market the Securities or enforce contracts for the sale of the
	Securities, (iv) if trading in any securities of the Company has been suspended or materially limited by the Commission or by the NYSE, or if trading generally on the NYSE, NYSE MKT LLC or the Nasdaq Global Market has been suspended, materially
	limited, (including an automatic halt in trading pursuant to market-decline triggers other than those in which solely program trading is temporarily halted), or limitations on or minimum prices for trading (other than limitations on hours or numbers
	of days of trading) shall have been fixed, or maximum ranges for prices for securities have been required, by such exchange or FINRA or Nasdaq or by order of the Commission or any other governmental authority, (v) if a banking moratorium shall
	have been declared by New York or United States authorities or a material disruption has occurred in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States, (vi) if there shall have occurred any downgrading, or
	any notice or announcement shall have been given or made of (a) any intended or potential downgrading or (b) any review or possible change that does not indicate an improvement, in the rating accorded any securities of or guaranteed by the
	Company by any nationally recognized statistical rating organization, as that term is defined under Section 3(a)(62) of the Exchange Act, (vii) if any federal or state statute, regulation, rule or order of any court or other
	governmental authority has been enacted, published, decreed or otherwise promulgated which, in the reasonable opinion of the Representative, materially adversely affects or will materially adversely affect the business or operations of the Company,
	or (viii) if any action has been taken by any federal, state or local government or agency in respect of its monetary or fiscal affairs which, in the reasonable opinion of the Representative, has a material adverse effect on the securities
	markets in the United States.


	 


	28






	If the Representative elects to terminate this Agreement as provided in this

	Section 9

	, the Company and each other Underwriter shall be notified promptly by telephone, which shall be promptly confirmed by facsimile.


	If the sale to the Underwriters of the Securities, as contemplated by this Agreement, is not carried out by the Underwriters for any reason
	permitted under this Agreement or if such sale is not carried out because the Company shall be unable to comply with any of the terms of this Agreement, the Company shall not be under any obligation or liability under this Agreement (except to the
	extent provided in

	Sections 3, 5(p)

	,

	7

	,

	11

	and

	12

	hereof), and the Underwriters shall be under no obligation or liability to the Company under this Agreement (except to the extent provided in

	Sections 11

	and

	12

	hereof) or to one another hereunder.


	10.


	Increase in Underwriters Commitments


	. If any Underwriter shall
	default in its obligation under this Agreement to take up and pay for the Securities to be purchased by it under this Agreement (otherwise than for reasons sufficient to justify the termination of this Agreement under the provisions of

	Section 9

	hereof), the Representative shall have the right, within 36 hours after such default, to make arrangements for one or more of the non-defaulting Underwriters, or any other underwriters, to purchase all, but not less than all,
	of the Securities which such Underwriter shall have agreed but failed to take up and pay for (the 

	Defaulted Securities

	). Absent the completion of such arrangements within such 36 hour period, (i) if the total number of
	Defaulted Securities does not exceed 10% of the total number of Securities to be purchased at the time of purchase or each additional time of purchase, as the case may be, each non-defaulting Underwriter shall take up and pay for (in addition to the
	number of Securities which it is otherwise obligated to purchase on such date pursuant to this Agreement) the number of Securities agreed to be purchased by all such defaulting Underwriters in such amount or amounts as the Representative may
	designate with the consent of each Underwriter so designated or, in the event no such designation is made, such Securities shall be taken up and paid for by all non-defaulting Underwriters pro rata in proportion to the aggregate number of Firm
	Securities set opposite the names of such non-defaulting Underwriters in

	Schedule A

	hereto; and (ii) if the total number of Defaulted Securities exceeds 10% of such total number of Securities to be purchased at the time of purchase or
	each additional time of purchase, as the case may be, and if neither the non-defaulting Underwriters nor the Company shall make arrangements within the five Business Day period from the date of default for the purchase of such Defaulted Securities,
	the Representative may terminate this Agreement by notice to the Company, without liability of any party to any other party except that the provisions of

	Sections 3

	,

	5(p)

	,

	7

	,

	11

	and

	12

	shall at all times be
	effective and shall survive such termination. Nothing in this paragraph, and no action taken hereunder, shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.


	Without relieving any defaulting Underwriter from its obligations hereunder, the Company agrees with the non-defaulting Underwriters that they
	will not sell any Securities hereunder unless all of the Securities are purchased by the Underwriters (or by substituted Underwriters selected by the Representative with the approval of the Company or selected by the Company with the approval of the
	Representative).


	 


	29






	If a new Underwriter or Underwriters are substituted for a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters
	in accordance with the foregoing provisions, the Company or the Representative shall have the right to postpone the time of purchase or each additional time of purchase, as the case may be, for a period not exceeding seven Business Days from the
	date of substitution in order that any necessary changes in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and other documents may be effected.


	The term Underwriter as used in this Agreement shall refer to and include any Underwriter substituted under this

	Section 10

	with
	like effect as if such substituted Underwriter had originally been named in

	Schedule A

	hereto.


	11.


	Indemnification

	.



	(a)

	Indemnification of the Underwriters

	. The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Underwriters, their
	respective affiliates, as such term is defined in Rule 501(b) under the Securities Act (each, an 

	Affiliate

	) and the person, if any, who controls each Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or
	Section 20 of the Exchange Act as follows:


	(i) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense
	whatsoever, as incurred, arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), including the Rule 430B Information, or the omission or alleged omission
	therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any preliminary prospectus, any
	Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the General Disclosure Package or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto or any documents deemed to be incorporated by reference therein), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material
	fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;


	(ii) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate
	amount paid in settlement of any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or of any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue
	statement or omission; provided that (subject to

	Section 11(d)

	below) any such settlement is effected with the written consent of the Company; and


	(iii) against any and all expense whatsoever, as incurred (including the fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by the
	Representative), reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue
	statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, to the extent that any such expense is not paid under (i) or (ii) above;


	 


	30







	provided

	,

	however

	, that this indemnity agreement shall not apply to any loss, liability, claim,
	damage or expense to the extent arising out of any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the
	Representative expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), including the Rule 430B Information or any preliminary prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the General Disclosure Package or the Prospectus (or
	any amendment or supplement thereto or any documents deemed to be incorporated by reference therein), it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter consists of the information described as such in
	subsection (b) below.


	(b)

	Indemnification of the Company, Manager, Directors and Officers

	. Each Underwriter
	severally agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company and the Manager, and each of their directors and each of the Companys officers who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls either the Company or the
	Manager within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained in subsection (a) of this Section, as
	incurred, but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), including the Rule 430B Information or any preliminary prospectus, any
	Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, General Disclosure Package or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representative
	expressly for use therein, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter consists of the following information in the Prospectus: the information appearing in the fourth paragraph under the caption
	

	Underwriting

	.


	(c)

	Actions against Parties; Notification

	. Each indemnified party shall give
	notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying
	party from any liability hereunder to the extent it is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. In the case of
	parties indemnified pursuant to

	Section11(a)

	above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Representative, and, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to

	Section 11(b)

	above, counsel to the indemnified
	parties shall be selected by the Company. An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of any such action; provided, however, that counsel to the indemnifying party shall not (except with the consent of the indemnified
	party) also be counsel to the indemnified party. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in
	connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified
	parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any


	 


	31






	governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this

	Section 11

	or

	Section 12

	hereof (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability
	arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.


	(d)

	Settlement without Consent if Failure to Reimburse

	. If at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an
	indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, such indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by

	Section 11(a)(ii)

	effected without its
	written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 30
	days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed such indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement.




	12.


	Contribution


	. If the indemnification provided for in

	Section 11

	hereof is for any reason unavailable to
	or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims,
	damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of
	the Securities pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause
	(i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as
	any other relevant equitable considerations.




	The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on
	the other hand in connection with the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting
	expenses) received by the Company, relative to the total compensation received by the Underwriters from the sale of Securities on behalf of the Underwriters.


	The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other
	things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties relative intent,
	knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.


	 


	32






	The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution
	pursuant to this

	Section 12

	were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations
	referred to above in this

	Section 12

	. The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this

	Section 12

	shall be deemed to include any legal or
	other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever
	based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.


	Notwithstanding the provisions of this

	Section 12

	, the Underwriters shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the
	amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.


	No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to
	contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.


	For purposes of this

	Section 12

	, the
	person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act and the Underwriters Affiliates shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and
	each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act
	shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company.




	13.

	Re:     

	Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-209447)



	Ladies and Gentlemen:


	We have served as
	Maryland counsel to Annaly Capital Management, Inc., a Maryland corporation (the Company), in connection with certain matters of Maryland law relating to the registration of up to 69,000,000 shares (the Shares) of common
	stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the Company (including up to 9,000,000 Shares issuable pursuant to an option granted to the underwriters in the offering of the Shares), in an underwritten public offering covered by the above-referenced
	Registration Statement on Form S-3, and all amendments thereto (the Registration Statement), filed by the Company with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission) under the Securities Act of 1933, as
	amended (the Securities Act).


	In connection with our representation of the Company, and as a basis for the opinion
	hereinafter set forth, we have examined originals, or copies certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of the following documents (hereinafter collectively referred to as the Documents):


	1. The Registration Statement and the related form of prospectus included therein and the supplement thereto, each substantially in the form in
	which it was transmitted to the Commission under the Securities Act;


	2. The charter of the Company (the Charter), certified
	by the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland (the SDAT);


	3. The Amended and Restated Bylaws of the
	Company, certified as of the date hereof by an officer of the Company;


	4. A certificate of the SDAT as to the good standing of the
	Company, dated as of a recent date;


	5. Resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors of the Company (the Board), and by a
	duly authorized committee of the Board (the Resolutions), relating to, among other matters, the sale and issuance of the Shares, certified as of the date hereof by an officer of the Company;






	Annaly Capital Management, Inc.


	July 21, 2017


	Page 2


	 


	6. A certificate executed by an officer of the Company, dated as of the date hereof; and


	7. Such other documents and matters as we have deemed necessary or appropriate to express the opinion set forth below, subject to the
	assumptions, limitations and qualifications stated herein.


	In expressing the opinion set forth below, we have assumed the following:


	1. Each individual executing any of the Documents, whether on behalf of such individual or another person, is legally competent to do so.


	2. Each individual executing any of the Documents on behalf of a party (other than the Company) is duly authorized to do so.


	3. Each of the parties (other than the Company) executing any of the Documents has duly and validly executed and delivered each of the
	Documents to which such party is a signatory, and such partys obligations set forth therein are legal, valid and binding and are enforceable in accordance with all stated terms.


	4. All Documents submitted to us as originals are authentic. The form and content of all Documents submitted to us as unexecuted drafts do not
	differ in any respect relevant to this opinion from the form and content of such Documents as executed and delivered. All Documents submitted to us as certified or photostatic copies conform to the original documents. All signatures on all Documents
	are genuine. All public records reviewed or relied upon by us or on our behalf are true and complete. All representations, warranties, statements and information contained in the Documents are true and complete. There has been no oral or written
	modification of or amendment to any of the Documents, and there has been no waiver of any provision of any of the Documents, by action or omission of the parties or otherwise.


	5. The Shares will not be issued or transferred in violation of the restrictions on transfer and ownership contained in Article XI of the
	Charter.


	Based upon the foregoing, and subject to the assumptions, limitations and qualifications stated herein, it is our opinion that:


	1. The Company is a corporation duly incorporated and validly existing under and by virtue of the laws of the State of Maryland and is in
	good standing with the SDAT.






	Annaly Capital Management, Inc.


	July 21, 2017


	Page 3


	 


	2. The issuance of the Shares has been duly authorized and, when and if delivered against
	payment therefor in accordance with the Registration Statement and the Resolutions, the Shares will be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.


	The foregoing opinion is limited to the laws of the State of Maryland and we do not express any opinion herein concerning any other law. We
	express no opinion as to compliance with any federal or state securities laws, including the securities laws of the State of Maryland, or as to federal or state laws regarding fraudulent transfers. To the extent that any matter as to which our
	opinion is expressed herein would be governed by the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Maryland, we do not express any opinion on such matter. The opinion expressed herein is subject to the effect of any judicial decision which may
	permit the introduction of parol evidence to modify the terms or the interpretation of agreements.


	The opinion expressed herein is
	limited to the matters specifically set forth herein and no other opinion shall be inferred beyond the matters expressly stated. We assume no obligation to supplement this opinion if any applicable law changes after the date hereof or if we become
	aware of any fact that might change the opinion expressed herein after the date hereof.


	This opinion is being furnished to you for
	submission to the Commission as an exhibit to the Companys Current Report on Form 8-K (the Current Report), which is incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement. We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an
	exhibit to the Current Report and the said incorporation by reference and to the use of the name of our firm therein. In giving this consent, we do not admit that we are within the category of persons whose consent is required by Section 7 of
	the Securities Act.

	Qualification as




	Real
	Estate Investment Trust



	Ladies and Gentlemen:


	We have acted as counsel to Annaly Capital Management, Inc., a Maryland corporation (the Company), in connection with the offer and
	sale of up to 69,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the Company pursuant to a prospectus supplement dated July 17, 2017 (the Prospectus Supplement) to a prospectus dated February 9, 2016 (the
	Prospectus), as part of a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-209447) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 9, 2016 (the Registration Statement). You have requested our opinion
	regarding certain U.S. federal income tax matters.


	In giving this opinion letter, we have examined, and with your consent, relied upon,
	the following:


	 




	 


	1.


	the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, and the Prospectus Supplement;




	 




	 


	2.


	the Companys Articles of Amendment and Restatement, as filed on February 4, 1997 with the Department of Assessments and Taxation of the State of Maryland, as amended and supplemented through the date hereof;




	 




	 


	3.


	the tax opinion issued by K&L Gates, dated as of July 11, 2016, regarding the Companys qualification as a real estate investment trust (a REIT) for U.S. federal income tax purposes (the
	Prior REIT Opinion); and




	 




	 


	4.


	such other documents as we have deemed necessary or appropriate for purposes of this opinion.

	In connection with the opinions rendered below, we have assumed, with your consent, that:


	1. each of the documents referred to above has been duly authorized, executed, and delivered; is authentic, if an original, or is
	accurate, if a copy; and has not been amended;


	2. during its taxable year ending December 31, 2017, and future taxable years, the
	Company has operated and will operate in a manner that will make the factual representations contained in a certificate, dated the date hereof and executed by a duly appointed officer of the Company (the Officers Certificate), true
	for such years;


	3. the Company will not make any amendments to its organizational documents after the date of this opinion that would
	affect its qualification as a REIT for any taxable year; and


	4. no action will be taken by the Company after the date hereof that would
	have the effect of altering the facts upon which the opinions set forth below are based.


	In connection with the opinions rendered below,
	we also have relied upon the correctness of the factual representations contained in the Officers Certificate and the factual matters discussed in the Prospectus and the Prospectus Supplement that relate to the Companys status as a REIT.
	No facts have come to our attention that would cause us to question the accuracy and completeness of such factual representations. Furthermore, where such factual representations involve terms defined in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
	(the Code), the Treasury regulations thereunder (the Regulations), published rulings of the Internal Revenue Service (the Service), or other relevant authority, we have reviewed with the individual making such
	representations the relevant provisions of the Code, the applicable Regulations and published administrative interpretations thereof.


	Based solely on the documents and assumptions set forth above, the representations set forth in the Officers Certificate, and the
	discussions in the Prospectus under the caption Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations and in the Prospectus Supplement under the caption Additional Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations (which are
	incorporated herein by reference), we are of the opinion that:


	(a) the Company qualified to be taxed as a REIT pursuant to sections 856
	through 860 of the Code for its taxable years ended December 31, 2013 through December 31, 2016, and the Companys organization and current and proposed method of operation will enable it to continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT
	under the Code for its taxable year ending December 31, 2017, and thereafter; and


	(b) the descriptions of the law and the legal
	conclusions in the Prospectus under the caption Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations and in the Prospectus Supplement under the caption Additional Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations are correct in all
	material respects.






	Annaly Capital Management, Inc.


	July 21, 2017


	Page 3


	 


	We will not review on a continuing basis the Companys compliance with the documents or
	assumptions set forth above, or the representations set forth in the Officers Certificate. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the actual results of the Companys operations for any given taxable year will satisfy the requirements
	for qualification and taxation as a REIT. Although we have made such inquiries and performed such investigations as we have deemed necessary to fulfill our professional responsibilities as counsel, we have not undertaken an independent investigation
	of all the facts referred to in this letter or the Officers Certificate. In particular, we note that the Company has engaged in transactions in connection with which we have not provided legal advice and may not have reviewed. Moreover, we
	note that we did not represent the Company as tax counsel prior to June 1, 2016.


	The foregoing opinions are based on current
	provisions of the Code, the Regulations, published administrative interpretations thereof, and published court decisions. The Service has not issued Regulations or administrative interpretations with respect to various provisions of the Code
	relating to REIT qualification. No assurance can be given that the law will not change in a way that will prevent the Company from qualifying as a REIT.


	The foregoing opinions are limited to the U.S. federal income tax matters addressed herein, and no other opinions are rendered with respect to
	other U.S. federal tax matters or to any issues arising under the tax laws of any other country, or any state or locality. We undertake no obligation to update the opinions expressed herein after the date of this letter. This opinion letter speaks
	only as of the date hereof. Except as provided in the next paragraph, this opinion letter may not be distributed, quoted in whole or in part or otherwise reproduced in any document, or filed with any governmental agency without our express written
	consent.

	We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Prospectus Supplement.
	We also consent to the references to Hunton & Williams LLP under the captions Additional Material Federal Income Tax Considerations and Legal Matters in the Prospectus Supplement. In giving this consent, we do not
	admit that we are in the category of persons whose consent is required by Section 7 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder by the SEC.
