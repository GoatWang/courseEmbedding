Brentwood Associates Raises $1.15 Billion for Sixth Private Equity 
      Fund




Investment strategy focused on category-defining brands with 
      exceptional customer loyalty and growth prospects






July 12, 2017 07:42 PM Eastern Daylight Time



LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Brentwood Associates, a leading Los Angeles-based private equity 
      investment firm (“Brentwood”), announced the final closing of Brentwood 
      Associates Private Equity VI, L.P. and parallel funds (“Fund VI”), with 
      $1.15 billion of capital commitments. Fund VI closed at its hard cap and 
      exceeded its target of $750 million. Fund VI is the largest fund raised 
      by Brentwood to date, and the firm now has over $2.4 billion in assets 
      under management. The new fund follows the strategy of its predecessor, 
      Brentwood Associates Fund V, L.P. and parallel funds, which closed at 
      its hard cap in November 2014 with total commitments of $688 million.
    


      “We are delighted with the results of our fundraising process,” said 
      Brentwood partner, Bill Barnum. “Our team is very appreciative of the 
      long-term support we’ve received from our existing limited partners, and 
      we are excited to welcome new investors to Fund VI. We value these 
      relationships and the confidence our partners have shown in our team and 
      investment strategy.”
    

      Brentwood’s investment strategy focuses on partnering with growing 
      category-defining brands, with exceptional customer loyalty and growth 
      prospects, where Brentwood can utilize its experience and resources to 
      realize untapped value. Brentwood is a value-added partner with 
      management in driving growth through improved branding, marketing 
      optimization, new product development, direct-to-consumer growth, 
      distribution expansion and optimization, and acquisitions.
    

      Fund VI generally will seek to make control-oriented equity investments 
      in companies with enterprise values between $50 million and $500 
      million, with a focus on buyouts, growth equity investments and minority 
      recapitalizations in the North American middle market. The firm is led 
      by its partners Bill Barnum, Roger Goddu, Steve Moore, Eric Reiter and 
      Rahul Aggarwal.
    

      Kirkland & Ellis LLP provided legal counsel, and Park Hill Group LLC 
      acted as an advisor and exclusive placement agent.

NEW YORK, Feb. 15, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- CS Strategic Partners, the exclusive dedicated secondary private equity arm of Credit Suisse and one of the leading secondary buyers of private equity limited partnership interests, today announced the final close of its most recent fund, CS Strategic Partners V, L.P.

Consistent with regulation, this capital includes over US $87 million committed by Credit Suisse and the Strategic Partner investment team.

SPV LBO Centric, SPV Real Estate and SPV Venture Secondary Funds began investing in the second half of 2011 and have to date already collectively invested or committed to invest approximately US $ 500 million to over 170 underlying funds in over 30 transactions. Strategic Partner's pipeline is robust, with significant transaction deal flow being generated by Strategic Partner's investment team as well as the entire Credit Suisse organization. The Fund is the fifth in a series of investment partnerships seeking capital appreciation through the purchase of secondary interests in high quality private equity funds from investors seeking liquidity.  Strategic Partners has built a market reputation of fair pricing, timely and seamless transaction execution, and confidentiality with sellers. 
Stephen Can, Global Head of Strategic Partners since its inception in 2000, said, "We are very pleased with our limited partner commitment to our fifth fund. From the start of its platform, Strategic Partners has raised over $11 billion of capital commitments, completed over 600 transactions, acquired over 1,400 limited partnership interests, and built a world class team currently consisting of 24 dedicated secondary investment professionals supported by over 50 accounting and product specialists.  We look forward to continuing to leverage our expertise in the secondary space and to building on our strong track record as 'secondary buyer of choice', by transacting on a fair, timely and confidential basis."
