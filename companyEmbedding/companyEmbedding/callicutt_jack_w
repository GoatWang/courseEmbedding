						 from   Galectin Therapeutics 











 
















































 

 




















 


NORCROSS, Ga., June 21, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Galectin Therapeutics (NASDAQ:   GALT), the leading developer of therapeutics that target galectin proteins to treat fibrosis and cancer, today announced the appointment of Jack W. Callicutt to the position of Chief Financial Officer, effective July 1, 2013.
Mr. Callicutt will lead the Company's financial activities, including financial reporting, accounting, risk management, public company governance, interaction with capital markets, and public and investor relations. As a member of the senior management team, Mr. Callicutt will play a key role in shaping corporate strategy as we advance key product assets in the clinic.  He will also help assure that the company has the financial resources to realize its vision for its pipeline of clinical development assets which is critical to create shareholder value.
"Jack's demonstrated leadership and deal-making capabilities coupled with his financial management experience and industry knowledge makes him an ideal fit with the needs of the company and further consolidates our leadership group in the Atlanta office. I am looking forward to working closely with Jack and am excited to add an individual of Jack's caliber to our management team," said Dr. Peter G. Traber, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Medical Officer of Galectin Therapeutics Inc. "I also wish to sincerely thank Mr. Thomas McGauley for his years of service to the company, including the last 14 months as acting CFO, and for agreeing to work closely with Jack to assure an orderly transition."
Mr. Callicutt has over 22 years of public and private company experience including more than a decade of audit, tax, and SEC registrant experience with a major accounting firm. He was most recently CFO for REACH Health, Inc., a telemedicine firm, where he completed a $4 MM private placement. Previous positions include CFO of Vystar Corporation, a public medical device company whose latex products are devoid of antigenic proteins, where he led all areas of financial reporting, accounting, treasury, risk management and administration and secured over $4.5 MM in financing. Previous experiences also include CFO roles at private companies including IVOX and Tikvah Therapeutics, and at Coratus Genetics, a publicly traded biopharmaceutical company. His broad background of experiences spanning a variety of technology intensive industries underpinned by a decade-long senior level role at Deloitte, positions him well to meaningfully contribute to the advancement of the company.
