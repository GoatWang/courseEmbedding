 Real estate recovery gets real

Michael V. Salm, Co-Head of Fixed Income; and Brett S. Kozlowski, CFA and Kevin F. Murphy, Portfolio Managers, June 25, 2014					

The U.S. housing market appears to be transitioning from a fast-paced recovery to a more mature expansion underpinned by a balanced supply-demand outlook. As a result of higher home prices and lower consumer indebtedness, U.S. homeowners in the aggregate now have more home equity than debt, underscoring a dramatic improvement in numerous housing-related indicators since 2011. These include a substantial reduction in the amount of underwater mortgages and a greater number of banks easing their lending standards.
 

In our view, stable U.S. population growth, combined with new financial regulations affecting the mortgage market, suggest that home prices are likely to grow steadily from current levels. Recent Consumer Price Index data showed that the housing component of the index was rising, indicating that demand for housing is growing, which puts upward pressure on rents and home prices.
Large-market commercial real estate prices rose significantly in 2013 and are now higher than they were in 2007, prior to the start of the liquidity crisis. Commercial real estate cash flow trends are improving, which has contributed to tighter CMBS spreads [less of a yield advantage over Treasuries] and increased new issuance.

	Securities, documents or other written instruments shall be deemed to mean original (including original counterparts) negotiable or non-negotiable agreements which in and of themselves represent an equitable interest, ownership, or debt, including an assignment thereof which instruments are in the ordinary course of business, transferable by delivery of such agreements with any necessary endorsement or assignment.




	The word "counterfeited" as used in this Insuring Agreement shall be deemed to mean any security, document or other written instrument which is intended to deceive and to be taken for an original.

	For having refused to pay any check or draft made or drawn by any customer, shareholder or subscriber of the Insured or any Authorized Representative of such customer, shareholder or subscriber.




	(I) UNCOLLECTIBLE ITEMS OF DEPOSIT




	Loss resulting from payments of dividends or fund shares, or withdrawals permitted from any customer's, shareholder's or subscriber's account based upon Uncollectible Items of Deposit of a customer, shareholder or subscriber credited by the Insured or the Insured's agent to such customer's, shareholder's or subscriber's Mutual Fund Account; or




	loss resulting from any Item of Deposit processed through an Automated Clearing House which is reversed by the customer, shareholder or subscriber and deemed uncollectible by the Insured.

	GENERAL AGREEMENTS


	 





	 



	A. ADDITIONAL OFFICES OR EMPLOYEES-CONSOLIDATION OR MERGER-NOTICE




	1. If the Insured shall, while this bond is in force, establish any additional office or offices, such office or offices shall be automatically covered hereunder from the dates of their establishment, respectively. No notice to the Underwriter of an increase during any premium period in the number of offices or in the number of Employees at any of the offices covered hereunder need be given and no additional premium need be paid for the remainder of such premium period.




	2. If an Investment Company, named as Insured herein, shall, while this bond is in force, merge or consolidate with, or purchase the assets of another institution, coverage for such acquisition shall apply automatically from the date of acquisition. The Insured shall notify the Underwriter of such acquisition within 60 days of said date, and an additional premium shall be computed only if such acquisition involves additional offices or employees.




	B. WARRANTY




	No statement made by or on behalf of the Insured, whether contained in the application or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a warranty of anything except that it is true to the best of the knowledge and belief of the person making the statement.




	C. COURT COSTS AND ATTORNEYS' FEES




	(Applicable to all Insuring Agreements or Coverages now or hereafter forming part of this bond)




	The Underwriter will indemnify the Insured against court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred and paid by the Insured in defense, whether or not successful, whether or not fully litigated on the merits and whether or not settled of any suit or legal proceeding brought against the Insured to enforce the Insured's liability or alleged liability on account of any loss, claim or dam age which, if established against the Insured, would constitute a loss sustained by the Insured covered under the terms of this bond provided, however, that with respect to Insuring Agreement (A) this indemnity shall


	apply only in the event that




	(1) an Employee admits to being guilty of any dishonest or fraudulent act(s), including Larceny or Embezzlement; or




	(2) an Employee is adjudicated to be guilty of any dishonest or fraudulent act(s), including Larceny or Embezzlement;




	(3) in the absence of (1) or (2) above an arbitration panel agrees, after a review of an agreed statement of facts, that an Employee would be found guilty of dishonesty if such Employee were prosecuted.




	The Insured shall promptly give notice to the Underwriter of any such suit or legal proceeding and at the request of the Underwriter shall furnish it with copies of all pleadings and other papers therein. At the Underwriter's election the Insured shall permit the Underwriter to conduct the defense of such suit or legal proceeding, in the Insured's name, through attorneys of the Underwriter's selection. In such event, the Insured shall give all reasonable information and assistance which the Underwriter shall deem necessary to the proper defense of such suit or legal proceeding.




	If the amount of the Insured's liability or alleged liability is greater than the amount recoverable under this bond, or if a Deductible Amount is applicable, or both, the liability of the Underwriter under this General Agreement is limited to the proportion of court costs and attorneys' fees incurred and paid by the Insured or by the Underwriter that the amount recoverable under this bond bears to the total of such amount plus the amount which is not so recoverable. Such indemnity shall be in addition to the Limit of Liability for the applicable Insuring Agreement or Coverage.




	D. FORMER EMPLOYEE




	Acts of an Employee, as defined in this bond, are covered under Insuring Agreement (A) only while the Employee is in the Insured's employ. Should loss involving a former Employee of the Insured be discovered subsequent to the termination of employment, coverage would still apply under Insuring Agreement (A) if the direct proximate cause of the loss occurred while the former Employee performed duties within the scope of his/her employment.

	SECTION 4. LOSS-NOTICE-PROOF-LEGAL


	PROCEEDINGS




	This bond is for the use and benefit only of the Insured named in the Declarations and the Underwriter shall not be liable hereunder for













	41206 (9/84)

	 



	7

	 



	© All rights reserved.

	 





	 










	loss sustained by anyone other than the Insured unless the Insured, in its sole discretion and at its option, shall include such loss in the Insured's proof of loss. At the earliest practicable moment after discovery of any loss hereunder the Insured shall give the Underwriter written notice thereof and shall also within six months after such discovery furnish to the Underwriter affirmative proof of loss with full particulars. If claim is made under this bond for loss of securities or shares, the Underwriter shall not be liable unless each of such securities or shares is identified in such proof of loss by a certificate or bond number or, where such securities or shares are uncertificated, by such identification means as agreed to by the Underwriter. The Underwriter shall have thirty days after notice and proof of loss within which to investigate the claim, but where the loss is clear and undisputed, settlement shall be made within forty-eight hours; and this shall apply notwithstanding the loss is made up wholly or in part of securities of which duplicates may be obtained. Legal proceedings for recovery of any loss hereunder shall not be brought prior to the expiration of sixty days after such proof of loss is filed with the Underwriter nor after the expiration of twenty-four months from the discovery of such loss, except that any action or proceeding to recover hereunder on account of any judgment against the Insured in any suit mentioned in General Agreement C or to recover attorneys' fees paid in any such suit, shall be begun within twenty-four months from the date upon which the judgment in such suit shall become final. If any limitation embodied in this bond is prohibited by any law controlling the construction hereof, such limitation shall be deemed to be amended so as to be equal to the minimum period of limitation permitted by such law.




	Discovery occurs when the Insured




	(a) becomes aware of facts, or




	(b) receives written notice of an actual or potential claim by a third party which alleges that the Insured is liable under circumstance




	which would cause a reasonable person to assume that a loss covered by the bond has been or will be incurred even though the exact amount or details of loss may not be then known.




	SECTION 5. VALUATION OF PROPERTY




	The value of any Property, except books of


	accounts or other records used by the Insured in the conduct of its business, for the loss of which a claim shall be made hereunder, shall be determined by the average market value of such Property on the business day next preceding the discovery of such loss; provided, however, that the value of any Property replaced by the Insured prior to the payment of claim therefor shall be the actual market value at the time of replacement; and further provided that in case of a loss or misplacement of interim certificates, warrants, rights, or other securities, the production which is necessary to the exercise of subscription, conversion, redemption or deposit privileges, the value thereof shall be the market value of such privileges immediately preceding the expiration thereof if said loss or misplacement is not discovered until after their expiration. If no market price is quoted for such Property or for such privileges, the value shall be fixed by agreement between the parties or by arbitration.




	In case of any loss or damage to Property consisting of books of accounts or other records used by the Insured in the conduct of its business, the Underwriter shall be liable under this bond only if such books or records are actually reproduced and then for not more than the cost of blank books, blank pages or other materials plus the cost of labor for the actual transcription or copying of data which shall have been furnished by the Insured in order to reproduce such books and other records.




	SECTION 6. VALUATION OF PREMISES AND


	FURNISHINGS




	In case of damage to any office of the Insured, or loss of or damage to the furnishings, fixtures, stationery, supplies, equipment, safes or vaults therein, the Underwriter shall not be liable for more than the actual cash value thereof, or for more than the actual cost of their replacement or repair. The Underwriter may, at its election, pay such actual cash value or make such replacement or repair. If the Underwriter and the Insured cannot agree upon such cash value or such cost of replacement or repair, such shall be determined by arbitration.




	SECTION 7. LOST SECURITIES




	If the Insured shall sustain a loss of securities the total value of which is in excess of the limit stated in Item 3 of the Declarations of this bond, the liability of the Underwriter shall

	8

	 



	© All rights reserved.

	 





	 










	be limited to payment for, or duplication of, securities having value equal to the limit stated in Item 3 of the Declarations of this bond.




	If the Underwriter shall make payment to the Insured for any loss of securities, the Insured shall thereupon assign to the Underwriter all of the Insured's rights, title and interests in and to said securities.




	With respect to securities the value of which do not exceed the Deductible Amount (at the time of the discovery of the loss) and for which the Underwriter may at its sole discretion and option and at the request of the Insured issue a Lost Instrument Bond or Bonds to effect replacement thereof, the Insured will pay the usual premium charged therefor and will indemnify the Underwriter against all loss or expense that the Underwriter may sustain because of the issuance of such Lost Instrument Bond or Bonds.




	With respect to securities the value of which exceeds the Deductible Amount (at the time of discovery of the loss) and for which the Underwriter may issue or arrange for the issuance of a Lost Instrument Bond or Bonds to effect replacement thereof, the Insured agrees that it will pay as premium therefor a proportion of the usual premium charged therefor, said proportion being equal to the percentage that the Deductible Amount bears to the value of the securities upon discovery of the loss, and that it will indemnify the issuer of said Lost Instrument Bond or Bonds against all loss and expense that is not recoverable from the Underwriter under the terms and conditions of this INVESTMENT COMPANY BLANKET BOND subject to the Limit of Liability hereunder.




	SECTION 8. SALVAGE




	In case of recovery, whether made by the Insured or by the Underwriter, on account of any loss in excess of the Limit of Liability hereunder plus the Deductible Amount applicable to such loss from any source other than suretyship, insurance, reinsurance, security or indemnity taken by or for the benefit of the Underwriter, the net amount of such recovery, less the actual costs and expenses of making same, shall be applied to reimburse the Insured in full for the excess portion of such loss, and the remainder, if any, shall be paid first in reimbursement of the Underwriter and thereafter in reimbursement of the Insured for that part of


	such loss within the Deductible Amount. The Insured shall execute all necessary papers to secure to the Underwriter the rights provided for herein.




	SECTION 9. NON-REDUCTION AND NON-ACCUMULATION OF LIABILITY AND TOTAL LIABILITY




	At all times prior to termination hereof this bond shall continue in force for the limit stated in the applicable sections of Item 3 of the Declarations of this bond notwithstanding any previous loss for which the Underwriter may have paid or be liable to pay hereunder; PROVIDED, however, that regardless of the number of years this bond shall continue in force and the number of premiums which shall be payable or paid, the liability of the Underwriter under this bond with respect to all loss resulting from




	(a) any one act of burglary, robbery or holdup, or attempt thereat, in which no Partner or Employee is concerned or implicated shall be deemed to be one loss, or




	(b) any one unintentional or negligent act on the part of any one person resulting in damage to or destruction or misplacement of Property, shall be deemed to be one loss, or




	(c) all wrongful acts, other than those specified in (a) above, of any one person shall be deemed to be one loss, or




	(d) all wrongful acts, other than those specified in (a) above, of one or more persons (which dishonest act(s) or act(s) of Larceny or Embezzlement include, but are not limited to, the failure of an Employee to report such acts of others) whose dishonest act or acts intentionally or unintentionally, knowingly or unknowingly, directly or indirectly, aid or aids in any way, or permits the continuation of, the dishonest act or acts of any other person or persons shall be deemed to be one loss with the act or acts of the persons aided, or




	(e) any one casualty or event other than those specified in (a), (b), (c) or (d) preceding, shall be deemed to be one loss, and




	shall be limited to the applicable Limit of Liability stated in Item 3 of the Declarations of this bond irrespective of the total amount of such loss or losses and shall not be cumulative in amounts from year to year or

	Sub-section (c) is not applicable to any situation to which the language of sub-section (d) applies.




	SECTION 10. LIMIT OF LIABILITY




	With respect to any loss set forth in the PROVIDED clause of Section 9 of this bond which is recoverable or recovered in whole or in part under any other bonds or policies issued by the Underwriter to the Insured or to any predecessor in interest of the Insured and terminated or cancelled or allowed to expire and in which the period for discovery has not expired at the time any such loss thereunder is discovered, the total liability of the Underwriter under this bond and under other bonds or policies shall not exceed, in the aggregate, the amount carried hereunder on such loss or the amount available to the Insured under such other bonds or policies, as limited by the terms and conditions thereof, for any such loss if the latter amount be the larger.




	SECTION 11. OTHER INSURANCE




	If the Insured shall hold, as indemnity against any loss covered hereunder, any valid and enforceable insurance or suretyship, the Underwriter shall be liable hereunder only for such amount of such loss which is in excess of the amount of such other insurance or suretyship, not exceeding, however, the Limit of Liability of this bond applicable to such loss.

	This bond does not afford coverage in favor of such Corporations or Exchanges or any nominee in whose name is registered any security included within the systems for the central handling of securities established and maintained by such Corporations, and upon payment to the Insured by the Underwriter on account of any loss(es) within the systems, an assignment of such of the Insured's rights and causes of action as it may have against such Corporations or Exchanges shall to the extent of such payment, be given by the Insured to the Underwriter, and the Insured shall execute all papers necessary to secure to the Underwriter the rights provided for herein.

	THESE DECLARATIONS, TOGETHER WITH THE COMPLETED AND SIGNED APPLICATION AND THE POLICY




	FORM ATTACHED HERETO, CONSTITUTE THE INSURANCE POLICY.



















	I. INSURING CLAUSE





	The Insurer agrees to provide insurance coverage to the Insureds in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Followed Policy, except as otherwise provided herein.





	II. LIMIT OF LIABILITY





	A. It is expressly agreed that liability for any covered Loss shall attach to the Insurer only after:




	1. the insurer(s) of the Underlying Policies;



	2. another insurer;



	3. the Insureds; or,



	4. any other person or entity,




	shall have paid the full amount of the Underlying Limit and the full amount of the retention, if any, applicable to the primary Underlying Policy has been paid. Nothing in this subsection shall preclude the Insurer of this Policy from considering any of the other terms, conditions, limitations and exclusions of this Policy or the Followed Policy, in determining whether any Loss is covered under this Policy. The Insurer shall then be liable to pay only covered Loss in excess of such Underlying Limit up to its Aggregate Limit of Liability as set forth in Item 5 of the Declarations.




	B. In the event and only in the event of the reduction or exhaustion of the Underlying Limit by reason of the payment of Loss otherwise covered hereunder, then this policy shall, subject to the Aggregate Limit of Liability set forth in Item 5 of the Declarations: (i) in the event of reduction, pay excess of the reduced Underlying Limit, and (ii) in the event of exhaustion, continue in force as primary insurance; provided always that in the latter event this policy shall only pay excess of the retention applicable to the exhausted primary Underlying Policy, which retention shall be applied to any subsequent Loss in the same manner as specified in such primary Underlying Policy.





	III. DEFINITIONS





	A. The terms “Insurer”, “Followed Policy”, “Underlying Policies”, “Policy Period” and “Aggregate Limit of Liability” have the meanings attributed to them in the Declarations.




	B. The term “Underlying Limit” means an amount equal to the aggregate of all limits of liability as set forth in Item 8 of the Declarations for all Underlying Policies, plus the uninsured retention, if any, applicable to the Underlying Policy.





	IV. UNDERLYING INSURANCE





	A. This policy is subject to the same representations as are contained in the Application for the Followed Policy and the same terms, definitions, conditions, exclusions and limitations (except as regards the premium, the limits of liability, the policy period and except as otherwise provided herein) as are contained in or as may be added to the Followed Policy. In no event shall this policy grant broader coverage than would be provided by the Followed Policy.




	B. If the Underlying Policies are not maintained in full effect during the Policy Period, the Insurer shall not be liable under this policy to a greater extent than it would have been had such Underlying Policies been so maintained.




	C. If during the Policy Period or any Discovery Period the terms and conditions of the Followed Policy are changed in any manner, the Insureds shall give to the Insurer written notice of the full particulars thereof as













	soon as practicable. This policy shall become subject to any such changes, provided that the Insureds shall pay any additional premium reasonably required by the Insurer for such changes.




	If the terms or conditions of the Followed Policy are changed in any manner or differ in any respect from the binder for such Followed Policy, the Insurer shall have 30 days after receipt of the Followed Policy containing such changes to provide written objection to such changes. If such written objection is provided, such changes shall not apply to this policy and no coverage related to such changes shall apply. If such written objection is not provided within the time frame captioned above, such changes shall apply.




	D. This policy shall follow the terms and conditions of any Prior or Pending Proceeding Exclusion, Prior or Pending Litigation Exclusion, or similar exclusion in the Followed Policy, but with respect to the application of such exclusion to this policy, the Prior or Pending Proceeding Date set forth in Item 9 of the Declarations shall apply.





	V. GENERAL CONDITIONS





	A. Discovery Period Premium: If the Insureds elect a discovery period or extended reporting period (“Discovery Period”) as set forth in the Followed Policy following the cancellation or non-renewal of this policy, the Insureds shall pay to the Insurer the additional premium set forth in Item 6 of the Declarations.




	B. Notice: All notices under this policy shall be given as provided in the Followed Policy and shall be properly addressed to the appropriate party at the respective address as shown in the Declarations.




	C. Claim Participation: The Insurer shall be given the opportunity to effectively associate with the Insureds in the investigation, settlement or defense of any Claim even if the Underlying Limit has not been exhausted.

	This Policyholder Notice shall not be construed as part of your policy and no coverage is provided by this Policyholder Notice nor can it be construed to replace any provisions of your policy. You should read your policy and review your Declarations page for complete information on the coverages you are provided.




	This Notice provides information concerning possible impact on your insurance coverage due to directives issued by OFAC.



	Please read this Notice carefully.





	The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) administers and enforces sanctions policy, based on Presidential declarations of “national emergency”. OFAC has identified and listed numerous:





	●



	Foreign agents;




	●



	Front organizations;




	●



	Terrorists;




	●



	Terrorist organizations; and




	●



	Narcotics traffickers;




	as “Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons”. This list can be located on the United States Treasury’s web site – http//www.treas.gov/ofac.




	In accordance with OFAC regulations, if it is determined that you or any other insured, or any person or entity claiming the benefits of this insurance has violated U.S. sanctions law or is a Specially Designated National and Blocked Person, as identified by OFAC, this insurance will be considered a blocked or frozen contract and all provisions of this insurance are immediately subject to OFAC. When an insurance policy is considered to be such a blocked or frozen contract, no payments nor premium refunds may be made without authorization from OFAC. Other limitations on the premiums and payments also apply.

	POLICYHOLDER








	DISCLOSURE NOTICE
	OF








	TERRORISM INSURANCE
	COVERAGE








	(for policies with no terrorism
	exclusion or sublimit)







	You are
	hereby notified that, under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (the "Act"),
	effective






	December
	26, 2007, this policy makes available to you insurance for losses arising
	out of






	certain
	acts of terrorism. Terrorism is defined as any act certified by the
	Secretary of the






	Treasury, in concurrence with the
	Secretary of State and the Attorney General of the






	United
	States, to be an act of terrorism; to be a violent act or an act that is
	dangerous to






	human
	life, property or infrastructure; to have resulted in damage within the
	United






	States,
	or outside the United States in the case of an air carrier or vessel or
	the premises






	of a
	United States Mission; and to have been committed by an individual or
	individuals as






	part of
	an effort to coerce the civilian population of the United States or to
	influence the






	policy
	or affect the conduct of the United States Government by
	coercion.





	 





	You
	should know that the insurance provided by your policy for losses caused
	by acts of






	terrorism is partially reimbursed by
	the United States under the formula set forth in the






	Act.
	Under this formula, the United States pays 85% of covered terrorism losses
	that






	exceed
	the statutorily established deductible to be paid by the insurance
	company






	providing the coverage.





	 





	However,
	if aggregate insured losses attributable to terrorist acts certified under
	the Act






	exceed
	$100 billion in a Program Year (January 1 through December 31), the
	Treasury






	shall
	not make any payment for any portion of the amount of such losses that
	exceeds






	$100
	billion.






	 



	10-02-1281 (Ed. 1/2003)






	 















	If
	aggregate insured losses attributable to terrorist acts certified under
	the Act exceed






	$100
	billion in a Program Year (January 1 through December 31) and we have met
	our






	insurer
	deductible under the Act, we shall not be liable for the payment of any
	portion of






	the
	amount of such losses that exceeds $100 billion, and in such case insured
	losses up






	to that
	amount are subject to pro rata allocation in accordance with
	procedures






	established by the Secretary of the
	Treasury.





	 





	The
	portion of your policy's annual premium that is attributable to insurance
	for such acts






	of
	terrorism is: $



	-0-.






	 





	If you
	have any questions about this notice, please contact your agent or

	HOW




	TO REPORT LOSSES, CLAIMS, OR POTENTIAL CLAIMS TO TRAVELERS



	 







	 



	Reporting new losses, claims, or potential claims promptly can be critical. It helps to resolve covered losses or claims as quickly as possible and often reduces the overall cost. Prompt reporting:






	●


	better protects the interests of all parties;






	●


	helps Travelers to try to resolve losses or claims more quickly; and






	●


	often reduces the overall cost of a loss or claim - losses or claims reported more than five days after they happen cost on average 35% more than those reported earlier.




	Report losses, claims, or potential claims to Travelers easily and quickly by fax, US mail, or email.

	AGREEMENT


	 





	 



	WHEREAS the undersigned parties have determined that it is in their best interests to enter into a joint fidelity bond, which bond is intended to meet the applicable standards of Rule 17g-1 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “Act”); and




	WHEREAS Rule 17g-1 under the Act requires that each registered management investment company entering into a joint fidelity bond shall agree with the other named insureds as to the allocation of the recovery received under the joint bond as a result of a loss sustained by the registered management investment company and one or more of the other named insureds.




	NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and of other good and valuable consideration, the undersigned parties hereby agree as follows:




	1. In the event recovery is received under the policy as a result of a loss sustained by one of the registered management investment companies listed on



	Exhibit A



	, as revised from time to time, and one or more other named insureds, the registered management investment company shall receive an equitable and proportionate share of the recovery, but at least equal to the amount it would have received had it provided and maintained a single insured bond with the minimum coverage required under Rule 17g-1 under the Act.




	2. The list of registered management investment companies in Exhibit A may be revised by adding, removing or renaming funds to reflect the creation, termination or renaming, respectively, of the registered management investment companies, or any series thereof, of the Putnam Funds, effective upon the execution of such revised Exhibit A by any officer of the Putnam Funds. Re-execution of this Agreement by other parties to this Agreement shall not be required for such a revision to Exhibit A to become effective.




	3. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of The Commonwealth of Massachusetts.




	4. A copy of the Declaration of Trust of each of the registered management investment companies listed on Exhibit A, as revised from time to time, is on file with the Secretary of The Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and notice is hereby given that this instrument is executed on behalf of the Trustees of each such registered management investment company as Trustees and not individually and that the obligations of or arising out of this instrument are not binding upon any of the Trustees, officers or shareholders individually but are binding only upon the assets and property of the registered management investment company.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.

Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
