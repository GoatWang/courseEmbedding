History[edit]
The asset management division of State Street Bank was founded in 1978 in Boston, Massachusetts. Its first three products were a domestic index fund, an international index fund (based on the MSCI EAFE index), and a short-term investment fund. By 1989 the division had $53 billion (USD) in assets under management.
In 1990 State Street Global Advisors was formed as a separate entity from State Street Bank with the mission of expanding globally. SSGA opened its first global office in London. By 1994 SSGA had offices in Brussels, Hong Kong, Toronto, Paris, Sydney, Tokyo, Dubai, San Francisco, Montreal, and Atlanta. Between 1995 and 1999 five more offices opened in Munich, Zürich, Santiago, Singapore, and Chicago. From 2000 to 2007 SSGA set up operations in Milan, Bangalore and Melbourne.
SSGA invented the investment vehicle known as the exchange-traded fund (ETF) in 1993 with the introduction of the S&P 500 SPDR product (Ticker: NYSE Arca: SPY),[2] which is traded on the American Stock Exchange. SSGA is the number two ETF manager in the world second only to BlackRock.[3]
Assets under management climbed to $161 billion (USD) in 1994 and more than quadrupled to $667 billion by 1999.
Since 2000, SSGA has focused on increasing its client base outside of the United States and developing actively managed investment products. As of 2006, one-third of assets under management were from non-US investors.
In 2003, SSGA's Boston office moved to the newly completed State Street Financial Center building at One Lincoln Street.
SSGA launched the first foreign real estate ETF in 2006 (Ticker: NYSE Arca: RWX),[4] which provides investors in the US an easy way to access the international housing and commercial development markets.
In January 2011, SSGA completed its acquisition of Bank of Ireland Asset Management (BIAM). The acquisition was first announced in October 2010 for approximately €57 million. The acquisition enhances SSGA’s range of investment management solutions and expands State Street’s overall presence in Ireland where it has been serving institutional clients for 15 years.[5]




Fearless Girl statue in Manhattan's Financial District


For March 2017, State Street Global Advisors commissioned a statue, Fearless Girl by Kristen Visbal, and located it temporarily in the Financial District, Manhattan, in front of the Wall Street icon Charging Bull. The statue is an advertisement for an index fund which comprises gender diverse companies that have a higher percentage of women among their senior leadership.[6] While some have seen it as an encouragement of women in business, some women criticized the statue as "corporate feminism" that violated their own feminist principles.[7][8][9]
Products and services[edit]
SSGA creates customized investment strategies for institutions. SSGA manages the assets for clients by setting up commingled funds (otherwise known as common trust funds).
In addition to institutional products, SSGA has 46 ETF investment products in the US market, as of March 2007. The ETFs track international and domestic indices based on market capitalization, investment style, sector, industry, or commodity. ETF products are also available in other parts of the world such as Belgium, France, Hong Kong, and Singapore under the streetTracks brand.
SSGA has 26 Mutual Fund products divided by investment type: money markets, bonds, equities, and diversified funds of funds (also known as life style funds).
SSGA partners with seven companies in various markets to produce local investment strategies for clients. They are Advanced Investment Partners; Asian Direct Capital Management; GovernanceMetrics International (GMI); Innovest Strategic Value Advisors, Inc.; Rexiter Capital Management Limited; Shott Capital Management, LLC; SSARIS Advisors, LLC; The Tuckerman Group, LLC; and Wilton Asset Management, LLC.
Lawsuits[edit]
In October, 2007, several pension funds sued State Street Corp. for the alleged mishandling of several bond funds managed by SSGA.[10]
In 2008, State Street Bank was sued by Trust Co. for Fixed Income Funds Investment.[11] The case was settled in 2010.
In April 2009, a class action suit was filed against State Street, alleging SSGA chose illiquid, leveraged, and risky securities in their short-term, liquid fund products.[12]

Important Information


      Investing involves risk including the risk of loss of principal.
    

ETFs trade like stocks, are subject to investment risk, fluctuate 
      in market value and may trade at prices above or below the ETFs net 
      asset value. Brokerage commissions and ETF expenses will reduce returns.
    

      In general, ETFs can be expected to move up or down in value with the 
      value of the applicable index. Although ETFs may be bought and sold on 
      the exchange through any brokerage account, ETFs are not individually 
      redeemable from the Fund. Investors may acquire ETFs and tender them for 
      redemption through the Fund in Creation Unit Aggregations only, please 
      see the prospectus for more details.All ETFs are subject to risk, 
      including possible loss of principal.
    

Sector ETF products are also subject to sector risk and 
      non-diversification risk, which generally result in greater price 
      fluctuations than the overall market.
    

Select Sector SPDR Funds bear a higher level of risk than more 
      broadly diversified funds.
    

Non-diversified funds that focus on a relatively small number of 
      securities tend to be more volatile than diversified funds and the 
      market as a whole.
    

Equity securities may fluctuate in value in response to the 
      activities of individual companies and general market and economic 
      conditions.
    

      While the shares of ETFs are tradable on secondary markets, they may not 
      readily trade in all market conditions and may trade at significant 
      discounts in periods of market stress.

State Street and State Street Global Advisors (SSGA) do not conduct job interviews via non-State Street email, instant messaging or chat rooms.

These scams usually have one of more of the following characteristics:

They attempt first contact via email from a public domain or via a text message.
They attempt to perform an online interview via common web services.
They may impersonate State Street or SSGA individuals during the process.
They may send a check and ask for the funds to be deposited and wired to another location for the purchase of home office equipment.
They may use the State Street or SSGA trademark and logo in the process.

If you have been contacted under these circumstances please report the activity to the Internet Crime Complaint Center, which is a partnership among the Federal Bureau of investigation (FBI), the National White Collar Crime Center (NW3C), and the Bureau of Justice Assistance (BIA), at www.ic3.gov.

History[edit]
The asset management division of State Street Bank was founded in 1978 in Boston, Massachusetts. Its first three products were a domestic index fund, an international index fund (based on the MSCI EAFE index), and a short-term investment fund. By 1989 the division had $53 billion (USD) in assets under management.
In 1990 State Street Global Advisors was formed as a separate entity from State Street Bank with the mission of expanding globally. SSGA opened its first global office in London. By 1994 SSGA had offices in Brussels, Hong Kong, Toronto, Paris, Sydney, Tokyo, Dubai, San Francisco, Montreal, and Atlanta. Between 1995 and 1999 five more offices opened in Munich, Zürich, Santiago, Singapore, and Chicago. From 2000 to 2007 SSGA set up operations in Milan, Bangalore and Melbourne.
SSGA invented the investment vehicle known as the exchange-traded fund (ETF) in 1993 with the introduction of the S&P 500 SPDR product (Ticker: NYSE Arca: SPY),[2] which is traded on the American Stock Exchange. SSGA is the number two ETF manager in the world second only to BlackRock.[3]
Assets under management climbed to $161 billion (USD) in 1994 and more than quadrupled to $667 billion by 1999.
Since 2000, SSGA has focused on increasing its client base outside of the United States and developing actively managed investment products. As of 2006, one-third of assets under management were from non-US investors.
In 2003, SSGA's Boston office moved to the newly completed State Street Financial Center building at One Lincoln Street.
SSGA launched the first foreign real estate ETF in 2006 (Ticker: NYSE Arca: RWX),[4] which provides investors in the US an easy way to access the international housing and commercial development markets.
In January 2011, SSGA completed its acquisition of Bank of Ireland Asset Management (BIAM). The acquisition was first announced in October 2010 for approximately €57 million. The acquisition enhances SSGA’s range of investment management solutions and expands State Street’s overall presence in Ireland where it has been serving institutional clients for 15 years.[5]




Fearless Girl statue in Manhattan's Financial District


For March 2017, State Street Global Advisors commissioned a statue, Fearless Girl by Kristen Visbal, and located it temporarily in the Financial District, Manhattan, in front of the Wall Street icon Charging Bull. The statue is an advertisement for an index fund which comprises gender diverse companies that have a higher percentage of women among their senior leadership.[6] While some have seen it as an encouragement of women in business, some women criticized the statue as "corporate feminism" that violated their own feminist principles.[7][8][9]
Products and services[edit]
SSGA creates customized investment strategies for institutions. SSGA manages the assets for clients by setting up commingled funds (otherwise known as common trust funds).
In addition to institutional products, SSGA has 46 ETF investment products in the US market, as of March 2007. The ETFs track international and domestic indices based on market capitalization, investment style, sector, industry, or commodity. ETF products are also available in other parts of the world such as Belgium, France, Hong Kong, and Singapore under the streetTracks brand.
SSGA has 26 Mutual Fund products divided by investment type: money markets, bonds, equities, and diversified funds of funds (also known as life style funds).
SSGA partners with seven companies in various markets to produce local investment strategies for clients. They are Advanced Investment Partners; Asian Direct Capital Management; GovernanceMetrics International (GMI); Innovest Strategic Value Advisors, Inc.; Rexiter Capital Management Limited; Shott Capital Management, LLC; SSARIS Advisors, LLC; The Tuckerman Group, LLC; and Wilton Asset Management, LLC.
Lawsuits[edit]
In October, 2007, several pension funds sued State Street Corp. for the alleged mishandling of several bond funds managed by SSGA.[10]
In 2008, State Street Bank was sued by Trust Co. for Fixed Income Funds Investment.[11] The case was settled in 2010.
In April 2009, a class action suit was filed against State Street, alleging SSGA chose illiquid, leveraged, and risky securities in their short-term, liquid fund products.[12]

Both will be based in Boston. SSGA is a global leader in exchange traded funds, with $558 billion in ETF assets under management.1“Our global SPDR ETF business has a strong track record of product innovation, having introduced the first US listed ETF more than two decades ago, and launched numerous ‘world firsts’ since,” said Rory Tobin, co-head of the global SPDR business. “As our business has expanded and matured, so too have the responsibilities of our product and marketing teams. Both Noel and Seth have strong track records of developing ETF products consistent with client and regulatory requirements. We are delighted to welcome them both to the team, and we look forward to their leadership as we evolve and grow our Global SPDR ETF business.”In this newly created role, Archard will be responsible for product strategy, innovation, range and lifecycle management for the global SPDR ETF business. He will report in to Cyrus Taraporevala, head of the global institutional group, and Tobin. Archard brings a wealth of knowledge with more than 20 years’ experience in the global asset management industry. Most recently, he was country head of BlackRock in Canada tasked with growing the company across all business lines within this market. Prior to this, Archard held positions at Blackrock and Vanguard, helping to build and establish their ETF programs. He is a graduate of Northwestern University and a CFA Charterholder.Also in a newly created role, Morrison will be responsible for all marketing activities across the SPDR business in North America, EMEA and APAC. He will report in to Nick Good, co-head of the global SPDR business, and Stephen Tisdalle, chief marketing officer of SSGA. “Both of these new roles demonstrate our commitment to expanding the reach and relevancy of SPDR value-added services and our broad range of ETF investment capabilities to institutional and intermediary clients,” said Good. Additionally Tisdalle commented, “Our ETF business is embracing innovative marketing programs that communicate our perspectives and insights to help investors make informed decisions about their portfolios.”Morrison joins SSGA from Vanguard where he served as head of Flagship Business Development Group, the high net-worth sales group for their US Retail business. Prior to this, Seth was head of Vanguard’s International Marketing team.
