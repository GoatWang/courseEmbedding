JOIN THE LISTClickFIND A STOREUnderstanding Walter Mosleyby Larson, Jennifer"Walter Mosley is perhaps best known for his first published mystery, Devil in a Blue Dress, which became the basis for the 1995 movie of the same name featuring Denzel Washington. Mosley has since written more than forty books across an impressive expanse of genres including, but not limited to, nonfiction, science fiction, drama, and even young adult fiction, garnering him many honors including an O'Henry Award, an Anisfield-Wolf Book Award, a Grammy Award, a Pen Center Lifetime Achievement Award, and two NAACP Image Awards for Outstanding Literary Work in Fiction. In Understanding Walter Mosley, Jennifer Larson considers Mosley's corpus as a whole to help readers more fully understand the evolution of his literary agenda.  All Mosley's texts feature his trademark accessibility as well as his penchant for creating narratives that both entertain and instruct. Larson examines how Mosley's writing interrogates, complicates, and contextualizes recurring moral, social, and even personal questions. She also considers the possible roots of Mosley's enduring popularity with a diverse group of readers. Larson then traces key themes and claims throughout the Easy Rawlins series to show how Mosley's beloved hero offers unique perspectives on race, class, and masculinity in the mid- to late twentieth century; explores the ways in which Fearless Jones, Mosley's second detective, both builds on and diverges from his predecessor's character; and looks at how the works featuring Leonid McGill, Mosley's junior detective, center on understanding the complex relationship between present-day social dilemmas and the personal as well as the communal past. Regarding Mosley's other genres, Larson argues that the science fiction works together portray a future in which race, class, and gender are completely reimagined, yet still subject to an oppressive power dynamic, while his erotica asks readers to reconsider the dynamics of power and control but in a more personal, even intimate, context. Similarly, in Mosley's nongenre fiction, stories are revived through a reconnection with the past, a reclaiming of cultural heritage and lineage, and a rejection of classist visions of power. Finally, Mosley's nonfiction, which persuades his audience to act through writing, humanitarian efforts, or social uprising, offers a mix of lessons aimed at guiding readers through the same questions that inform his fiction writing."--African-American, Mystery & DetectiveCondition: Used - GoodHPB condition ratingsNew: Item is brand new, unused and unmarked, in flawless condition.Fine/Like New (F): No defects, little usage.

Hear What Others Are Saying About Jenn Walter
“Our knowledge and insight into the lives that the two of you have lived gave us some specific focus, and some immediate listener recognition given the success of others in your respective families in the world of hockey.
You need to know that the two of you were beyond perfection.  We try to create an atmosphere on the show that comes across as real and sincere for the listening audience.  Feedback we have received says “you guys sound like two folks just sitting in the recreation room having a discussion”…and we like that.  And today, the two of you blended so well, allowing good conversation, good laughter and a relaxed period of time filled with wisdom and perspective from two successful women who represent two significant hockey families.  I hope you will find time to listen to the show which airs this coming Saturday or is available on podcast next Tuesday at TSN.ca (and we will send you the specific link).  I think this is important because, without any knowledge of the other’s involvement, the two of you delivered one of the most powerful messages possible to the minor hockey audience…that being, just how possible it was to derive huge enjoyment out of situations that stymie so many others…and you did it with an emphasis on family.  We were blown away by the similarity and strength of your individual messages.
Having the two of you on the same show was one of the best decisions we could have made.  Today’s show made a huge impact on the lives of those that will listen to it.
Thank you again, Mary Kay and Jennifer.”
Jack Ray, General Manager The Hockey Source










Jenni’s Jingliest
Pretty much everything that I love is related to nature or nurture. http://jennwalter.blogspot.ca/2010/07/born-to-nurture.html

I actually took the plastic-free February challenge a couple of years ago – you can read all about it here: http://jennwalter.blogspot.ca/2011/02/im-free.html.
It was difficult, but I discovered an awesome website that I would encourage you to check out. We have used the charcoal water filters on our boat and I have purchased dishes, toys, even a child’s lunch bag. Go ahead! Purchase some non-plastic:

On the subject of health, I have benefitted so much from the wisdom of Suzanne Somers. She helped me in my journey back to me: http://jennwalter.blogspot.ca/2011/06/my-journey-back-to-me.html. We avoid sugar as much as possible and love her somersweet. I feel aligned with her philosophy on natural health and wellness. Check out her site for books, supplements, and one of the best natural sugar substitutes anywhere.






And last but absolutely not least, I have discovered a way to merge my passion for natural health and wellness with a highly lucrative opportunity to invest in a global distribution channel for unique natural product breakthroughs in both skin care and health. Learn more at www.ryanwalter.myqivana.com or www.ryanwalter.myskinshift.com or call (877)816-1877.





 "Thank you Jennifer for a truly inspirational talk. I have referred to it and you, many times since you spoke and that is amazing because it was only 2 days ago. Your talk allowed us to see your life and trials as we women see life and trials. I have had a few, I'm afraid, having lost my son last year. I'm afraid I LOVED your story. All of the above is sent with all sincerity as I really do think your message reached into the hearts of us all. I hope to Stay Hungry… Thanks again…You are quite delightful and human and approachable and it was a pleasure to meet you."− Maggie M. Reimer, CFP | RBC Dominion Securities Inc "A BIG thank you to you & Jenni. Two thumbs up!"− Oliver Pattison, The Abbotsford Heat Faith Night Post Game Presentation "Jennifer added a dynamic that really rounded out the post game special event."− Ron St. Hilaire "Very much enjoyed the speaker. Well thought out evening. Jennifer, you are beautiful inside and out. I was so touched and inspired by your story. THANK YOU for sharing – it meant more to me than you know. I’m so glad I came… "− The Abbotsford After 5 Club "Speaker did a fantastic job. I wish hockey people who aren’t Christians could hear her message."− The Abbotsford After 5 Club "One of the best After 5 and CWC speakers I’ve ever heard. So true all she said"− The Abbotsford After 5 Club
