HALLOYSITE NANOTUBES
Naturally formed in the Earth over millions of years, halloysite nanotubes are unique and versatile nanomaterials that are formed by surface weathering of aluminosilicate minerals and are composed of aluminum, silicon, hydrogen and oxygen.
Halloysite nanotubes are ultra-tiny hollow tubes with diameters typically smaller than 100 nanometers (100 billionths of a meter), with lengths typically ranging from about 500 nanometers to over 1.2 microns (millionths of a meter).
Our team of scientists and researchers are developing methods of separating out the nanotubes and processing them for use in numerous commercial applications, such as additives in polymers and plastics, electronic components, cosmetics, and home and personal care products.

PROPERTIES OF HALLOYSITE NANOTUBES
The elements are: Aluminum, silicon, hydrogen, oxygen.
The functional characteristics desired for specific applications can be controlled through selection of nanotube diameter and length.
Diameters typically range from about 40nm to 200nm and in a variety of lengths, allowing for a wide range of applications.
Halloysite nanotubes can be coated with metallic and other substances to achieve a wide variety of electrical, chemical, and physical properties.
They can be filled with such things as active ingredients including many that are used for cosmetics, household and personal care products, pesticides, pest repellents, pharmaceuticals and other agents that could benefit from extended release.
NaturalNano has identified additional applications, not yet publicly disclosed, for these unique and abundantly available materials. 

THE SEPARATION CHALLENGE
While halloysite nanotubes are found in large quantity in the Earth, the process of mining and separating them is technically challenging.  NaturalNano scientists and engineers are developing patent-pending proprietary processes for extracting, separating, and classifying specific types of halloysite nanotubes from halloysite clay.

Pleximer
Kaolin Clay



Challenges With Today’s Nanocomposite Materials
Today, most nanocomposites used in the plastics industry are made with “platy nanoclay” materials, but these clays are very difficult and expensive to process. Platy clays, such as the Kaolin clay below, contain layered two-dimensional sheets held together by an intercalation (or intermediary) layer. The sheets must first be exfoliated, or chemically separated, so they can function as nanoparticulate fillers and be dispersed in the polymer matrix. In today’s platy nanoclay production process, these multiple steps lead to complexity, cost, and dispersion quality challenges. In addition, most manufacturers do not have the specialized equipment needed to produce composites with platy nanoclays – this required investment is the biggest market barrier for nanoclays.

PLEXIMER  Advantage
NaturalNano’s patent product bypasses these multiple processing steps and complex chemistry by offering the manufacturer a turnkey drop-in solution that runs on standard conventional equipment. Pleximer is a turnkey concentrate in the form of pellets that can be added directly into the extruder by the end manufacturer. Pleximer contains Halloysite clay nanotubes, shown below, that are blended with a specific polymer base utilizing NaturalNano’s patent technology. The resulting product is a drop-in additive.
Pleximer doesn’t require the expensive exfoliation process needed by platy clay systems, and it successfully provides the required dispersion in a polymer matrix. Platy nanoclays, by comparison, have trouble achieving uniform dispersion, even with exfoliation, and work with a limited number of polymer families.  
The nanocomposite market is also limited by the small number of manufacturers that have invested in the know-how and the specialized equipment necessary to run platy nanoclays. NaturalNano believes that the Pleximer technology will have rapid industry acceptance because it enables manufacturers to produce nanocomposites with existing equipment.  NaturalNano is currently focused on leveraging this new drop-in, turnkey advantage to a select number of industrial compounders who supply major industries such as automotive, performance sporting goods and aerospace.

The complete, corrected release with Company Contact information follows:NaturalNano, Inc. Provides Shareholder Update Letter<!--Begin actual release body-->MADEIRA BEACH, Fla., Jan. 4, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- NaturalNano, Inc. (OTC Pink: NNAN) (the "Company"), a Nevada corporation is a provider of shrimp in the United States is pleased to provide shareholder update letter from Colm Wrynn the CEO.To Our Valued Shareholders:We are pleased to provide an update on the recent milestones we have achieved in our first full quarter of operations as NaturalNano, and discuss our vision for the Company's future. We wish to take this opportunity to recount our recent corporate actions and business activities.NaturalNano, has achieved substantive progress as we implement plans to create and capture shareholder value. To that end, we are pursuing an expansive growth while capitalizing on our diverse opportunities across the United States and overseas. We expect the next six months to mark a major inflection point in our growth.According to National Fisheries Institute (NFI), shrimp is the most consumed seafood within the United States at over 4 pounds of shrimp consumed per person in the United States annually. Shrimps come in many varieties which are differentiated by their color.We specialize in the a very high quality, domestic and wild caught shrimp called Key West Pink Shrimp also referred to as "pinks". They derive their name from their pink color which is the result of growing up in the coral sands off the west coast of Florida. Key West Pink Shrimp are also great tasting and may be enjoyed as "peel and eat" or in a wide variety of recipes. The harvesting season for "Pinks" is from November through June. Throughout the year, Omni also purchases and sells "Brown" and "White" shrimp also grown in the United States and harvested in the wild.Omni believes that it differentiates itself from its competitors not only by the quality of its product but its relationships with Shrimp boat captains and fishermen, shrimp seafood company owners and some of the top shrimp processors in the U.S. These relationships allow Omni to get its product to market as quickly as possible in order to guarantee freshness and taste. The vessels who supply our shrimp have refrigeration units and freezing capabilities on board which locks in freshness. Additionally, we use a large, approved, industry accepted processor in Louisiana which allows our haul to get out to the dining public within two to three days of catch resulting in delivery of fresh shrimp with uncompromised taste to our customers.  Most consumers in the United States are not aware of the origin of their store-bought or restaurant purchased shrimp.   Omni's shrimp product is free of pesticide, chemicals and antibiotics, caught in the U.S. and wild caught, facts that we believe are highly attractive, becoming more and more sought after and beneficial in terms of our eventual marketing success.Management is strongly optimistic that it has positioned the Company to capitalize on the high growth segments of the burgeoning shrimp and seafood markets.REVENUE FORECASTRevenue for the period from January 1, 2016 to June 23, 2016 (date of acquisition) totaled $1,199,948 and the cost of goods sold was $1,043,928. Net margin of $156,020 resulted in a gross profit percentage of 13%. The company has targeted $3 million in revenue for next year as its goal and revenues of more than $2,000,000.00 for FY 2016.CAPITAL STRUCTURENaturalNano, currently has 3,342,225 shares outstanding as of 9/14/16.
