RCM Files Lawsuit Against Legion Partners Asset Management Group Alleging Violations Of Federal Securities Laws






GlobeNewswire



Nov 8, 2013 7:41 PM EST













 




























































    PENNSAUKEN, N.J., Nov. 8, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- RCM Technologies, Inc. (Nasdaq:RCMT), a premier provider of business and technology solutions designed to enhance and maximize the operational performance of its customers through the adaptation and deployment of advanced information technology, engineering and specialty healthcare services, today announced that it has filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey alleging violations of the federal securities laws by Legion Partners Asset Management, LLC and other members of the "Legion Group," including IRS Partners No. 19, L.P., the Leonetti/O'Connell Family Foundation, M20, Inc., the Michael F. O'Connell and Margo L. O'Connell Revocable Trust, Michael F. O'Connell, Christopher S. Kiper, Bradley S. Vizi and Roger H. Ballou.  RCM alleges in the complaint that the Legion Group has failed to provide complete and materially accurate information in the filings it has made with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including its dissident proxy statement, other proxy materials and Schedule 13D. RCM is seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to ensure that RCM stockholders are provided with complete, accurate and truthful disclosures that enable them to make properly informed decisions concerning the election of directors at RCM's upcoming 2013 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.  As previously announced, the Legion Group is pursuing a proxy contest to elect its two handpicked nominees, Messrs. Vizi and Ballou, to the Board of Directors of RCM at RCM's 2013 Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held on Thursday, December 5, 2013, at 6:00 p.m., at the offices of Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. RCM has established October 18, 2013 as the record date for stockholders entitled to vote at the 2013 Annual Meeting.  Leon Kopyt, RCM's Chairman of the Board and CEO, commented as follows: "Our Board takes very seriously our duty to protect our stockholders from attempts to mislead them with information we believe is false, misleading and incomplete. The Legion Group's actions in recent weeks have made it clear that immediate corrective action is necessary to prevent the Legion Group from continuing to influence of the outcome of this proxy contest with what we believe to be false, misleading and incomplete statements."
