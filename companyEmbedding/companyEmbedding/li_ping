	Kiso-Hinoki/Texalium
	DONIC developed the Li Ping KiTex blade expressly for Li Ping, a young Chinese National Team player who is one of China's hopefuls. The Li Ping KiTex blade consists of high-quality wood plies with two extra texalium inner layers. The high-quality, hard hinoki outer plies, as well as the texalium inner plies, guarantee strength, flexibility, and power. The combination of the soft ayous inner ply and kiri middle layer produce a perfect synthesis between speed and control. If you are an attacker who, like Li Ping, has a varied topspin game, you will enjoy using this blade.
	7-plies
	1.+ 7. ply: kiso-hinoki,
	2.+ 6. ply: ayous
	3.+ 5. ply: texalium
	Centre ply: kiri

	Approx. weight: 90 gr. Layer: 7 Elasticity: nearly stiff

There are 3 users using the Donic Li Ping Kitex. 





				DONIC developed the sensational new Li Ping KiTex blade expressly for Li Ping, a young Chinese National Team player who is one of China's hopefuls after Olympics 2008! The Li Ping KiTex blade consists of high-quality wood plies with two extra texalium inner layers. The high-quality, hard hinoki outer plies, as well as the texalium inner plies, guarantee strength, flexibility, and power. The combination of the soft ayous inner ply and kiri middle layer produce a perfect synthesis between speed and control. If you are an attacker who, like Li Ping, has a varied topspin game, you will enjoy using this blade.

						Rubbers used to test: T64, EL-P, MX-P, M2.

The handle is a chinese style handle, no matter which type you choose, it will be small. Even smaller than the ZJK or Shiwen blade, but it is comfortable for me.  The blade is head heavy, which I personally prefer. The composite layers in the blade are next to the kiri core, dark grey in colour. Middle layer of the blade is ayous/samba/abachi, which is nice. Top veener is kiso-hinoki (200 years old), which is perfectly sanded, no visible pores or uneven surfaces, where your glue would stick in.

So the blade was designed to loop, but also have a bit more power. It is marked OFF-/OFF by the manufacturer, which I think is reasonable. This blade resonates, which gives the optimal feedback from the contact of the ball. The blade is predictable in every situation. Sweet spot is suprisingly large, I would say that the 1,5 cm margain of the head is not usable. When looping the arc of the ball is medium. Also the feeling of the loop is very pleasant, no resonations. On direct flat hits the blade resonates on low tempo, but this resonance fades when hitting harder.

A very stable and offesive blade with fine touch, the soft top layer of hinoki makes every loop a spinny threat to the opponent. It is usually spinnier than similar ZLF blades with limba top veener. Works well with modern ESN hard rubbers, gives them fine touch. Arc of the ball is medium, but steady and safe. No matter how you vary the power.

I would recommend this blade to allwood blade lovers who want speed and control around 80-85 grams. Texalium gives a bit more power, but not that much like carbon. This is a controlled to aggressive looper blade which has the power for smashing. To be honest it definetly feels like Jun Mizutani ZLC, with a bit more power and better feeling in flat contacts. Price tag is pleasant, I wonder why it got no hype. Also works well with poly ball.

						No one put any review on this blade for years..while some people in my country said this is one of their best seller. So I bought this blade with some hesitation.

After trying, Wheeew... What a blade! Trust me, i've tried many donic blades previously, and this is their best blade IMO. The head is smaller than regular blade, but it feels very2 balance, it just feel very natural. I pair it with acuda s2 front/back.

Speed is not too fast but enough, feel, control and everything is superb! I still can't believe how come there's no review so far. I might say that this blade is better than tb alc which I also admire. The small head will actually helps you to focus your stroke.

This blade deserve highest rating from me.

You can categorize and save all your highlights in Notebook and even turn them into flashcards with the click of a button; go to Notebook and click on the Flashcards button to create flashcards from your highlights. We store all your highlights at kindle.amazon.com so you can reference them even after you return the eTextbook.














Studying for exams? Notebook for eTextbooks displays all of your notes, colored highlights, saved images and bookmarks in one place. With Notebook you can mark and filter your most important concepts to study when it's test time–you can even export them to email and Evernote on Fire tablets.

On iOS and Android devices, tap the top or bottom of the screen from within the eTextbook to bring up the controls to access Notebook.

Kindle's Whispersync technology also synchronizes the furthest page you read, your bookmarks, and annotations across your devices so you can pick up where you left off.














You can save money and space in your bag with eTextbooks. Read across your devices and save time studying the concepts you need to learn with interactive features such as Keyword Search and X-Ray for Textbooks. Quickly create and manage your notes and highlights and access them anytime in the Amazon cloud.

You can also access all of your eTextbooks, notes, and bookmarks wherever you go, whether it's on your Fire tablet, iPad, iPhone, Android device, PC, or Mac with the free Kindle Reading App.














With the swipe of a finger, quickly and efficiently navigate through pages and chapters of eTextbooks. Swift navigation is available on Android and iOS tablets. Tap the top or bottom of your tablet screen from inside the eTextbook to access swift navigation. On iPads, you have the option of swiping through all the pages from a grid like the one shown above.
