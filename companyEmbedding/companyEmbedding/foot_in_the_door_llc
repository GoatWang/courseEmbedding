Foot In The Door







Weight Range:  3-4 Ounces depending on elements of package
Postage Range: $.50 – $3.74 each
Total Mailer Cost Range (including printing and mailing services): $3.50 – $5.50 each
Our Pricing Philosophy: No two successful direct mail marketing campaigns look the same. Quantities mailed, number of pages in the mailer, paper choice, ink color, size of the letter, envelope vs box vs container as mailer, labels or no labels, type of postage and other variables will all differ from campaign to campaign.
Since there are so many variables, and more importantly, because they all impact how well your mailer performs, we like to work with you to identify the “just right” configuration of all these variables for your specific goal instead of just putting boilerplate prices on our website.
Because you aren’t a boilerplate customer, and we don’t want you to get boilerplate ROI.

Lumpy Mail Implementation Steps

Identify your goal for the campaign. Is it lead generation? Event promotion? Reactivation of dead customers? Sales generation? Each one requires their own unique approach, so before you start planning your campaign start with the end in mind and figure out your goal.
Identify your target market and ideal customer for your mailing. Every marketing piece you generate needs to speak very specifically to a target market and ideal customer. And you may have multiple target markets and ideal customers. So don’t skip this step! You cannot create your mailing before identifying which one you are speaking to. If you only have one target market and ideal customer, review it to brush up and make sure you don’t need to update your data.
Pick the right list. If you’re working with multiple target markets and ideal customers, you need to make sure your using the list that only has that target market and ideal customers in it. If you’re buying a list, you need to make sure you’ve bought a list based on the data points for the target market and ideal customers you are speaking to in your mailing. Pick the segments within your own database that this mailing will speak to and ONLY mail to those segments.
Write your sales letter. The Lumpy Mail™ piece you use will get their attention, but it’s the sales letter that is going to keep it and compel them into taking the action you want them to take. Want to make sure you’re sales letters are effective? Trying to avoid the deadly mistakes that land your sales letter in the trash bin? Need help knowing how to write one?  Get our free sales letter guide.(This step only applies if you are mailing the boomerang in an envelope or box. If you are mailing the boomerang as is, you can play around with attaching a sales letter in an envelope to it and other methods. Or rely on the boomerang to display your call-to-action.)
Put a sample of your mailing together and mail a test piece to yourself. This allows you to make sure you have the correct postage for your mailing, that your mailing will weather the handling of it’s trip, and catch any other potential glitches that might impact the response rate of your mailing.
Make any adjustments you need to based on the results of the test mailing. If you made a significant change, send another test piece to yourself to make sure that change will solve the problem and not create any other glitches.
Assemble the rest of your mailings and get them out there into the hands of your prospects!
Make sure you’re sitting down when the results start rolling in. (Smelling salts may also be handy.)

Review 
The first single-disc Pink Floyd compilation to surface in 30 years -- the last being A Collection of Great Dance Songs, released as a stopgap between The Wall and The Final Cut -- A Foot in the Door: The Best of Pink Floyd has its share of idiosyncrasies, quirks evident right from the choice of the moody “Hey You” as the set’s opener. “Hey You” might not be an ideal keynote song but it is certainly one of Floyd’s signature songs, something that can’t be said of every one of the 16 songs here, the oddest choices being “The Happiest Days of Our Lives” (used as an extended intro for “Another Brick in the Wall, Pt. 2”) and “The Fletcher Memorial Home” (an album cut from the un-beloved The Final Cut). Apart from these tunes, A Foot in the Door serves up the expected -- five cuts from Dark Side of the Moon, three from Wish You Were Here, four from The Wall (of the big radio staples, “Run Like Hell” and “Young Lust” are absent), adding the early Syd Barrett “See Emily Play” and the latter-day “High Hopes” and “Learning to Fly” almost as afterthoughts. Although the compilation could withstand some minor tweaks -- a post-Syd song like “One of These Days” would have been welcome, for instance -- this is still a very worthy compilation of (most of) the Floyd songs everybody knows by heart. [Foot in the Door was re-released on CD in 2016.] ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi

The first single-disc Pink Floyd compilation to surface in 30 years -- the last being A Collection of Great Dance Songs, released as a stopgap between The Wall and The Final Cut -- A Foot in the Door: The Best of Pink Floyd has its share of idiosyncrasies, quirks evident right from the choice of the moody “Hey You” as the set’s opener. “Hey You” might not be an ideal keynote song but it is certainly one of Floyd’s signature songs, something that can’t be said of every one of the 16 songs here, the oddest choices being “The Happiest Days of Our Lives” (used as an extended intro for “Another Brick in the Wall, Pt. 2”) and “The Fletcher Memorial Home” (an album cut from the un-beloved The Final Cut). Apart from these tunes, A Foot in the Door serves up the expected -- five cuts from Dark Side of the Moon, three from Wish You Were Here, four from The Wall (of the big radio staples, “Run Like Hell” and “Young Lust” are absent), adding the early Syd Barrett “See Emily Play” and the latter-day “High Hopes” and “Learning to Fly” almost as afterthoughts. Although the compilation could withstand some minor tweaks -- a post-Syd song like “One of These Days” would have been welcome, for instance -- this is still a very worthy compilation of (most of) the Floyd songs everybody knows by heart. [Foot in the Door was re-released on CD in 2016.] ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi
