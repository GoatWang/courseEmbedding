CD DetailsReleased: October 24, 1995
Originally Released: 1995
Label: Giant Records / WEA

Entertainment Reviews:


Entertainment Weekly - 11/10/95, p.67"...he's one cookie-cutter sensation who isn't likely to crumble." - Rating: B+




Tracks:


1.Who Needs You Baby
2.I Won't Have The Heart
3.Let Me Take The Heartache (Off Your Hands)
4.Hypnotize The Moon
5.Hand Me Down Heart
6.Only On Days That End In "Y"
7.Where Were You
8.Loving You Comes Naturally To Me
9.Bury The Shovel
10.A Cowboy's Toughest Ride
11.Love Me Like You Love Me



Product Description:



Personnel: Clay Walker (vocals); Steve Dorff (conductor); Larry Byrom, Kyle Frederick (acoustic guitar); Dann Huff, Brent Rowan, Landon Taylor (electric guitar); Sonny Garrish, Tim Sargeant (steel guitar); Paul Franklin (dobro); Johnny Gimble, Joe Spivey, Stuart Duncan, Jason Roberts (fiddle); The Nashville String Machine (strings); John Hobbs, Matt Rollings, Van Rentz (piano); Glenn Worf, Mike Brignardello, Byron House (bass); Eddie Bayers, Maxwell Schauff (drums); Curtis Young, Curtis Wright (background vocals).Country sensation Clay Walker's HYPNOTIZE THE MOON is another satisfying collection of broadly themed love songs guaranteed to please his considerable fan base. On this, his third release, Walker doesn't stray far from the formula that has earned him platnium status and a number of country #1 hits. The native Texan continues to charm, whether it's with haunting ballads like "Where Were You," or uptempo fare such as "A Cowboy's Toughest Ride," one of four tunes co-written by Walker himself. Recorded with a smart set of Nashville's finest session musicians, and produced by his long-time collaborator James Stroud, HYPNOTIZE THE MOON also features songs composed by some of the genre's best and brightest songwriters. Of particular interest is a new track by Steve Wariner, "Love Me Like You Love Me."Personnel: Clay Walker (vocals); Larry Byrom (acoustic guitar); Dann Huff, Brent Rowen (electric guitar); Sonny Garrish (steel guitar); Paul Franklin (dobro); Johnny Gimble, Stuart Duncan, Jason Roberts , Joe Spivey (fiddle); The Nashville String Machine (strings); John Hobbs, Matt Rollings (piano); Maxwell Schauf, Eddie Bayers (drums); Curtis Wright, Curtis Young (background vocals).Recording information: 16th Avenue Sound; LOUD Recording; Mid-Town Tone; Sound Stage Studios, Nashville, TN.Unknown Contributor Role: Mike Brignardello.Clay Walker's Hypnotize the Moon is his most assured, cohesive album to date. Walker shines on both polished, contemporary ballads and gritty traditional country, and his consistently excellent performance is what carries the album over the weak spots. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine
