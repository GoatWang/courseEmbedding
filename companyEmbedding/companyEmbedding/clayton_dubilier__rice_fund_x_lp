    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Strategy

      We were founded on a simple premise: good investments result from sound decision-making; and, good businesses are built with a commitment to operational excellence.  Since our founding in 1978, we have never wavered from these principles.
      

            Good investments result
            from sound decision-making;
            and, good businesses are
            built with a commitment to
            operational excellence
          
      We work collaboratively with corporate and family business sellers on transactions to maximize value.  Many corporations, CEOs and entrepreneurs select CD&R as their partner because of our strong reputation for trustworthiness and operational leadership.
      
      We practice investing as a craft, relying on a dedicated and cohesive team with a shared sense of purpose and values.  Our investment approach blends skilled investment judgment with extensive experience driving growth and operating excellence.  
      
      Our Partners come from globally-recognized businesses that have long been known for the quality of their people – ABB, Allstate, Disney, Emerson Electric, The Gap, GE and Unilever as well as Goldman Sachs, McKinsey & Company and Morgan Stanley, among others.

Firm History

			We were founded in 1978 by Joe Rice, a former corporate lawyer from Sullivan & Cromwell and former investment banker; Martin Dubilier, a former McKinsey & Company partner and experienced corporate executive; Gene Clayton, a well-known crisis manager; and Bill Welsh, also a proven operating executive from Raytheon.  With 35 years of history, CD&R today is recognized as one of the most experienced and respected private equity firms.  We have institutionalized our distinctive approach to private equity investing – an approach that has become the reference point for blending investment skills with operating capabilities to build great businesses.
			
			Our reputation as a business builder was established by such landmark transactions as the buyout of Harris Graphics in 1983, at the time one of the largest ever corporate divestiture accomplished by means of a private equity buyout structure, and the creation of Lexmark International from IBM’s printer and supplies business in 1991.  The Firm and its investments have been the subject of numerous articles, including several case studies in the Harvard Business Review (“HBR”).  In a 1995 HBR article that focused on the Firm and its culture, the authors concluded that CD&R provides important “insights into what constitutes best practice in the ownership and governance of corporate enterprises.”  David Swenson, Chief Investment Officer of the Yale Investment Management Company, in his book Pioneering Portfolio Management (2009) stated that “by combining operational and financial skills, CD&R exemplifies the potential for unusual value creation.”
			
			Joe Rice assumed the role of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer in 1991. Don Gogel became Chief Executive Officer in 1999 and Chairman and Chief Executive Officer in 2012.  Jack Welch, former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of General Electric, became a Senior Advisor in 2001, and Sir Terry Leahy, former Chief Executive of Tesco, became a Senior Advisor in 2011, supplementing the Firm’s renowned group of full-time operating partners from some of the world’s most successful companies as well as operating advisors who are engaged by our funds.

Clayton, Dubilier & Rice to Acquire Largest Distributor of Waterworks Products in the U.S.
Carve-Out of HD Supply's Waterworks Division Valued at $2.5 Billion


























NEW YORK, June 6, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Clayton, Dubilier & Rice ("CD&R") today announced an agreement with HD Supply Holding, Inc.                 

/quotes/zigman/17064684/composite HDS
+0.71%


 to acquire its Waterworks business unit ("Waterworks"), the nation's largest distributor of water, sewer, storm and fire protection products, for $2.5 billion. Through a carve-out transaction, Waterworks will become an independent company, wholly-owned by CD&R funds.


                                        








Waterworks is a leading U.S. distributor of industrial and construction products used to build and maintain underground water, wastewater and drainage infrastructure networks. The company operates a national network of 244 branches in 46 states with a sales team of more than 1,700 sales representatives serving a diverse customer base of more than 37,000 municipalities, private water companies and professional contractors. Waterworks will continue to be headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri.


                                        








Jim Berges, a CD&R Partner, will serve as Chairman of Waterworks.  Mr. Berges was Chairman of HD Supply from 2007 to 2015. CD&R invested in HD Supply in 2007 and exited the investment in 2014.  Previously, Mr. Berges served as Vice Chairman and President of Emerson Electric Co.


                                        








Steve LeClair, who has served as the President of Waterworks since 2011, will become the chief executive officer.  "This transaction is an important milestone in the strategic growth of Waterworks," said Mr. LeClair. "The Waterworks team is very excited to reunite with CD&R to accelerate our growth and productivity initiatives."


                                        








"Waterworks represents an attractive opportunity to invest in the leading distributor in the U.S. waterworks market, which stands to benefit from tailwinds in construction activity and municipal infrastructure spending," said CD&R Partner J.L. Zrebiec.  "With strong national, regional and local positions and a reputation for customer service and reliability, the company is in a very favorable long-term position."


                                        








"Through our prior investment in HD Supply, we have a great appreciation for the strength and quality of the Waterworks business and the exceptionally talented Waterworks management team," said CD&R Partner Nate Sleeper. "We are very excited to work alongside them once again to continue to build on the company's leading market position and pursue the many significant profitable growth opportunities available to it as a freestanding business."


                                        








CD&R has obtained committed financing from Barclays; BofA Merrill Lynch; Citi; Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC; Deutsche Bank AG Cayman Islands Branch; Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch; J.P. Morgan; and RBC Capital Markets, LLC. Barclays; BofA Merrill Lynch; Citi; Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC; Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.; J.P. Morgan; and RBC Capital Markets, LLC acted as financial advisors to CD&R. Debevoise & Plimpton LLP served as CD&R's legal advisor in the transaction.


                                        

About Waterworks

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
