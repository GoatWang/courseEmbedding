A word from the desk of the President of Voigt Lighting about LED lighting


LED lighting or Light Emitting diode is an exciting technology that is coming into its own at this time. It promises to provide energy savings, reduction in maintenance costs and change our industry. This next generation light source is being tapped for general illumination purposes in both commercial and residential applications.The technology although not new is still in its infancy with much more work to be done, in order for it to evolve into a full blown lighting source, much the same way that we currently view Metal halide and Fluorescent technologies.LED’s require more attention to how they are put together within a specific luminaire with regard to how they interact with the other components more so then any of the current mainstream technologies that are out there.Our goal at Voigt is to marry these components so that we achieve higher outputs, better luminous efficacy and a long life so that our products live up to the promise of longer life, less maintenance and ultimately save energy costs and help our environment.Voigt Lighting is a member of the Department of Energy Solid State Lighting program and has taken a pledge to provide the best in LED technology as is possible.


Thank you.


Paul Goldberg

Voigt, Paul V
Owner


















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Minnesota:













Does Voigt, Paul V carry a valid contracting license?



Licenses are required for all residential building contractors and residential remodelers who contract with a homeowner to construct or improve dwellings by offering more than one special skill. Owners working on their own property must also be licensed if they build or remodel for the sole purpose of speculation or resale.











How important is contractor licensing in Minnesota?



Contractors acting as sole proprietors, or qualifying persons for a construction related business entity, must pass a two part exam. The first section tests building code compliance knowledge. Section two tests a candidate's understanding of Minnesota business and law.











Your liability risk when hiring Voigt, Paul V



Licensed contractors in Minnesota must carry both active workers' compensation and general liability insurance policies. Request a copy of the insurance certificate for each before any work begins. 











Financial recourse when hiring Voigt, Paul V



The purpose of the Minnesota Contractor Recovery Fund is to compensate consumers who have suffered losses due to a licensed contractor's fraudulent, deceptive, or dishonest practices, conversion of funds, or failure to perform. All licensed contractors are required to pay a fee to the fund. The total amount that can be paid out against any one licensed contractor is $75,000. If multiple claims are filed against the same contractor, they are prorated. In these situations, you may not be able to recover your entire loss. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Minnesota, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

In the Beginning
 
Paul G. A. H. Voigt was born in London
on December 9, 1901. He was educated at Dulwich College and University College,
London, receiving a B Sc.  degree in electrical engineering in 1922. Among
many other audio contributions and 32 patents, he can be credited with the
first high flux energized speaker drive unit and horns using the Tractrix
contour. While with the Edison Bell Works in London, Voigt started work on his
loudspeaker. When the company went under, in 1933, he set up his own company Voigt Patents, Ltd. based in Sydenham,
London. Under agreement with Bell, he remained the owner the 19 patents that he
received on his ideas. The domestic corner horn (at the right) was released in
1934 and set a new record for high quality sound reproduction. This unique
design gave an extremely lifelike non-directional presentation with the sound
entering the room at a height between 3 and 5 feet from the floor.
 
A unique feature of the Voigt
designs is the use of a single driver that covers the entire frequency range.
This is done using a mechanical crossover, commonly known as a whizzer. The
driver then consists of a main cone and a short cone both of which are attached
to the same voice coil. Bass frequencies are radiated by loading the rear of
the driver with a folded horn enclosure. In addition, Paul took great pride in
designing the drivers with very high efficiency and concentrating  very
high flux density in the magnetic gap. This was accomplished using a very small
gap making the centering of the voice coil very critical.
 
About this time Paul met O.P.
Lowther from the Lowther Manufacturing Company and eventually this resulted in
a merge between the two companies.. This became Lowther-Voigt Radio. 
 
During the war, Paul was kept
busy maintaining his horn speakers installed in cinemas. After the war,
priority was given to the design of a new driver using new magnet materials and
drive unit having a flux density of 18,000 gauss (1.8 tesla). It was released
in 1949
 
Unfortunately, due to poor
health and slow sales, Paul decided to move to Canada with his wife in 1950 and
set up North American sales for his new designs. The company folded because of
the Korean War. He taught electronics for a while and then moved to Ottawa and
worked for the Canadian Government in Radio Regulations. He retired in 1969 and
pursued other interests.
 
He died on February 9, 1981
leaving a legacy of his inventions. Geoffery L. Wilson wrote a glowing memoriam
about him in the April 1981 issue of the Journal of the Audio Engineering
Society. Paul Klipsch contributed and mentioned that Paul Voigt was one of the
unsung pioneers in audio. Donald Aldous also write a nice memoriam in the June
issue of Audio magazine. More information can be found at the Lowther Museum. 
 
I did get a chance to speak
with Paul Voigt following the 1974 Audio Engineering Society (AES) meeting in
New York City. We talked about several things but I gathered that he had some
reservations about how his invention was being used at Lowther and things were
not as amicable as I was led to previously believe. The next day he was
presented with an honorary membership in the AES. I also found it strange that
neither memoriam mentioned his association with Lowther, although other
companies were mentioned.
 
Meanwhile, Donald Chave, who
was previously Lowthers chief engineer, had bought the company after World War
II. He finally developed the PM-1 driver using the Voigt cone assembly. Before
Paul had left it was agreed that Lowther would produce the domestic corner horn
under license. About 400 corner horns were produced between 1934 and the early
1950s. Chave later expanded the products and developed new drivers based on the
early Voigt units.
 




 








 
Stewart Hegeman was also
involved with Lowther in the early 1950s. In 1951 Lowther released the incredible
"Lowther Hegeman" reproducer, which was three-times the price of a
Lowther Voigt domestic corner horn. The enclosure was four feet wide, four feet
tall and two feet deep. 
 
The
newly-developed PM4A drive unit was used inside a large horizontal plaster horn,
giving an amazingly wide dispersion of mid and treble frequencies. It was a
result of a collaboration between Stuart ( British spelling) Hegeman and Donald
Chave of Lowther. Later in the 1950s, Hegeman and Chave also developed the
Harman Kardon Citation X driver. Lowther still exists today although similar drivers are now being
sold by other companies as well/
 

 
Lowther TP-1
 

 
Early versions of the Lowther TP-1 speaker system had the driver in a box
protruding top of the enclosure. It used the PM3 driver that was based on the
PM2A. Flux density: 21 Tesla, Impedance: 15 ohms, Power Handling: 6 watts. The
PM3/5A driver is an improved version having a flux density of 23.2 Tesla. The
1968 TP-1D system pictured above has no top on the box 
 

 
Brociner Model 4
 
My first audition with the
Voigt design was when I heard the Brociner Model 4 speaker system at the 1955
New Your Hi-Fi show. The system was used in the Tetrad diamond room. I was very
impressed with the sound. The design was similar to the Lowther TP-1 system
made in England. Although only a single system was playing (mono in those
days), it sounded very clean and smooth. It did require corner placement. I was
only a student then and could not even afford one, let alone two. 
 
Victor Brociner had a
business in New York City and made amplifiers and preamplifiers plus the Model
4. He later went to work for University Loudspeakers in White Plains, NY. I was
actually interested to get a job there since it was only a few miles from home
but they were not hiring. After an evening session at the AES, Victor told me
University was an ulcer factory. Then University moved to Oklahoma and soon
Victor started his own speaker company called Avid, based in Rhode Island.
 









 
In 1952, the Brociner model 4
had been demonstrated in room 602 at the Fourth Audio Fair in the Hotel New
Yorker from October 29 to November 1. Other Brociner equipment included the
Brociner A100 preamp-equalizer, CA-2 control amplifier, UL-1 Ultra-Linear
Williamson power amplifier, Model 250 Transcentent 3-way corner reproducer and
the Ductflex coaxial speaker cabinet, In attendance were Victor Brociner and A.
Stewart Hegeman. Right next door in room 606 was, McIntosh Engineering
Laboratory , Water Street, Binghamton, NY. In attendance were Frank McIntosh
and Gordon Gow demonstrating their audio amplifiers. Among others in attendance
for Harvey Radio in room 631, was James Carroll.
