Profile




ABOUT ME

I have been a pediatric physical therapist at Duke since 2009. I have the honor and joy of working with infants, children, and their families both in the inpatient and outpatient settings. As a PT, I enjoy helping parents understand their child's unique motor skills and ways to support development in the hospital and at home. My goal is to optimize development during the hospital stay and walk alongside families during this process and through the transition home. One of the best parts of my job is watching a child flourish and attain new milestones through follow-up appointments at our Special Infant Care Clinic. I am originally from South Carolina, but my husband and I have fallen in love with Durham and enjoy all it has to offer.

Clinical focus and research



MY RESEARCH INTERESTS

I have an interest in evaluating cranial molding, or head shape development, in preterm infants. Our goal is to determine the best way to prevent head shaping issues during the hospital stay.  Maintaining a round head shape helps infants prevents secondary motor issues that can influence development. I also work with my colleagues to evaluate how physical therapy can best support the preterm infant in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Through specific interventions we provide, we hope to minimize the long-term consequences of prematurity that affect the musculoskeletal and neurological systems.
