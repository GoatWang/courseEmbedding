Company Overview

Odyssey Marine Exploration was founded in 1994  on the following beliefs:


There are billions of dollars in valuable materials  on the ocean floor;
The technology exists to find and recover these treasures, artifacts, cargo and naturally-occurring mineral deposits;
Good business and sound scientific practice can co-exist and thrive together;
The treasures and the knowledge recovered from the deep ocean should be shared with the world. 


 From the start, Odyssey's business plan envisioned the discovery of valuable and interesting assets from the deep-ocean over an extended period of time. This successful strategy has enabled us to bring the world's finest deep-ocean technology and equipment together with the most qualified and brightest researchers, engineers, technicians and scientist from all corners of the globe and we continue to attract the best minds in this emerging industry. 

  We have surveyed and mapped more than 26,000 square miles of seabed and spent more than 14,000 hours diving on sites using advanced robotic technology. Our expert team has discovered hundreds of shipwrecks ranging from third-century BC Punic sites to WWII casualties. We’ve also explored some of the most famous shipwreck finds to date including the SS Republic, HMS Victory, SS Gairsoppa and SS Central America.

  Our important discoveries also uncover priceless new knowledge and history from the depths. As we recover these shipwreck treasures, once believed lost forever, we also resurrect intriguing stories that offer a rare and fascinating window into historic events which would otherwise remain obscure.

  We share the thrill and adventure of deep-ocean exploration by making shipwreck treasures, artifacts and information available to collectors, the general public and students through our webstore, exhibits, books, television,  educational programs and a virtual museum.

 Admiral Balchin's HMS Victory Discovered by Odyssey Marine Exploration
World's Mightiest Ship Was Lost Without a Trace in 1744 - Mystery Solved
Discovery Channel's "Treasure Quest" program reveals behind-the-scenes look at the discovery and exploration of the deep-ocean shipwreck site
Tampa, FL – February 2, 2009 - Odyssey Marine Exploration, Inc. (NasdaqCM: OMEX), pioneers in the field of deep-ocean shipwreck exploration, has discovered the long-sought shipwreck of HMS Victory lost in 1744, solving one of the greatest mysteries in naval history. 
  The direct predecessor and inspiration behind Nelson’s flagship, Balchin’s Victory was the mightiest and technically most advanced vessel of her age. She sank during a storm in 1744 with all hands and was the last Royal Navy warship to be lost at sea with a complete complement of bronze cannon. Two of the greatest admirals in English history, Sir John Norris and Sir John Balchin, called her their flagship. Research indicates that Balchin’s Victory sank with a substantial amount of gold and silver specie aboard.
Odyssey has been cooperating closely with the United Kingdom’s Ministry of Defence (MOD) on the project, and all activities at the site have been conducted in accordance with protocols agreed with MOD and Royal Navy officials. Terms of collaboration between Odyssey and the UK MOD on the project are currently being negotiated, and an agreement similar to the Sussex Partnering Agreement has been proposed.
“Finding this shipwreck has solved one of the greatest shipwreck mysteries in history. Having discovered it in deep water far from where history says it was lost has served to exonerate Admiral Balchin and his officers from the accusation of having let the ship run aground on the Casquets due to faulty navigation,” commented Greg Stemm, Odyssey’s Chief Executive Officer. “We have worked closely with the MOD on this operation, and anticipate that we will continue the excellent cooperative relationship that we have enjoyed working together on the Sussex project. Fortunately, this shipwreck is not in waters claimed by any other country, so we do not expect any interference in further exploration of the site.”
Odyssey discovered the site nearly 100 km from where the ship was historically believed to have been wrecked on a reef near the Channel Islands. In an operation conducted in cooperation with the MOD, Odyssey has completed an archaeological pre-disturbance survey of the site, conducted limited test trenching, and recovered two bronze cannon to confirm the identity of the shipwreck. The cannon recovered include a 12-pounder featuring the royal arms of George II and a 4 ton, 42-pounder bearing the crest of George I. The huge 42-pounder recovered is the only known example of a gun of this type and size currently in existence on dry land. The only other artifacts recovered to date were two small brick fragments that were brought into U.S. federal court in order to file an admiralty arrest of the site.
During these operations, evidence was discovered of substantial damage to the site from natural deterioration, scouring, extensive fishing trawl net damage and the intrusion of modern trash and debris.
“Rather than staying frozen in time beneath the waves, this unique shipwreck is fading fast,” warns marine archaeologist Dr. Sean Kingsley, Director of Wreck Watch International., “The Victory lies in an area of intensive trawling, and her hull and contents are being ploughed away by these bulldozers of the deep day in, day out. Leaving the Victory’s rich archaeology so vulnerable to the ravages of man is like allowing a motorway to smash straight through a historic site on land without excavating it. The archaeological recovery of the artifacts from the site should begin as soon as possible or the story of England’s most important lost man-of-war may not survive to be told.”
Sir Robert Balchin, descendant of Admiral Sir John Balchin, stated, “This is the most astonishing news; for generations my family has wondered about the fate of Sir John and the Victory.  Now that the wreck has been found, I and my family hope that as many of the artifacts on it as possible will be raised to the surface; our fear is that erosion, or trawler fishing will destroy what is there within a very few years. It would be wonderful to see these historic artifacts on permanent display in a museum where they will give a unique insight into naval warfare in the mid 18th century.”
A preliminary archaeological report detailing research and work to date on the site, which identifies the shipwreck as that of HMS Victory is available at www.shipwreck.net/publications.php 
Odyssey’s work on the Victory site was all conducted while cameras for Discovery Channel’s “Treasure Quest” were rolling. In the United States, the “Treasure Quest” episode featuring the identification of HMS Victory will air on Thursday, February 5 at 10PM ET/PT. In the United Kingdom, a special presentation of “Treasure Quest” featuring HMS Victory will premiere on Sunday, February 8 at 9:00 PM. “Treasure Quest” is produced by Primetime Emmy® Award-winning JWM Productions.
Additional information about Odyssey’s discovery and work to date on Balchin’s Victory is available at www.shipwreck.net/hmsvictoryfaqs.php.

HMS Victory Project Overview
One of the world's greatest maritime mysteries  was solved when Odyssey Marine Exploration discovered the shipwreck of HMS  Victory, lost in 1744 under the command of Admiral Sir John Balchin. The direct predecessor and inspiration behind Admiral Nelson's flagship, this Victory was the mightiest and most technically advanced vessel of her age. She was lost during a storm with all hands and was the last Royal Navy warship to be lost at sea with a complete complement of bronze cannon. Two of the greatest admirals in English history, Sir John Norris and Sir John Balchin called her their flagship. Research indicates that the Victory sank with a substantial amount of specie aboard.
Odyssey discovered the  site nearly 100 km from where the ship was historically believed to have been  wrecked on a reef near the Channel Islands. In  an operation conducted in cooperation with the United Kingdom Ministry of Defence (MOD), Odyssey has completed an  archaeological pre-disturbance survey of the site, conducted limited test  trenching, and recovered two bronze cannon to confirm the identity of the shipwreck.  The cannon recovered include a 12-pounder featuring the royal arms of George II  and a 4-ton, 42-pounder bearing the crest of George I. The huge 42-pounder recovered  is the only known example of a gun of this type and size currently in existence  on dry land.  On September 18, 2009, Odyssey announced it reached an agreement with the UK Government on a salvage award for the cannon recovered from the site. 
For more information about the preliminary survey and identification of the site, read Neil Cunningham Dobson's and Dr. Sean Kingsley's archaeological paper, HMS Victory, a First-Rate Royal Navy Warship Lost in the English Channel, 1744. Preliminary Survey & Identification (2009).
During these operations and on subsequent monitoring visits to the site,  evidence was discovered of substantial damage to the site from natural  deterioration, scouring, extensive fishing trawl net damage and the intrusion  of modern trash and debris. Read more in 
Dr. Sean Kingsley's archaeological paper, Deep-Sea   Fishing Impacts on the Shipwreck of the English Channel & Western   Approaches (2009) as well as the  archaeological paper Balchin's Victory (Site 
25C): Shipwreck Monitoring & Cannon Impacts (2012).
In January 2012, following a period of consultation, the UK Ministry of Defence and the UK Department for Culture, Media and Sport transferred future management responsibility of the Victory to the Maritime Heritage Foundation, a charity established to locate shipwrecks, investigate, recover and preserve artifacts to the highest archaeological standards and to promote knowledge and understanding of Britain’s maritime heritage. The Maritime Heritage Foundation reached an agreement with Odyssey Marine Exploration for the financing, archaeological survey and excavation, conservation and exhibit of the Victory and artifacts from the shipwreck site.  As part of the agreement, Odyssey  produced an extensive project design for the archaeological excavation of the site, including a plan for recording, documentation, conservation, publication and public education. 
Details regarding the work completed as part Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the VIctory 1744 Project Design are available in the following papers: Gerhard Seiffert, Neil Cunningham Dobson, Frederick Van de Walle, Dr. Sean Kingsley, HMS Victory (Site 25C). Preliminary Results of the Non-Disturbance Shipwreck Survey, 2012 (2013); Anthony R. Prave, Donald A. Herd, Angus C. Calder & Stuart G. Allison, The Wreck of the First Rate Warship the Victory, Western English Channel: Site 25C Sediment Analysis (2013); Juan Antonio Morales González & Claudio Lozano Guerra-Librero, Dynamics of Sediment Bedforms in the Western English Channel: the Wreck of the Victory (Site 25C) in Context (2013).
The Maritime Heritage Foundation is currently waiting for permission from the Ministry of Defence and a license from the Marine Management Organisation in order to proceed with the recovery of  at-risk, surface artifacts.

Odyssey Overview: Go on board to see how Odyssey Marine Exploration, the pioneers in deep-ocean shipwreck exploration, have discovered some of the greatest lost treasures in history.
SS Republic: Scenes from the SS Republic shipwreck site, a Civil-War era paddlewheel   steamer which sank approximately 100 miles off the Georgia coast. Odyssey   recovered more than 51,000 coins and nearly 14,000 artifacts from this site   1,700 feet deep. 
HMS Sussex: Underwater video from a shipwreck site believed to be HMS Sussex, a   British warship which sank in 1694. The video was taken during pre-disturbance   and core sampling surveys at the site. 
"Tortugas": This Spanish   colonial shipwreck discovered approximately 1500 feet deep was the first ever   deep-ocean remotely-operated archaeolgical excavation. During the 1990-1991   excavation nearly 17,000 artifacts, some as small as seeds and pearls, were   recovered.
"Blue China": Likely the remains of a modest American coastal trader with a large ceramic cargo conducting   business along the Atlantic Seaboard in the years preceding the American Civil   War.

 Mark D. Gordon
President and Chief Executive Officer
	


  
Mark D. Gordon was appointed Chief Executive Officer of Odyssey Marine Exploration in October 2014. Mr. Gordon has served as the company's President since 2007 and on Odyssey's Board of Directors since January 2008. He joined Odyssey in 2005 as an independent consultant before serving as Director, Business Development and Executive Vice President of Sales and Business Development, where he was responsible for the Attraction, Business Development and Retail Merchandising operations for the Company.

	Prior to joining Odyssey, Mr. Gordon started, owned or managed four different entrepreneurial ventures from 1987 to 2003, including Synergy Networks which he founded in 1993 and served as CEO until September of 2003 before selling the company to the Rockefeller Group. He continued serving as President of Rockefeller Group Technology Services Mid Atlantic (RGTSMA), a member of Rockefeller Group International, until December 2004. Past work experience also includes a two-year tenure as a Management Consultant at Arthur Andersen Consulting (now Accenture).

	Mark Gordon received a B.S./Business Administration in 1982 and an MBA in Finance in 1983 from the American University. As a shipwreck diver with the National Diving Center in Washington DC, he has conducted hundreds of dives and explorations on shipwrecks and was the first person to discover and dive on the wreck of the S.S. Proteus, a ship that had been missing since the early 1900's.






 John D. Longley
Chief Operating Officer
	


  
John D. Longley was appointed Chief Operating Officer in October 2014. Previously, Mr. Longley served as Senior Vice President since 2012 and Director of Business Operations since 2005 when he joined the company. With over 25 years of marketing and business strategy experience, he has been integral in growing the company’s business opportunities including its attractions, the monetization of valuable shipwreck finds and exploring new deep-ocean opportunities that utilize Odyssey’s core competencies. 

	Mr. Longley has an instrumental role in executing major marketing programs and projects at Odyssey. Following the Gairsoppa silver recovery operations that took place in 2012 and 2013, Mr. Longley led the program to monetize the 110 tons of shipwreck silver bullion, which constituted the world’s largest precious metals recovery from a shipwreck in history at the time of recovery.

Gregory P. Stemm
Co-founder and Chairman
	


 
Greg Stemm is a co-founder and Chairman of the Board for Odyssey Marine Exploration, Inc. Previously, Mr. Stemm served as CEO of the company from 2007 to 2014. Mr. Stemm has played an important role in the development of new technologies and private sector standards for underwater cultural heritage resource management. In 1987, Mr. Stemm and his partner John Morris bought their first research vessel and ROV system and embarked on a mission to create a company dedicated to developing private sector exploration of shipwrecks while adhering to the highest standards of archaeology.

	Mr. Stemm’s first major deep-ocean shipwreck project was the “Tortugas” project, a Colonial Spanish shipwreck that was the world’s first complete remote robotic archaeological excavation. Conducted in 1990-1991 at a depth of over 1,300 feet, it was the first project of its kind to integrate acoustic positioning and detailed photography to create deep ocean photomosaic and stands as the world’s first complete deep-ocean archaeological excavation of a historical shipwreck site.

	Odyssey has discovered and explored more shipwrecks than any other company, academic group or government organization in the world. The company’s first success came in 2003 with the discovery of over 51,000 coins and 14,000 artifacts from the SS Republic, a shipwreck lost in 1865 approximately 100 miles off the coast of Georgia in 2003 and 2004. In 2007 Odyssey announced the discovery and archaeological excavation of nearly 600,000 (more than 17 tons) of silver and gold coins from a shipwreck site in the Atlantic code-named “Black Swan”. Then, in 2008, history was re-written when Odyssey discovered the shipwreck site of Admiral John Balchin’s Victory, lost in 1744, nearly 100 km from where others long thought she had sunk. Odyssey has since monitored and conducted archaeological work on the site under a contract with the Maritime Heritage Foundation which is chaired by Lord Lingfield. In 2012, Odyssey once again made history by conducting the heaviest and deepest recovery of precious metals from a shipwreck when it brought to the surface 48 tons of silver bullion from the SS Gairsoppa which lies 4,700 meters deep. In addition to these famous discoveries, Mr. Stemm has directed operations which have resulted in the discovery of hundreds of shipwrecks, ranging from ancient Roman and Phoenician sites to previously undiscovered U-boats and pirate ships in the deep oceans of the world.

	Greg has authored and edited scores of papers and articles on deep-ocean shipwreck exploration and archaeological excavation, and has given hundreds of lectures on the subject to a variety of venues including The Explorers Club, Institute of Nautical Archaeology, Young Presidents’ Organization, World Presidents’ Organization, World Business Council, Association of Dive Contractors, and The UK National Shipwreck Conference and has been a frequent enrichment lecturer for Cunard, Silver Seas, and Seabourn Cruise Lines. He is the co-editor of the Oceans Odyssey series which features a broad range of scientific papers relating to shipwrecks and exploration in the deep ocean.

	Recently published volumes include Oceans Odyssey I: Deep Sea Shipwrecks in the English Channel, Straits of Gibraltar and the Atlantic Ocean, Oceans Odyssey II: Underwater Cultural Heritage Management and Deep Sea Shipwrecks in the English Channel and Atlantic Ocean and Oceans Odyssey III: The Deep-Sea Tortugas Shipwreck, Straits of Florida : A Merchant Vessel from Spain's 1622 Tierra Firme Fleet. He has also written for Maritime Heritage Magazine, Ocean News & Technology Magazine and Underwater Magazine. Mr. Stemm has also authored dozens of opinion pieces for international publications in favor of allowing government/private party partnerships in deep-ocean exploration.

	He was a panelist at the 1998 Law of the Sea Institute and was appointed for four consecutive terms to the United States delegation to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) expert meeting to negotiate the Convention for the Protection of Underwater Cultural Heritage at UNESCO headquarters in Paris.

	Mr. Stemm has been featured as an expert on deep-ocean exploration on international television and radio programs for the past twenty years. National Geographic and PBS broadcasted a one hour special on the recovery of the SS Republic and Discovery Channel profiled Mr. Stemm and his company in 2009 as they explored the English Channel in a 13 part documentary series called Treasure Quest. Odyssey’s recent successes have also been filmed and were featured on the Discovery Channel in the Silver Rush mini-series.

	He was selected as a Fellow of The Explorers Club, and was the founder and past-president of the Professional Shipwreck Explorers Association (ProSEA), a non-profit group that provides a forum through which private sector explorers, archaeologists and governments cooperate to promote ethical policies for dealing with shipwreck resource management.

	Stemm served as a Founding Director (1986-93) and International President (1992-93) of YEO (Young Entrepreneurs Organization), the world's largest entrepreneur's organization with over 7,000 members in 113 chapters in 24 countries. YEO members average 33 years of age and together represent over $100 Billion in sales annually. He was also a founder of the Florida Aquarium and a member of the Underwater Mining Institute.

	Stemm currently serves as a Director of the International Marine Minerals Society (IMMS), a non-profit group focusing on marine minerals as a resource for study and sound application to meet world demands for strategic minerals. IMMS was founded in 1987 and includes members from government agencies, academic institutions and industry.

Odyssey Marine Exploration Reports Third Quarter 2016 Results

TAMPA, Fla., Nov.  09, 2016  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Odyssey Marine Exploration, Inc. (Nasdaq:OMEX), a pioneer in the field of deep-ocean exploration, reported results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2016. Third Quarter 2016 Highlights Performed contracted offshore services for our shipwreck business partner, using Odyssey technology and marine personnel, resulting in revenue of $2.9 million.Increased revenue 98%, or $1.4 million, compared to the same quarter last year.Decreased net loss 53% to $2.1 million compared to $4.6 million in the same quarter last year.Increased the total amount of cash available to Odyssey from Epsilon Acquisitions to $6.0 million from $3.0 million through a revised debt instrument with no additional increase in collateral. Epsilon is an investment vehicle controlled by Mr. Alonso Ancira, who is the chairman of MINOSA's parent company, AHMSA. Management Commentary"We continue to support the environmental approval process on the "Don Diego" project through our Mexican subsidiary, and we look forward to moving the project forward in the near future. Plans have been completed, and the team is prepared to begin the next phase of the project as early as Q1 2017," said Mark Gordon, Odyssey Chief Executive Officer and President. "While we await approval on the "Don Diego" project, we have focused on improving our financial discipline and results while securing offshore marine contract work to leverage our assets and technical team to generate cash flow. Our third quarter revenue results more than doubled our revenue from last quarter and were 97% higher than the same quarter last year. In addition, our Mexican partner, through Epsilon Acquisitions, agreed to provide additional funding to Odyssey. "The paid shipwreck search and recovery services anticipated in the asset purchase agreement executed in December with Monaco Financial and its affiliated companies have commenced. We conducted operations in Q3 on the first of what we expect to be a recurring series of projects for our shipwreck partner under a services agreement that generates profitable marine services revenues and provides Odyssey with a 21.25% back-end interest in the net recovery values realized from these projects. We recently completed an extensive planning process and have seven targets being reviewed for operations in 2017." Q3 2016 Financial SummaryTotal revenue in the third quarter was $2.9 million, a $1.4 million increase over the revenue in the same period a year ago and was derived from the performance of expedition marine survey services. The majority of revenue in the same quarter last year was generated from the sales of recovered cargo inventory items as well as from providing equipment and personnel to a third party offshore operator under a services agreement that generated $0.1 million of expedition revenue. Marketing, general and administrative expenses decreased by $0.4 million from $2.6 million in 2015 to $2.2 million in 2016 primarily as a result of (i) a reduction of $0.2 million of personnel and related expenses, (ii) a $0.3 million decrease in additional director fees, which were paid with equity in one of our subsidiaries in 2015, (iii) a $0.3 million increase in share based compensation amounts predominantly due to the departure of the previous chief financial officer, and (iv) $0.2 million of general corporate overhead reductions. Operations and research expenses increased by $0.6 million from 2015 to 2016 as a result of (i) a reduction of $0.7 million of Dorado Discovery charter related expenses from 2015, (ii) $2.3 million increase in marine services associated with the charter revenue earned this quarter and (iii) $1.0 million gain on sale of assets of which $0.9 million is a non-cash gain on the sale of a remotely operated vehicle to a vendor. The net loss in the third quarter of 2016 was $2.1 million or $(0.28) per share, as compared to a net loss of $4.6 million or $(0.60) per share in the same year-earlier quarter. Consolidated financial statements as well as the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended September 30, 2016, are available on the company's website at www.odysseymarine.com as well as at www.sec.gov. About Odyssey Marine ExplorationOdyssey Marine Exploration, Inc. (Nasdaq:OMEX) is engaged in deep-ocean exploration using innovative methods and state of-the-art technology. The company has numerous projects in various stages of development around the world from both our own portfolio as well as through third-party contracts. For additional details, please visit www.odysseymarine.com. Forward Looking InformationOdyssey Marine Exploration believes the information set forth in this Press Release may include "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Act of 1934. Certain factors that could cause results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements are set forth in "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 30, 2016. The financial and operating projections as well as estimates of mining assets are based solely on the assumptions developed by Odyssey that it believes are reasonable based upon information available to Odyssey as of the date of this release. All projections and estimates are subject to material uncertainties, and should not be viewed as a prediction or an assurance of actual future performance. The validity and accuracy of Odyssey's projections will depend upon unpredictable future events, many of which are beyond Odyssey's control and, accordingly, no assurance can be given that Odyssey's assumptions will prove true or that its projected results will be achieved. Cautionary Note to U.S. InvestorsThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) permits mining companies, in their filings with the SEC, to disclose only those mineral deposits that a company can economically and legally extract or produce. We use certain terms in this press release, such as "measured" "indicated," and "inferred" "resources," which the SEC guidelines strictly prohibit us from including in our filings with the SEC. "Inferred mineral resources" have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence, and great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to a higher category. U.S. investors are cautioned not to assume that part or all of the inferred mineral resource exists, or is economically or legally mineable, and urged to consider closely the disclosures in our Form 10-K which may be secured from us or from the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml.

Odyssey Marine Exploration, Inc. is an American company engaged in the salvage of deep-water shipwrecks. Odyssey salvaged the U.S. Civil War era shipwreck of the SS Republic in 2003 and recovered over 50,000 coins and 14,000 artifacts from the site nearly 1,700 feet deep. Odyssey has several shipwreck projects in various stages of development around the world, including the codenamed Black Swan Project.[3][4]

HMS Sussex[edit]




Gregory Stemm, founder and CEO of Odyssey Marine Exploration






The Odyssey Explorer is Odyssey Marine Exploration's platform to search for and recover sunken treasure.


Between 1998 and 2001, Odyssey Marine Exploration searched for HMS Sussex and stated that it had located the shipwreck off Gibraltar at a depth of 821 metres. The ship sank in a storm in 1694 during the War of the Grand Alliance as it was transporting 10 tons of gold coins to buy the allegiance of the Duke of Savoy, Victor Amadeus II, against France.
In September 2002,[5] Odyssey reached an agreement with the British government on a formula for sharing any potential spoils, under which Odyssey would get 80 percent of the proceeds up to $45 million, 50 percent from $45 million to $500 million and 40 percent above $500 million. The British government would get the rest.
The company was poised to start the excavation in the late summer of 2003,[6] according to the approved project plan and engaged Gifford and Partners to assist with archaeological aspects,[7] but the project was delayed when Odyssey discovered and began excavating the SS Republic[8] which continued until early 2003.[9] The Sussex agreement was criticized by some archaeological organizations and charities, including the Council for British Archaeology, Rescue, and the Institute of Field Archaeologists, denouncing it as a dangerous precedent for the "ransacking" of shipwrecks by private firms under the aegis of archaeological research.[10][11][12] An early day motion was signed by 60 British MPs condemning the treasure hunting.[10]
In December 2005 Odyssey began archaeological investigation of the site believed to be HMS Sussex. The company adhered to the project plan submitted and accepted by the Sussex Archaeological Executive, a committee of archaeological consultants approved by the UK Government. As of 2009, Odyssey had completed Phase 1A (the non-disturbance survey) and a substantial portion of Phase 1B (trial excavation of the site believed to be HMS Sussex) to the satisfaction of the UK Government. Odyssey was authorized by HMG to complete phase 1B of the project.[13]
Before Odyssey could complete Phase 1B of the Sussex project plan, it was stopped by the Spanish authorities, in particular the Junta of Andalusia in January 2006.[14] In early June 2006, Odyssey provided clarification to Spain's Ministry of Foreign Affairs through the offices of the embassy of the United Kingdom. Odyssey then awaited final comments on the plan before resuming operations on the shipwreck believed to be that of the Sussex.
In March 2007, Andalusia gave its assent for the excavation to start with the condition that Spanish archaeologists take part in order to ascertain that the shipwreck to be excavated was indeed the Sussex and not a Spanish vessel.[15] While waiting for Andalusia to appoint an archaeologist to participate in the Sussex expedition, the company began operations on the "Black Swan" salvage (see below) and since then, Spain has rescinded all cooperation with the company.
Frigate Mercedes[edit]

Main article: Black Swan Project
In May 2007, the company announced the salvage of 17 tons of mainly silver and some gold coins from a wreck in an undisclosed location "in international waters". The shipwreck was later proved to be that of the Spanish frigate Nuestra Señora de las Mercedes,[16] which blew up and sank in the Action of 5 October 1804.[3][17]
Following the discovery, Odyssey brought the coins and artifacts recovered into the jurisdiction of the United States Federal Court by filing an admiralty arrest pursuant to admiralty law. At that time, the Spanish government claimed that they believed the site was in Spanish territorial waters.[18] The Spanish Government has since conceded that claim and sought to claim the discovered treasure based on their belief that the Nuestra Señora de las Mercedes should be afforded sovereign immunity.[19]
On July 12, 2007, the Civil Guard seized the Odyssey Marine Exploration research vessel Ocean Alert 3.5 nautical miles (6 km) off the European coast. The Spanish Civil Guard claims to be responsible for customs control and European Union borders in this region, under the EU Schengen Agreement. This however, is disputed by the Government of Gibraltar and the UK Government who claim that the ship was detained in international waters near Gibraltar and that Spain therefore had no legal authority to board the vessel without the express consent of the flag state of the ship — in this case Panama. The Gibraltar Government stated that although this was a matter for the Government of Panama, they are "concerned that international shipping using Gibraltar port should be interfered with in this way in international waters."[20]
The ship was ordered to sail to the Spanish port of Algeciras to undergo a search and inspection.[21] Issues include the value and cultural significance of the shipwreck and the disputed status of Gibraltar between the UK and Spain.[22] Panama is also involved because Odyssey's vessel is flagged there.[23]
A U.S. federal judge awarded the treasure to Spain in December 2009, on the ground that the ship remained the property of Spain, but Odyssey appealed the ruling. Finally, after a five-year legal battle, in February 2012 the U.S. Supreme Court ordered Odyssey Marine to relinquish the treasure to Spanish authorities. Spain's culture minister indicated the treasure would be divided among several national museums.[24] In September 2013, a U.S. district judge further ruled that Odyssey had acted in "bad faith", should have recognized Spain's right, and should thus reimburse $1 million in Spain's attorneys fees.[25] Odyssey then issued a statement recognizing that this case was unusual and that the court ruling has clarified the applicable law, which Odyssey is committed to respecting.
Other underwater searches[edit]
In 2009, Odyssey Marine Exploration's searches were the subject of the Discovery Channel program, Treasure Quest.
In 2014, Odyssey Marine Exploration was selected to salvage gold from the 1857 shipwreck of the SS Central America.[26]
Financial difficulties[edit]
Odyssey's stock price fell below $1 in 2014 and traded even lower in 2015.
In December 2015, Odyssey announced the sale of part of its assets to a company called Monaco Financials for $21 million. This capital allowed the company to reimburse a $11.7 million bank debt. Sold assets included the company's headquarters building in Florida, 50% of underwater mining business Neptune Minerals and a profit sharing agreement on future shipwreck salvages. CEO Mark Gordon also stated that the company would refocus on underwater mining, while treasure hunting would remain "part of the mix".[27]

HMS Sussex[edit]




Gregory Stemm, founder and CEO of Odyssey Marine Exploration






The Odyssey Explorer is Odyssey Marine Exploration's platform to search for and recover sunken treasure.


Between 1998 and 2001, Odyssey Marine Exploration searched for HMS Sussex and stated that it had located the shipwreck off Gibraltar at a depth of 821 metres. The ship sank in a storm in 1694 during the War of the Grand Alliance as it was transporting 10 tons of gold coins to buy the allegiance of the Duke of Savoy, Victor Amadeus II, against France.
In September 2002,[5] Odyssey reached an agreement with the British government on a formula for sharing any potential spoils, under which Odyssey would get 80 percent of the proceeds up to $45 million, 50 percent from $45 million to $500 million and 40 percent above $500 million. The British government would get the rest.
The company was poised to start the excavation in the late summer of 2003,[6] according to the approved project plan and engaged Gifford and Partners to assist with archaeological aspects,[7] but the project was delayed when Odyssey discovered and began excavating the SS Republic[8] which continued until early 2003.[9] The Sussex agreement was criticized by some archaeological organizations and charities, including the Council for British Archaeology, Rescue, and the Institute of Field Archaeologists, denouncing it as a dangerous precedent for the "ransacking" of shipwrecks by private firms under the aegis of archaeological research.[10][11][12] An early day motion was signed by 60 British MPs condemning the treasure hunting.[10]
In December 2005 Odyssey began archaeological investigation of the site believed to be HMS Sussex. The company adhered to the project plan submitted and accepted by the Sussex Archaeological Executive, a committee of archaeological consultants approved by the UK Government. As of 2009, Odyssey had completed Phase 1A (the non-disturbance survey) and a substantial portion of Phase 1B (trial excavation of the site believed to be HMS Sussex) to the satisfaction of the UK Government. Odyssey was authorized by HMG to complete phase 1B of the project.[13]
Before Odyssey could complete Phase 1B of the Sussex project plan, it was stopped by the Spanish authorities, in particular the Junta of Andalusia in January 2006.[14] In early June 2006, Odyssey provided clarification to Spain's Ministry of Foreign Affairs through the offices of the embassy of the United Kingdom. Odyssey then awaited final comments on the plan before resuming operations on the shipwreck believed to be that of the Sussex.
In March 2007, Andalusia gave its assent for the excavation to start with the condition that Spanish archaeologists take part in order to ascertain that the shipwreck to be excavated was indeed the Sussex and not a Spanish vessel.[15] While waiting for Andalusia to appoint an archaeologist to participate in the Sussex expedition, the company began operations on the "Black Swan" salvage (see below) and since then, Spain has rescinded all cooperation with the company.

Odyssey Marine Exploration, Inc. is an American company engaged in the salvage of deep-water shipwrecks. Odyssey salvaged the U.S. Civil War era shipwreck of the SS Republic in 2003 and recovered over 50,000 coins and 14,000 artifacts from the site nearly 1,700 feet deep. Odyssey has several shipwreck projects in various stages of development around the world, including the codenamed Black Swan Project.[3][4]

HMS Sussex[edit]




Gregory Stemm, founder and CEO of Odyssey Marine Exploration






The Odyssey Explorer is Odyssey Marine Exploration's platform to search for and recover sunken treasure.


Between 1998 and 2001, Odyssey Marine Exploration searched for HMS Sussex and stated that it had located the shipwreck off Gibraltar at a depth of 821 metres. The ship sank in a storm in 1694 during the War of the Grand Alliance as it was transporting 10 tons of gold coins to buy the allegiance of the Duke of Savoy, Victor Amadeus II, against France.
In September 2002,[5] Odyssey reached an agreement with the British government on a formula for sharing any potential spoils, under which Odyssey would get 80 percent of the proceeds up to $45 million, 50 percent from $45 million to $500 million and 40 percent above $500 million. The British government would get the rest.
The company was poised to start the excavation in the late summer of 2003,[6] according to the approved project plan and engaged Gifford and Partners to assist with archaeological aspects,[7] but the project was delayed when Odyssey discovered and began excavating the SS Republic[8] which continued until early 2003.[9] The Sussex agreement was criticized by some archaeological organizations and charities, including the Council for British Archaeology, Rescue, and the Institute of Field Archaeologists, denouncing it as a dangerous precedent for the "ransacking" of shipwrecks by private firms under the aegis of archaeological research.[10][11][12] An early day motion was signed by 60 British MPs condemning the treasure hunting.[10]
In December 2005 Odyssey began archaeological investigation of the site believed to be HMS Sussex. The company adhered to the project plan submitted and accepted by the Sussex Archaeological Executive, a committee of archaeological consultants approved by the UK Government. As of 2009, Odyssey had completed Phase 1A (the non-disturbance survey) and a substantial portion of Phase 1B (trial excavation of the site believed to be HMS Sussex) to the satisfaction of the UK Government. Odyssey was authorized by HMG to complete phase 1B of the project.[13]
Before Odyssey could complete Phase 1B of the Sussex project plan, it was stopped by the Spanish authorities, in particular the Junta of Andalusia in January 2006.[14] In early June 2006, Odyssey provided clarification to Spain's Ministry of Foreign Affairs through the offices of the embassy of the United Kingdom. Odyssey then awaited final comments on the plan before resuming operations on the shipwreck believed to be that of the Sussex.
In March 2007, Andalusia gave its assent for the excavation to start with the condition that Spanish archaeologists take part in order to ascertain that the shipwreck to be excavated was indeed the Sussex and not a Spanish vessel.[15] While waiting for Andalusia to appoint an archaeologist to participate in the Sussex expedition, the company began operations on the "Black Swan" salvage (see below) and since then, Spain has rescinded all cooperation with the company.
Frigate Mercedes[edit]



Wikinews has related news: 500 million US dollars worth of treasure found off coast of Cornwall UK


Main article: Black Swan Project
In May 2007, the company announced the salvage of 17 tons of mainly silver and some gold coins from a wreck in an undisclosed location "in international waters". The shipwreck was later proved to be that of the Spanish frigate Nuestra Señora de las Mercedes,[16] which blew up and sank in the Action of 5 October 1804.[3][17]
Following the discovery, Odyssey brought the coins and artifacts recovered into the jurisdiction of the United States Federal Court by filing an admiralty arrest pursuant to admiralty law. At that time, the Spanish government claimed that they believed the site was in Spanish territorial waters.[18] The Spanish Government has since conceded that claim and sought to claim the discovered treasure based on their belief that the Nuestra Señora de las Mercedes should be afforded sovereign immunity.[19]
On July 12, 2007, the Civil Guard seized the Odyssey Marine Exploration research vessel Ocean Alert 3.5 nautical miles (6 km) off the European coast. The Spanish Civil Guard claims to be responsible for customs control and European Union borders in this region, under the EU Schengen Agreement. This however, is disputed by the Government of Gibraltar and the UK Government who claim that the ship was detained in international waters near Gibraltar and that Spain therefore had no legal authority to board the vessel without the express consent of the flag state of the ship — in this case Panama. The Gibraltar Government stated that although this was a matter for the Government of Panama, they are "concerned that international shipping using Gibraltar port should be interfered with in this way in international waters."[20]
The ship was ordered to sail to the Spanish port of Algeciras to undergo a search and inspection.[21] Issues include the value and cultural significance of the shipwreck and the disputed status of Gibraltar between the UK and Spain.[22] Panama is also involved because Odyssey's vessel is flagged there.[23]
A U.S. federal judge awarded the treasure to Spain in December 2009, on the ground that the ship remained the property of Spain, but Odyssey appealed the ruling. Finally, after a five-year legal battle, in February 2012 the U.S. Supreme Court ordered Odyssey Marine to relinquish the treasure to Spanish authorities. Spain's culture minister indicated the treasure would be divided among several national museums.[24] In September 2013, a U.S. district judge further ruled that Odyssey had acted in "bad faith", should have recognized Spain's right, and should thus reimburse $1 million in Spain's attorneys fees.[25] Odyssey then issued a statement recognizing that this case was unusual and that the court ruling has clarified the applicable law, which Odyssey is committed to respecting.
Other underwater searches[edit]
In 2009, Odyssey Marine Exploration's searches were the subject of the Discovery Channel program, Treasure Quest.
In 2014, Odyssey Marine Exploration was selected to salvage gold from the 1857 shipwreck of the SS Central America.[26]
Financial difficulties[edit]
Odyssey's stock price fell below $1 in 2014 and traded even lower in 2015.
In December 2015, Odyssey announced the sale of part of its assets to a company called Monaco Financials for $21 million. This capital allowed the company to reimburse a $11.7 million bank debt. Sold assets included the company's headquarters building in Florida, 50% of underwater mining business Neptune Minerals and a profit sharing agreement on future shipwreck salvages. CEO Mark Gordon also stated that the company would refocus on underwater mining, while treasure hunting would remain "part of the mix".[27]

   OEM vs. Aftermarket Boat Parts   When buying boat parts, should you buy an aftermarket part, or stick with original equipment manufacturer (OEM) parts?  There is some controversy over this, but the debate is far from being cut and dried. ... read more   Like most others, I once believed that an OEM part was always superior to an aftermarket part.  Unfortunately, the word “aftermarket” seems to carry some negative connotations.  So what are the real differences between an OEM part and an aftermarket part, and where do aftermarket parts find their place in this day and age?  Some time ago, there was no such thing as an “aftermarket” part.  Everything was made directly by the original manufacturers.  Eventually, these manufacturers found it beneficial to outsource production and manufacturing duties to other factories, who were one day also able to replicate these parts and sell them to other distributors.  These parts became known as aftermarket.  When most people think of aftermarket parts, they probably think of a huge production line overseas pumping out mass quantities of low-quality parts.  While this sometimes may not be far from the truth, these parts are usually of a higher quality than one would originally expect.  In fact, these parts are more often than not the exact same part that you would get from an authorized dealer.  The reason for this is that a lot of the original manufacturers use the same factories, and even the same companies, to manufacture their parts.  So what is often the big difference between these parts?  The answer is the packaging the part comes in and the brand that it is labeled as being.  There are several reasons why you might choose an aftermarket part over its OEM alternative.  In this day and age, we find most people going aftermarket for economic reasons. OEM dealers often get by under the guise that their parts are original and therefore are superior, or that an aftermarket part is cheap and will under-perform and potentially damage your motor.  This enables them to charge astronomical prices in most cases, whereas an aftermarket part is usually far less expensive.  Aside from that, you may be the owner of an older motor or boat and the OEM part is no longer available, but an aftermarket company still makes a replacement for said part. Or you simply can’t find the OEM part in your area, whereas you can easily find and order an aftermarket alternative online.  Perhaps you want to change either the appearance of the performance of your motor or boat from its stock condition and no authorized dealer can help you find what you need.  Maybe your boat is taking too long to plane out evenly and you want to adjust the pitch of your propeller, but an OEM propeller isn’t offered in anything other than what you already have.  Most likely, you can find various aftermarket propellers to achieve this.  These are just a few examples of why you may find it beneficial to go with an aftermarket part.  The debate rages on over which is better and why, but the evidence is clear and shouldn’t sway you from deciding to go aftermarket.  Your wallet and boat may thank you for it!   read less       8 Tips to Keeping Your Boat Motor Cool   Overheating is a major cause of death for marine engines,including gas and diesel stern drives, inboards and outboard motors. In fact some industry statistics say as many of 70% of all premature engine deaths emanate from the malady. ... read more    Saving the day, some modern power plants have engine warning systems that literally sound the alarm when the temperature begins to rise towards dangerous temperatures. When that happens, onboard firmware automatically reduces rpm so the boat can, in most cases, limp home. That technology is a great fail safe. But what would be even better is some kind of plan to prevent the overheating in the first place. With that in mind here are some ideas to keep in mind.  Most of the time engines overheat because the impeller isn’t pumping water to the cylinder block and heads. So naturally it follows - keeping track of impeller health is a good idea. On inboards and stern drives that can be as simple as removing the inspection cover and looking at it. You don’t necessarily have to remove it. Visually determine whether all of the blades are present. And are any of the blades showing cracks or checkering? If so don’t hesitate to replace the worn impeller at once. Not only is it in danger of complete failure, when blades strip off they flow downstream into the engine where they could obstruct cooling flow. Another important checkpoint is the raw water filter. Go to the trouble of making sure it’s not plugged. At the same time check all of the cooling system hoses, one at a time. Start at the hull thru fitting. Visually inspect the hoses with a flashlight looking for checkering or cracks, once again, clues that near term failure is possible. Next, squeeze each hose in turn. A cooling hose should feel supple, and not hard. Most of the time when you find a hardened hose it will be on the engine. That’s because ambient engine heat hour after running hour has baked it to a crisp. Outboard motor impellers are strategically located in the lower unit. The lower unit is exposed to sunlight, which over time can bake the impeller. Baked impellers have lost resilience. Hard impeller blades strip off. Also over time, and this includes inboard and stern drive impellers, impellers lose their flexibility and take a set - meaning the blades don’t stick out from the hub at a 90 degree angle and are curved. When that happens they will still pump water, just not very much. Knowing that, some boat owners make a preemptive strike and remove and replace the impeller every two or three years. Another overheating culprit is the thermostat. Sometimes they stick open, in which case the engine may not warm up to its normal operating temperature. And in other instances the thermostat sticks tight in the closed position. The good news is changing a thermostat is easy even for a fumble fingered do-it-yourselfer. But what do you do when you think the engine is overheating and you don’t have, or simply don’t trust, the temperature gauge? The answer is as simple as the sea is salt. Shut down the engine for safety sake. Then carefully touch the cylinder head. You should almost, but not quite, be able to lay you hand on it. But if it is sizzling hot, there’s an overheating problem. If you’re squeamish about touching a warm engine, no problem, flick some water onto the engine and watch the results. If the water beads up and sizzles away into evaporation, there’s a problem. There are other high tech solutions worth considering. For about $50 and up you can buy an infrared temperature gun. To use it, simply aim it at the work piece and squeeze the trigger. The temperature display tells you how hot it is. Also you should know about temperature crayons. They come denominated in different temperature ranges. With this method, scribe a mark with the crayon on the work piece. If the crayon residue melts then the temperature is as least the rating of the crayon. Besides the temp gauge, outboard motors also shoot an indicator stream that shows the impeller is hard working. Sometimes when the stream stops it means the impeller is dead. Sometimes it just means the indicator streams plumbing is plugged up. That’s why I have a two-foot section of 300-pound monofilament fish line under the cowling tied to the engine. If the stream stops, I jab the stiff monofilament into the orifice and clean it out. If water begins to flow anew, all is well. Finally, the best prevention for engine overheating is to trust the temperature gauge and monitor it often. Consider rotating the temp gauge so its needle points straight up when registering normal engine temperature. Then if the temp begins to rise you’ll see it immediately.iboats.com carries all brands of impellers, thermostats, hoses, gauges and more.    Written by Tim Banse  Tim Banse is a marine engines expert and has written about propulsion for Popular Mechanics, Yachting, Motor Boating, Boating Industry and other publications around the world.

An article from Marine Technician Today Magazine outlining the process of a tune-up on your boat engine. ... read more  -- By Bill Brannis (Marine Technician Today Magazine; Summer 2013) What exactly is a tune-up ? By definition a tune-up is a series of lubrications, tests, and adjustments that the manufacturer requires at specified intervals to keep the engine in peak operating condition.  A quality shop will perform various checks and procedures to keep their customers happy and remaining loyal to them. No technician or shop owner wants to hear about a customer stranded on the water like the couple shown in Figure #1.  Most outboards require service every 100 hours or once a year, whichever comes first. Evinrude E-TEC models have a longer schedule – 3 years/300 hours in fresh-water with fresh-water recreational use. Boaters in salt-water areas and those in commercial usage or high performance boating have shorter service periods because of the corrosive nature of seawater and the heavier duty operating conditions. A 4-stroke may require 50 hours or 6 month interval oil changes if the motor is run at low speeds (trolling) or high speeds for extended periods of time. If it has an “extended warranty,” in order to keep it valid, most contracts state “…the engine must be maintained per manufacture’s recommendations.” Keep in mind that the whole rig should be visually inspected for overall condition and what service needs are to be recommended.  Types of usage (commercial, high-performance, etc.) and environmental conditions (salt, muddy, or shallow water) determine the type and the frequency of service needed. Discuss water pump and thermostat servicing with your customer. This also depends on operating conditions and type of use as well as engine hours.  Do not attempt to service without the correct service manual, tools, supplies and a thorough understanding of the procedures. Use common sense and observe safety precautions around moving parts, flammable liquids, and high voltage ignitions. With both 2-stroke and 4-stroke engines, each particular outboard is different and may have additional items that have to be addressed. This article is only an overview of servicing procedures.  INSPECTION and PROPELLER  The first step is a complete visual inspection of the motor along with the steering system and control cables and other boat systems. Check hoses for deterioration and inspect everything for leaks and for worn, damaged or missing items. Remove the propeller and look for fishing line in the seals. Timing belts, air filters and alternator belts are some additional inspection items along with belt tensioners and pulleys that various outboards have. Props should be rebuilt or replaced if damaged to prevent harmful vibrations from affecting the outboard. For safety, leave the propeller off until all the servicing is completed. Check and replace the zinc anodes if needed. Some 4-strokes use internal cylinder block anodes for cooling system corrosion protection.  SPARKPLUGS and IGNITION  Remove the plugs and lay them out in order; note if any one sparkplug looks significantly different from the others. A good plug has sharp edges on the side and center electrodes with no rounded or eroded areas. Flakes of carbon mean a possible rich running, poor oil quality, leaking injectors, or open thermostats. A tan center ceramic is ideal, but in outboards, the color can vary from off white to almost black. Always check for the outboard manufacture’s latest plug recommendations since changes may have taken place since a manual was printed. Evinrude FICHT and E-TEC engines require an additional step of positioning (indexing) the plug gap within 90° on either side of the fuel injector nozzle centerline.  Ignition output is important for quick starting, smooth idling and good acceleration. Perform the procedures outlined in the service manual using the proper tools. If the spark is weak or not consistent, find out why before going any further. Inspect the wiring, coils and connections for carbon tracks or deterioration. Replace and gap the sparkplugs if needed.  COMPRESSION  A compression test indicates the internal condition of the motor’s pistons, cylinders and rings. Use a quality gauge and record the readings. Most manuals do not list the compression pressures but recommend results within 15% of each other on a healthy engine. Some Yamaha and Johnson-Evinrude outboards have staggered compression ratios so the bottom cylinders could have lower readings than the upper ones, but they should be close from side to side. A scored cylinder or piston may give a good reading at times because of residual oil sealing the grooves. Occasionally a low cylinder will improve after using a carbon-cleaning compound that frees up the stuck piston rings. This is a good time to torque the head bolts while the motor is cold if applicable.  Perform a leakdown test on 4-stroke engines as that is the only true test of those motor’s internal health. By listening to air coming out of the intake, exhaust, or crankcase it is easy to determine the source of leakage on a cylinder and piston that does not hold at least 90% of the air from the tester.  GEARCASE  Drain the lower unit oil. If clear water comes out or metal chips are seen, the gearcase should be disassembled and inspected. Metal “fuzz” on magnetic drain plugs is normal, but chunks or chips are not. Use the manufacture’s recommended lubricant and refill from the lower hole until oil appears at the upper threads. New gaskets or o-rings under the screws assure a tight seal. Inspect the prop shaft for wobble and the seals for damage or fishing line. Grease the splines to prevent corrosion and a stuck prop. Install a new cotter-pin if applicable.  LUBRICATION  Lubricate all the fittings with approved marine grease. Hood latches and other sliding parts work easier with a slight film of lube. Use silicone spray on carb linkages, contrary to the glob of grease that some factories recommend. Avoid spraying around the starter drive to prevent it from slipping. If you have a fuel injected Yamaha OX66, keep silicone away from the oxygen sensor located on the starboard side. Use care with a petroleum-based coatings if you spray it on the engine for corrosion prevention. Sparkplug wires, rubber and plastic could be affected. A greasy film will attract dirt and grit, plus it makes future servicing a sticky messy ordeal. You will spend extra time and shop rags cleaning off your hands and tools quite often to keep fingerprints from the boat’s upholstery, trim, and gelcoat.  4-strokes require and oil and filter change which is best done while the motor is warm. An experienced technician will soon learn a servicing sequence that will maximize his efficiency in performing the tune-up procedure in the shortest amount of time. For best results use an FC-W certified 4-stroke outboard oil if you do not use the manufacturer’s oil. That way it prevents any question of improper lubricant use should a warranty situation arise down the road.  LINKAGE  Synchronization of the spark timing to the throttle opening and the removal of the carb or throttle body linkage free-play are known as “sync and link” adjustments. Service manuals show detailed step by step instructions because of the importance of these settings for a smooth running motor. Do not overlook the oil pump linkage adjustments on certain 2-stroke engines.  Electronic fuel injected motors may require a throttle position sensor (TPS) adjustment using a digital voltmeter. Again, follow the manual exactly for this critical setting.  WARNING SYSTEMS  Test the integrity of the alarm systems. With the key on and motor off, disconnect the temp sender wire connector and ground it with a test lead. The warning horn should sound. On System Check gauges, the overheat LED will illuminate but the buzzer will not activate unless the motor is running. It is wise to test oil pressure switches and water-in-filter sensors if equipped per the service manual. Digital dash gauges may have different procedures.  FUEL and OIL  Using a clean glass jar to inspect a fuel sample from the engine. It should be clean and clear with no debris, water or varnish smell. A turkey-baster works well for sampling the bottom of a remote oil tanks for sludge, water, or gelled oil. The engine mounted tanks on V4 and V6 Yamahas collect condensation in a 2” clear hose and should be examined regularly. Suzuki and Yamaha recommend the annual replacement of the oil filter assembly between the tank and the oil pump.  Replace and/or clean all boat mounted and motor mounted filters. If there is no boat mounted fuel-water separator, suggest one for your customer and emphasize its importance with today’s ethanol fuels which attract moisture. Pour the correct amount of a fuel additive into the gas tank to help clean out the system and to stabilize the fuel. This is very important if ethanol E-10 gasoline is used. Inspect the condition of the hoses, clamps, and any fuel valves.  ELECTRICAL SYSTEM  Use an ammeter in conjunction with a voltmeter to test the electrical system. Crank the engine for about 15 seconds with the kill switch removed. A healthy battery will show 10 volts or more during cranking or test it with a quality load tester. Make sure the battery terminals and cable ends are shiny clean and replace any wing-nuts with regular nuts and lock-washers for secure connections. Distilled water is recommended for topping off regular batteries. According to ABYC standards the positive terminals should be protected with vinyl covers if the battery is not mounted in a covered box and the battery is to be securely tied down so it will not move around in rough water.  Start the motor and monitor an inductive ammeter to read the charging output. Compare the results with the service manual specifications. On computer controlled outboards, download an engine report from the ECU and save it with the customer service records. Technically oriented owners may want a copy for themselves. Check for any error codes and correct any recent abnormal indications.  TIMING and TEMPERATURE  Set the carb-pickup timing or engine idle timing according to the service manual in addition to the linkage adjustments. Thermostat operation can be checked with an infrared temp gun or the finger method. If you can hold your fingers on top of each cylinder head for more than 3 full seconds, chances are that the engine is not warming up enough for proper operation. CARBON CLEANING Periodic use of a carbon remover is essential to long outboard life by keeping the rings and the pistons free of accumulated combustion byproducts on both 2-stroke and 4-stroke outboards. Cleaners like Mercury’s Power Tune, Yamaha’s Combustion Cleaner, or Evinrude’s Engine Tuner have instructions on the can. After waiting the recommended amount of time, run the engine for at least 15 minutes at low speed to clean things out before applying full power. Do this before changing engine oil and filter in a 4-stroke. For even better cleaning, add the proper quantity of a fuel additive carbon cleaner to the gas tank according to the manufacturer’s policies.  FINAL ADJUSTMENTS  Idle speed and carb adjustments (if equipped) must be done in the water for proper exhaust backpressure, not on a hose flusher. Use an accurate tachometer and be patient while getting everything “dialed in” perfectly. Some multi-carb and certain EFI engines may need intake vacuum balancing for a smooth and consistent idle. Do not overlook valve adjustments that may be required at specified intervals. Although they are not often part of a regular tune-up, they are an important procedure affecting the drivability and longevity of a 4-stroke outboard.  Run the boat at all speeds after carefully setting the full throttle timing if required. Check that the top operating rpm is within the upper half of the factory recommended range for best performance.  read less      The Basic Parts of a Boat   Although no two boat models are exactly alike, all boats have the same basic layout and format: ... read more    Hull The hull is the overall body/shape of the boat. Different shapes appeal better to certain boat styles. There are five basic hull types: flat, shallow vee, deep vee, round, and catamaran. The hull's size is measured by two main measurements. 1) centerline (length from tip of the bow to the edge of the transom) and, 2) beam (width from the widest point on the gunwale). The Bow At the tip/head of the boat is the bow. The bow of the boat can be opened or closed, depending on the make. Some open bow models will have installed seats/seating groups. Simultaneously, some models include windshields and/or bow rails, whether they are opened or closed bow. Stern/Transom The stern and transom are at the rear of the boat. Propellers and engines are always in the stern/transom area, which gives all boats their primary source of movement. This area includes features such as engines (specifically outboard), transom ladders, swim platforms, and so on. Port/Starboard/Gunwale The port side of a boat indicates the left-hand side of the boat when standing in the boat and facing directly toward the bow. Similarly, the starboard side of the boat is the right-hand side. The sides of the port and starboard positions where different accessories and components are mounted is the gunwale (gun-nel). The gunwale allows several different features to be installed onto it (depending on the style of boat), such as bimini tops, wakeboard towers, side rails, etc. Engines There are three main styles of engines: outboard, sterndrive, and inboard. Engines are stored either at the transom of the boat or stored within the hull with the rest of the engine protruding out the backside.         Outboard Sterndrive Inboard    These different engines pair up with certain boats depending on the boat's style and size, the type of steering, and many other contributing factors.  read less

HMS Sussex[edit]




Gregory Stemm, founder and CEO of Odyssey Marine Exploration






The Odyssey Explorer is Odyssey Marine Exploration's platform to search for and recover sunken treasure.


Between 1998 and 2001, Odyssey Marine Exploration searched for HMS Sussex and stated that it had located the shipwreck off Gibraltar at a depth of 821 metres. The ship sank in a storm in 1694 during the War of the Grand Alliance as it was transporting 10 tons of gold coins to buy the allegiance of the Duke of Savoy, Victor Amadeus II, against France.
In September 2002,[5] Odyssey reached an agreement with the British government on a formula for sharing any potential spoils, under which Odyssey would get 80 percent of the proceeds up to $45 million, 50 percent from $45 million to $500 million and 40 percent above $500 million. The British government would get the rest.
The company was poised to start the excavation in the late summer of 2003,[6] according to the approved project plan and engaged Gifford and Partners to assist with archaeological aspects,[7] but the project was delayed when Odyssey discovered and began excavating the SS Republic[8] which continued until early 2003.[9] The Sussex agreement was criticized by some archaeological organizations and charities, including the Council for British Archaeology, Rescue, and the Institute of Field Archaeologists, denouncing it as a dangerous precedent for the "ransacking" of shipwrecks by private firms under the aegis of archaeological research.[10][11][12] An early day motion was signed by 60 British MPs condemning the treasure hunting.[10]
In December 2005 Odyssey began archaeological investigation of the site believed to be HMS Sussex. The company adhered to the project plan submitted and accepted by the Sussex Archaeological Executive, a committee of archaeological consultants approved by the UK Government. As of 2009, Odyssey had completed Phase 1A (the non-disturbance survey) and a substantial portion of Phase 1B (trial excavation of the site believed to be HMS Sussex) to the satisfaction of the UK Government. Odyssey was authorized by HMG to complete phase 1B of the project.[13]
Before Odyssey could complete Phase 1B of the Sussex project plan, it was stopped by the Spanish authorities, in particular the Junta of Andalusia in January 2006.[14] In early June 2006, Odyssey provided clarification to Spain's Ministry of Foreign Affairs through the offices of the embassy of the United Kingdom. Odyssey then awaited final comments on the plan before resuming operations on the shipwreck believed to be that of the Sussex.
In March 2007, Andalusia gave its assent for the excavation to start with the condition that Spanish archaeologists take part in order to ascertain that the shipwreck to be excavated was indeed the Sussex and not a Spanish vessel.[15] While waiting for Andalusia to appoint an archaeologist to participate in the Sussex expedition, the company began operations on the "Black Swan" salvage (see below) and since then, Spain has rescinded all cooperation with the company.
Frigate Mercedes[edit]



Wikinews has related news: 500 million US dollars worth of treasure found off coast of Cornwall UK


Main article: Black Swan Project
In May 2007, the company announced the salvage of 17 tons of mainly silver and some gold coins from a wreck in an undisclosed location "in international waters". The shipwreck was later proved to be that of the Spanish frigate Nuestra Señora de las Mercedes,[16] which blew up and sank in the Action of 5 October 1804.[3][17]
Following the discovery, Odyssey brought the coins and artifacts recovered into the jurisdiction of the United States Federal Court by filing an admiralty arrest pursuant to admiralty law. At that time, the Spanish government claimed that they believed the site was in Spanish territorial waters.[18] The Spanish Government has since conceded that claim and sought to claim the discovered treasure based on their belief that the Nuestra Señora de las Mercedes should be afforded sovereign immunity.[19]
On July 12, 2007, the Civil Guard seized the Odyssey Marine Exploration research vessel Ocean Alert 3.5 nautical miles (6 km) off the European coast. The Spanish Civil Guard claims to be responsible for customs control and European Union borders in this region, under the EU Schengen Agreement. This however, is disputed by the Government of Gibraltar and the UK Government who claim that the ship was detained in international waters near Gibraltar and that Spain therefore had no legal authority to board the vessel without the express consent of the flag state of the ship — in this case Panama. The Gibraltar Government stated that although this was a matter for the Government of Panama, they are "concerned that international shipping using Gibraltar port should be interfered with in this way in international waters."[20]
The ship was ordered to sail to the Spanish port of Algeciras to undergo a search and inspection.[21] Issues include the value and cultural significance of the shipwreck and the disputed status of Gibraltar between the UK and Spain.[22] Panama is also involved because Odyssey's vessel is flagged there.[23]
A U.S. federal judge awarded the treasure to Spain in December 2009, on the ground that the ship remained the property of Spain, but Odyssey appealed the ruling. Finally, after a five-year legal battle, in February 2012 the U.S. Supreme Court ordered Odyssey Marine to relinquish the treasure to Spanish authorities. Spain's culture minister indicated the treasure would be divided among several national museums.[24] In September 2013, a U.S. district judge further ruled that Odyssey had acted in "bad faith", should have recognized Spain's right, and should thus reimburse $1 million in Spain's attorneys fees.[25] Odyssey then issued a statement recognizing that this case was unusual and that the court ruling has clarified the applicable law, which Odyssey is committed to respecting.
Other underwater searches[edit]
In 2009, Odyssey Marine Exploration's searches were the subject of the Discovery Channel program, Treasure Quest.
In 2014, Odyssey Marine Exploration was selected to salvage gold from the 1857 shipwreck of the SS Central America.[26]
Financial difficulties[edit]
Odyssey's stock price fell below $1 in 2014 and traded even lower in 2015.
In December 2015, Odyssey announced the sale of part of its assets to a company called Monaco Financials for $21 million. This capital allowed the company to reimburse a $11.7 million bank debt. Sold assets included the company's headquarters building in Florida, 50% of underwater mining business Neptune Minerals and a profit sharing agreement on future shipwreck salvages. CEO Mark Gordon also stated that the company would refocus on underwater mining, while treasure hunting would remain "part of the mix".[27]

HMS Sussex[edit]




Gregory Stemm, founder and CEO of Odyssey Marine Exploration






The Odyssey Explorer is Odyssey Marine Exploration's platform to search for and recover sunken treasure.


Between 1998 and 2001, Odyssey Marine Exploration searched for HMS Sussex and stated that it had located the shipwreck off Gibraltar at a depth of 821 metres. The ship sank in a storm in 1694 during the War of the Grand Alliance as it was transporting 10 tons of gold coins to buy the allegiance of the Duke of Savoy, Victor Amadeus II, against France.
In September 2002,[5] Odyssey reached an agreement with the British government on a formula for sharing any potential spoils, under which Odyssey would get 80 percent of the proceeds up to $45 million, 50 percent from $45 million to $500 million and 40 percent above $500 million. The British government would get the rest.
The company was poised to start the excavation in the late summer of 2003,[6] according to the approved project plan and engaged Gifford and Partners to assist with archaeological aspects,[7] but the project was delayed when Odyssey discovered and began excavating the SS Republic[8] which continued until early 2003.[9] The Sussex agreement was criticized by some archaeological organizations and charities, including the Council for British Archaeology, Rescue, and the Institute of Field Archaeologists, denouncing it as a dangerous precedent for the "ransacking" of shipwrecks by private firms under the aegis of archaeological research.[10][11][12] An early day motion was signed by 60 British MPs condemning the treasure hunting.[10]
In December 2005 Odyssey began archaeological investigation of the site believed to be HMS Sussex. The company adhered to the project plan submitted and accepted by the Sussex Archaeological Executive, a committee of archaeological consultants approved by the UK Government. As of 2009, Odyssey had completed Phase 1A (the non-disturbance survey) and a substantial portion of Phase 1B (trial excavation of the site believed to be HMS Sussex) to the satisfaction of the UK Government. Odyssey was authorized by HMG to complete phase 1B of the project.[13]
Before Odyssey could complete Phase 1B of the Sussex project plan, it was stopped by the Spanish authorities, in particular the Junta of Andalusia in January 2006.[14] In early June 2006, Odyssey provided clarification to Spain's Ministry of Foreign Affairs through the offices of the embassy of the United Kingdom. Odyssey then awaited final comments on the plan before resuming operations on the shipwreck believed to be that of the Sussex.
In March 2007, Andalusia gave its assent for the excavation to start with the condition that Spanish archaeologists take part in order to ascertain that the shipwreck to be excavated was indeed the Sussex and not a Spanish vessel.[15] While waiting for Andalusia to appoint an archaeologist to participate in the Sussex expedition, the company began operations on the "Black Swan" salvage (see below) and since then, Spain has rescinded all cooperation with the company.
Frigate Mercedes[edit]



Wikinews has related news: 500 million US dollars worth of treasure found off coast of Cornwall UK


Main article: Black Swan Project
In May 2007, the company announced the salvage of 17 tons of mainly silver and some gold coins from a wreck in an undisclosed location "in international waters". The shipwreck was later proved to be that of the Spanish frigate Nuestra Señora de las Mercedes,[16] which blew up and sank in the Action of 5 October 1804.[3][17]
Following the discovery, Odyssey brought the coins and artifacts recovered into the jurisdiction of the United States Federal Court by filing an admiralty arrest pursuant to admiralty law. At that time, the Spanish government claimed that they believed the site was in Spanish territorial waters.[18] The Spanish Government has since conceded that claim and sought to claim the discovered treasure based on their belief that the Nuestra Señora de las Mercedes should be afforded sovereign immunity.[19]
On July 12, 2007, the Civil Guard seized the Odyssey Marine Exploration research vessel Ocean Alert 3.5 nautical miles (6 km) off the European coast. The Spanish Civil Guard claims to be responsible for customs control and European Union borders in this region, under the EU Schengen Agreement. This however, is disputed by the Government of Gibraltar and the UK Government who claim that the ship was detained in international waters near Gibraltar and that Spain therefore had no legal authority to board the vessel without the express consent of the flag state of the ship — in this case Panama. The Gibraltar Government stated that although this was a matter for the Government of Panama, they are "concerned that international shipping using Gibraltar port should be interfered with in this way in international waters."[20]
The ship was ordered to sail to the Spanish port of Algeciras to undergo a search and inspection.[21] Issues include the value and cultural significance of the shipwreck and the disputed status of Gibraltar between the UK and Spain.[22] Panama is also involved because Odyssey's vessel is flagged there.[23]
A U.S. federal judge awarded the treasure to Spain in December 2009, on the ground that the ship remained the property of Spain, but Odyssey appealed the ruling. Finally, after a five-year legal battle, in February 2012 the U.S. Supreme Court ordered Odyssey Marine to relinquish the treasure to Spanish authorities. Spain's culture minister indicated the treasure would be divided among several national museums.[24] In September 2013, a U.S. district judge further ruled that Odyssey had acted in "bad faith", should have recognized Spain's right, and should thus reimburse $1 million in Spain's attorneys fees.[25] Odyssey then issued a statement recognizing that this case was unusual and that the court ruling has clarified the applicable law, which Odyssey is committed to respecting.
Other underwater searches[edit]
In 2009, Odyssey Marine Exploration's searches were the subject of the Discovery Channel program, Treasure Quest.
In 2014, Odyssey Marine Exploration was selected to salvage gold from the 1857 shipwreck of the SS Central America.[26]
Financial difficulties[edit]
Odyssey's stock price fell below $1 in 2014 and traded even lower in 2015.
In December 2015, Odyssey announced the sale of part of its assets to a company called Monaco Financials for $21 million. This capital allowed the company to reimburse a $11.7 million bank debt. Sold assets included the company's headquarters building in Florida, 50% of underwater mining business Neptune Minerals and a profit sharing agreement on future shipwreck salvages. CEO Mark Gordon also stated that the company would refocus on underwater mining, while treasure hunting would remain "part of the mix".[27]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
