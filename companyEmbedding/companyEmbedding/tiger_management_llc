Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.

No sell buffer

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

Tiger Management L.L.C. Announces Strategic 
      Partnership with Tiger Pacific Capital LP, a New Asian-Focused Manager






November 05, 2012 03:35 PM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Tiger Management L.L.C. (“Tiger”) has 
      announced a strategic partnership to focus on investing in Asian 
      equities. Tiger Pacific Capital LP (“TPC”) 
      is a new investment company, whose founding partners are Run Ye, Junji 
      Takegami and Hoyon Hwang. The individuals are experienced investors who 
      were formerly senior members of Tiger Asia Management, L.L.C., a 
      long/short Asian hedge fund manager. Tiger Management L.L.C. and its 
      principal owner, Julian H. Robertson, Jr., will serve as TPC’s seed 
      investor.
    

      Julian H. Robertson, Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Tiger, 
      said, “Asia is the best area of the world to practice the hedge fund 
      business. There are great companies at the initial phase of their growth 
      and, on the other side, companies with huge over-valuations or even 
      possible frauds. We are fortunate indeed to have a team of the caliber 
      of Run, Junji and Hoyon to maximize the opportunity.”
    

      Mr. Robertson and Tiger, since 1980, have been committed to creating and 
      fostering a culture of investment excellence. In addition to his 
      successful investments, Mr. Robertson has demonstrated an ability to 
      identify and develop talented investment professionals, many of whom 
      have become leaders in the alternative investment industry. Since 2000,
