Mino-Lok™





Our Mino-Lok™ product may provide a superior alternative to removing and replacing central venous catheters (CVCs). Of the approximately 7 million CVCs used annually, about 500,000 or 7% become contaminated leading to serious, life threatening infections called catheter-related blood stream infections (CRBSIs). A 90 patient Phase 2b clinical study using our Mino-Lok™ product demonstrated sufficient safety to proceed to a pivotal Phase 3 trial. Our Mino-Lok™ product has received a U.S. FDA QIDP designation.

Hydro-Lido





Hydro-Lido is a topical formulation of hydrocortisone and lidocaine that is intended to provide anti-inflammatory and anesthetic relief to persons suffering from hemorrhoids. In the United States, hemorrhoids affect nearly 5% of the population, with approximately 10 million patients annually reporting symptoms of hemorrhoidal disease; approximately one-third visit a physician for evaluation and treatment of their hemorrhoids. Citius has recently completed Phase 2a studies for its hydrocortisone-lidocaine topical therapy.

About Citius Pharmaceuticals






  



MenuCompany OverviewDevelopment StrategyMino-Lok™Hydrocortisone-LidocaineNews and MediaLeadership




  





Company Overview
Citius Pharmaceuticals (OTCQB: CTXR) is a specialty pharmaceutical company dedicated to the development and commercialization of therapeutic products for large and growing markets. Citius is currently advancing two proprietary product candidates, our Mino-Lok™ product and a hydrocortisone-lidocaine formulation. Citius believes the markets for its products are large and underserved by the current standard of care.
Highlights




Target large market opportunities that have unmet medical needs with cost-effective products; high growth categories with low developmental risk.
Mino-Lok™ product is advancing to Phase 3 clinical studies.
Positive results from a Phase 2a study for hydrocortisone-lidocaine formulation for Grade I and II hemorrhoids.
Experienced management team with demonstrated success developing and commercializing novel pharmaceutical products.












  







  





Development and Commercialization Strategy
Citius seeks to build a successful pharmaceutical company through the development and commercialization of innovative, efficacious, and cost-effective products that address compelling market opportunities. Citius seeks to leverage the FDA’s 505(b)(2) pathway for new drug approvals and bring products to market faster and with less cost as compared to other FDA new drug approval pathways.





Development and Commercialization Objectives




Identify later stage drug candidates that can be developed within a 3-4 year time horizon using a 505(b)(2) pathway.
License the most relevant and advanced technologies to provide superior product characteristics and intellectual property protection for 10 years.
Focus on therapeutic areas that are highly influenced by key opinion leaders (KOLs) and drugs that are prescribed by a relatively small number of physicians.
Provide cost-effective therapies that would be endorsed by patients, providers, and payers.










FDA’s 505(b)(2) Approval Pathway





The 505(b)(2) approval pathway was introduced by the FDA to encourage innovation while eliminating costly and time-consuming duplicative pre-clinical studies.
There are compelling commercial benefits to employing the 505(b)(2) regulatory strategy, including the availability of three years of market exclusivity. Depending on the extent of the changes to the previously approved drug and the type of clinical data included in the NDA, the FDA may also grant other forms of exclusivity and orphan drug status.






  







  





Mino-Lok™
Our Mino-Lok™ product is an antibiotic lock solution used to treat patients with catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs). CRBSIs are very serious, especially in cancer patients receiving therapy through central venous catheters (CVCs), and in hemodialysis patients where venous access presents a challenge.
Our Mino-Lok™ product is intended to salvage the CVC obviating the need to remove and replace the catheter. This is a recognized unmet medical need. There are no alternatives other than the removal and reinsertion of the CVC once the CVC becomes infected. Studies show that removal and reinsertion of CVCs have a 15% to 20% complication rate, including pneumothorax, misplacement, and arterial puncture. Learn more about Mino-Lok >>





Program Highlights




Partnership with a leading cancer center and support from key industry opinion leaders.
In a Phase 2b trial, our Mino-Lok™ product demonstrated a 100% efficacy rate in salvaging infected CVCs; the Mino-Lok™ product had no significant adverse events compared to an 18% serious adverse event rate when infected CVCs were removed and replaced.
FDA QIDP designation and patent protected until June 2024.
Advancing to a Phase 3 pivotal superiority trial.











Our Mino-Lok™ product was developed by clinicians and technologists at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. Citius obtained a worldwide license to the patented technology (with the exception of South America) in May 2014.






  







  





Hydro-Lido
Citius is developing a topical formulation of hydrocortisone (3%) and lidocaine (5%), Hydro-Lido, to provide anti-inflammatory and anesthetic relief to patients suffering from Grade I and II hemorrhoids.
Although there are numerous prescription and over-the-counter products commonly used to treat hemorrhoids, none currently possess safety and efficacy data generated from rigorously conducted clinical trials. Citius believes its hydrocortisone-lidocaine product will become an important treatment option for physicians who want to provide their patients with a therapy that has demonstrated safety and efficacy in treating hemorrhoids. Citius has recently completed a Phase 2a clinical study in 211 hemorrhoid patients. Learn more about Citius’ Hemorrhoids Program >>










Commercial Opportunity




By age 50, approximately half of adults will have suffered from the pain, bleeding, itching and discomfort caused by hemorrhoids.
In the United States., hemorrhoids affect nearly 5% of the population, with approximately 10 million persons annually reporting symptoms of hemorrhoidal disease; of these patients, approximately one-third visit a physician for evaluation and treatment.
We believe Citius’ hydrocortisone and lidocaine formulation could become the first FDA-approved product to treat hemorrhoids in the United States.

("Citius") (OTC BB: CTXR), a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on critical care drug products, announced today a reverse stock split of its outstanding common stock at a ratio of 1-for-15 effective at market open on Friday June 9, 2017. The reverse stock split will reduce the number of outstanding shares of the Company's common stock from approximately 75.8 million shares to approximately 5.05 million shares.  Upon completion of the split, management will seek to secure listing on a senior exchange.  A senior exchange listing would allow us to attract a broader range of investors and to increase share liquidity.The reverse stock split will be effective with FINRA (the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority) and in the marketplace at the open of business June 9, 2017, whereupon the stock will begin trading on a split-adjusted basis. The Company's trading symbol on June 9, 2017 will temporarily change to "CTXRD" and continue for a period of 20 business days from that date, after such time, the symbol will revert to the original symbol of "CTXR".The Company has retained its transfer agent, VStock Transfer LLC, to act as its exchange agent for the reverse stock split. VStock Transfer LLC, will provide stockholders of record as of the effective time with a letter of transmittal providing instructions for the exchange of their stock certificates. Stockholders owning shares via a broker or other nominee will have their positions automatically adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split, subject to brokers' particular processes, and will not be required to take any action in connection with the reverse stock split.As a result of the reverse stock split, each 15 shares of common stock held by each stockholder will be converted automatically into one share of common stock, with fractional shares rounded up to the next whole share. No fractional shares will be issued, and no cash or other consideration will be paid. The Company`s stockholders at the 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on September 9, 2016 authorized the Company's Board of Directors to effect a reverse stock split of the Company's common stock in a ratio in a range of not less than 1-for-8 and not more than 1-for-20, and the specific ratio of 1-for-15 was subsequently approved by the Company's Board of Directors.Stockholders who are holding their shares in electronic form at their brokerage firms do not have to take any action as the effects of the reverse stock split will automatically be reflected in their brokerage accounts. No further action is required for stockholders holding paper certificates. Certificates representing pre-split holdings will be deemed to represent the stockholder's post-split holdings until the stockholder presents the certificate to the transfer agent, whose contact information appears below. For additional information regarding the reverse stock split, please reference the Company's Definitive Proxy Statement filed with the SEC on August 11, 2016.About Citius Pharmaceuticals, Inc.Citius is a specialty pharmaceutical company dedicated to the development and commercialization of critical care products with a focus on anti-infectives, cancer care and unique prescription products using innovative, patented or proprietary formulations of previously approved active pharmaceutical ingredients.  We seek to achieve leading market positions by providing therapeutic products that address unmet medical needs.  By using previously approved drugs with substantial safety and efficacy data, we seek to reduce the risks associated with pharmaceutical product development and regulatory requirements.

("Citius") (OTC QB: CTXR), a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on adjunctive cancer care and critical care drug products, announced today that it has initiated manufacturing for the company's clinical trial of Mino-Lok ™, an antibiotic lock solution used to salvage central venous catheters (CVCs) and to treat catheter related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs).Citius Pharmaceuticals has engaged two large contract-manufacturing organizations ("CMOs") to perform the work.  The product will be manufactured and packaged in two components, to be mixed and used at patient treatment sites.  Minocycline will be manufactured by one of the largest CMOs with global operations.  The other two components will be packaged at a US-based CMO with expertise in this area.  The work has commenced at both locations and the Company expects the materials to be available for clinical use when the first patient is enrolled in early 2017.Mr. Myron Holubiak, President and CEO stated, "Manufacturing of the components of Mino-Lok™ for clinical trial purposes marks a significant milestone for Citius.  We hope to prove that a simple administration protocol that conforms to everyday work process in hospitals today will be able to salvage infected CVCs that cause devastating bacteremias in very vulnerable patients.  There is currently no other solution on the market or in development that is focused on catheter salvage.  We are confident that a successful trial will help to establish Citius as a market leader in the industry and allow us to offer an attractive alternative to removing and replacing central lines in very ill and susceptible patients.Central Venous Catheters (CVCs) are life-saving vascular access ports in many patients requiring long-term intravenous therapy.  Approximately 7 million CVCs are used annually and nearly 500,000 of those result in CRBSIs leading serious, life threatening infections and morbidities.  Currently, the treatment for patients with a CRBSI is to treat the bacteremia with appropriate systemic antibiotic therapy, and in most cases remove the infected CVC and replace it with a new CVC at a new venous access site.  There are currently no approved therapies to salvage infected CVCs.  Mino-Lok ™ is an antibiotic lock solution that will be studied to treat patients with CRBSIs in combination with appropriate systemic antibiotics(s), to preserve venous access and avoid the complications of morbidities associated with catheter removal and reinsertion.  Mino-Lok ™ penetrates biofilm, eradicates bacteria and provides anti-clotting properties to salvage infected indwelling CVCs.About Citius Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Citius is a specialty pharmaceutical company dedicated to the development and commercialization of critical care products with a focus on anti-infectives, cancer care and unique prescription products using innovative, patented or proprietary formulations of previously approved active pharmaceutical ingredients.  We seek to achieve leading market positions by providing therapeutic products that address unmet medical needs.  By using previously approved drugs with substantial safety and efficacy data, we seek to reduce the risks associated with pharmaceutical product development and regulatory requirements.

A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER 

















A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

















HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

Diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than 30 million Americans. While complications of the disease can be dire, there is hope. Biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments.
Diabetes: the patient perspective
Diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose (sugar) in the blood. Normally, the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy. With diabetes, the body either does not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or does not use it properly (type 2 diabetes), leading to high blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications, such as heart attack, lower-limb amputation, vision impairment and blindness.
Endocrinologist Dr. William "Bill" Chin has experience treating endocrine disorders, including diabetes. As chief medical officer at PhRMA, he works to ensure that patient voices are heard, drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes. When Dr. Chin's son, Danny, was 15, he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst. Dr. Chin diagnosed his son himself with type 1 diabetes.
He says, "I don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease, particularly one that will be chronic. In many ways it’s forever, but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed."
The changing landscape of diabetes treatment
The medications that Danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years. A decade ago, a number of insulin options were available to patients, as well as oral and injected medications. Successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels. To control their glucose, patients needed multiple daily injections and/or multiple oral medicines.
In recent years, researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients, from fewer pills to less frequent injections. Careful monitoring and treatment are still needed, but current medicines in development offer a promising future.
There are 171 medicines currently in development for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related conditions. A new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels. Other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetes-related complications that affect the kidneys, blood vessels and eyes. All of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the FDA.
While these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type 1 diabetes, ongoing research remains critical. In fact, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2013.
Dr. Chin says, "Collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes ... we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease. This can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry."

We cannot take progress for granted

We are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases. But we must not take this progress for granted.  To ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop life-saving treatments and cures.
In order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients, our country must:
1)    Make medicines more affordable by rewarding value
 Today, America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines. Prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment, or agreements may lower co-pays if patients achieve better health outcomes. While these partnerships will vary, they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system.
Yet, outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements.  Government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines. Rather, we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for Americans.
2)    Ensure patients get the best deal on medicines
America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Those rebates are growing every year and now exceed $100 billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers.
But we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings, and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price, even when their insurers get a rebate. In fact, patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine.  That’s wrong. Health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive. This could lower out-of-pocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year.
3)    Make new breakthroughs accessible, and promote competition
We need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines. It simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over 10 years and over one billion dollars, on average.  Outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more. To get medicines approved faster, while ensuring safety, we need to modernize the FDA with new technologies and expertise to keep up with 21st century science. Modernizing the FDA will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines, which will bring medicines to patients faster, and enhance competition in the market.
We also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection. 
At the same time, we must avoid policies that deter risk-taking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients. Learn more about our plan to build a sustainable, science-based health care system that harnesses today’s hopes to discover tomorrow’s cures here.

Mino-Lok™





Our Mino-Lok™ product may provide a superior alternative to removing and replacing central venous catheters (CVCs). Of the approximately 7 million CVCs used annually, about 500,000 or 7% become contaminated leading to serious, life threatening infections called catheter-related blood stream infections (CRBSIs). A 90 patient Phase 2b clinical study using our Mino-Lok™ product demonstrated sufficient safety to proceed to a pivotal Phase 3 trial. Our Mino-Lok™ product has received a U.S. FDA QIDP designation.
