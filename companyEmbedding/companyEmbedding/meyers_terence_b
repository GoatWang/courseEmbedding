Ingredient Glossary
 
We are proud of the ingredients in our products and list them on every label, as well as share additional information below. Our products are specifically formulated to be safe for use in and around the home with family, children and pets. We work hard to ensure our products have the very best combination of ingredients—combinations that not only work hard on your daily dirt and grime, but that fill your home with garden-inspired scents.
We make intelligent, responsible raw material choices, and whenever possible, obtain materials from renewable plant resources such as coconut, corn, soy or olive. At times we choose not to use a plant-derived material for reasons of efficacy, consistency and safety.
Our products do not contain ammonia, chlorine, glycol solvents, parabens, phthalates, formaldehyde, artificial colorants, phosphates or petroleum distillates.
We do not test our products on animals, nor are our products made with animal-derived ingredients.
Our packaging is recyclable and we use at least 25% post-consumer plastic in our bottles.
We manufacture according to exacting personal care standards in a cosmetic-grade cGMP facility. cGMP is an abbreviation for the term "current Good Manufacturing Practice", which refers to FDA regulations regarding the manufacturing, testing, and quality control of pharmaceutical and food products.
All suppliers of Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day ingredients derived from Palm Oil are members of RSPO (Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil). Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day supports sustainable practices of eco-sensitive areas throughout Asia, Africa and South America like the Brazilian rain forests.

A better way to clean
inspired by a mother of nine.





How We Began
Learn what sparked the creation of ourhard-working, nice smelling product line.

Our products were inspired by Mrs. Thelma A. Meyer, an Iowa homemaker and mother of nine. It all started when one of her daughters was walking down a cleaning aisle, eyeing all the products with their harsh, stinky chemicals. Right then and there, she had an idea: "Let's make cleaners that smell nice, like my mom's garden, but still work like the dickens on daily dirt and grime."




WHAT WE MAKE
Find out how and why our products smell like a garden, yet clean like the dickens.

For generations we've had to put up with harsh chemical smells to get a good clean. Enter Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day. A collection of household products made with essential oils from flowers and herbs that smell nice, but really pack a punch against daily dirt and grime. Our garden fresh scents include Lavender, Lemon Verbena, Basil, Geranium and many others.






"I wouldn't put my name on something that didn't work hard and smell great. No reason to ruin my reputation this late in the game."

We put a lot of work into our products so it's less work for our consumers.

Ingredient Glossary
 
We are proud of the ingredients in our products and list them on every label, as well as share additional information below. Our products are specifically formulated to be safe for use in and around the home with family, children and pets. We work hard to ensure our products have the very best combination of ingredients—combinations that not only work hard on your daily dirt and grime, but that fill your home with garden-inspired scents.
We make intelligent, responsible raw material choices, and whenever possible, obtain materials from renewable plant resources such as coconut, corn, soy or olive. At times we choose not to use a plant-derived material for reasons of efficacy, consistency and safety.
Our products do not contain ammonia, chlorine, glycol solvents, parabens, phthalates, formaldehyde, artificial colorants, phosphates or petroleum distillates.
We do not test our products on animals, nor are our products made with animal-derived ingredients.
Our packaging is recyclable and we use at least 25% post-consumer plastic in our bottles.
We manufacture according to exacting personal care standards in a cosmetic-grade cGMP facility. cGMP is an abbreviation for the term "current Good Manufacturing Practice", which refers to FDA regulations regarding the manufacturing, testing, and quality control of pharmaceutical and food products.
All suppliers of Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day ingredients derived from Palm Oil are members of RSPO (Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil). Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day supports sustainable practices of eco-sensitive areas throughout Asia, Africa and South America like the Brazilian rain forests.

A better way to clean
inspired by a mother of nine.





How We Began
Learn what sparked the creation of ourhard-working, nice smelling product line.

Our products were inspired by Mrs. Thelma A. Meyer, an Iowa homemaker and mother of nine. It all started when one of her daughters was walking down a cleaning aisle, eyeing all the products with their harsh, stinky chemicals. Right then and there, she had an idea: "Let's make cleaners that smell nice, like my mom's garden, but still work like the dickens on daily dirt and grime."




WHAT WE MAKE
Find out how and why our products smell like a garden, yet clean like the dickens.

For generations we've had to put up with harsh chemical smells to get a good clean. Enter Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day. A collection of household products made with essential oils from flowers and herbs that smell nice, but really pack a punch against daily dirt and grime. Our garden fresh scents include Lavender, Lemon Verbena, Basil, Geranium and many others.






"I wouldn't put my name on something that didn't work hard and smell great. No reason to ruin my reputation this late in the game."
