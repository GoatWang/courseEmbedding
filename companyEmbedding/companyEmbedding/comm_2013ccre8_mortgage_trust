Approximately $1.38 Billion of Structured Securities Affected


New York, June 16, 2017 -- Moody's Investors Service, ("Moody's") has 
affirmed the ratings on fifteen classes in COMM 2013-CCRE8 Mortgage 
Trust as follows:




Cl. A-1, Affirmed Aaa (sf); previously on Apr 
28, 2016 Affirmed Aaa (sf)

RATINGS RATIONALE




The ratings on the P&I classes were affirmed because the transaction's 
key metrics, including Moody's loan-to-value (LTV) 
ratio, Moody's stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and the 
transaction's Herfindahl Index (Herf), are within acceptable 
ranges.




The ratings on the IO classes were affirmed based on the credit quality 
of the referenced classes.




Moody's rating action reflects a base expected loss of 2.5% 
of the current balance, compared to 2.7% at Moody's 
last review. Moody's base expected loss plus realized losses is 
now 2.4% of the original pooled balance, compared 
to 2.7% at the last review. Moody's provides 
a current list of base expected losses for conduit and fusion CMBS transactions 
on moodys.com at http://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBS_SF215255.




FACTORS THAT WOULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS:




The performance expectations for a given variable indicate Moody's forward-looking 
view of the likely range of performance over the medium term. Performance 
that falls outside the given range can indicate that the collateral's 
credit quality is stronger or weaker than Moody's had previously expected.




Factors that could lead to an upgrade of the ratings include a significant 
amount of loan paydowns or amortization, an increase in the pool's 
share of defeasance or an improvement in pool performance.




Factors that could lead to a downgrade of the ratings include a decline 
in the performance of the pool, loan concentration, an increase 
in realized and expected losses from specially serviced and troubled loans 
or interest shortfalls.




METHODOLOGY UNDERLYING THE RATING ACTION




The methodologies used in these ratings were "Approach to Rating US and 
Canadian Conduit/Fusion CMBS" published in December 2014, and "Moody's 
Approach to Rating Large Loan and Single Asset/Single Borrower CMBS" 
published in October 2015. Please see the Rating Methodologies 
page on www.moodys.com for a copy of these methodologies.




Additionally, the methodology used in rating Cl. X-A 
and Cl. X-C was "Moody's Approach to Rating Structured 
Finance Interest-Only (IO) Securities" published in June 2017. 
Please see the Rating Methodologies page on www.moodys.com 
for a copy of this methodology.




DEAL PERFORMANCE




As of the June 12, 2017 distribution date, the transaction's 
aggregate certificate balance has decreased by 5% to $1.32 
billion from $1.38 billion at securitization. The 
certificates are collateralized by 59 mortgage loans ranging in size from 
less than 1% to 16% of the pool, with the top ten 
loans (excluding defeasance) constituting 56% of the pool. 
Two loans, constituting 20% of the pool, have investment-grade 
structured credit assessments. Five loans, constituting 8% 
of the pool, have defeased and are secured by US government securities.




Moody's uses a variation of Herf to measure the diversity of loan 
sizes, where a higher number represents greater diversity. 
Loan concentration has an important bearing on potential rating volatility, 
including the risk of multiple notch downgrades under adverse circumstances. 
The credit neutral Herf score is 40. The pool has a Herf of 17, 
compared to 19 at Moody's last review.




Two loans, constituting 2% of the pool, are on the 
master servicer's watchlist. The watchlist includes loans 
that meet certain portfolio review guidelines established as part of the 
CRE Finance Council (CREFC) monthly reporting package. As part 
of Moody's ongoing monitoring of a transaction, the agency 
reviews the watchlist to assess which loans have material issues that 
could affect performance.




There have been no loans liquidated from the pool. Three loans, 
constituting 2% of the pool, are currently in special servicing. 
The largest specially serviced loan is the Georgetown MHC Portfolio ($9.6 
million), which is secured by a 502-pad manufactured housing 
community in Georgetown, Kentucky, located just outside the 
city of Lexington. The loan transferred to special servicing in 
March 2014 due to delinquency. The property was 73% occupied 
as of February 2017, down from 97% at securitization. 
The loan is currently REO.




The remaining two specially serviced loans are secured by a mix of property 
types. Moody's estimates an aggregate $8.1 million 
loss for the specially serviced loans (55% expected loss on average).


Moody's has assumed a high default probability for two poorly performing 
loans, constituting 2% of the pool, and has estimated 
an aggregate loss of $4.2 million (a 20% expected 
loss based on a 50% probability default) from these troubled loans.




Moody's received full year 2015 operating results for 96% of the 
pool, and full or partial year 2016 operating results for 92% 
of the pool (excluding specially serviced and defeased loans). 
Moody's weighted average conduit LTV is 100%, compared 
to 101% at Moody's last review. Moody's conduit 
component excludes loans with structured credit assessments, defeased 
and CTL loans, and specially serviced and troubled loans. 
Moody's net cash flow (NCF) reflects a weighted average haircut 
of 15% to the most recently available net operating income (NOI). 
Moody's value reflects a weighted average capitalization rate of 
9.1%.




Moody's actual and stressed conduit DSCRs are 1.60X and 1.04X, 
respectively, compared to 1.59X and 1.03X at the last 
review. Moody's actual DSCR is based on Moody's NCF 
and the loan's actual debt service. Moody's stressed 
DSCR is based on Moody's NCF and a 9.25% stress rate 
the agency applied to the loan balance.




The largest loan with a structured credit assessment is the 375 Park Avenue 
Loan ($209 million -- 16% of the pool), 
which represents a participation interest in a $418 million senior 
mortgage loan. The loan is secured by the Seagram Building, 
a class A trophy, landmark office tower located in Midtown Manhattan. 
The building has 38 stories with a net rentable area (NRA) of approximately 
830,928 square feet. The property was 94% leased as 
of November 30, 2016, compared to 88% leased at December 
2015. The loan is also encumbered by a $364.8 million 
B note and $217.3 million of mezzanine debt. Moody's 
structured credit assessment and stressed DSCR are aaa (sca.pd) 
and 1.64X, respectively.




The second largest loan with a structured credit assessment is the Paramount 
Building Loan ($55 million -- 4% of the pool), 
which represents a participation interest in a $130 million mortgage 
loan. The loan is secured by a 31-story, Class A office 
property in the Times Square section of Midtown Manhattan. The 
property was originally constructed in 1926 and received a major overhaul 
in 2006. The property incudes ground floor retail space leased 
to national retail and restaurant tenants. Moody's structured credit 
assessment and stressed DSCR are aaa (sca.pd) and 1.67X.




The top three conduit loans represent 19% of the pool balance. 
The largest loan is the Moffett Towers Phase II Loan ($115 million 
-- 9% of the pool), which is secured by three, 
eight-story, Class A suburban office properties in Sunnyvale, 
California. The properties were 100% occupied as of October 
2016, the same as at last review and compared to 91% at securitization. 
The two tenants occupying the property are the Hewlett-Packard 
Company and a subsidiary of Amazon.com, Inc. Moody's 
LTV and stressed DSCR are 107% and 0.94X, respectively, 
unchanged from the prior review.




The second largest loan is the 175 Park Avenue Loan ($71 million 
-- 5% of the pool). The loan is secured by 
a 270,000 square foot, Class A, suburban office property 
in Madison, New Jersey. The property was originally built 
in 1971 and was extensively renovated into the headquarters office for 
Realogy Holdings Corporation, a real estate conglomerate. 
Realogy occupies 100% of the property under a lease set to expire 
in March 2030, six years after scheduled loan maturity. After 
an initial interest-only period, the loan is now amortizing.

respectively, compared to 100% and 1.03X at the last 
review.




The third largest loan is the Westin San Diego Loan ($65.6 
million -- 5% of the pool). The loan is secured 
by a 27-story, 436-room, full service hotel 
property in downtown San Diego, California. The hotel property 
is part of a larger, mixed use development which contains non-collateral 
components, including condominium residences and offices. 
Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 92% and, 1.2X, 
respectively, compared to 94% and, 1.17X at 
the last review.




REGULATORY DISCLOSURES




For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and sensitivity 
analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and Sensitivity 
to Assumptions of the disclosure form.




The analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and 
performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected 
collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments. As a 
second step, Moody's estimates expected collateral losses or cash 
flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement, 
loss allocation and other structural features, to derive the expected 
loss for each rated instrument.




Moody's did not use any stress scenario simulations in its analysis.




For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series 
or category/class of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings 
are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's 
rating practices. For ratings issued on a support provider, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the credit rating action on the support provider and in relation to 
each particular credit rating action for securities that derive their 
credit ratings from the support provider's credit rating. 
For provisional ratings, this announcement provides certain regulatory 
disclosures in relation to the provisional rating assigned, and 
in relation to a definitive rating that may be assigned subsequent to 
the final issuance of the debt, in each case where the transaction 
structure and terms have not changed prior to the assignment of the definitive 
rating in a manner that would have affected the rating. For further 
information please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page for the 
respective issuer on www.moodys.com.




For any affected securities or rated entities receiving direct credit 
support from the primary entity(ies) of this credit rating action, 
and whose ratings may change as a result of this credit rating action, 
the associated regulatory disclosures will be those of the guarantor entity. 
Exceptions to this approach exist for the following disclosures, 
if applicable to jurisdiction: Ancillary Services, Disclosure 
to rated entity, Disclosure from rated entity.




Regulatory disclosures contained in this press release apply to the credit 
rating and, if applicable, the related rating outlook or rating 
review.


Please see www.moodys.com for any updates on changes to 
the lead rating analyst and to the Moody's legal entity that has issued 
the rating.


Please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page on www.moodys.com 
for additional regulatory disclosures for each credit rating.

Because of the possibility of human or mechanical error as well as other factors, however, all information contained herein is provided “AS IS” without warranty of any kind. MOODY'S adopts all necessary measures so that the information it uses in assigning a credit rating is of sufficient quality and from sources MOODY'S considers to be reliable including, when appropriate, independent third-party sources. However, MOODY’S is not an auditor and cannot in every instance independently verify or validate information received in the rating process or in preparing the Moody’s publications. To the extent permitted by law, MOODY’S and its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors and suppliers disclaim liability to any person or entity for any indirect, special, consequential, or incidental losses or damages whatsoever arising from or in connection with the information contained herein or the use of or inability to use any such information, even if MOODY’S or any of its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors or suppliers is advised in advance of the possibility of such losses or damages, including but not limited to: (a) any loss of present or prospective profits or (b) any loss or damage arising where the relevant financial instrument is not the subject of a particular credit rating assigned by MOODY’S. To the extent permitted by law, MOODY’S and its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors and suppliers disclaim liability for any direct or compensatory losses or damages caused to any person or entity, including but not limited to by any negligence (but excluding fraud, willful misconduct or any other type of liability that, for the avoidance of doubt, by law cannot be excluded) on the part of, or any contingency within or beyond the control of, MOODY’S or any of its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors or suppliers, arising from or in connection with the information contained herein or the use of or inability to use any such information. NO WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE ACCURACY, TIMELINESS, COMPLETENESS, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE OF ANY SUCH RATING OR OTHER OPINION OR INFORMATION IS GIVEN OR MADE BY MOODY’S IN ANY FORM OR MANNER WHATSOEVER. Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody’s Corporation (“MCO”), hereby discloses that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from $1,500 to approximately $2,500,000. MCO and MIS also maintain policies and procedures to address the independence of MIS’s ratings and rating processes. Information regarding certain affiliations that may exist between directors of MCO and rated entities, and between entities who hold ratings from MIS and have also publicly reported to the SEC an ownership interest in MCO of more than 5%, is posted annually at www.moodys.com under the heading “Investor Relations — Corporate Governance — Director and Shareholder Affiliation Policy.” Additional terms for Australia only: Any publication into Australia of this document is pursuant to the Australian Financial Services License of MOODY’S affiliate, Moody’s Investors Service Pty Limited ABN 61 003 399 657AFSL 336969 and/or Moody’s Analytics Australia Pty Ltd ABN 94 105 136 972 AFSL 383569 (as applicable). This document is intended to be provided only to “wholesale clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. By continuing to access this document from within Australia, you represent to MOODY’S that you are, or are accessing the document as a representative of, a “wholesale client” and that neither you nor the entity you represent will directly or indirectly disseminate this document or its contents to “retail clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. MOODY’S credit rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a debt obligation of the issuer, not on the equity securities of the issuer or any form of security that is available to retail investors. It would be reckless and inappropriate for retail investors to use MOODY’S credit ratings or publications when making an investment decision. If in doubt you should contact your financial or other professional adviser. Additional terms for Japan only: Moody's Japan K.K. (“MJKK”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody's Group Japan G.K., which is wholly-owned by Moody’s Overseas Holdings Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of MCO. Moody’s SF Japan K.K. (“MSFJ”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of MJKK. MSFJ is not a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (“NRSRO”). Therefore, credit ratings assigned by MSFJ are Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings. Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings are assigned by an entity that is not a NRSRO and, consequently, the rated obligation will not qualify for certain types of treatment under U.S. laws. MJKK and MSFJ are credit rating agencies registered with the Japan Financial Services Agency and their registration numbers are FSA Commissioner (Ratings) No. 2 and 3 respectively. MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) hereby disclose that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from JPY200,000 to approximately JPY350,000,000. MJKK and MSFJ also maintain policies and procedures to address Japanese regulatory requirements.

                    Global Credit Research - 09 Jun 2017
                









New York, June 09, 2017 -- Moody's Investors Service ("Moody's") has upgraded the 
ratings on eight interest-only (IO) classes from seven US and Canadian 
commercial mortgage-backed securitizations (CMBS) deals, 
downgraded the ratings on 243 IO classes from 236 CMBS deals and withdrawn 
51 interest-only classes from 51 CMBS deals issued by multiple 
issuers. As further described below, the rating actions result 
from the adoption of an updated approach to the rating of structured finance 
interest-only (IO) securities.

for the List of Affected Credit Ratings. This list is an integral 
part of this Press Release and identifies each affected issuer.




RATINGS RATIONALE




Please click on this link http://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBS_SF453781 
for the List of Affected Credit Ratings. This list is an integral 
part of this Press Release and provides, for each of the credit 
ratings covered, Moody's disclosures on the following items:




-Principal Methodologies 




The upgrades of eight CMBS IO classes and the downgrades of 243 CMBS IO 
classes follow the publication of "Moody's Approach to Rating 
Structured Finance Interest-Only (IO) Securities" published 
on 8 June 2017 (the "updated IO Methodology") and reflect 
the rating impact of our updated approach incorporating performance information 
as of the May 2017 remittance dates.




The updated methodology modifies Moody's approach to rating IO securities 
referencing multiple bonds and single or multiple collateral pools with 
realized losses. References made to the exclusion of certain IO 
securities in the previous methodology were removed. In addition, 
a description was added to explain when an IO bond is viewed as having 
effectively matured and results in the withdrawal of the rating.




The updated methodology explains that Moody's will limit the rating 
of an IO security to no more than five notches above the rating of the 
lowest credit quality reference bond or the rating that would be assigned 
based on an assessment of the default probability of the reference pool(s), 
as applicable, and clarifies that the collateral pool's default 
probability typically will be treated as equivalent to Ca(sf) if a loss 
is expected on the pool. The methodology also explains how Moody's 
10-year Idealised Cumulative Loss Rates table will be used to determine 
the rating of IOs referencing multiple bonds and IOs backed by single 
or multiple pools, as well as how the table is used when the loss 
falls between two rating categories.




This press release is not intended to provide a summary of the methodology. 
For a full explanation of the methodology, please consult the updated 
report, now available on www.moodys.com and accessible 
at: https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-updates-its-approach-for-rating-structured-finance-interest-only--PR_367970




Ratings on 51 of the interest-only classes from 51 deals were withdrawn 
due to the excess spread due on the IO bond being reduced to zero and 
are treated as having effectively matured.




The upgrades of eight CMBS IO classes were due to the modification of 
Moody's approach to rating IO securities referencing multiple bonds (including 
WAC IOs) to the weighted average of the current credit quality of all 
referenced bonds based on current balances (grossed up for realized losses), 
subject to the constraint of no more than five notches above the lowest 
credit quality referenced bond.




The downgrades on 243 CMBS IO classes were due to (i) the rating limit 
of an IO security to no more than five notches above the lowest credit 
quality referenced bond, (ii) the use of Moody's 10-year 
Idealised Cumulative Loss Rates table to determine the rating of IOs referencing 
multiple bonds and the mapping to the next lower category when the loss 
falls between two rating categories and (iii) principal paydowns of higher 
quality reference classes as of the May 2017 remittance statements.




FACTORS THAT WOULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS:




An IO class may be subject to ratings upgrades if there is an improvement 
in the credit quality of its referenced classes, subject to the 
limits and provisions of the updated IO methodology.




An IO class may be subject to ratings downgrades if there is (i) a decline 
in the credit quality of the reference classes and/or (ii) paydowns of 
higher quality reference classes, subject to the limits and provisions 
of the updated IO methodology.




REGULATORY DISCLOSURES




For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and sensitivity 
analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and Sensitivity 
to Assumptions of the disclosure form.




The analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and 
performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected 
collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments. As a 
second step, Moody's estimates expected collateral losses or cash 
flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement, 
loss allocation and other structural features, to derive the expected 
loss for each rated instrument.




Moody's did not use any stress scenario simulations in its analysis.




For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series 
or category/class of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings 
are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's 
rating practices. For ratings issued on a support provider, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the credit rating action on the support provider and in relation to 
each particular credit rating action for securities that derive their 
credit ratings from the support provider's credit rating. 
For provisional ratings, this announcement provides certain regulatory 
disclosures in relation to the provisional rating assigned, and 
in relation to a definitive rating that may be assigned subsequent to 
the final issuance of the debt, in each case where the transaction 
structure and terms have not changed prior to the assignment of the definitive 
rating in a manner that would have affected the rating. For further 
information please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page for the 
respective issuer on www.moodys.com.




For any affected securities or rated entities receiving direct credit 
support from the primary entity(ies) of this credit rating action, 
and whose ratings may change as a result of this credit rating action, 
the associated regulatory disclosures will be those of the guarantor entity. 
Exceptions to this approach exist for the following disclosures, 
if applicable to jurisdiction: Ancillary Services, Disclosure 
to rated entity, Disclosure from rated entity.




Regulatory disclosures contained in this press release apply to the credit 
rating and, if applicable, the related rating outlook or rating 
review.




The below contact information is provided for information purposes only. 
Please see the ratings tab of the issuer page at www.moodys.com, 
for each of the ratings covered, Moody's disclosures on the 
lead rating analyst and the Moody's legal entity that has issued 
the ratings.

the lead rating analyst and to the Moody's legal entity that has issued 
the rating.

Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody’s Corporation (“MCO”), hereby discloses that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from $1,500 to approximately $2,500,000. MCO and MIS also maintain policies and procedures to address the independence of MIS’s ratings and rating processes. Information regarding certain affiliations that may exist between directors of MCO and rated entities, and between entities who hold ratings from MIS and have also publicly reported to the SEC an ownership interest in MCO of more than 5%, is posted annually at www.moodys.com under the heading “Investor Relations — Corporate Governance — Director and Shareholder Affiliation Policy.” Additional terms for Australia only: Any publication into Australia of this document is pursuant to the Australian Financial Services License of MOODY’S affiliate, Moody’s Investors Service Pty Limited ABN 61 003 399 657AFSL 336969 and/or Moody’s Analytics Australia Pty Ltd ABN 94 105 136 972 AFSL 383569 (as applicable). This document is intended to be provided only to “wholesale clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. By continuing to access this document from within Australia, you represent to MOODY’S that you are, or are accessing the document as a representative of, a “wholesale client” and that neither you nor the entity you represent will directly or indirectly disseminate this document or its contents to “retail clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. MOODY’S credit rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a debt obligation of the issuer, not on the equity securities of the issuer or any form of security that is available to retail investors. It would be reckless and inappropriate for retail investors to use MOODY’S credit ratings or publications when making an investment decision. If in doubt you should contact your financial or other professional adviser. Additional terms for Japan only: Moody's Japan K.K. (“MJKK”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody's Group Japan G.K., which is wholly-owned by Moody’s Overseas Holdings Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of MCO. Moody’s SF Japan K.K. (“MSFJ”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of MJKK. MSFJ is not a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (“NRSRO”). Therefore, credit ratings assigned by MSFJ are Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings. Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings are assigned by an entity that is not a NRSRO and, consequently, the rated obligation will not qualify for certain types of treatment under U.S. laws. MJKK and MSFJ are credit rating agencies registered with the Japan Financial Services Agency and their registration numbers are FSA Commissioner (Ratings) No. 2 and 3 respectively. MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) hereby disclose that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from JPY200,000 to approximately JPY350,000,000. MJKK and MSFJ also maintain policies and procedures to address Japanese regulatory requirements.

RATINGS RATIONALE




The ratings on the P&I classes were affirmed because the transaction's 
key metrics, including Moody's loan-to-value (LTV) 
ratio, Moody's stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and the 
transaction's Herfindahl Index (Herf), are within acceptable 
ranges.




The ratings on the IO classes were affirmed because the credit performance 
(or the weighted average rating factor or WARF) of the referenced classes 
is consistent with Moody's expectations.




Moody's rating action reflects a base expected loss of 2.7% 
of the current balance compared to 1.9% at Moody's 
last review. Moody's base expected loss plus realized losses is 
now 2.7% of the original pooled balance, compared 
to 1.9% at the last review. Moody's provides 
a current list of base expected losses for conduit and fusion CMBS transactions 
on moodys.com at http://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBS_SF215255. 





FACTORS THAT WOULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATING:




The performance expectations for a given variable indicate Moody's forward-looking 
view of the likely range of performance over the medium term. Performance 
that falls outside the given range can indicate that the collateral's 
credit quality is stronger or weaker than Moody's had previously expected.




Factors that could lead to an upgrade of the ratings include a significant 
amount of loan paydowns or amortization, an increase in the pool's 
share of defeasance or an improvement in pool performance.




Factors that could lead to a downgrade of the ratings include a decline 
in the performance of the pool, loan concentration, an increase 
in realized and expected losses from specially serviced and troubled loans 
or interest shortfalls.




METHODOLOGY UNDERLYING THE RATING ACTION




The methodologies used in these ratings were "Approach to Rating US and 
Canadian Conduit/Fusion CMBS" published in December 2014, and "Moody's 
Approach to Rating Large Loan and Single Asset/Single Borrower CMBS" 
published in October 2015. Please see the Ratings Methodology page 
on www.moodys.com for a copy of these methodologies.




DESCRIPTION OF MODELS USED




Moody's review used the excel-based CMBS Conduit Model, 
which it uses for both conduit and fusion transactions. Credit 
enhancement levels for conduit loans are driven by property type, 
Moody's actual and stressed DSCR, and Moody's property 
quality grade (which reflects the capitalization rate Moody's uses 
to estimate Moody's value). Moody's fuses the conduit 
results with the results of its analysis of investment grade structured 
credit assessed loans and any conduit loan that represents 10% 
or greater of the current pool balance. 




Moody's uses a variation of Herf to measure the diversity of loan 
sizes, where a higher number represents greater diversity. 
Loan concentration has an important bearing on potential rating volatility, 
including the risk of multiple notch downgrades under adverse circumstances. 
The credit neutral Herf score is 40. The pool has a Herf of 19.




When the Herf falls below 20, Moody's uses the excel-based 
Large Loan Model and then reconciles and weights the results from the 
conduit and large loan models in formulating a rating recommendation. 
The large loan model derives credit enhancement levels based on an aggregation 
of adjusted loan-level proceeds derived from Moody's loan-level 
LTV ratios. Major adjustments to determining proceeds include leverage, 
loan structure, property type and sponsorship. Moody's 
also further adjusts these aggregated proceeds for any pooling benefits 
associated with loan level diversity and other concentrations and correlations.




DEAL PERFORMANCE




As of the April 12, 2016 distribution date, the transaction's 
aggregate certificate balance has decreased by 3% to $1.34 
billion from $1.38 billion at securitization. The 
certificates are collateralized by 59 mortgage loans ranging in size from 
less than 1% to 16% of the pool, with the top ten 
loans (excluding defeasance) constituting 58% of the pool. 
Two loans, constituting 20% of the pool, have investment-grade 
structured credit assessments.




Five loans, constituting 4% of the pool, are on the 
master servicer's watchlist. The watchlist includes loans 
that meet certain portfolio review guidelines established as part of the 
CRE Finance Council (CREFC) monthly reporting package. As part 
of Moody's ongoing monitoring of a transaction, the agency 
reviews the watchlist to assess which loans have material issues that 
could affect performance.




Two loans, constituting 1% of the pool, are currently 
in special servicing. The largest specially serviced loan is the 
Georgetown MHC Portfolio ($9.9 million), which is 
secured by a 502-pad manufactured housing community in Georgetown, 
Kentucky, located just outside the city of Lexington. The 
loan transferred to special servicing in March 2014 due to delinquency. 
The property was 76% occupied as of December 2015, down from 
81% in December 2014 and 97% at securitization. The 
loan is currently in foreclosure. The other loan in special servicing 
is a hotel property that is in a market primarily for the petroleum industry. 
Moody's analysis incorporates a modest loss for the specially serviced 
loans.




Moody's received full year 2014 operating results for 96% of the 
pool, and full or partial year 2015 operating results for 67% 
of the pool. Moody's weighted average conduit LTV is 101%, 
compared to 103% at Moody's last review. Moody's 
conduit component excludes loans with structured credit assessments, 
defeased and CTL loans, and specially serviced and troubled loans. 
Moody's net cash flow (NCF) reflects a weighted average haircut 
of 5.6% to the most recently available net operating income 
(NOI). Moody's value reflects a weighted average capitalization 
rate of 9.5%.




Moody's actual and stressed conduit DSCRs are 1.59X and 1.03X, 
respectively, compared to 1.59X and 1.01X at the last 
review. Moody's actual DSCR is based on Moody's NCF 
and the loan's actual debt service. Moody's stressed 
DSCR is based on Moody's NCF and a 9.25% stress rate 
the agency applied to the loan balance.




The largest loan with a structured credit assessment is the 375 Park Avenue 
Loan ($209 million -- 16% of the pool), which 
represents a participation interest in a $418 million senior mortgage 
loan. The loan is secured by the Seagram Building, a trophy, 
landmark office tower located in Midtown Manhattan. The property 
was 88% leased as of December 2015, the same as at last review. 
Reported recent new leasing increases percentage leased to 96%. 
The loan is also encumbered by a $364.8 million B note and 
$217.3 million of mezzanine debt. Moody's structured 
credit assessment and stressed DSCR are aaa and 1.64X, respectively.




The second largest loan with a structured credit assessment is the Paramount 
Building Loan ($55 million -- 4% of the pool), 
which represents a participation interest in a $130 million mortgage 
loan. The loan is secured by a 31-story, Class A office 
property in the Times Square section of Midtown Manhattan. The 
property was originally constructed in 1926 and received a major overhaul 
in 2006. The property incudes ground floor retail space leased 
to national retail and restaurant tenants. Moody's structured credit 
assessment and stressed DSCR are aaa and 1.67X.




The top three performing conduit loans represent 19% of the pool 
balance. The largest loan is the Moffett Towers Phase II Loan ($115 
million -- 9% of the pool), which is secured by three, 
eight-story, Class A suburban office properties in Sunnyvale, 
California. The properties were 100% occupied as of December 
2015, the same as at last review and compared to 91% at securitization. 
The two tenants occupying the property are the Hewlett-Packard 
Company and a subsidiary of Amazon.com, Inc. Moody's 
LTV and stressed DSCR are 107% and 0.94X, respectively, 
unchanged from the prior review.




The second largest loan is the 175 Park Avenue Loan ($73 million 
-- 5% of the pool). The loan is secured by a 270,000 
square foot, Class A, suburban office property in Madison, 
New Jersey. The property was originally built in 1971 and was extensively 
renovated into the headquarters office for Realogy Holdings Corporation, 
the real estate conglomerate. Realogy occupies 100% of the 
property under a lease set to expire in March 2030, six years after 
scheduled loan maturity. After an initial interest-only 
period, the loan is now amortizing. Moody's LTV and stressed 
DSCR are 100% and 1.03X, respectively, compared 
to 103% and 1.00X at the last review.




The third largest loan is the Westin San Diego Loan ($67 million 
-- 5% of the pool). The loan is secured by a 27-story, 
436-room, full service hotel property in downtown San Diego, 
California. The hotel property is part of a larger, mixed 
use development which contains non-collateral components, 
including condominium residences and offices. Moody's LTV and stressed 
DSCR are 94% and, 1.17X, respectively, 
compared to 96% and 1.15X at the last review.




REGULATORY DISCLOSURES




For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and sensitivity 
analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and Sensitivity 
to Assumptions of the disclosure form.




The analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and 
performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected 
collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments. As a 
second step, Moody's estimates expected collateral losses or cash 
flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement, 
loss allocation and other structural features, to derive the expected 
loss for each rated instrument.




Moody's did not use any stress scenario simulations in its analysis.




For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series 
or category/class of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings 
are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's 
rating practices. For ratings issued on a support provider, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the credit rating action on the support provider and in relation to 
each particular credit rating action for securities that derive their 
credit ratings from the support provider's credit rating. 
For provisional ratings, this announcement provides certain regulatory 
disclosures in relation to the provisional rating assigned, and 
in relation to a definitive rating that may be assigned subsequent to 
the final issuance of the debt, in each case where the transaction 
structure and terms have not changed prior to the assignment of the definitive 
rating in a manner that would have affected the rating. For further 
information please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page for the 
respective issuer on www.moodys.com.

RATINGS RATIONALE




The ratings on the P&I classes were affirmed because the transaction's 
key metrics, including Moody's loan-to-value (LTV) 
ratio, Moody's stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and the 
transaction's Herfindahl Index (Herf), are within acceptable 
ranges.




The ratings on the IO classes were affirmed because the credit performance 
(or the weighted average rating factor or WARF) of the referenced classes 
is consistent with Moody's expectations.




Moody's rating action reflects a base expected loss of 1.9% 
of the current balance compared to 2.2% at Moody's 
last review. Moody's base expected loss plus realized losses is 
now 1.9% of the original pooled balance, compared 
to 2.1% at the last review. Moody's provides 
a current list of base expected losses for conduit and fusion CMBS transactions 
on moodys.com at 


http://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBS_SF215255. 





FACTORS THAT WOULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATING:




The performance expectations for a given variable indicate Moody's forward-looking 
view of the likely range of performance over the medium term. Performance 
that falls outside the given range can indicate that the collateral's 
credit quality is stronger or weaker than Moody's had previously expected.




Factors that could lead to an upgrade of the ratings include a significant 
amount of loan paydowns or amortization, an increase in the pool's 
share of defeasance or an improvement in pool performance.




Factors that could lead to a downgrade of the ratings include a decline 
in the performance of the pool, loan concentration, an increase 
in realized and expected losses from specially serviced and troubled loans 
or interest shortfalls.




METHODOLOGY UNDERLYING THE RATING ACTION




The principal methodology used in this rating was "Approach to Rating 
US and Canadian Conduit/Fusion CMBS" published in December 2014. 
Please see the Credit Policy page on www.moodys.com for 
a copy of this methodology.




DESCRIPTION OF MODELS USED




Moody's review used the excel-based CMBS Conduit Model, 
which it uses for both conduit and fusion transactions. Credit 
enhancement levels for conduit loans are driven by property type, 
Moody's actual and stressed DSCR, and Moody's property 
quality grade (which reflects the capitalization rate Moody's uses 
to estimate Moody's value). Moody's fuses the conduit 
results with the results of its analysis of investment grade structured 
credit assessed loans and any conduit loan that represents 10% 
or greater of the current pool balance. 




Moody's uses a variation of Herf to measure the diversity of loan 
sizes, where a higher number represents greater diversity. 
Loan concentration has an important bearing on potential rating volatility, 
including the risk of multiple notch downgrades under adverse circumstances. 
The credit neutral Herf score is 40. The pool has a Herf of 20, 
unchanged from at Moody's last review.




DEAL PERFORMANCE




As of the April 10, 2015 distribution date, the transaction's 
aggregate certificate balance has decreased by 2% to $1.36 
billion from $1.38 billion at securitization. The 
certificates are collateralized by 59 mortgage loans ranging in size from 
less than 1% to 15% of the pool, with the top ten 
loans (excluding defeasance) constituting 58% of the pool. 
Two loans, constituting 19% of the pool, have investment-grade 
structured credit assessments.




Four loans, constituting 4% of the pool, are on the 
master servicer's watchlist. The watchlist includes loans 
that meet certain portfolio review guidelines established as part of the 
CRE Finance Council (CREFC) monthly reporting package. As part 
of Moody's ongoing monitoring of a transaction, the agency 
reviews the watchlist to assess which loans have material issues that 
could affect performance.




One loan, constituting less than 1% of the pool, is 
currently in special servicing. The specially serviced loan is 
the Georgetown MHC Portfolio ($10 million), which is secured 
by a 504-pad manufactured housing community in Georgetown, 
Kentucky, located just outside the city of Lexington. The 
loan transferred to special servicing in March 2014 due to delinquency. 
The property was 81% occupied as of December 2014, down from 
97% at securitization. The loan is currently in foreclosure.




Moody's analysis incorporates a modest loss for the specially serviced 
loan.




Moody's received full year 2013 operating results for 97% of the 
pool, and full or partial year 2014 operating results for 60% 
of the pool. Moody's weighted average conduit LTV is 103%, 
compared to 104% at Moody's last review. Moody's 
conduit component excludes loans with structured credit assessments, 
defeased and CTL loans, and specially serviced and troubled loans. 
Moody's net cash flow (NCF) reflects a weighted average haircut 
of 1.8% to the most recently available net operating income 
(NOI). Moody's value reflects a weighted average capitalization 
rate of 9.5%.




Moody's actual and stressed conduit DSCRs are 1.59X and 1.01X, 
respectively, compared to 1.61X and 0.99X at the last 
review. Moody's actual DSCR is based on Moody's NCF 
and the loan's actual debt service. Moody's stressed 
DSCR is based on Moody's NCF and a 9.25% stress rate 
the agency applied to the loan balance.




The largest loan with a structured credit assessment is the 375 Park Avenue 
Loan ($209 million -- 15% of the pool), which 
represents a participation interest in a senior mortgage loan. 
The loan is secured by the Seagram Building, a trophy, landmark 
office tower located in Midtown Manhattan. The property was 88% 
leased as of June 2014. Moody's structured credit assessment and 
stressed DSCR are aaa (sca.pd) and 1.64X, respectively, 
unchanged from last review.




The second largest loan with a structured credit assessment is the Paramount 
Building Loan ($55 million -- 4% of the pool), 
which represents a participation interest in a $130 million mortgage 
loan. The loan is secured by a 31-story, Class A office 
property in the Times Square section of Midtown Manhattan. The 
property was originally constructed in 1926 and received a major overhaul 
in 2006. The property incudes ground floor retail space leased 
to national retail and restaurant tenants. Moody's structured credit 
assessment and stressed DSCR are aaa (sca.pd) and 1.67X, 
unchanged from the last review.




The top three performing conduit loans represent 19% of the pool 
balance. The largest loan is the Moffett Towers Phase II Loan ($115 
million -- 9% of the pool), which is secured by three, 
eight-story, Class A suburban office properties in Sunnyvale, 
California. The properties were 100% occupied as of December 
2014, compared to 91% at securitization. The two tenants 
occupying the property are the Hewlett-Packard Company and a subsidiary 
of Amazon.com, Inc. Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR 
are 107% and 0.94X, respectively, unchanged 
from the prior review.




The second largest loan is the 175 Park Avenue Loan ($74 million 
-- 5% of the pool). The loan is secured by a 270,000 
square foot, Class A, suburban office property in Madison, 
New Jersey. The property was originally built in 1971 and was extensively 
renovated into the headquarters office for Realogy Holdings Corporation, 
the real estate conglomerate. Realogy occupies 100% of the 
property under a lease set to expire in March 2030, six and a half 
years after scheduled loan maturity. After an initial interest-only 
period, the loan is now amortizing. Moody's LTV and stressed 
DSCR are 103% and 1.00X, respectively, compared 
to 105% and 0.99X at the last review.




The third largest loan is the Westin San Diego Loan ($69 million 
-- 5% of the pool). The loan is secured by a 27-story, 
436-room, full service hotel property in downtown San Diego, 
California. The hotel property is part of a larger, mixed 
use development which contains non-collateral components, 
including condominium residences and offices. Moody's LTV and stressed 
DSCR are 96% and, 1.15X, respectively, 
compared to 98% and 1.13X at the last review.




REGULATORY DISCLOSURES




For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and 
sensitivity analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and 
Sensitivity to Assumptions of the disclosure form.




Moody's did not receive or take into account a third-party 
assessment on the due diligence performed regarding the underlying assets 
or financial instruments related to the monitoring of this transaction 
in the past six months.




The analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and 
performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected 
collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments. As a 
second step, Moody's estimates expected collateral losses or cash 
flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement, 
loss allocation and other structural features, to derive the expected 
loss for each rated instrument.




Moody's did not use any stress scenario simulations in its analysis.




For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series 
or category/class of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings 
are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's 
rating practices. For ratings issued on a support provider, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the rating action on the support provider and in relation to each particular 
rating action for securities that derive their credit ratings from the 
support provider's credit rating. For provisional ratings, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the provisional rating assigned, and in relation to a definitive 
rating that may be assigned subsequent to the final issuance of the debt, 
in each case where the transaction structure and terms have not changed 
prior to the assignment of the definitive rating in a manner that would 
have affected the rating. For further information please see the 
ratings tab on the issuer/entity page for the respective issuer on www.moodys.com.




For any affected securities or rated entities receiving direct credit 
support from the primary entity(ies) of this rating action, and 
whose ratings may change as a result of this rating action, the 
associated regulatory disclosures will be those of the guarantor entity. 
Exceptions to this approach exist for the following disclosures, 
if applicable to jurisdiction: Ancillary Services, Disclosure 
to rated entity, Disclosure from rated entity.




Regulatory disclosures contained in this press release apply to the credit 
rating and, if applicable, the related rating outlook or rating 
review.

Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody’s Corporation (“MCO”), hereby discloses that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from $1,500 to approximately $2,500,000. MCO and MIS also maintain policies and procedures to address the independence of MIS’s ratings and rating processes. Information regarding certain affiliations that may exist between directors of MCO and rated entities, and between entities who hold ratings from MIS and have also publicly reported to the SEC an ownership interest in MCO of more than 5%, is posted annually at www.moodys.com under the heading “Investor Relations — Corporate Governance — Director and Shareholder Affiliation Policy.” Additional terms for Australia only: Any publication into Australia of this document is pursuant to the Australian Financial Services License of MOODY’S affiliate, Moody’s Investors Service Pty Limited ABN 61 003 399 657AFSL 336969 and/or Moody’s Analytics Australia Pty Ltd ABN 94 105 136 972 AFSL 383569 (as applicable).

Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

ASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE APPLICABLE
SERVICING CRITERIA
�
The management (�Management�)
of the Corporate Trust Services division of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (the �Company�) is responsible
for assessing the Company�s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB
of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Management has determined that the servicing criteria are applicable in regards to the
servicing platform for the period as follows:
�
Period: As of and for the twelve months
ended December 31, 2014 (the �Period�).
�
Platform: The platform consists of residential
mortgage-backed securities (�RMBS�) transactions backed by pools of residential mortgage loans and commercial
mortgage-backed securities (�CMBS�) transactions backed by pools of commercial mortgage loans, in each case
for which the Company provides document custody services and where the RMBS and CMBS transactions were either (a) publicly-issued
pursuant to a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933 on or after January 1, 2006, or (b) privately-issued pursuant
to an exemption from registration on or after January 1, 2006 where the Company has an obligation under the transaction agreements
to deliver an assessment of compliance with the applicable servicing criteria under Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB; provided however
that, the platform excludes any transactions where the offered securities were issued, sponsored and/or guaranteed by any agency
or instrumentality of the U.S. government or any government sponsored entity, other than certain securitizations of residential
mortgage loan transactions issued, sponsored and/or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Company (the �Document
Custody Platform�). Appendix A identifies the individual transactions defined by Management as constituting the
Document Custody Platform for the Period.
�
Applicable Servicing Criteria: Management
has determined that the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d)(1)(ii), 1122(d)(1)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(i), 1122(d)(4)(ii) and
1122(d)(4)(iii) are applicable to the activities performed by the Company with respect to the Document Custody Platform for the
Period; provided however that, with respect to the Document Custody Platform, servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii) is applicable
only as it relates to the Company�s obligation to review and maintain the required loan documents related to any additions,
removals or substitutions in accordance with the transaction agreements (the �Applicable Servicing Criteria�).
Management has determined that all other servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) are not applicable to the Document Custody
Platform.
�
With respect to the Document Custody Platform
and the Period, Management provides the following assessment of the Company�s compliance with respect to the Applicable Servicing
Criteria:
�
1. Management is responsible for assessing
the Company�s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria.
�
2. Management has assessed the Company�s
compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria. In performing this assessment, Management used the criteria set forth by the
Securities and Exchange Commission in paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB.

DBRS Confirms Ratings on COMM 2013-CCRE8 Mortgage Trust 


February 13, 2017







DBRS Limited (DBRS) has today confirmed the following classes of COMM 2013-CCRE8 Mortgage Trust:

-- Class A-1 at AAA (sf)
-- Class A-2 at AAA (sf)
-- Class A-3 at AAA (sf)
-- Class A-4 at AAA (sf)
-- Class A-5 at AAA (sf)
-- Class A-SBFL at AAA (sf)
-- Class A-SBFX at AAA (sf)
-- Class A-M at AAA (sf)
-- Class B at AA (sf)
-- Class C at A (high) (sf)
-- Class D at BBB (sf)
-- Class E at BB (high) (sf)
-- Class F at B (high) (sf)
-- Class X-A at AAA (sf)
-- Class X-B at AAA (sf)
-- Class X-C at AAA (sf)

All trends are Stable. DBRS does not rate the first loss piece, Class G. The Class A-SBFX certificates are exchangeable with the Class A-SBFL certificates and vice versa.

The rating confirmations reflect the overall stable performance of the transaction. At issuance, the pool consisted of 59 fixed-rate loans secured by 94 commercial properties. As of the January 2017 remittance, there has been collateral reduction of 3.9% since issuance with all of the original 59 loans outstanding. The current outstanding trust balance is $1.330 billion. The top 15 loans reported a weighted-average (WA) YE2015 debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) of 1.90 times (x), representative of a WA improvement over the DBRS original analyzed figures of 16.0% and a WA debt yield of 8.5%. The top 15 loans reported a WA 1.1% improvement in YE2015 net cash flow compared with YE2014 figures. According to partial-year 2016 reporting, positive cash flow trends are continuing. Since issuance, five loans representing 8.2% of the pool balance, including two loans in the top 15, have fully defeased.

As of the January 2017 remittance, there were three loans in special servicing, representing 1.6% of the pool balance, and three loans on the servicer�s watchlist, representing 3.4% of the pool balance. Two of the specially serviced loans are expected to be resolved in the near future, which are expected to cause realized losses to the trust. The losses are expected to be contained to the unrated bond, Class G. The third loan recently transferred for delinquency. One of the three watchlisted loans is secured by a hotel property, which reported a performance decline below the 1.10x DSCR threshold, but has since seen an improvement in performance. For additional information on these loans and the remaining watchlisted loans, please see the servicer�s reported data and DBRS commentary on the DBRS IReports platform at www.ireports.dbrs.com.

At issuance, DBRS shadow-rated the 375 Park Avenue (Prospectus ID#1, 15.7% of the pool balance) loan and The Paramount Building loan (Prospectus ID#6, 4.1% of the pool balance) as investment grade. DBRS has today confirmed that the performance of these loans remains consistent with investment-grade loan characteristics.

DBRS has provided updated loan-level commentary and analysis for larger and/or pivotal watchlisted and specially serviced loans as well as for the largest 15 loans in the pool in the DBRS CMBS IReports platform. To view these and future loan-level updates provided as part of DBRS�s ongoing surveillance for this transaction, please log into DBRS CMBS IReports at www.ireports.dbrs.com.

HARP Loan















Advertorial






 (877) 792-9388

What is the HARP Program?
When you have little equity in your home, or owe as much or more on your mortgage than your home is worth, it can be difficult to find a lender willing to help you refinance.
                            But for borrowers who have remained current on their mortgages, and have loans owned by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, there is hope. It’s called Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP).
                        
Introduced in March 2009, HARP enables borrowers with little or no equity to refinance into more affordable mortgages without new or additional mortgage insurance.
                            HARP targets borrowers with loan-to-value (LTV) ratios equal to or greater than 80 percent and who have limited delinquencies over the 12 months prior to refinancing.







Significant changes have been made to HARP since the program was first introduced. For example, in 2011 the LTV ceiling was removed, property appraisal requirements were waived in certain circumstances, certain risk fees for borrowers
                            selecting shorter amortization terms were eliminated, and certain representations and warranties were waived. In 2013, the eligibility date was changed from the date the loan was acquired by Fannie Mae                            or Freddie Mac to the date on the note, increasing the pool of eligible borrowers.
                        
Through HARP, you can get a lower interest rate (which means less out-of-pocket costs each month), get a shorter loan term, or change from an adjustable to fixed-rate
                            mortgage. There’s no minimum credit score needed, either.
                        
And now that HARP guidelines are simpler, even people who were formerly turned down may now be eligible for HARP refinancing.
                        
Find out if you qualify for HARP!




How can HARP help me?
If you are current on your mortgage; have a mortgage that is owned by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, and owe as much or more than your home is currently worth, you may be eligible for HARP refinancing. That can mean significant savings
                            by: 

Lowering your monthly payment
Reducing your interest rate
Securing a fixed-rate mortgage that won’t change over time
Building equity faster—shorter term options may be available
Lower closing costs because an appraisal is not usually required
Check your HARP eligibility‎!





HARP program includes:


No underwater limits
Borrowers will now be able to refinance regardless of how far their homes have fallen in value. Previous loan-to-value limits were set at 125 percent.
                                


No appraisals or underwriting
Most homeowners will not have to get an appraisal or have their loan underwritten, making their refinance process smoother and faster.


Modified fees
Certain risk-based fees for borrowers who refinance into shorter-term loans have been reduced.


Less paperwork
Lenders now need less paperwork for income verification, and have the option of qualifying a borrower by documenting that the borrower has at least 12 months
                                    of mortgage payments in reserve.


Program Deadline
The end date to get a HARP refinance is September 30, 2017.


Check if you qualify for HARP before it's gone!






Might you be eligible?
See if you meet these basic eligibility requirements:

You are current on your mortgage, with no 30-day+ late payments in the last six months and no more than one in the past 12 months
Your home is your primary residence, a 1-unit second home or a 1- to 4-unit investment property.
Your loan is owned by Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae. You can use the Loan Look-up Tools below if you are unsure.
Your loan was originated on or before May 31, 2009.
Your current loan-to-value (LTV) ratio must be greater than 80%.
Verify your HARP eligibility now‎!











Gather your financial information
Make sure you have your basic financial and loan information on hand when you call your mortgage company. You’ll need:

Your mortgage statements, including information on a second mortgage (if applicable).
Your income details (paystub or income tax return).






Connect with us
The licensed lending officer will also explain all the steps–from getting started, to locking in your low rate, to closing your loan quickly. Because we are a direct lender, if you have any questions during the loan process,
                                you will have one direct number enabling you to get quick answers straight from the source.
