What a constant stream of oil company spending cuts means for crude prices
              
              Oil companies are sounding a recurring theme: lower exploration and production spending estimates. Will that lead to a rally in oil prices?

How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve

A quarter of S&P 500’s 2017 climb due to five stocks (yes, those five)
              
              Throughout 2017, there’s one acronym that investors have in particular been sinking their teeth into: FAANG.

Amazon earnings fall 77%, shares drop
              
              Amazon.com Inc.  reported much lower earnings than expected Thursday, and shares declined more than 2% in late trading. The e-commerce giant reported net income of $197 million, or 40 cents a share, on sales of $38 billion, a profit decline of 77% from the same quarter a year ago. Analysts on average expected Amazon to report earnings of $1.41 a share on sales of $37.2 billion. The company's spending cut into profit, as fulfillment costs -- the amount Amazon spends to fulfill customers' orders on its e-commerce platform -- rose about 33% from a year ago and spending on technology and content increased by about 43%. Amazon stock traded at all-time highs this week, making Amazon the fourth U.S. company with a market capitalization of $500 billion and briefly giving Chief Executive Jeff Bezos the title of richest man in the world, but shares declined about 2% in immediate after-hours action.

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks

              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

        The Company

        Corporate Profile




Pampa Energ�a S.A. is one of the most important energy companies in Argentina. Over a decade, through its electricity subsidiaries and affiliates Pampa has been involved in the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity, placing the Company as the largest fully integrated electricity company in Argentina. Moreover, the Company participates in transportation of natural gas and processing of natural gas liquids.
Along with the acquisition of Petrobras Argentina, it sets a huge step towards the consolidation of Pampa Energ�a in the Argentine energy industry, being its core primary business exploration and production of oil and gas through the incorporation of large amounts of production and reserves of oil and gas. Moreover, we add power generation installed capacity and other businesses to our asset portfolio, such as fuels production and retail, lubricants manufacturing and the participation in petrochemical business.
In Oil and Gas, our Exploration and Production segment is mainly composed by Petrobras Argentina’s assets plus Petrolera Pampa’s, with a total of 18 productive blocks and 10 exploratory blocks, as well as a daily production of 27 thousand barrels of oil per day of oil and 9.5 million m3 per day of natural gas.
Our Midstream segment, Pampa has a presence through its indirect stake in TGS, the country’s major gas transportation company, owning a 9,184 km-long gas pipeline network and a gas fuel processing plant, General Cerri, with an output capacity of 1 million tons.
At Downstream, our Bah�a Blanca Refinery has a processing installed capacity of 30.2 thousand barrels per day, supplying a retail network of 265 gas stations across the country and storing all fuel products in two plants strategically located. Moreover, Pampa holds a 28.5% stake in Refinor, which has a daily refining capacity of 26.4 thousand barrels.
In Petrochemicals, we have three plants located at the shores of Paran� River, which produce and hold most of the local market shares of styrene, polystyrene, BOPs and synthetic rubber.
Our power generation segment has an installed capacity of 3,433 MW, which represents 10.2% of Argentina’s installed capacity.
Our power transmission segment co-controls the operation and maintenance of the Argentine high voltage transmission grid covering more than 14.5 thousand km of proprietary lines, as well as 6.2 thousand km of Transba-owned high voltage lines. Transener transports 90% of the electricity in Argentina. Moreover, Petrobras Argentina indirectly holds a stake in 22 km of high voltage lines in the Province of Corrientes.
Our electricity distribution segment is composed of Edenor, the largest electricity distributor in Argentina, with 2.8 million customers and a concession area covering the Northern City of Buenos Aires and Northwestern Greater Buenos Aires.
Pampa is listed on the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange (‘BCBA’), and is one of the Argentine companies with a greater weight on the Merval index (8.953% since July 1, 2016). Pampa has a Level II ADS program admitted to listing on the New York Stock Exchange (‘NYSE’), and each ADS represents 25 common shares.

YP advertisers receive higher placement in the default ordering of search results and may appear in sponsored listings on the top, side, or bottom of the search results page.Sort:DefaultDefaultDistanceRatingName (A - Z)Sponsored LinksAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your home collection!Error when adding to home collectionThis business was removed from the home collection1. Key Energy SvcHwy 15 E Loop Rd & Highway 1Perryton, TX 79070(806) 435-5893Energy Conservation ConsultantsWebsiteBusinesses in related categories to Energy Conservation ConsultantsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your home collection!Error when adding to home collectionThis business was removed from the home collection2. Beicker Spray Foam Insealation757 N Highway 123 BypSeguin, TX 78155(830) 303-8200Insulation Contractors Equipment &...WebsiteDirectionsMore InfoFrom Business: Beicker Insealation offers Icynene spray foam insulation in San Antonio, Austin, New Braunfels, Seguin and surrounding areas; Icynene is green, quiet, healthy, and energy-efficient.Beicker Insulation is a Beicker Building and Remodeling Company in business for over 30 years.

Our story




Gu-ru / ‘goroō /
Noun:
1. A mentor, a teacher, one who helps you move forward.
2. A source of inspiration and good energy.


GURU
A Story of Organic Growth
Ever since the early days, GURU has always been driven by this idea of crafting the best natural energy drink out there. Founded in Montreal during the summer of 1999 by four college friends, the company marketed the world's first all-natural energy drink.
More than 15 years later, this vision is not only fulfilled but is also thriving and expanding worldwide. GURU has become the #1 Organic Energy Drink in Canada and the US in the Health Channel thanks to a strong network of distribution partnerships and a passionate sales team. 
With research & development at the forefront of our expansion, GURU now tackles a new market and adventure with the recent introduction of our Energy Waters. This new line of product arrives just in time to satisfy a growing demand for organic sugar and calorie-free energy beverages.
In short, GURU has and will always believe that energy should not come at the expense of health. That is what has brought our company a steady and organic growth.
Our Philosophy
Through its corporate philosophy and its beverages, GURU gives good energy for people to make great things, reminding that, with the right dose of will, inspiration and energy, achieving great results is within everyone's reach. 
People today define themselves less by what they have and more by what they do and contribute to the world. Resourcefulness, imagination, inventiveness is today’s new currency. Whether using technology, natural ingredients or just plain common sense, people who Make it Good are the ones who seek to make everything better. We call them Makers.
They are pioneers that never settle. Makers, not followers. Crafters not manufacturers. Some may call them obsessed, exceptional or extraordinary people. But these are men and women who are true innovators, thought leaders and doers in their respective communities. They make the impossible possible.

Luc Martin-Privat
Our Brew Master
Meet Luc our Brew Master. He is the brains behind GURU.  In fact, while he could have become your friendly neighborhood pharmacist, Luc had other dreams…
From the functional herbs he started playing with in his dad’s lab to his PhD in Pharmacology, Luc has mastered the art of blending botanicals, an art he is now applying to our beloved GURU.
Always on the lookout for smart organics from around the world, Luc is looking into the GURU recipe “Organically” to make it perfect everytime! And when he is not looking at new ways to craft our GURU, Luc is dreaming about new products!
