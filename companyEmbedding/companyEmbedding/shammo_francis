Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/24/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Verizon CFO: FCC Ruling 'Cluttered' Broadband Future


2 Mar, 2015


By: Erik Gruenwedel 






 



Verizon CFO Francis Shammo

Francis Shammo says ISP reclassification as utility could affect investment and innovation going forward

A promising broadband investment landscape received unwanted intrusion (regulation) following the Federal Communications Commission’s recent 3-2 vote in favor of reclassifying the nation’s ISPs under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934, Verizon CFO Francis Shammo told an investor group.
Speaking March 2 at the Morgan Stanley’s 2015 Technology, Media & Telecom confab in San Francisco, Shammo said that while the exact language of the FCC ruling hasn’t been available to the public, the mere specter of regulation is not a good thing.
The CFO said that prior to the FCC vote, Verizon saw an open playing field to invest, innovate and deliver products to the consumer.
“Now, that field has been cluttered up with a lot of obstacles,” Shammo said. “It’s going to be more difficult to invest, more difficult to innovate.”
Specifically, he said that innovation would now require navigating burdensome regulation on select areas of broadband distribution — a reality Shammo said invites confusion.
“I’m pretty much assured [the FCC vote] will have an impact on investment and innovation over the longer term just like we’ve seen in Europe and other places,” he said. “But, you can probably make the assumption there’s going to be a lot of litigation around this one when it’s all said and done.”
Meanwhile, Shammo said the telecom’s pending mobile video over-the-top platform would combine Verizon Digital Media Services, Edgecast and OnCue to deliver a “very viable” consumer product that can do “a lot of things."
“There’s going to be very different models in mobile video than there [is] in the linear TV. You can’t make money paying $5 [to content holders] for every subscriber you have. With 103 million [mobile] subs, it doesn’t make economic sense. And the content holders know that,” he said.
The CFO said the platform would attempt to meld multicast technology as during Verizon’s exclusive mobile wireless distribution rights to the Super Bowl and select IndyCar events.
Shammo said exclusive content would be a component of the mobile OTT service, but different from traditional linear TV. He said retransmissions deals with the NFL and IndyCar have shown Verizon how people consume wireless content.
Notably, the CFO said the average mobile video user consumes about 30 minutes of content daily spread out over short clips.
“You’re not going to watch a linear TV program here. The NFL has been a huge success during the [football] season. We saw a lot of growth in our consumer usage during that. Similar to what we saw in the World Cup. We’re learning a lot about usage patterns that we’re going to adopt in over-the-top video.”

Matt Ellis appointed CFO, effective Nov. 1













NEW YORK – Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE, Nasdaq: VZ) today announced that Francis J. (Fran) Shammo plans to retire at the end of 2016 after 27 years with the company. Prior to his retirement, he will step down as executive vice president and chief financial officer, effective Nov. 1.
Verizon’s Board of Directors today appointed Matthew D. (Matt) Ellis to succeed Shammo as executive vice president and CFO. Ellis is currently senior vice president and CFO - Operations Finance, responsible for providing financial support to Verizon’s wireless and wireline business units.
Verizon Chairman and CEO Lowell McAdam said, “I’ve worked closely with Fran for many years and have been continually impressed by his success at balancing the needs of customers, shareholders and employees. He has been a tremendous leader, and a voice of sound advice and counsel to me and the rest of Verizon’s leadership team. While Fran will be greatly missed, I respect his decision to retire, and I am pleased that he will stay through year-end to ensure a smooth transition.”
McAdam added, “I’m also pleased that we have such great bench strength at Verizon that our Board could appoint an executive as accomplished as Matt Ellis to succeed Fran. Within months of joining Verizon as treasurer in 2013, Matt led the team that raised a record $49 billion in one day to help finance Verizon’s acquisition of Vodafone’s interest in Verizon Wireless.”
Shammo said, “This is a great time for me to make this personal move. For Verizon, 2016 has been a significant transformational year, and I will leave knowing that the company is well-positioned to deliver on its strategic initiatives.”
Shammo, 55, was appointed Verizon CFO in November 2010, with responsibility for the company’s finance and strategic planning operations, and financial transaction services. Under his leadership, Verizon has focused on a strategy of network investment, strong dividends and transactions designed to deliver sustainable shareholder value. The company has divested non-strategic assets while securing complete ownership of Verizon Wireless and acquiring other assets (such as AOL Inc., Telogis Inc., and the recently announced Fleetmatics Group PLC and Yahoo! Inc. transactions) that position the company for future growth in the mobile video and Internet of Things markets.
Before 2010, Shammo was president and chief executive officer of Verizon Telecom and Business. Previously, Shammo was president of Verizon Business (now Verizon Enterprise Solutions), and prior to that he served as senior vice president and chief financial officer for Verizon Business.
Shammo had also served as president - West area for Verizon Wireless, and he was vice president and controller at the time of Verizon Wireless’ launch in 1999.
Shammo joined predecessor company Bell Atlantic Mobile in 1989.
Ellis joined Verizon from Tyson  
Succeeding Shammo, Ellis will report to McAdam as Verizon CFO. Ellis, 45, currently reports to John Stratton, executive vice president and president of Operations, and a successor will be announced at a future date.






 








 






Prior to Ellis’ current role of providing financial leadership for Verizon’s business units, he was senior vice president and treasurer for Verizon, responsible for corporate-wide financing, cash management, pension and insurance activities, as well as the Verizon Capital Group.














Ellis joined Verizon in 2013, after having spent 15 years at Tyson Foods, Inc. in a variety of roles. At Tyson, he was vice president and treasurer, responsible for financing, cash management, insurance and credit. From 2007 through 2010, Ellis was vice president - Finance, where he was involved in merger and acquisition activity, including transactions in China, Brazil and India. From 2005 to 2007, Ellis was vice president - Country Manager, with responsibility for all aspects of Tyson’s Mexico subsidiary.
Previously, Ellis worked in England for Dixons Stores Group PLC and Coopers & Lybrand, where he qualified as a Chartered Accountant.
Ellis holds a Bachelor of Commerce (Accounting) degree from the University of Birmingham in the United Kingdom.
