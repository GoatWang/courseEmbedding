Team — Bractlet






















































We AreChallenging the status quo with innovative, insightful, and intuitive energy solutions






 Why We're HereWe believe energy efficiency should be easy. With technology and data, the opportunity to solve operational and efficiency problems in the built environment has never been greater. We're dedicated to unlocking the energy potential hiding in buildings; saving energy resources and improving our world in the process. In 2012, when we looked at the available technology, we saw a smattering of products that could solve small pieces of the problem, but the solution was far from complete. The industry was fraught with vague savings claims, antiquated processes, overpriced hardware, and no means to make sense of data even when people could get their hands on it. We saw a need for a comprehensive kind of technology, and we knew it would take a comprehensive kind of company to build it. That's why we founded Bractlet.    Leadership Team

Analyze — Bractlet






















































A building analyzedwith precisionBractlet merges data collection with energy modeling to quickly and accurately find and predict energy savings






More advanced than industry standards, Bractlet's energy analytics enables fast, exact and cost-effective equipment-level energy modeling.Bractlet analysis follows three steps—building baseline energy models, identifying savings opportunities and forecasting energy savings.Building baseline energy models.We generate dynamic, physics-based building models that enable us to forecast the energy consumption effects of any modifications to a building with unmatched (98%) accuracy. By simulating millions of variables and interactions we can understand relationships between equipment-performance, building occupancy/operations, and outdoor environmental variables. 






Building model with individual thermal zones generated for analysis. 



 In addition to using cloud-based computing resources, our process is built to limit assumptions and increase speed and accuracy by:







Using as-designed equipment, architectural information and standard auditing processes.






We use advanced statistical analysis to understand relationships in the building.



Extracting operational characteristics through automated mining algorithms from BAS and equipment-level energy data.






Low error from simulated vs monitored power display accuracy of energy model. 



Automatically calibrating energy simulations using both equipment and building consumption data.Identify energy savings.Once a baseline energy model is established, Bractlet uses in-house energy experts and automated analytics—based on our historical database—to identify areas of savings.Our unique understanding of a building allows us to:Pinpoint non-capital energy conservation measures.Identify savings from complex and deep energy retrofits.Consider combined energy efficiency, renewable generation and energy storage solutions.






Understand and predict effects of savings measures at the equipment-level.



Predict energy savings.Bractlet simulates possible energy conservation measures by manipulating the baseline energy model. Our modeling was designed to consider interdependencies between savings measures and building systems.Our granular simulations allows us to run proprietary uncertainty analyses that quantify the risk of achieving energy savings, providing decision makers with key insights on energy efficiency opportunities. 






Savings distributions allow for risk and uncertainty to be quantified

It developed a product that combines hardware with software to collect data from building equipment by monitoring every branch circuit in a standard commercial electrical panel, up to 42 branch circuits, and the electrical mains and other components feeding individual pieces of equipment.




The Bractlet system uses the data it collects to generate analytics designed to enable property owners to compare cost savings of retrofitted units, CEO Alec Manfre said. He declined to provide the cost of the systems.
Earlier this month, the company reported completing a $300,000 seed financing from seven investors, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Manfre declined to name any of his angel investors, who he said were not based in Austin. He said the company had six customer installations.
Bractlet, which was founded in 2011 by a team of Georgia Tech engineers, has pivoted its business model several times and now plans to “make energy waste a thing of the past,” according to the company website. It has three employees.
In early 2013, Manfre and his team participated in the 12-week Surge Accelerator in Houston designed for energy focused software startups.
