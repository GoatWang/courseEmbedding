Description



Access to case studies expires six months after purchase date.



Publication Date: May 14, 2008

 As CEO of leading executive search firm Heidrick & Struggles for the past 18 months, Kevin Kelly was pleased with his accomplishments so far but concerned about threats he perceived to Heidrick's position at the highest levels of the executive search business. In response, Kelly had begun making strategic investments in firms offering technology-based solutions, but had not yet made significant progress convincing Heidrick's search consultants about the significance of the threats, or the risks and opportunities being created by information technology and the Internet. The increased emphasis Kelly placed on building leadership consulting services was itself a big change. The case asks what levers Kelly can use, from culture to compensation, to make the challenges to Heidrick's traditional business model understood, and how to implement the strategic initiatives he has launched.

Leadership Consulting



No organization wants to be left behind by the competition. The need for speed is driven by external factors, but the capacity to accelerate when necessary is driven internally. The board must hold its executive team accountable, executives must rise above divisional agendas for the sake of the whole, and talent must be developed, retained, and matched swiftly to opportunities.


An organization’s success depends on the speed with which it can forecast changing conditions and adopt strategies to stay ahead of the pack. We work with our clients to build their “capacity for pace” at all levels.
					    			    
Helping companies outperform competitors and win the race to value.

Culture Shaping



Every organization needs a culture strategy. An organization's culture plays a significant role in its ability to successfully execute strategic plans. Simply put: Culture drives performance. It enhances customer experience and employee engagement at all levels, brings desired values, behaviors and mindsets to life, and drives faster achievement of your business initiatives.
					    			    
Helping companies define, align, and scale culture to drive performance and results.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Shares Sold Short The total number of shares of a security that have been sold short and not yet repurchased. Change from Last Percentage change in short interest from the previous report to the most recent report. Exchanges report short interest twice a month.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.

History[edit]
Heidrick & Struggles was founded in 1953 by Gardner Heidrick and John E. Struggles, both former employees of the management consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton. Heidrick recruited Struggles, who previously worked as a personnel manager for Montgomery Ward, as his partner in the new venture establishing their presence in Chicago. The partnership heralded the beginning of one of the first executive search firms in the United States.[1] Their first three clients were West Virginia Coal & Coke Corporation, Northern Trust and Continental Can.
Heidrick & Struggles served as a launching pad for many top companies in the modern executive search industry. In Spring of 1955, Heidrick & Struggles hired Spencer Stuart, who would eventually leave to start his own executive search firm, Spencer Stuart.
In 1957, Heidrick & Struggles began expanding outside of the Midwest across the United States and onto both coasts with offices in Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York City. In 1968, the firm officially became an international provider by establishing an office in London. The firm would go on to expand globally with more than 50 offices across six continents and establish a world-class reputation in leadership.[2]
In 2014, Heidrick & Struggles International named Tracy R. Wolstencroft as President and Chief Executive Officer. Wolstencroft, who was also named to the Heidrick & Struggles Board of Directors, came to the firm after serving a 25-year career at Goldman, Sachs & Co. where he was a partner from 1994 – 2010.
Recent Acquisitions[edit]

In December 2012, Heidrick & Struggles acquired Senn Delaney, a leading firm in corporate culture shaping. The acquisition served as a step toward the strategy of building a premier professional services firm focused on serving the leadership of top international organizations. As the evolution of the executive search industry continued to grow and evolve, Heidrick & Struggles’ purchase of Senn Delaney opened the doors to a complementary service highly coveted by top executives. The purchase closed with an acquisition cost of $53.3 million.[3]
In October, 2015, Heidrick & Struggles acquired London-based advisory boutique Co Company, expanding its offerings with this leadership consultancy focusing on the service of accelerating organizational performance. Co Company Chairman Colin Price joined Heidrick & Struggles as Executive Vice President leading its leadership consulting practice globally.

History[edit]
Heidrick & Struggles was founded in 1953 by Gardner Heidrick and John E. Struggles, both former employees of the management consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton. Heidrick recruited Struggles, who previously worked as a personnel manager for Montgomery Ward, as his partner in the new venture establishing their presence in Chicago. The partnership heralded the beginning of one of the first executive search firms in the United States.[1] Their first three clients were West Virginia Coal & Coke Corporation, Northern Trust and Continental Can.
Heidrick & Struggles served as a launching pad for many top companies in the modern executive search industry. In Spring of 1955, Heidrick & Struggles hired Spencer Stuart, who would eventually leave to start his own executive search firm, Spencer Stuart.
In 1957, Heidrick & Struggles began expanding outside of the Midwest across the United States and onto both coasts with offices in Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York City. In 1968, the firm officially became an international provider by establishing an office in London. The firm would go on to expand globally with more than 50 offices across six continents and establish a world-class reputation in leadership.[2]
In 2014, Heidrick & Struggles International named Tracy R. Wolstencroft as President and Chief Executive Officer. Wolstencroft, who was also named to the Heidrick & Struggles Board of Directors, came to the firm after serving a 25-year career at Goldman, Sachs & Co. where he was a partner from 1994 – 2010.
Recent Acquisitions[edit]

In December 2012, Heidrick & Struggles acquired Senn Delaney, a leading firm in corporate culture shaping. The acquisition served as a step toward the strategy of building a premier professional services firm focused on serving the leadership of top international organizations. As the evolution of the executive search industry continued to grow and evolve, Heidrick & Struggles’ purchase of Senn Delaney opened the doors to a complementary service highly coveted by top executives. The purchase closed with an acquisition cost of $53.3 million.[3]
In October, 2015, Heidrick & Struggles acquired London-based advisory boutique Co Company, expanding its offerings with this leadership consultancy focusing on the service of accelerating organizational performance. Co Company Chairman Colin Price joined Heidrick & Struggles as Executive Vice President leading its leadership consulting practice globally.

History[edit]
Heidrick & Struggles was founded in 1953 by Gardner Heidrick and John E. Struggles, both former employees of the management consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton. Heidrick recruited Struggles, who previously worked as a personnel manager for Montgomery Ward, as his partner in the new venture establishing their presence in Chicago. The partnership heralded the beginning of one of the first executive search firms in the United States.[1] Their first three clients were West Virginia Coal & Coke Corporation, Northern Trust and Continental Can.
Heidrick & Struggles served as a launching pad for many top companies in the modern executive search industry. In Spring of 1955, Heidrick & Struggles hired Spencer Stuart, who would eventually leave to start his own executive search firm, Spencer Stuart.
In 1957, Heidrick & Struggles began expanding outside of the Midwest across the United States and onto both coasts with offices in Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York City. In 1968, the firm officially became an international provider by establishing an office in London. The firm would go on to expand globally with more than 50 offices across six continents and establish a world-class reputation in leadership.[2]
In 2014, Heidrick & Struggles International named Tracy R. Wolstencroft as President and Chief Executive Officer. Wolstencroft, who was also named to the Heidrick & Struggles Board of Directors, came to the firm after serving a 25-year career at Goldman, Sachs & Co. where he was a partner from 1994 – 2010.
Recent Acquisitions[edit]

In December 2012, Heidrick & Struggles acquired Senn Delaney, a leading firm in corporate culture shaping. The acquisition served as a step toward the strategy of building a premier professional services firm focused on serving the leadership of top international organizations. As the evolution of the executive search industry continued to grow and evolve, Heidrick & Struggles’ purchase of Senn Delaney opened the doors to a complementary service highly coveted by top executives. The purchase closed with an acquisition cost of $53.3 million.[3]
In October, 2015, Heidrick & Struggles acquired London-based advisory boutique Co Company, expanding its offerings with this leadership consultancy focusing on the service of accelerating organizational performance. Co Company Chairman Colin Price joined Heidrick & Struggles as Executive Vice President leading its leadership consulting practice globally.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
