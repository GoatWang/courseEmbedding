            I am considering purchasing the 15 x 8 shed model # 6446. Will this extension (model 6422) fit that model.
        
Asked by: John

            This is actually a question for the Lifetime rep who answered John's 2-3-17 question. Lifetime:  you make an extension (this item, #6422) for a shed (#6446) -- but if customers actually USE the extension for its intended purpose, they void their warranty?  What?!!

        All in all, a good deal.
While the price isn't cheap, keep in mind the shipping is free. The package isn't small & is delivered by a semi truck. It can also be a bit tricky fitting new panels to an older shed. Tip: use shims to get the floor snapped into place.

        LOOKS GREAT !!!
the expansion looks great from the outside but the product was missing the wall supports and the floor was completely different than the original floor pattern, overall the product is good. I called about the missing parts (wall supports) and they shipped immediately, I received them in a couple of days.

        Wouldn't Fit
I carefully examined the specs and other customer reviews and thought this would easily extend my 8' shed. Unfortunately, the floor grooves were not the same as on the rest of my Lifetime Shed, and so the vertical panels would not fit properly with the others. Now I have to try and repack this monster and return it. I wish the extension was as workable as the shed itself, which is quite nice and highly recommended.

        Great shed extension
This little item is a gem.  We had gotten a lifetime shed a few years back and later realized we needed more space. This did the trick.  We can't believe how much more space it provides

        Wall to floor connection
I have two Lifetime sheds.  I used shims for the first assembly...helpful.
On the second shed, I sprayed the wall/ floor tabs with WD40. Perfect, slipped right in.

        Great Product!
I bought our original 8 X 5 building 7 years ago and decided to buy two expansion kits for it. They went together beautifully, no problems at all. Glad we did it...our new storage shed is now 8 X 10. It really looks nice!
