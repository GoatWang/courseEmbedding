10.02.2017McCormick Announces 4 New Products at 2017 Dealer Meeting
McCORMICK UNVEILS 4 NEW TRACTOR LINES FOR 2017, WILL SHOWCASE MODELS AT NATIONAL FARM MACHINERY SHOW

	DULUTH, GA, February 9, 2017 - McCormick North America recently hosted its annual 2017 Dealer Meeting event for its entire North American dealer network.  Held in Orlando, FL, McCormick unveiled 4 new tractor lines to further complement its full-line tractor offering.  New tractor families include the X4 STANDARD Series, X6 STANDARD Series, X6 VT-Drive Series, and X8 VT-Drive Series, which brings McCormick’s offering to over 300 horsepower!



	With the exception of the X8 VT-Drive Series, the newly released models fit into a horsepower segment that is already covered by McCormick tractor.  However, these new machines offer new levels of features, comfort, and performance that target a wider range of customers within the segment.  “We want to offer customers more choices within the McCormick tractor line-up,” says Tiago Bonomo, President of McCormick North America.  “Customers have specific needs, and we need to be able to meet those needs.”  After the initial unveiling in Orlando, McCormick will officially launch all 4 new models at the National Farm Machinery Show in Louisville, KY, booth 4060 in the North Wing.



	The new X4 STANDARD Series is a simple, reliable utility tractor that will target a market dominated by suppliers with manufacturing in low-cost countries.  All X4 STANDARD models are design in-house and built in McCormick factories located in Italy.  Boasting a reliable Deutz 4-cylinder diesel engine and 12-speed shuttle transmission, these machines are built to work.  The simple operator’s platform is constructed of steel for durability, yet includes comfortable refinements and intuitive control layout.  A powerful X-Series front loader (built by Alo) ensures that these new tractors can get the job done.  The X4 STANDARD Series offers 3 models from 64 to 79 horsepower.



	The new X6 STANDARD Series has similar attributes to its smaller brother, the X4 STANDARD Series, but in a larger chassis and with more power.  Two models will be available, boasting up to 121 and 130 horsepower.  These large, open station tractors feature a simplified configuration for those customers seeking a simple, reliable tractor with the power to handle big jobs around the farm.  A 4-cylinder BETAPOWER diesel engine drives the shuttle transmission and 4wd driveline.  Capable hydraulics provide massive lifting capacity at the 3-point hitch and ample flow for a loader and implements.  The large operator’s station with flat foot deck and comfortable control layout make the new X6 STANDARD Series a welcome option in the 100+ horsepower utility tractor segment.



	For customers looking for greater performance and technology in the large utility tractor segment, McCormick offers the new X6 VT-Drive model with CVT.  This dynamic and capable tractor boasts a continuously variable transmission and ISO BUS technology to boost productivity and take McCormick to the next level.  The continuously variable transmission (CVT) is a concept that combines the best features from two different transmissions:  the efficiency of a mechanical transmission, and the infinite speeds and smooth acceleration of a hydrostatic transmission.  The result is a tractor that delivers peak performance and maximum efficiency in nearly any application.  An integrated 12-inch color, touch-screen universal terminal with ISO BUS connectivity and available electronic hydraulic controls give greater flexibility and level of control to match the needs of demanding agricultural operations.  The single X6.430 VT-Drive model delivers up to 130 horsepower. 

  

	Last but not least, the New X8 Series extends McCormick’s reach to over 300 horsepower, allowing the brand to compete in the professional agricultural segment dominated by only a few major manufacturers.  This new high horsepower offering consists of 3 models ranging from 264 to 310 engine horsepower.  Each model features a powerful 6-cylinder BETAPOWER diesel engine and massive CVT transmission to deliver infinite speeds from 0 to 32 mph (0 to 50 kph).  Hydraulic front axle suspension and cab suspension provide both comfort and performance during operation.  Closed center hydraulics with up to 54 gpm (212 lpm) of flow can power a wide variety of implements.  The large cab is packed with technology and capabilities to meet the toughest demands, yet the tractor remains very simple to operator.  Intuitive controls and systems ensure that any operator can get in and drive, and that the tractor will perform in a wide range of operations.

	“Introducing these new models is a game changer for McCormick,” says Taylor Grout, Product and Marketing Manager for McCormick North America.  “Each model has unique qualities and features that target a specific customer segment.  These tractors expand McCormick’s reach in the market place and provide our customers with more choices to fit their needs.”

	Dealers and sales team members from all across the United States and Canada were invited to attend the 2017 Dealer Meeting on February 2nd and 3rd, 2017.  In addition to the unveiling of the 4 new series, attendees were informed of some new corporate initiatives being introduced in 2017 and beyond, and were also treated to exceptional accommodations, meals and entertainment at the Renaissance Orlando Sea World Hotel and Resort.

Show moreFood You want to feed your family healthy food, but making the best choices can be difficult, especially if you're on a budget or short on time   or if you or any members of your family have special dietary needs. Fortunately, Walmart makes it easy to plan meals and stock up on delicious and nutritious food that is also affordable. Barbecue essentials Anytime is a great time to fire up the barbecue. Grab some hot dogs, hamburgers, steaks, chops, corn on the cob and whatever else you like to grill and get ready for a fun food fest. Of course, barbecue essentials don't necessarily need to be cooked on a grill. Don't forget the: Chips and snacks, like pistachios and mixed nuts, almonds and snack crackers Dips and spreads, including salsa, guacamole and black bean dip Side dishes of rice, mac and cheese and pasta salad beans and chili Condiments, like ketchup, mustard, mayo and more You'll also find Walmart's lowest prices on picnic items like paper plates, napkins, plastic cups, plasticware and more, should you want to take your meal to the great outdoors. Beverages From water and juice to coffee, beer and wine, you'll find a wide variety of delicious and refreshing beverages at Walmart, all at Every Day Low Prices. Explore the varied selection of juices, where you'll find common favorites like apple, orange and cranberry juice as well as mixed fruit and vegetable juices and much more. Browse the soft drinks: colas, root beer, cream soda, fruit sodas and more in both standard and sugar-free varieties, including options from popular brands such as Coca Cola, Pepsi and A&W. If you've been exercising, try sports drinks, like Gatorade, to keep yourself hydrated and maybe a caffeinated energy drink to keep yourself going throughout the day. There is also a large selection of hot beverages, including coffee, tea and hot cocoa, plus adult beverages, including beer, wine and spirits. To turn an ordinary glass of water into a more appealing beverage, consider powdered drink mixes and drink enhancers, which come in a wide range of flavors and include diet and fortified options featuring vitamins and electrolytes. Healthy options Are you confused by all the nutritional information that's available? Walmart's Great For You products feature a simple icon that lets you know you're choosing a healthy item. That includes lots of the foods nutritionists say people should get more of, including fruits and vegetables, nuts and seeds and lean meats. It's also easy to find foods that meet special requirements. Simply filter your grocery searches by dietary need and you'll find products that are: Gluten free Sugar free Sodium free Fat free Nut free Dairy free There are also natural, organic, vegetarian, kosher and halal options. Walmart makes it easier to find the foods you want while simultaneously meeting your dietary requirements. No matter what type of special diet you are looking for, there are options that will help you make the right food choices day in and day out. Organic foods If you prefer to feed your family with natural or organic foods, enjoy Walmart's inventory of organic delights, which are made without artificial ingredients; they're grown without synthetic pesticides or chemical fertilizers. A food is labeled as organic by the way farmers grow and process their agricultural products, like different meats, fruits, vegetables, grains and dairy products. Organic farming practices are created to promote soil and water conservation and also to reduce pollution. The farmers who grow organic produce don't use what would be considered conventional methods to fertilize and control weeds. For example, organic farming practices would include the use of natural fertilizers to feed the soil and plants, while using crop rotation or mulch to manage the weeds. So what makes a product organic for certain? The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) established a certification program that requires all organic-labeled foods to meet strict government standards first. These standards regulate how such foods are grown, handled and processed. Thus, any product labeled as organic must be USDA certified. You could look through a variety of foods and check for the organic label on each one, but it s a much easier shopping process when everything can be found together, in one convenient location. Whatever your dietary goals or requirements are, you can easily find foods that meet your needs at Walmart. Just filter your search by dietary need and you'll find a large selection of delicious foods. Save Money.
