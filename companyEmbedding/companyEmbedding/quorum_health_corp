Press Releases


On August 4, 2015, Community Health Systems, Inc. (NYSE: CYH) announced plans to form a new, independent, publicly traded hospital company by spinning off a group of 38 hospitals and Quorum Health Resources, LLC, a leading hospital management and consulting firm.
The new company will be named Quorum Health Corporation and it will be headquartered in Middle Tennessee.
The company’s initial Form 10 Registration Statement was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 4, 2015.

The hospitals that will become part of Quorum Health Corporation have strong market positions and are primarily located in cities or counties having populations of 50,000 or less. In 84 percent of these markets, the hospital is the sole provider of acute care hospital services. In 2014, The Joint Commission recognized 74 percent of the hospitals that will become part of Quorum Health Corporation as Top Performers in Key Quality Measures.
The new company will also include Quorum Health Resources, which provides hospital management and consulting services to 150 non-affiliated hospitals across the United States, most of which are located in similar markets as Quorum Health Corporation’s sole provider hospitals.

Executive Leadership Team Announced

Thomas D. Miller, Chief Executive Officer
Thomas D. Miller currently serves as president of Division V Operations for Community Health Systems and oversees the operations of affiliated hospitals in Indiana, New Jersey, Ohio and Pennsylvania.

Prior to joining Community Health Systems, from 1998 through 2007, he served as the president and chief executive officer of Lutheran Health Network in northeast Indiana, a system that has grown to include eight hospital facilities.

Mr. Miller holds a bachelor’s degree from Auburn University and a master’s degree in hospital and health administration from the University of Alabama at Birmingham. He currently serves on the Board of Trustees of the American Hospital Association.

            COMMENTEMAILMORECommunity Health Systems is spinning off a portfolio of hospitals, as well as a management and consulting business.The company will be called Quorum Health Corp. and will own Quorum Health Resources, which is Community Health Systems' subsidiary that manages hospitals for other entities. Quorum Health Corp. will also own 38 hospitals in 16 states.The transaction bucks a trend toward consolidation among hospital owners and operators but points to an emphasis on niche and specialty operations.The spinoff divides CHS' 198-hospital portfolio into two, by size of the community.The hospitals slated for Quorum Health Corp. have a total of 3,635 beds and are primarily in communities or counties with 50,000 or fewer people.CHS' Smith: Quorum spinoff 'made a lot of sense'8 things to know about Community Health, Quorum spinThe portfolio is about 12 percent of Community Health Systems' existing portfolio of owned, leased or operated hospitals in 29 states with about 30,000 beds."This significant transaction will realign our portfolio into two strong and focused companies that can respond to market demands with greater agility and that are better positioned to take advantage of growth opportunities, while creating additional value for our stockholders," Wayne T. Smith, chairman and CEO of Community Health Systems in Franklin, said in a prepared statement.Hospitals in small or rural communities face a different set of challenges than counterparts in more populous areas. There can be issues finding access to capital, although those that are owned by corporations have fared somewhat better than publicly owned hospitals.Notably, there is also an issue of physician recruitment, said Craig Becker, president of the Tennessee Hospital Association in Nashville.Patients are often older and more chronically ill, Becker said, explaining that younger patients may be more willing to drive to a larger, more urban area than people who are older and want to stay close to home.Operating hospitals in small and rural communities requires a different managerial skill set.“Small and rural hospitals are probably the most vulnerable right now in terms of not of having enough resource to survive and go forward. They are run different,” Becker said. “I think that’s why LifePoint (Health) is successful in running rural hospitals; it’s their niche. It’s a whole different ballgame.”Article continues below photo (Photo: Submitted)Smith said in a statement that Quorum will be able “to focus on the changes in the healthcare delivery system, which are different in smaller community hospitals than in our larger and more urbanized markets. At the same time, the transaction will facilitate a sharper focus on the hospitals that are retained by Community Health Systems, especially in high-opportunity markets and in areas where we are building regional healthcare networks."Two hospitals in West Tennessee will be included in Quorum’s portfolio: Henderson County Community Hospital in Lexington and McKenzie Regional Hospital in McKenzie.Some of the hospitals moving to Quorum were acquired by Community Health Systems when it bought Health Management Associates in a $7.6 billion deal that closed in January 2014.“It would be customary for CHS to be focused on its management and resources on its highest performing assets,” said Richard Cowart, chairman of Baker Donelson's health and public policy department.Credit Suisse, a global investment bank, advised Community Health Systems on the spinoff, alongside law firms Bass Berry & Sims and Bradley Arant Boult Cummings.Community Health Systems, which is based in Franklin, plans to keep the newly established company local.Quorum Health Corp. will be headquartered in Middle Tennessee, although an exact location has not been confirmed, said Tomi Galin, senior vice president of corporate communications for Community Health Systems.The decision to put Quorum Health in the region underscores that "Nashville is where successful health care companies want to be located and further cements the city’s position as the health care capital of the country,” said Hayley Hovious, president of the Nashville Health Care Council, in a prepared statement to The Tennessean. “We are so pleased to have one of Nashville’s strongest companies grow and choose Middle Tennessee for its headquarters."Quorum Health Corp. will have its own management team and independent board of directors. Quorum will have an unaudited net revenue of about $2.1 billion at the outset.“It gives Nashville another company with a fresh management team. … It’s a nice energy,” Cowart said.Reach Holly Fletcher at 615-259-8287 and on Twitter @hollyfletcher.

TESTIMONIALS













												“We were a brand new management client and on a Friday evening, had to terminate our CEO and CFO.  With Quorum’s help, we had an interim CFO by Monday and interim CEO five days later.  As a small community hospital in California, this immediate support and guidance was really appreciated and I believe provided the community the peace of mind that the hospital would continue to run smoothly despite the leadership transition,” 											





												Rob Robbins											

												Board Member, Bear Valley Community Hospital30 bed general medical and surgical hospital											









												“Despite challenges from decreasing Medicaid funding and shifts in the payer mix, Quorum Health Resources’ process improvements and approach allowed us to increase our bottom line and optimize our revenue cycle performance.  I really appreciated the level of experience Quorum provided to our hospital, helping us pay attention to key areas, which needed to be improved on.  The engagement exceeded our expectations,” 											





												Randy Pirtle											

												Chief Financial Officer, King’s Daughters Medical Center465 bed hospital											









												“We looked at several local and national firms in our evaluation of potential partners to help institute the Lean Performance Improvement Process at North Country Hospital.  We selected Quorum Health Resources because of their deep knowledge of healthcare and their approach to integrate Lean as the model for the existing Quality improvement function, instead of Lean as a separate program.  The Quorum consultants were knowledgeable, supportive and most importantly, demonstrated an intimate understanding of challenges unique to healthcare,” 											





												Claudio Fort											

												President and Chief Executive Officer, North Country Hospital25 bed general medical and surgical hospital
