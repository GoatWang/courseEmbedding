CUI Global collects personally identifiable information, such as your e-mail address, name, home or work address or telephone number. CUI Global also collects anonymous demographic information, which is not unique to you, such as your ZIP code, age, gender, preferences, interests and favorites. There is also information about your computer hardware and software that is automatically collected by CUI Global. This information can include: your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring Web site addresses. This information is used by CUI Global for the operation of the service, to maintain quality of the service, and to provide general statistics regarding use of the CUI Global Web site. Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose personally identifiable information or personally sensitive data through CUI Global public message boards, this information may be collected and used by others. Note: CUI Global does not read any of your private online communications. CUI Global encourages you to review the privacy statements of Web sites you choose to link to from CUI Global so that you can understand how those Web sites collect, use and share your information. CUI Global is not responsible for the privacy statements or other content on Web sites outside of the CUI Global and CUI Global family of Web sites.
Use of your Personal Information

                        CUI Global collects and uses your personal information to operate the CUI Global Web site and deliver the services you have requested. CUI Global also uses your personally identifiable information to inform you of other products or services available from CUI Global and its affiliates. CUI Global may also contact you via surveys to conduct research about your opinion of current services or of potential new services that may be offered.

                        CUI Global does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third parties. CUI Global may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases, your unique personally identifiable information (e-mail, name, address, telephone number) is not transferred to the third party. In addition, CUI Global may share data with trusted partners to help us perform statistical analysis, send you email or postal mail, provide customer support, or arrange for deliveries. All such third parties are prohibited from using your personal information except to provide these services to CUI Global, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information.

                        CUI Global does not use or disclose sensitive personal information, such as race, religion, or political affiliations, without your explicit consent.

                        CUI Global keeps track of the Web sites and pages our customers visit within CUI Global, in order to determine what CUI Global services are the most popular.

                        CUI Global Web sites will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on CUI Global or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of CUI Global; and, (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of CUI Global, or the public.
                    
Use of Cookies

                        The CUI Global Web site use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.

                        One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize CUI Global pages, or register with CUI Global site or services, a cookie helps CUI Global to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same CUI Global Web site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the CUI Global features that you customized.

                        You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the CUI Global services or Web sites you visit.
                    
Security of your Personal Information

                        CUI Global secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. CUI Global secures the personally identifiable information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other Web sites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.
                    
Changes to this Statement

                        CUI Global will occasionally update this Statement of Privacy to reflect company and customer feedback. CUI Global encourages you to periodically review this Statement to be informed of how CUI Global is protecting your information.

Conflict Minerals







Conflict Minerals


In August of 2012, the SEC implemented Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Act, mandating all SEC issuers to report whether or not conflict minerals are used in the production of their products and to disclose the country of origin for these minerals.  Conflict minerals consist of tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold and are referred to as the 3TGs.  3TGs originate in multiple locations around the world including the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and adjoining countries (collectively referred to as the "Covered Countries").  In the DRC, some of the sources of the 3TGs are controlled by armed groups that have conducted severe human rights violations.

CUI Global, Inc. is committed to ethical business practices and the protection of basic human rights.  CUI Global expects all of its suppliers to have policies and procedures in place to ensure that any 3TGs used in the production of the products sold to CUI Global are DRC conflict-free.  This means that the products must not contain 3TGs that directly or indirectly finance or benefit armed groups in the Covered Countries.  CUI Global is actively working with its supply chain to do a Reasonable Country of Origin Inquiry (RCOI) while exercising due diligence by following the OECD Due Diligence Guidance.

There is also information about your computer hardware and software that is automatically collected by CUI Global. This information can include: your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring Web site addresses. This information is used by CUI Global for the operation of the service, to maintain quality of the service, and to provide general statistics regarding use of the CUI Global Web site. Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose personally identifiable information or personally sensitive data through CUI Global public message boards, this information may be collected and used by others. Note: CUI Global does not read any of your private online communications. CUI Global encourages you to review the privacy statements of Web sites you choose to link to from CUI Global so that you can understand how those Web sites collect, use and share your information. CUI Global is not responsible for the privacy statements or other content on Web sites outside of the CUI Global and CUI Global family of Web sites.
Use of your Personal Information

                        CUI Global collects and uses your personal information to operate the CUI Global Web site and deliver the services you have requested. CUI Global also uses your personally identifiable information to inform you of other products or services available from CUI Global and its affiliates. CUI Global may also contact you via surveys to conduct research about your opinion of current services or of potential new services that may be offered.

                        CUI Global does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third parties. CUI Global may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you.

Use of Cookies

                        The CUI Global Web site use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server.

                        One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize CUI Global pages, or register with CUI Global site or services, a cookie helps CUI Global to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same CUI Global Web site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the CUI Global features that you customized.

                        You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the CUI Global services or Web sites you visit.

This information is used by CUI Global for the operation of the service, to maintain quality of the service, and to provide general statistics regarding use of the CUI Global Web site. Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose personally identifiable information or personally sensitive data through CUI Global public message boards, this information may be collected and used by others. Note: CUI Global does not read any of your private online communications. CUI Global encourages you to review the privacy statements of Web sites you choose to link to from CUI Global so that you can understand how those Web sites collect, use and share your information. CUI Global is not responsible for the privacy statements or other content on Web sites outside of the CUI Global and CUI Global family of Web sites.
Use of your Personal Information

                        CUI Global collects and uses your personal information to operate the CUI Global Web site and deliver the services you have requested. CUI Global also uses your personally identifiable information to inform you of other products or services available from CUI Global and its affiliates. CUI Global may also contact you via surveys to conduct research about your opinion of current services or of potential new services that may be offered.

                        CUI Global does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third parties. CUI Global may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases, your unique personally identifiable information (e-mail, name, address, telephone number) is not transferred to the third party. In addition, CUI Global may share data with trusted partners to help us perform statistical analysis, send you email or postal mail, provide customer support, or arrange for deliveries.

                        CUI Global Web sites will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on CUI Global or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of CUI Global; and, (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of CUI Global, or the public.
                    
Use of Cookies

This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same CUI Global Web site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the CUI Global features that you customized.

                        You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the CUI Global services or Web sites you visit.

CUI Global also uses your personally identifiable information to inform you of other products or services available from CUI Global and its affiliates. CUI Global may also contact you via surveys to conduct research about your opinion of current services or of potential new services that may be offered.

                        CUI Global does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third parties. CUI Global may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases, your unique personally identifiable information (e-mail, name, address, telephone number) is not transferred to the third party. In addition, CUI Global may share data with trusted partners to help us perform statistical analysis, send you email or postal mail, provide customer support, or arrange for deliveries. All such third parties are prohibited from using your personal information except to provide these services to CUI Global, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information.

                        CUI Global does not use or disclose sensitive personal information, such as race, religion, or political affiliations, without your explicit consent.

                        CUI Global keeps track of the Web sites and pages our customers visit within CUI Global, in order to determine what CUI Global services are the most popular.

                        CUI Global Web sites will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on CUI Global or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of CUI Global; and, (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of CUI Global, or the public.
                    
Use of Cookies

                        The CUI Global Web site use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.

                        One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize CUI Global pages, or register with CUI Global site or services, a cookie helps CUI Global to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same CUI Global Web site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the CUI Global features that you customized.

                        You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the CUI Global services or Web sites you visit.
                    
Security of your Personal Information

                        CUI Global secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. CUI Global secures the personally identifiable information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other Web sites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.
                    
Changes to this Statement

                        CUI Global will occasionally update this Statement of Privacy to reflect company and customer feedback. CUI Global encourages you to periodically review this Statement to be informed of how CUI Global is protecting your information.

History


                            CUI Inc was founded in Beaverton, Oregon in 1989 as a joint venture with a Japanese electronics firm. Over the past three decades, CUI has grown to become a recognized name in electronic components worldwide in the areas of power, interconnect, motion control, and acoustic technologies. In an effort to expand our global footprint, international offices have been added in China, and most recently, in Japan to provide expanded design, manufacturing, and sales support services to our customers.
                        

                            In 2008, CUI Inc was purchased and incorporated as a wholly owned subsidiary of Waytronx, Inc., a platform company dedicated to the acquisition, development, and commercialization of new, innovative technologies. In January of 2011, Waytronx changed its name to CUI Global, Inc. (NASDAQ: CUI), better reflecting the company’s strategic direction into advanced electronics targeting various markets and industries.
                        

                            The merge with a public corporation has offered CUI access to new sources of capital, allowing for a more aggressive move toward acquiring new technologies and building our operational resources. We now look to move into a leadership position within the industry by integrating a growing patent portfolio of innovative technologies into our established and successful electro-mechanical product groups.
                        









Core Values


                            CUI's core values put definition to what we consider to be the heart of our company. They inspire and guide us in our daily interactions with each other, our customers, and our business partners. These values put in action are what make CUI a unique and exciting company, serving as our foundation as we continue to grow.
                        





Excellence
 
                                    We challenge ourselves to continually strive for excellence in everything that we do.
                                







Relationship
 
                                    We work to build long-term relationships based on respect, integrity, and trust.
                                







Service
 
                                    We are committed to serving the global community and inspiring others to do the same.

In the Community





Investing in the community, whether through donations or direct involvement has always been important to CUI; it is at the core of who we are. We recognize our potential to give and are thankful for all the opportunities we have had to share with our global community.













 







CUI Volunteers


                            CUI employees regularly serve the local community with their time and talents both in teams and as individuals. Each January CUI offices shut down on Martin Luther King, Jr. Day and the company spends their time volunteering at local charities. Throughout the year CUI works closely with Hands On Greater Portland to connect employees with volunteer opportunities.
                            
                            “The CUI Volunteer Program was created as a way to put our company’s core values into action. It’s important to CUI to make time to give back and build relationships within our community,” affirmed CUI’s VP of Human Resources, Katie McKenzie.
                            
                            For more information and photos of CUI employees' current volunteer efforts visit our Facebook page

Sales Partner Giving Program


                            In an industry first, CUI has initiated a program designed to give back to the local communities where our manufacturer's rep organizations reside. A percentage of total revenue generated by CUI’s rep network is set aside and donated to each firm on an annual basis as a charitable commission intended to be passed along to the charities of their choosing.

TUALATIN, Ore., Nov. 9, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- CUI Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:   CUI), today reported its unaudited financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.

Energy segment unaudited backlog was $13.4 million at September 30, 2016

Third Quarter 2016 Highlights:

CUI Global Announces Award of $40.0 Million, 5-Year Framework Agreement with National Grid Gas PLC 
CUI Global Announces $1.9 Million Award by UK Network Innovation for Delivery of Gas Quality and Metering Stations within the UK's Gas Distribution Network 
CUI Global Announces Technology Agreement between its Wholly Owned Subsidiary, Orbital Gas Systems, and Daily Thermetrics for North American Sales of its Proprietary VE Technology® 
CUI Global Subsidiary Orbital Gas Systems Joins American Biogas Council 
CUI Global's Wholly-owned Subsidiary, CUI Inc., Expands Agreement as the Exclusive Hardware Design Partner for Virtual Power Systems (VPS) 
CUI Global Announces Award of National Grid Contract for Delivery of Gas Quality Analytical Equipment to Strategically Important Natural Gas Import Terminal

"We continued to make steady progress in driving market adoption of our gas technology solutions in the third quarter while managing our P&EM business to a 5% sequential increase in revenue and stable backlog despite continued weakness in the worldwide electronics market," stated William Clough, president and CEO of CUI Global. "We were awarded a five-year framework agreement from National Grid that assures us a minimum of $40 million in already authorized work over the term of the agreement and cements our relationship with this important customer. Our successful delivery of an initial 400 GasPT units to Snam Rete - on time and on budget - confirms our ability to manage large scale deployments as we pursue other iconic European gas pipeline companies. Underscoring the value proposition of our GasPT solution, Snam Rete is today a key reference customer for us. Finally, our cash balance, which increased to $7.1 million as a result of sequential improvements in net loss and working capital, will continue to provide ample capital to achieve our goals and take us to profitability.
"Our strategy to grow market awareness and drive adoption of our gas technology products is gaining traction," continued Mr. Clough. "We continue to leverage the gas industry's developing interest in our GasPT and VE technology solutions to broaden the opportunities internationally and across our entire gas technology portfolio. In the third quarter, we partnered with Daily Thermetrics in North America, giving our VE thermal well sampling systems solutions entrée into an addressable market of hundreds of thousands of thermal wells deployed throughout the North American pipeline system. In Western Europe, we are expanding our penetration of existing customers, such as Scotia Gas and National Grid, while also creating cross-selling opportunities for gas technology sales as demonstrated by the framework agreement with National Grid. We continue to advance opportunities with national gas transmission companies with a partner network that now encompasses every GasPT opportunity of size in the industry. Cumulatively, our efforts are generating momentum that puts us on a path to greater gas technology sales in 2017. 
"Our optimism for growth in 2017 is founded in the gas industry's growing acceptance of our technology solutions as industry-shifting and aligned with the global transition to natural gas energy from other fossil fuels," concluded Mr. Clough. "From fiscal monitoring for gas transmission companies, to process control for large natural gas-fired turbines and compressors, to thermal well applications and trace element detection like moisture and mercury, the value proposition of our technology portfolio to meet challenges facing the natural gas industry is becoming increasingly evident. Demand for one product creates complimentary demand for others in our portfolio. As we build our Energy business, the partners and customers we secure today will be the foundation for our sustained growth tomorrow."
For the quarter ended September 30, 2016, CUI Global produced consolidated total revenues of $23.3 million and year-to-date total revenues of $67.1 million. Revenues for the three months were lower than the comparable period in 2015 due primarily to lower translated revenue at our U.K. operations. Revenues for the three and nine months are attributable to continued sales and marketing efforts, sales through the distribution channel customers, the addition in March 2015 of the CUI-Canada related product line, the revenues generated since the January 2015 opening of Orbital Gas Systems, North America, Inc., and overall improved sales of gas related metering, monitoring and control systems, including GasPT. 
For the third quarter, the Power and Electromechanical segment contributed revenues of $16.2 million and the Energy segment contributed $7.1 million. Revenue in the Power and Electromechanical segment was down $0.4 million in the three months ended September 30, 2016 due to the timing of customer delivery schedules and sell through activity at distributors. Revenue in the Energy segment was down $1.1 million in the three months ended September 30, 2016 due primarily to the currency translation impact to revenue following the Brexit in June 2016.  For the year-to-date period, the Power and Electromechanical segment increased revenues $1.0 million to $44.6 million and the Energy segment increased revenues $1.7 million to $22.5 million.  
Sales order backlog at September 30, 2016 was a consolidated $31.6 million. Of this, the Power and Electromechanical segment held a backlog of customer orders of approximately $18.2 million and the Energy segment held a backlog of approximately $13.4 million.
For the third quarter, cost of revenues was $14.7 million versus $15.5 million for the same period in 2015. The decrease when compared to the third quarter of 2015 is primarily the result of an improved product mix in the Energy segment. The cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased to 63% from 62% during the prior year comparative period. This percentage will vary based upon the power and electromechanical product mix sold, the mix of natural gas systems sold, contract labor necessary to complete gas related projects, the competitive markets in which the Company competes, and foreign exchange rates. The cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue for the Power and Electromechanical segment for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 was 65% compared to 61% during the prior-year comparative period. The cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue for the Energy segment for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was 60% compared to 65% in the three months ended September 30, 2015. The improved cost percentage in the Energy segment was due to an improved product mix during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015.
For the year-to-date period, cost of revenues was $41.3 million, versus $40.5 million for the comparable period in 2015. The cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue for the year-to-date period ended September 30, 2016 decreased to 62% from 63% during the prior year comparable period. This improvement was due to an improved product mix including an increased volume of higher margin GasPT sales in the Energy segment.  As a result of the improved product mix in the Energy segment, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue dropped 9 percentage points from 65% to 56%.  This improvement helped offset lower margins incurred in the Power and Electromechanical segment as the segment's cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue increased slightly to 64% from 62%.  
For the third quarter, gross profit was $8.6 million, or 37%, versus $9.3 million, or 38%, in the comparable period in 2015, and $25.8 million, or 38% for the year-to-date period versus $23.8 million, or 37%, during the prior year. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Power and Electromechanical segment generated gross profit margins of 35% and 36%, respectively, while the Energy segment generated gross profit margins of 40% and 44%, respectively.
During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, SG&A increased $0.1 million and $1.8 million, respectively, compared to the prior-year comparative periods. The increase for the nine-month period is largely due to $0.8 million in severance costs incurred in the Power and Electromechanical segment for the transition of the R&D team to CUI-Canada and for various positions within the Energy segment during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Increased audit and accounting fees in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 of $0.2 million and $0.8 million, respectively, contributed to the increased SG&A in both the three and nine-month periods. Partially offsetting the increased SG&A for the nine-month period was a $0.6 million decrease in non-severance-related SG&A associated with the activities of Orbital Gas Systems, North America, Inc., which opened in January 2015 and had increased start-up related costs in its first three months of operations. The remaining increases in SG&A during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 were associated with the ongoing activities to reach new customers, promote new product lines including Novum, GasPT, IRIS and VE-Probe, and new product introductions. SG&A increased to 35% of total revenue compared to 32% of total revenue during the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 and for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, the percent of SG&A increased to 39% of total revenue compared to 38% in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015.
For the third quarter, the company reported a net loss of $(507) thousand or $(0.02) per share (EPS) as compared with a net loss of $(59) thousand or $(0.00) per share in the prior year period. For the year-to-date period, the Company reported a net loss of $(4.7) million or $(0.22) per share as compared with a net loss of $(4.6) million or $(0.22) per share in the prior year period. The consolidated net loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, was primarily the result of lower gross profit margins in the Power and Electromechanical segment, selling, general and administrative expenses related to Orbital Gas Systems, North America, Inc. and manufacturing costs at CUI-Canada, Inc., as well as severance costs in both the Power and Electromechanical and Energy segments, increased audit and accounting fees in the other category and the ongoing amortization of intangible assets related to the Orbital Gas Systems Limited and CUI-Canada acquisitions. The overall results in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 showed improved results in the Energy segment, which were partially offset by lower margins in the Power and Electromechanical segment, and higher taxes in our foreign operations. Energy segment operations were improved despite headwinds from lower translated British pound results due to Brexit. These results are compared to the first nine months of 2015, which were negatively affected by the downward pressure on income in 2015 from start-up costs associated with Orbital Gas Systems, North America and CUI-Canada. 
The earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $0.1 million and a loss of $(2.1) million, respectively. EBITDA for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 was $0.6 million and a loss of $(2.3) million, respectively.
As of September 30, 2016, CUI Global held cash and cash equivalents of $7.1 million, a decrease of $(0.2) million since December 31, 2015. Operations, investments, patents and equipment have been funded through cash on hand during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income (loss) are non-GAAP financial measures and are reconciled in the table below. These non-GAAP financial measures do not represent funds available for management's discretionary use and is not intended to represent cash flow from operations. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income (loss) should not be construed as a substitute for net loss or as a better measure of liquidity than cash flow from operating activities, which is determined in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income (loss) exclude components that are significant in understanding and assessing the company's results of operations and cash flows. In addition, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income (loss) are not terms defined by GAAP and as a result our measure of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income (loss) might not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. However, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income (loss) are used by management to evaluate, assess and benchmark the company's operational results and the company believes EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted Net Income (loss) are relevant and useful information which are often reported and widely used by analysts, investors and other interested parties in the Company's industry. Accordingly, the Company is disclosing this information to permit a more comprehensive analysis of its operating performance, to provide an additional measure of performance and liquidity and to provide additional information with respect to the Company's ability to meet future debt service, capital expenditure and working capital requirements. Adjusted Net Income (loss) eliminates the amortization expenses associated with intangible assets acquired with Orbital Gas Systems Limited and CUI-Canada, as well as non-cash expenses associated with stock and stock options for compensation, royalties and services during the period.
