                           Infectious diseases are transmitted through various different mechanisms including person to person interactions, by insect
                              vectors and via vertical transmission from a parent to an unborn offspring. The population dynamics of such disease transmission
                              can be very complicated and the development of rational strategies for controlling and preventing the spread of these diseases
                              requires careful modeling and analysis. The book describes current methods for formulating models and analyzing the dynamics
                              of the propagation of diseases which include vertical transmission as one of the mechanisms for their spread. Generic models
                              that describe broad classes of diseases as well as models that are tailored to the dynamics of a specific infection are formulated
                              and analyzed. The effects of incubation periods, maturation delays, and age-structure, interactions between disease transmission
                              and demographic changes, population crowding, spatial spread, chaotic dynamic behavior, seasonal periodicities and discrete
                              time interval events are studied within the context of specific disease transmission models. No previous background in disease
                              transmission modeling and analysis is assumedand the required biological concepts and mathematical methods are gradually introduced
                              within the context of specific disease transmission models. Graphs are widely used to illustrate and explain the modeling
                              assumptions and results. REMARKS: NOTE: the authors have supplied variants on the promotion text that are more suitable for

                              In this paper, the problem was considered of determining the asymptotic behavior of solutions of linear differentialdifference
                                 equations whose coefficients possess asymptotic series. Although the problem is considerably more complicated than the corresponding
                                 problem for ordinary differential equations, by means of a sequence of transformations the problem was reduced to a form where
                                 the standard techniques of ordinary differential equation theory could be employed. The differential-difference equation was
                                 transformed into an integral equation which was trans formed into an integro-differential equation. At this point the Liouville
                                 transformation plays a vital role. Although the guiding ideas were simple, the analysis became formidable. For this reason,
                                 only some of the more immediate aspects of the problem were considered

                              This paper extends to linear differential-difference equations a number of results familiar in the stability theory of ordinary
                                 linear differential equations. In this theory, one considers a system of equations of the form (1) dx/dt = A(t)x, x(0) = c,
                                 where t is a real variable, x is a column vector with n rows, and A(t) is an n- by -n matrix, and a perturbed system (2) dx/dt
                                 = (A(t) + B(t))x. In general terms, the stability problem is to determine conditions on the matrix B sufficient to ensure
                                 that some property of all solutions of (1)- such as boundedness or order of growth - will also be a property of all solutions

                              The theory of invariant imbedding leads to new types of difference approximations to partial differential equations. To illustrate
                                 the type of analysis required to establish the convergence of the solution of one to the solution of the other, we consider
                                 the difference approximation u(x delta, y) u(x, y u(x, y) delta), and the limiting equation u sub x uu sub y

A basic text in differential-difference and functional-differential equations used by mathematicians and physicists in attacking problems involving the description and prediction of the behavior of physical systems. The subjects covered include the use of the Laplace transform to derive a contour-integral expression permitting a study of asymptotic behavior, the stability by solutions of linear and nonlinear differential-difference equations, and applications of these techniques to problems encountered in contemporary science and engineering.

Item Description: ReInk Books, 2017. Softcover. Book Condition: NEW. Reprinted from 1964 edition. Volume: 691 (1964) - 735 (1967) Language: eng. NO changes have been made to the original text. This is NOT a retyped or an ocr'd reprint. Illustrations, Index, if any, are included in black and white. Each page is checked manually before printing. As this reprint is from very old book, there could be some missing or flawed pages, but we always try to make the book as complete as possible. Fold-outs, if any, are not part of the book. If the original book was published in multiple volumes then this reprint is of only one volume, not the whole set. This paperback book is SEWN, where the book block is actually sewn (smythe sewn/section sewn) with thread before binding which results in a more durable type of paperback binding. It can also be open wide. The pages will not fall out and will be around for a lot longer than normal paperbacks. This print on demand book is printed on high quality acid-free paper. Original Publisher: Mississippi Agricultural Experiment Station. Now called Mississippi Agricultural and Forestry Experiment Station (MAFES) 922 pages Volume: 691 (1964) - 735 (1967).
