NEW YORK, Feb. 1, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Sixpoint Partners, a leading global investment bank serving the middle market, today announced the successful closing of The Huron Fund V L.P. ("Fund" or "Fund V"), with $550 million of total limited partner capital commitments. The Fund, which is the sixth investment vehicle for Huron Capital Partners ("Huron"), closed at its hard cap and in excess of its $500 million target. Receiving commitments from a number of top-tier investors, including endowments, foundations, multi-manager funds, public pensions, corporate pensions and family offices, the Fund closed after just three months of marketing and was oversubscribed with over $1 billion of demand. 








Like its predecessor, The Huron Fund IV L.P., which also closed above its target at $500 million of capital commitments in 2013, Fund V will seek to utilize Huron's operationally-focused, buy-and-build approach to identify and acquire fundamentally-sound companies and build them into leaders. The Fund will seek control transactions in the lower middle market with valuations generally under $200 million and will focus on committing a total of $20 million to $70 million per transaction. The firm is led by its senior partners, Brian Demkowicz, Michael Beauregard, John Higgins and Peter Mogk. 
"We deeply value the tremendous confidence and broad support that our new and existing investors have placed with our experienced investment team and remain focused on delivering strong returns to our LP base," said Brian Demkowicz, Managing Partner at Huron. "We look forward to deploying our buy-and-build strategy in partnership with seasoned executives to improve and grow our businesses through strategic initiatives, operational improvements and add-on acquisitions."
"With over $1 billion of demand for Fund V, we believe Huron's 16-year track record drove robust demand from investors for its disciplined investment process and proven strategy," said Eric Zoller, Partner at Sixpoint Partners. "Huron is an excellent representative of Sixpoint's exceptional relationships in the lower middle market for our LPs." 
Larry Smith, Partner at Sixpoint Partners added, "Given Huron's long track record and focus on attractive opportunities within the lower middle market, we expect Huron's oversubscribed fund to generate strong returns, and we look forward to continuing our partnership."

Huron Capital Doubles Size of Specialty Chemicals Platform Company



Published on 2006-08-08. Author :
SpecialChem













 DETROIT -- Huron Capital Partners
LLC announced that its portfolio company, Quest Specialty Chemicals,
Inc. ("Quest"), has recapitalized Matrix System Automotive Finishes,
Inc. ("Matrix" or the "Company") in partnership with
Matrix' management and combined the business with Quest's wholly-owned
subsidiary, Raabe Company LLC ("Raabe"). Founded in 1983, Matrix
is the largest independent supplier of automotive aftermarket refinish
coatings in the United States and has developed an extensive product line
of acrylic and polyurethane coatings for the high performance requirements
specified in automotive finishes. These include a complete intermix paint
system capable of matching over 60,000 automotive colors, clearcoats,
primers, hardeners and single stage top coats. Based in Walled Lake, Michigan,
the Company supplies paint products to automotive refinish paint distributors
across the entire U.S. for sale to collision repair shops. Mr. W. Kent
Gardner, Founder and President of Matrix, will continue to serve as the
President of the Company and has been appointed to the Board of Directors
of Quest.
 In 2003, Huron formed a strategic market entry initiative
with specialty chemical industry executives Frederick Quinn and Gerry
Loftus and long-time chemical industry investor Carol Bramson. In 2004,
Huron invested a significant amount of equity in Quest to acquire Raabe
as part of a buy-and- build acquisition strategy in the specialty coatings
markets. Since acquiring Raabe, Quest has been exploring acquisition opportunities
in the coatings, adhesives & sealants and films markets, which resulted
in the 2005 acquisition of Foxcolor, Inc. The Foxcolor acquisition provided
an extension of Raabe's market penetration with ready-to-apply custom
match touch-up paints that closely match original equipment coatings and
are used to repair the surfaces of industrial and commercial products
along all points of the supply chain.
Commenting on the Matrix transaction, Michael R. Beauregard, a partner
at Huron, stated, "The Matrix deal comes on the heels of Quest's
purchase of Raabe and Foxcolor and significantly strengthens Quest's initiatives
in niche specialty performance coatings. The collision repair marketplace
served by Matrix is large and highly fragmented, with approximately 50,000
repair facilities in the United States alone. We expect to offer these
end-users unique product solutions and make additional synergistic acquisitions
for Quest, Raabe and Matrix in the future to continue building an integrated
coatings, adhesives and films provider."
Mr. Quinn, Quest CEO, added, "We are thrilled to have Kent Gardner
and his team join us in building the vision for Quest. We believe that
the combination of Raabe and Matrix will enhance both businesses' product
offerings. Quest's combined technologies are now transferable into many
complimentary markets and our products can be cross-promoted to solve
supply chain inefficiencies by consolidating our customers' supply sources."
Mr. Gardner, Matrix President, commented, "I was attracted to the
strategic and operating talent that Fred and Gerry will bring to the Matrix
organization. With Quest and Raabe, we will be able to expand our product
lines to include aerosols and build our market offering. With the financial
strength of Huron Capital and the firm's value-added operations-oriented
approach, we will be able to grow our company organically and through
acquisitions."
Huron Capital and Quest were represented by Honigman, Miller, Schwartz
and Cohn (Detroit). Quest's existing lenders, Marshall & Ilsley M&I
Bank (Milwaukee) and BMO Mezzanine Fund (Chicago), provided financing
for the Matrix transaction. Huron separately announced that Raabe completed
a sale and leaseback transaction in June involving Raabe's plant in Menomonee
Falls, Wisconsin, with Gladstone Commercial Limited Partnership.

partner with strong management teams at niche manufacturing, specialty
service, and value- added distribution companies that can be built through
acquisition and organic growth.
Huron Capital manages over $250 million through two private equity funds,
The Huron Fund, L.P. ($72 million, 2000) and The Huron Fund II, L.P. ($185
million, 2005). Since its founding in 1999, Huron has acquired or invested
in 23 companies and has generated a realized IRR exceeding 65% for its
Limited Partners. In 2006, Huron sold York Label in a transaction that
generated 5.0 times its original investment and an 83% IRR and sold Delta
Educational Systems in a transaction that generated 11.7 times its original
investment and an 85% IRR. Huron has committed over 45% of its latest
fund and is aggressively seeking new investment opportunities.
About Quest Specialty Chemicals
Quest is led by Messrs. Quinn and Loftus, veterans in the specialty chemical
industry who have successfully built, acquired and divested businesses
in the specialty chemical industry. The mission of Quest is to acquire
and build specialty chemical companies who are engaged in the formulation
of coatings, adhesive and sealant products which are designed to provide
surface protection to or the bonding of, flexible and rigid substrates.
Quest seeks enterprises whose core competencies and drive are based on

market niche strategy focus.

        Published on 2004-12-01. Author : 
        
        SpecialChem

        













 DETROIT -- Huron Capital Partners LLC, a Michigan- based 
        private equity firm, announced that it has made the first investment for 
        The Huron Fund II, L.P. ("Fund II") by capitalizing Quest Specialty 
        Chemicals ("Quest") in order to facilitate the acquisition of 
        Raabe Corporation ("Raabe"). The investment in Quest was made 
        just four weeks after Huron Capital closed on over $90 million in commitments 
        to Fund II, a fund which Huron is presently raising with a targeted size 
        of at least $150 million. M&I Marshall & Ilsley Bank provided 
        senior debt financing and Harris Nesbitt Capital, Inc. provided subordinated 
        debt financing in the transaction. 
Consistent with Huron's strategy of partnering with entrepreneurial 
        and proven industry executives, Huron teamed-up with Frederick A. Quinn 
        and Gerard A. Loftus to build Quest as a platform company in the specialty 
        chemicals industry. In executing the initiative over the past year, Huron 
        and Quest developed a market entry plan to search for and acquire companies 
        that have developed unique solutions to the challenges of surface protection 
        and the bonding of flexible and rigid substrates. These products include 
        coatings, adhesives, polymers and thermoplastic films designed for a wide 
        range of industrial markets. 
The acquisition of Raabe fits squarely in Quest's strategy 
        to acquire a business with a strong position in a niche coatings market 
        where Quest could drive organic and acquired growth. Raabe is a leading 
        manufacturer of custom matched branded touch-up paint and a provider of 
        private label aerosol and liquid paint filling services. Raabe's touch-up 
        products consist of ready-to- apply paints that closely match original 
        equipment coatings and are used to repair the surfaces of industrial & 
        commercial products along all points of the supply chain. Raabe is based 
        in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin. 
Michael R. Beauregard, a Partner at Huron, stated, "We 
        worked with Fred to drive strong deal flow this year in a targeted search 
        effort to find platform chemical businesses. The Quest initiative allowed 
        us to partner with a strong management team first and then be focused 
        on creating investment opportunities in specifically identified companies. 
        In Raabe, we saw a solid core aerosol business serving a niche market 
        with state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities." 
Frederick A. Quinn, Quest's Chairman & CEO added, 
        "Raabe's strong market share and talented management team are critical 
        assets on which Huron and Quest plan to execute a specialty coatings growth 
        strategy. We expect to make complementary acquisitions in Raabe's core 
        business lines and to extend their capabilities into new applications. 
        We are also pleased that Mr. David Wacker will continue as President of 
        Raabe." 
Huron and Quest also announced today that Gerard A. Loftus 
        has been appointed COO & CFO of Quest. Mr. Quinn stated, "Gerry 
        will focus on the operational and financial aspects of our business. He 
        brings a strong financial background and extensive operational experience 
        in running specialty chemical businesses." Huron also stated that 
        it elected Carol E. Bramson to Quest's Board of Directors. Ms. Bramson's 
        professional experience includes leading Banc One Equity Capital's successful 
        investment in Sovereign Specialty Chemicals.

              COMPLETES ACQUISITION OF SPECIALTY AND FINE PAPERS BUSINESSES FROM 
              CROWN VANTAGE



New 
              York, NY (March 2, 2001) --  
              KPS Special Situations Fund, L.P. ("KPS") announced 
              the purchase of certain assets of Crown Vantage Inc. and the
              formation of Curtis Papers, Inc. Curtis Papers was formed to own 
              and
              operate the specialty paper and premium papers businesses of Crown 
              Vantage.
              KPS invested $10 million of equity to fund the transaction. 
The specialty papers business of Curtis Papers 
              will be conducted under the
              name of Curtis Specialty Papers and will include the paper mills 
              in Port
              Huron, Michigan and Milford, New Jersey. Curtis Specialty Papers 
              is a
              leading manufacturer of premium uncoated and coated papers for a 
              wide range
              of end use markets including food service, flexible packaging, label 
              and
              release and custom converting. Products are marketed under such 
              well-known
              names as Staynles ® and Conquest ®. 
The premium papers business will operate under 
              the name of Curtis Fine
              Papers and will conduct operations out of a paper mill in Adams,
              Massachusetts and a coating and converting facility in Richmond, 
              Virginia.
              Curtis Fine Papers is one of the oldest and best know manufacturers 
              of text
              and cover and premium printing grades and markets its products under 
              trade
              names such as Curtis Brightwater®, Linen®, Flannel® 
              and King James®. Curtis
              Fine Papers is also a leading producer of custom technical specialties 
              for a
              wide range of demanding end uses. Crown Vantage will continue to 
              run the
              text and cover mill in Ypsilanti, Michigan under an operating agreement 
              with
              Curtis Papers for up to six months while the grades produced in 
              Ypsilanti
              are transitioned to the Adams Mill. 
In addition to the four domestic facilities, the 
              new company will also own
              the stock of Curtis Papers, Ltd., which consists of two premium 
              paper mills
              in Scotland. The Scottish mills market premium papers under the 
              name of
              Curtis Classic in the U.K. and throughout Europe.
Curtis Papers will have capacity to produce 200,000 annual tons 
              of paper
              products and will generate revenues in excess of $250 million. The 
              new
              company will employ over 850 domestically and in the U.K. 

              "The new Curtis Papers has a very loyal customer base, a broad 
              family of
              high quality and unique products, and a talented group of employees. 
              We
              look forward to building on this foundation and creating a vibrant 
              and
              successful specialty paper company through a combination of cost 
              reduction,
              focused capital investment and new product introductions", 
              said David
              Shapiro, a managing principal of KPS. Curtis Papers, Inc. will be 
              led by an
              experienced management team, including two new additions: President 
              and
              Chief Executive Officer, Bruce Curley, formerly with the Mead Corporation
              and Chief Financial Officer, Keith McKinnish, formerly with Champion
              International. Charles Whitaker, is joining the new company from 
              Crown
              Vantage as President of Curtis Fine Papers. Allan Milne will retain 
              his
              current position as Managing Director of Curtis Fine Paper, Ltd.
This transaction is KPS's third investment in the 
              forest products industry:
              KPS created Blue Ridge Paper Products, Inc. in May of 1999 and Blue 
              Heron
              Paper Company in May of 2000. KPS was introduced to the Crown Vantage
              opportunity by representatives of the Paper, Allied-Industrial, 
              Chemical and
              Energy Workers International Union ("PACE").

              Special Situations Fund, L.P., founded and managed by Eugene Keilin, 
              David Shapiro and Michael Psaros, is a New York City-based private 
              equity fund focused on constructive investing in restructurings, 
              turnarounds and other special situations. More information on KPS

PRESS RELEASE
Huron Capital Partners Closes $550 Million Private Equity Fund At Hard Cap
Sixpoint Partners served as exclusive global placement agent
New York, February 1, 2017 – Sixpoint Partners, a leading global investment bank serving the middle market, today announced the successful closing of The Huron Fund V L.P. (“Fund” or “Fund V”), with $550 million of total limited partner capital commitments. The Fund, which is the sixth investment vehicle for Huron Capital Partners (“Huron”), closed at its hard cap and in excess of its $500 million target. Receiving commitments from a number of top-tier investors, including endowments, foundations, multi-manager funds, public pensions, corporate pensions and family offices, the Fund closed after just three months of marketing and was oversubscribed with over $1 billion of demand.
Like its predecessor, The Huron Fund IV L.P., which also closed above its target at $500 million of capital commitments in 2013, Fund V will seek to utilize Huron’s operationally-focused, buy-and-build approach to identify and acquire fundamentally-sound companies and build them into leaders. The Fund will seek control transactions in the lower middle market with valuations generally under $200 million and will focus on committing a total of $20 million to $70 million per transaction. The firm is led by its senior partners, Brian Demkowicz, Michael Beauregard, John Higgins and PeterMogk. 





“We deeply value the tremendous confidence and broad support that our new and existing investors have placed with our experienced investment team and remain focused on delivering strong returns to our LP base,” said Brian Demkowicz, Managing Partner at Huron. “We look forward to deploying our buy-and-build strategy in partnership with seasoned executives to improve and grow our businesses through strategic initiatives, operational improvements and add-on acquisitions.”
“With over $1 billion of demand for Fund V, we believe Huron’s 16-year track record drove robust demand from investors for its disciplined investment process and proven strategy,” said Eric Zoller, Partner at Sixpoint Partners. “Huron is an excellent representative of Sixpoint’sexceptional relationships in the lower middle market for our LPs.”
Larry Smith, Partner at Sixpoint Partners added, “Given Huron’s long track record and focus on attractive opportunities within the lower middle market, we expect Huron’s oversubscribed fund to generate strong returns, and we look forward to continuing our partnership.”

Huron Capital Partners  » Investment Approach » Flex Equity 



Flex Equity


Sometimes a business owner needs an equity partner to help accomplish growth or liquidity goals. A minority equity investment from us may make sense, allowing an owner to retain a controlling ownership position yet providing capital for a number of situations, such as:

Strategic add-on acquisition
Capital for organic growth initiatives
Buyout of inactive shareholders or family members
Partial liquidity for the primary owner
Balance sheet enhancement

Huron offers flexible equity solutions for a variety of situations. Since our founding in 1999 we’ve sought to make strategic equity investments in the lower middle market and help business owners build their companies.
Through our Flex Equity program, a business owner can pursue any of the objectives listed above, while continuing to maintain a majority ownership position. At the same time, the owner would have the benefit of working with a strategic investment partner with a long history of making investments in the lower middle market, along with a dedicated Strategy and Operations Group. We think that could be a winning combination.
To learn more about Flex Equity, look here:

Huron Flex Equity Program

You can also reach out directly to Doug Sutton or Charlie Sheridan, who oversee Huron Capital’s Flex Equity program.
