    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

History[edit]
The company was founded in 1947 in New York by Rupert H. Johnson, Sr., who ran a successful retail brokerage firm from an office on Wall Street.[citation needed] He named the company for American polymath Benjamin Franklin because Franklin espoused frugality and prudence when it came to saving and investing.[5] The company's first line of mutual funds, Franklin Custodian Funds, was a series of conservatively managed equity and bond funds designed to appeal to most investors.
After Rupert Sr. retired, his son, Charles B. Johnson (Charlie), took over as president and chief executive officer in 1957 at age 24. There were only a handful of employees at that time and the funds had total assets under management of US$2.5 million.
By the early 1960s the company was growing, albeit slowly. It was a struggle to keep up with the day-to-day demands of the business and Charlie continued to wear many hats—mutual fund manager, wholesaler, accountant. Rupert Johnson, Jr., Charlie's brother, joined the company in 1965 and also took on multiple roles.
Franklin went public in 1971, which gave Charlie and team the capital needed to grow the business and position it for the future. In 1973, the company acquired Winfield & Company, a San Mateo, California-based investment firm, and moved Franklin's offices from New York to California. The combined organization had close to US$250 million in assets under management and approximately 60 employees. In 1979, Franklin Money Fund began a growth surge that made it Franklin's first billion-dollar fund and launched the company's significant asset growth in the 1980s.
Starting in 1980, the company's total assets under management doubled (or nearly doubled) every year for the next six years. The company's stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange in 1986. In the same year, the company opened its first office outside North America in Taiwan. In 1988, Franklin acquired L.F. Rothschild Fund Management Company. Assets under management for Franklin grew from just over US$2 billion in 1982 to more than US$40 billion in 1989 (the crash of 1987 had little impact on Franklin's income and bond funds).
In October 1992, Franklin acquired Templeton, Galbraith & Hansberger Ltd. for a reported cost of $913 million, leading to the common name Franklin Templeton. Mutual fund pioneer Sir John Templeton was the owner of Templeton, Galbraith & Hansberger Ltd together with his son Dr. John Templeton and John Galbraith who together owned 70% of the firm.[6]
In November 1996, Heine Securities Corporation, known for the Mutual Series of funds, merged into the Franklin Templeton complex. In October 2000, Franklin acquired Bissett Funds to increase its Canadian presence, and Bissett remains a key brand from Franklin in the Canadian market. The Fiduciary Trust Company was acquired by Franklin Templeton in April 2001.
Fiduciary Trust Company, a member of the Franklin family, maintained an office of over 650 employees in Two World Trade Center during the September 11 attacks in 2001.[7] 87 employees died in the collapse.[8][9] Ann Tatlock, the CEO of Fiduciary Trust Co. International was at Offutt Air Force Base in Omaha for a charity event hosted by Warren Buffett.[10][11][12]
The firm specializes in conservatively managed mutual funds. It offers products under the Franklin, Templeton, Mutual Series and Fiduciary brand names. Like other large investment companies, the firm offers a wide variety of funds but is traditionally best known for bond funds under the Franklin brand, international funds under the Templeton brand, and value funds under the Mutual Series brand.
As of July 31, 2008, Franklin Resources, Inc. managed over $570 billion in total assets worldwide.[13] In April 2007, Franklin Resources was 445th in the Fortune 500, and 7th overall among securities companies.[14]
In April 2007, USA Today listed BEN stock as the top stock pick for the last 25 years based on returns, claiming it is up 64,224% since 1982.[15] In February 2009, Barron's Magazine called Franklin Templeton "King of the Decade" among fund families over the ten-year period ending in 2008.[16]
The company sponsored a tennis tournament, the Franklin Templeton Classic.
The firm continues to make strategic investments and acquisitions, including asset managers in Australia and the UK, that further broaden and diversify its capabilities. Today, Franklin Templeton is one of the largest independent global asset management firms in the world with offices in 35 countries and clients in more than 150. In 2013, Charlie Johnson retired as chairman and Greg Johnson became chairman of the board, CEO and president.
Mutual funds[edit]
Franklin Templeton has over 200 different open-ended mutual funds and 7 closed-end funds in the fund family. Included in these are 36 state and federal tax free income funds, an area of investment pioneered by Franklin.
Prominent funds in the fund family include the Templeton Growth Fund, Inc. (opened 1954, $29.5bn assets[when?]), the Mutual Shares fund (opened 1949, $7.9bn assets), and the Mutual Discovery Fund (opened 1992, $7.6bn assets) and the Templeton Growth (Euro) Fund A (acc) ($6.1bn assets).
The Franklin Income Fund (FKINX, assets $33.6bn) is a mutual fund in Morningstar's "conservative allocation" category and "large/value" style box. The fund was created in 1948 and has paid uninterrupted dividends for 60 years. The Franklin Income Fund is constructed primarily of dividend-paying stocks and bonds (2%).
Regulatory issues[edit]
In 2004, Franklin Templeton paid fines to the State of California, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to settle issues regarding questionable practices including market timing. The plan for distribution of settlement monies of $50 million[17] was completed in September 2006, and all distributions have been completed as of December 2008.[18]
A settlement was also completed with the Ontario Securities Commission concerning Bissett Funds in September 2005.[18]

History[edit]
The company was founded in 1947 in New York by Rupert H. Johnson, Sr., who ran a successful retail brokerage firm from an office on Wall Street.[citation needed] He named the company for American polymath Benjamin Franklin because Franklin espoused frugality and prudence when it came to saving and investing.[5] The company's first line of mutual funds, Franklin Custodian Funds, was a series of conservatively managed equity and bond funds designed to appeal to most investors.
After Rupert Sr. retired, his son, Charles B. Johnson (Charlie), took over as president and chief executive officer in 1957 at age 24. There were only a handful of employees at that time and the funds had total assets under management of US$2.5 million.
By the early 1960s the company was growing, albeit slowly. It was a struggle to keep up with the day-to-day demands of the business and Charlie continued to wear many hats—mutual fund manager, wholesaler, accountant. Rupert Johnson, Jr., Charlie's brother, joined the company in 1965 and also took on multiple roles.
Franklin went public in 1971, which gave Charlie and team the capital needed to grow the business and position it for the future. In 1973, the company acquired Winfield & Company, a San Mateo, California-based investment firm, and moved Franklin's offices from New York to California. The combined organization had close to US$250 million in assets under management and approximately 60 employees. In 1979, Franklin Money Fund began a growth surge that made it Franklin's first billion-dollar fund and launched the company's significant asset growth in the 1980s.
Starting in 1980, the company's total assets under management doubled (or nearly doubled) every year for the next six years. The company's stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange in 1986. In the same year, the company opened its first office outside North America in Taiwan. In 1988, Franklin acquired L.F. Rothschild Fund Management Company. Assets under management for Franklin grew from just over US$2 billion in 1982 to more than US$40 billion in 1989 (the crash of 1987 had little impact on Franklin's income and bond funds).
In October 1992, Franklin acquired Templeton, Galbraith & Hansberger Ltd. for a reported cost of $913 million, leading to the common name Franklin Templeton. Mutual fund pioneer Sir John Templeton was the owner of Templeton, Galbraith & Hansberger Ltd together with his son Dr. John Templeton and John Galbraith who together owned 70% of the firm.[6]
In November 1996, Heine Securities Corporation, known for the Mutual Series of funds, merged into the Franklin Templeton complex. In October 2000, Franklin acquired Bissett Funds to increase its Canadian presence, and Bissett remains a key brand from Franklin in the Canadian market. The Fiduciary Trust Company was acquired by Franklin Templeton in April 2001.
Fiduciary Trust Company, a member of the Franklin family, maintained an office of over 650 employees in Two World Trade Center during the September 11 attacks in 2001.[7] 87 employees died in the collapse.[8][9] Ann Tatlock, the CEO of Fiduciary Trust Co. International was at Offutt Air Force Base in Omaha for a charity event hosted by Warren Buffett.[10][11][12]
The firm specializes in conservatively managed mutual funds. It offers products under the Franklin, Templeton, Mutual Series and Fiduciary brand names. Like other large investment companies, the firm offers a wide variety of funds but is traditionally best known for bond funds under the Franklin brand, international funds under the Templeton brand, and value funds under the Mutual Series brand.
As of July 31, 2008, Franklin Resources, Inc. managed over $570 billion in total assets worldwide.[13] In April 2007, Franklin Resources was 445th in the Fortune 500, and 7th overall among securities companies.[14]
In April 2007, USA Today listed BEN stock as the top stock pick for the last 25 years based on returns, claiming it is up 64,224% since 1982.[15] In February 2009, Barron's Magazine called Franklin Templeton "King of the Decade" among fund families over the ten-year period ending in 2008.[16]
The company sponsored a tennis tournament, the Franklin Templeton Classic.
The firm continues to make strategic investments and acquisitions, including asset managers in Australia and the UK, that further broaden and diversify its capabilities. Today, Franklin Templeton is one of the largest independent global asset management firms in the world with offices in 35 countries and clients in more than 150. In 2013, Charlie Johnson retired as chairman and Greg Johnson became chairman of the board, CEO and president.
Mutual funds[edit]
Franklin Templeton has over 200 different open-ended mutual funds and 7 closed-end funds in the fund family. Included in these are 36 state and federal tax free income funds, an area of investment pioneered by Franklin.
Prominent funds in the fund family include the Templeton Growth Fund, Inc. (opened 1954, $29.5bn assets[when?]), the Mutual Shares fund (opened 1949, $7.9bn assets), and the Mutual Discovery Fund (opened 1992, $7.6bn assets) and the Templeton Growth (Euro) Fund A (acc) ($6.1bn assets).
The Franklin Income Fund (FKINX, assets $33.6bn) is a mutual fund in Morningstar's "conservative allocation" category and "large/value" style box. The fund was created in 1948 and has paid uninterrupted dividends for 60 years. The Franklin Income Fund is constructed primarily of dividend-paying stocks and bonds (2%).
Regulatory issues[edit]
In 2004, Franklin Templeton paid fines to the State of California, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to settle issues regarding questionable practices including market timing. The plan for distribution of settlement monies of $50 million[17] was completed in September 2006, and all distributions have been completed as of December 2008.[18]
A settlement was also completed with the Ontario Securities Commission concerning Bissett Funds in September 2005.[18]

History[edit]
The company was founded in 1947 in New York by Rupert H. Johnson, Sr., who ran a successful retail brokerage firm from an office on Wall Street.[citation needed] He named the company for American polymath Benjamin Franklin because Franklin espoused frugality and prudence when it came to saving and investing.[5] The company's first line of mutual funds, Franklin Custodian Funds, was a series of conservatively managed equity and bond funds designed to appeal to most investors.
After Rupert Sr. retired, his son, Charles B. Johnson (Charlie), took over as president and chief executive officer in 1957 at age 24. There were only a handful of employees at that time and the funds had total assets under management of US$2.5 million.
By the early 1960s the company was growing, albeit slowly. It was a struggle to keep up with the day-to-day demands of the business and Charlie continued to wear many hats—mutual fund manager, wholesaler, accountant. Rupert Johnson, Jr., Charlie's brother, joined the company in 1965 and also took on multiple roles.
Franklin went public in 1971, which gave Charlie and team the capital needed to grow the business and position it for the future. In 1973, the company acquired Winfield & Company, a San Mateo, California-based investment firm, and moved Franklin's offices from New York to California. The combined organization had close to US$250 million in assets under management and approximately 60 employees. In 1979, Franklin Money Fund began a growth surge that made it Franklin's first billion-dollar fund and launched the company's significant asset growth in the 1980s.
Starting in 1980, the company's total assets under management doubled (or nearly doubled) every year for the next six years. The company's stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange in 1986. In the same year, the company opened its first office outside North America in Taiwan. In 1988, Franklin acquired L.F. Rothschild Fund Management Company. Assets under management for Franklin grew from just over US$2 billion in 1982 to more than US$40 billion in 1989 (the crash of 1987 had little impact on Franklin's income and bond funds).
In October 1992, Franklin acquired Templeton, Galbraith & Hansberger Ltd. for a reported cost of $913 million, leading to the common name Franklin Templeton. Mutual fund pioneer Sir John Templeton was the owner of Templeton, Galbraith & Hansberger Ltd together with his son Dr. John Templeton and John Galbraith who together owned 70% of the firm.[6]
In November 1996, Heine Securities Corporation, known for the Mutual Series of funds, merged into the Franklin Templeton complex. In October 2000, Franklin acquired Bissett Funds to increase its Canadian presence, and Bissett remains a key brand from Franklin in the Canadian market. The Fiduciary Trust Company was acquired by Franklin Templeton in April 2001.
Fiduciary Trust Company, a member of the Franklin family, maintained an office of over 650 employees in Two World Trade Center during the September 11 attacks in 2001.[7] 87 employees died in the collapse.[8][9] Ann Tatlock, the CEO of Fiduciary Trust Co. International was at Offutt Air Force Base in Omaha for a charity event hosted by Warren Buffett.[10][11][12]
The firm specializes in conservatively managed mutual funds. It offers products under the Franklin, Templeton, Mutual Series and Fiduciary brand names. Like other large investment companies, the firm offers a wide variety of funds but is traditionally best known for bond funds under the Franklin brand, international funds under the Templeton brand, and value funds under the Mutual Series brand.
As of July 31, 2008, Franklin Resources, Inc. managed over $570 billion in total assets worldwide.[13] In April 2007, Franklin Resources was 445th in the Fortune 500, and 7th overall among securities companies.[14]
In April 2007, USA Today listed BEN stock as the top stock pick for the last 25 years based on returns, claiming it is up 64,224% since 1982.[15] In February 2009, Barron's Magazine called Franklin Templeton "King of the Decade" among fund families over the ten-year period ending in 2008.[16]
The company sponsored a tennis tournament, the Franklin Templeton Classic.
The firm continues to make strategic investments and acquisitions, including asset managers in Australia and the UK, that further broaden and diversify its capabilities. Today, Franklin Templeton is one of the largest independent global asset management firms in the world with offices in 35 countries and clients in more than 150. In 2013, Charlie Johnson retired as chairman and Greg Johnson became chairman of the board, CEO and president.
Mutual funds[edit]
Franklin Templeton has over 200 different open-ended mutual funds and 7 closed-end funds in the fund family. Included in these are 36 state and federal tax free income funds, an area of investment pioneered by Franklin.
Prominent funds in the fund family include the Templeton Growth Fund, Inc. (opened 1954, $29.5bn assets[when?]), the Mutual Shares fund (opened 1949, $7.9bn assets), and the Mutual Discovery Fund (opened 1992, $7.6bn assets) and the Templeton Growth (Euro) Fund A (acc) ($6.1bn assets).
The Franklin Income Fund (FKINX, assets $33.6bn) is a mutual fund in Morningstar's "conservative allocation" category and "large/value" style box. The fund was created in 1948 and has paid uninterrupted dividends for 60 years. The Franklin Income Fund is constructed primarily of dividend-paying stocks and bonds (2%).
Regulatory issues[edit]
In 2004, Franklin Templeton paid fines to the State of California, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to settle issues regarding questionable practices including market timing. The plan for distribution of settlement monies of $50 million[17] was completed in September 2006, and all distributions have been completed as of December 2008.[18]
A settlement was also completed with the Ontario Securities Commission concerning Bissett Funds in September 2005.[18]

            Strategy, Benefits, Results
        



            Strategy
        Our strategy is built upon the following Templeton cornerstones, which have been in place for more than 70 years.

Search Globally. We believe bargains have no borders when searching for the best investment opportunities.
Seek Value. We search worldwide for stocks selling at prices we believe are low relative to their true value.
Perform Fundamental, Bottom-Up Research. We conduct in-person visits and perform extensive fundamental research to model a company's potential future earnings, cash flow and asset value relative to its stock price.
Practice Patient, Long-Term Investing. We evaluate a company's potential for earnings and growth over a five-year horizon.



            Benefits
        
Broad Diversification. Our investments span across many countries, industries and companies.
Unsurpassed Global Resources. Our global reach includes offices in Edinburgh, Nassau and Singapore, as well as Shanghai, Mumbai, Warsaw and Dubai.
A Clear Philosophy, Consistently Applied. Disciplines and traditions founded by Sir John Templeton in 1940 continue today.

Hypothetical $10K Investment



















            Investing In The Fund
        

What Are the Risks?

All investments involve risks, including possible loss of principal.
Special risks are associated with foreign investing, including currency fluctuations, economic instability and political developments.
Investments in emerging markets involve heightened risks related to the same factors. In addition, smaller-company stocks have historically experienced more price volatility than larger-company stocks, especially over the short term.
Derivatives, including currency management strategies, involve costs and can create economic leverage in the portfolio which may result in significant volatility and cause the fund to participate in losses (as well as enable gains) on an amount that exceeds the fund’s initial investment.
The fund may not achieve the anticipated benefits, and may realize losses when a counterparty fails to perform as promised.
The fund’s risk considerations are discussed in the prospectus.

Performance data represents past performance, which does not guarantee future results. Current performance may differ from figures shown. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate with market conditions, and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.

Footnotes

A statistical measurement of the range of a fund's total returns. In general, a higher standard deviation means greater volatility. Based on the fund's monthly returns over the 3-year period ended as of the date of the calculation.
A statistical measurement of a fund's historical risk-adjusted performance. It is calculated by taking a fund's excess return over that of the three-month Treasury bill divided by its standard deviation. Higher values generally indicate better historical risk-adjusted performance. Based on the 3 years ended as of the date of the calculation.
The annualized percentage difference between a fund's actual returns and its expected performance given its level of market risk, as measured by beta.  Based on the 3-year period ended as of the date of the calculation.
Public Offering Price — Purchase price for each share of the fund on a given day. It includes the maximum initial sales charge, if any.
Net Asset Value — The amount per share you would receive if you sold shares that day.

The vertical axis shows the market capitalization of the stocks owned and the horizontal axis shows investment style (value, blend, or growth). Placement is determined by fund portfolio holding figures most recently entered into Morningstar's database and corresponding market conditions. Shaded areas show the past 3 years of quarterly data. Past performance does not guarantee future results.
Source: Morningstar®. For each mutual fund and exchange traded fund with at least a 3-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating™ based on how a fund ranks on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure against other funds in the same category. This measure takes into account variations in a fund's monthly performance, and does not take into account the effects of sales charges, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The weights are: 100% 3-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% 5-year rating/40% 3-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% 5-year rating/20% 3-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent 3-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. Morningstar Rating™ is for the named share class only; other classes may have different performance characteristics. Past performance is not an indicator or a guarantee of future performance.

A measure of the fund's volatility relative to the market, as represented by the MSCI All Country World Index. A beta greater than 1.00 indicates volatility greater than the market. Based on the 3-year period ended as of the date of the calculation.
Percentage of the fund's returns explained by movements in the MSCI All Country World Index. 100 equals perfect correlation to the index. Based on the 3-year period ended as of the date of the calculation.
The Gross Expense Ratio does not include an expense reduction contractually guaranteed through 4/30/18. Fund investment results reflect the fee reduction; without this reduction, the results would have been lower. Please see the prospectus for additional information.
Indices are unmanaged and one cannot invest directly in them. Index returns do not reflect any fees, expenses or sales charges.
For performance reporting purposes, the inception date for Classes A, R, R6, Z, and Advisor Class shares of all Franklin Templeton Funds is the date of effectiveness of the fund's registration statement or the first day the fund commenced operations. For Class C shares, generally the inception date is the first day the fund commenced offering such shares. Exceptions: Templeton Global Balanced Fund Classes A and C use the inception date of the old Class A and C shares, renamed Class A1 and Class C1. For Franklin Mutual Series Funds, Franklin International Small Cap Growth Fund and Franklin Pelagos Commodities Strategy Fund, the inception date for Classes A, C, R and R6 shares is the funds' oldest class', Z or Advisor, inception date. Franklin U.S. Government Money Fund Class R6 inception date is the first day it commenced offering such shares. For Franklin California Ultra-Short Tax-Free Income Fund Classes A1 and Advisor Class use the inception date of its predecessor, Franklin California Tax-Exempt Money Fund.

Franklin Templeton’s Hardenberg: One emerging markets sector you should keep an eye on
Carlos Hardenberg, manager of the Templeton Global Emerging Markets fund, explains why the tech sector is likely to play an important role in emerging markets growth in the coming years.

Emerging markets are beginning to take the lead from developed markets in a range of technology sectors, according to Carlos Hardenberg of Franklin Templeton Investments.
Hardenberg, the manager of the £29.7m Templeton Global Emerging Markets fund alongside Chetan Sehgal, said innovation in the sector and early adoption have driven growth of technology stocks in Asia, Latin America and Russia.
Indeed, technology stocks have been part of the reason for the strong performance of MSCI Emerging Markets index, according to consultancy Capital Economics, which notes that the sector forms a significant part of the index.
Hardenberg said: “The IT sector in general, be it software producers, developers, hardware component producers, all the way to the software producers, in emerging markets have really changed the landscape in emerging markets dramatically.
“So if you look at Korea, Taiwan, China but also Latin America, Russia and some of the smaller African countries, that’s where the music plays, that’s where the innovation takes place and the businesses are moving into. That’s where the future opportunities lie.”

Hardenberg said a number of traditional industries are also embracing technology much more rapidly than developed markets have.
He explained: “So it’s global, it’s moving fast and we are seeing consumer habits in emerging market are kind of more flexible than in the old world.
“If you look at China, China never built up the same capacity in terms of malls and all that that we have in the US.
“They went very quickly into e-commerce so a lot of the transactions in the grocery area or any other aspect of the day-to-day purchasing activity of consumers is in the internet. As a matter of fact, 20 per cent of global internet consumption is in China.”
However, as well as being great adopters of technology – both from a consumer and a business perspective – emerging markets are beginning to challenge the supremacy of developed countries.

The manager said that a lot of the technology innovation previously dominated by Germany, US and the UK was now shifting towards emerging markets: “If you look at the innovation in technology in wind turbines, innovation in technology in alternative energy providers is developed in emerging markets.”
He added: “Probably one of the biggest and most transformational industrial developments that we will witness is the move from the combustion engine and cars driven by people to battery-powered vehicles that are no longer being driven by people but by robots.
“All the solutions from battery cooling to batteries themselves to lightweight structural components with software to network integration is coming from emerging markets. It’s not coming from Stuttgart or Detroit but emerging markets.
“This is where we are positioning the portfolios so that we can benefit from this very big global trend.”
Hardenberg added: “The new iPhones will be based on surface technology which is based on organic LEDs and it is entirely occupied by Samsung which has 95 per cent of that surface technology.
“It will take quite a long time for others to come in and they will be able to protect their margin for quite a long time and they will be able to enjoy their leadership in that technology and supply not just to Apple but to everyone.”
Another part of the technology sector where Hardenberg sees increased competition from emerging markets firm is the semi-conductor market, which has been dominated by developed market providers.
Hardenberg said though it is a part of the industry that is well understood, the demand for memory could soar as internet of things and driverless cars become more prevalent.
“If you look at the market today and compare it to five to six years ago it used to be a market that was very fragmented which was very US-centric,” the manager said.

“Now the US market is dominated by emerging market companies like Samsung and on the processing side it is really Taiwan Semiconductor which is based out of Taiwan.
“So these are incredible opportunities in emerging markets and it is important to acknowledge the fact that we’ve come a long way from cement and traditional telco businesses to what we are looking at right now.”
 
The IT sector represents 27.06 per cent of the fund – the largest sector exposure – compared with a 26.63 per cent weighting in the MSCI Emerging Markets benchmark.
The fund’s top holdings include several high conviction technology stocks. Samsung Electronics is the fund’s second largest holding representing 6.86 per cent of the portfolio.
Elsewhere, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and South Korean firm SK Hynix represent 5.1 per cent and 1.76 per cent of the fund respectively. Also in the top 10 stocks is Chinese firm Alibaba, which has a 4.16 per cent weighting in the portfolio.
Hardenberg and Sehgal took over as managers of the fund earlier this year, following the announcement that veteran emerging markets investor Mark Mobius would be stepping back from day-to-day management duties.

Over three years the fund has underperformed the sector and index, delivering a return of just 26.85 per cent, compared with a 37.4 per cent rise in the benchmark and a 35.84 per cent rise for the average IA Global Emerging Markets peer.
The fund an ongoing charges figure (OCF) of 1.2 per cent.

He added: “Probably one of the biggest and most transformational industrial developments that we will witness is the move from the combustion engine and cars driven by people to battery-powered vehicles that are no longer being driven by people but by robots.
“All the solutions from battery cooling to batteries themselves to lightweight structural components with software to network integration is coming from emerging markets. It’s not coming from Stuttgart or Detroit but emerging markets.
“This is where we are positioning the portfolios so that we can benefit from this very big global trend.”
Hardenberg added: “The new iPhones will be based on surface technology which is based on organic LEDs and it is entirely occupied by Samsung which has 95 per cent of that surface technology.
“It will take quite a long time for others to come in and they will be able to protect their margin for quite a long time and they will be able to enjoy their leadership in that technology and supply not just to Apple but to everyone.”
Another part of the technology sector where Hardenberg sees increased competition from emerging markets firm is the semi-conductor market, which has been dominated by developed market providers.
Hardenberg said though it is a part of the industry that is well understood, the demand for memory could soar as internet of things and driverless cars become more prevalent.
“If you look at the market today and compare it to five to six years ago it used to be a market that was very fragmented which was very US-centric,” the manager said.

“Now the US market is dominated by emerging market companies like Samsung and on the processing side it is really Taiwan Semiconductor which is based out of Taiwan.
“So these are incredible opportunities in emerging markets and it is important to acknowledge the fact that we’ve come a long way from cement and traditional telco businesses to what we are looking at right now.”
 
The IT sector represents 27.06 per cent of the fund – the largest sector exposure – compared with a 26.63 per cent weighting in the MSCI Emerging Markets benchmark.
The fund’s top holdings include several high conviction technology stocks. Samsung Electronics is the fund’s second largest holding representing 6.86 per cent of the portfolio.
Elsewhere, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and South Korean firm SK Hynix represent 5.1 per cent and 1.76 per cent of the fund respectively. Also in the top 10 stocks is Chinese firm Alibaba, which has a 4.16 per cent weighting in the portfolio.
Hardenberg and Sehgal took over as managers of the fund earlier this year, following the announcement that veteran emerging markets investor Mark Mobius would be stepping back from day-to-day management duties.
