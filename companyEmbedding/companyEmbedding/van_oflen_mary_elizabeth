News>Executive Changes Kroger names Foley chief accounting officer


    Succeeds retiring Van Oflen; Fike named VP, treasurer
  

Jon Springer | Apr 10, 2017


































Todd A. Foley has been appointed chief accounting officer at Kroger Co., succeeding Mary Elizabeth Van Oflen, who retired last week, the company said.
Foley had been serving as VP and treasurer since 2003. In his place, the retailer has appointed Carin Fike, it said in a financial filing.
Foley, 47, began his career with Kroger in 2001 as an audit manager after working for PricewaterhouseCoopers from 1991 to 2001. At Kroger he was controller of the company’s Cincinnati/Dayton division from October 2003 to March 2006 and assistant corporate controller from March 2006 to June 2013.
Fike was appointed director and assistant treasurer in 2011. From 2004 to 2011 she was the company’s director of investor relations.
