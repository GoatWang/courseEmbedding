NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Link to Fitch Ratings' Report: Goldman Sachs Commercial Mortgage Trust 
      2014-GC18 (US CMBS)
    

http://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/reports/report_frame.cfm?rpt_id=729789


      Fitch Ratings has issued a presale report on GS Mortgage Securities 
      Trust 2014-GC18 Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates.
    

      Fitch expects to rate the transaction and assign Rating Outlooks as 
      follows:
    

      --$56,812,000 class A-1 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$116,213,000 class A-2 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;

      --$22,273,000b class E 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$12,528,000b class F 'Bsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      a Notional amount and interest-only.
    

      b Privately placed pursuant to Rule 144A.
    

      c Class A-S, B, and C certificates may be exchanged for class PEZ 
      certificates, and class PEZ certificates may be exchanged for up to the 
      full certificate principal amount of the class A-S, B and C certificates.
    

      The expected ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as 
      of Jan. 15, 2014. Fitch does not expect to rate the $54,290,128 class G 
      or the $66,818,128 interest-only class X-C.
    

      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership in the trust, 
      primary assets of which are 74 loans secured by 141 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $1.113 
      billion as of the cutoff date. The loans were contributed to the trust 
      by Goldman Sachs Mortgage Company, Citigroup Global Markets Realty 
      Corp., Starwood Mortgage Funding I LLC, and Cantor Commercial Real 
      Estate Lending, L.P.
    

      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 72.2% of the properties by balance and 
      cash flow analysis and asset summary reviews on 81.2% of the pool.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      High Fitch Leverage: The pool's Fitch DSCR and LTV of 1.15x and 106.2%, 
      respectively, are worse than the 2013 and 2012 averages of 1.29x and 
      101.6% and 1.24x and 97.2%, respectively.
    

      Limited Lodging Exposure: The pool's hotel concentration of 8.1% is 
      lower than the 2013 average hotel concentration of 14.7%. Two of the 15 
      largest loans in the pool are collateralized by hotel properties. Hotels 
      have a higher probability of default in Fitch's multiborrower model.
    

      Malls Located in Secondary Markets and High Retail Concentration: Two of 
      the five largest loans, The Crossroads (9% of the pool) and Wyoming 
      Valley Mall (7%), are collateralized by regional malls located in 
      secondary markets. Retail properties represent the largest property type 
      concentration at 40.5% of the pool, including five of the top 10 loans. 
      This is higher than the 2013 average retail concentration of 33.2%.
    

      Secondary Markets: Six of the 10 largest loans are collateralized by 
      properties located in secondary markets, including Portage, MI, 
      Wilkes-Barre, PA, Toledo, OH, Anchorage, AK, and Bangor, ME. The largest 
      state concentrations are Pennsylvania (16.7%), Michigan (12.9%), and 
      Louisiana (11.7%).
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      For this transaction, Fitch's NCF was 9.9% below the full-year 2012 NOI 
      (for properties that 2012 NOI was provided, excluding properties that 
      were stabilizing during this period).
    

      Unanticipated further declines in property-level NCF could result in 
      higher defaults and loss severity on defaulted loans, and could result 
      in potential rating actions on the certificates. Fitch evaluated the 
      sensitivity of the ratings assigned to GSMS 2014-GC18 certificates and 
      found that the transaction displays average sensitivity to further 
      declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF declined a further 20% from 
      Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'A-sf' 
      could result. In a more severe scenario, in which NCF declined a further 
      30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 
      'BBB-sf' could result.
    

      The presale report includes a detailed explanation of additional 
      stresses and sensitivities in the Rating Sensitivity and Rating Stresses 
      sections of the presale.
    

      The master servicer will be Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., rated 'CMS1-' by 
      Fitch. The special servicer will be LNR Partners LLC, rated 'CSS1-' by 
      Fitch.

                113The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or “star rating”, is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange–traded funds, closed–end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three–year history. Exchange–traded funds and open–ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk–Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product′s monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three–, five–, and 10–year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three–year rating for 36–59 months of total returns, 60% five–year rating⁄40% three–year rating for 60–119 months of total returns, and 50% 10–year rating⁄30% five–year rating⁄20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.Morningstar Stylebox†

                    Global Credit Research - 25 Feb 2016
                









New York, February 25, 2016 -- Moody's Investors Service (Moody's) was informed that The Shops and Garage 
at Canal Place, LLC, the Sponsor for The Shops and Garage 
at Canal Place in New Orleans, Louisiana, sold and transfered 
the subject property to Wilson Canal Place II, LLC. The property 
consists of the 216,616 square feet Shops at Canal Place and an 
adjacent 1,606 space parking garage.




Moody's has reviewed the transaction and has determined that the Proposed 
Sale, Transfer and Loan Assumption will not, in and of itself, 
and at this time, result in a downgrade or withdrawal of the current 
ratings to any class of certificates rated by Moody's for the GS Mortgage 
Securities Trust, Commercial Pass-Through Certificates, 
Series 2014-GC18.


Moody's opinion only addresses the credit impact associated with the proposed 
transaction. Moody's is not expressing any opinion as to whether 
this change has, or could have, other noncredit related effects 
that may have a detrimental impact on the interests of note holders and/or 
counterparties.




Moody's will continue to monitor these ratings. Any change in the 
ratings will be publicly disseminated by Moody's through appropriate media.








This publication does not announce a credit rating action. For 
any credit ratings referenced in this publication, please see the 
ratings tab on the issuer/entity page on www.moodys.com 
for the most updated credit rating action information and rating history.

This document is intended to be provided only to “wholesale clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. By continuing to access this document from within Australia, you represent to MOODY’S that you are, or are accessing the document as a representative of, a “wholesale client” and that neither you nor the entity you represent will directly or indirectly disseminate this document or its contents to “retail clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. MOODY’S credit rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a debt obligation of the issuer, not on the equity securities of the issuer or any form of security that is available to retail investors.

(“MJKK”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody's Group Japan G.K., which is wholly-owned by Moody’s Overseas Holdings Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of MCO. Moody’s SF Japan K.K. (“MSFJ”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of MJKK. MSFJ is not a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (“NRSRO”). Therefore, credit ratings assigned by MSFJ are Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings. Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings are assigned by an entity that is not a NRSRO and, consequently, the rated obligation will not qualify for certain types of treatment under U.S. laws. MJKK and MSFJ are credit rating agencies registered with the Japan Financial Services Agency and their registration numbers are FSA Commissioner (Ratings) No. 2 and 3 respectively. MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) hereby disclose that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from JPY200,000 to approximately JPY350,000,000. MJKK and MSFJ also maintain policies and procedures to address Japanese regulatory requirements.

                    Global Credit Research - 22 Nov 2016
                







Approximately $911.7 Million of Structured Securities Affected


New York, November 22, 2016 -- Moody's Investors Service has affirmed the ratings on ten classes in GS 
Mortgage Securities Trust 2014-GC18 as follows: 




Cl. A-2, Affirmed Aaa (sf); previously on Jan 
8, 2016 Affirmed Aaa (sf)

Cl. X-B, Affirmed Aa3 (sf); previously on Jan 
8, 2016 Affirmed Aa3 (sf)




RATINGS RATIONALE




The ratings on seven P&I classes were affirmed because the transaction's 
key metrics, including Moody's loan-to-value 
(LTV) ratio, Moody's stressed debt service coverage ratio 
(DSCR), and the transaction's Herfindahl Index (Herf), 
are within acceptable ranges.




The ratings on the IO classes X-A and X-B were affirmed 
due to the credit performance (or weighted average rating factor or WARF) 
of the referenced classes.




The ratings on the Class PEZ was affirmed due to the credit performance 
(or weighted average rating factor or WARF) of the exchangeable classes.




Moody's rating action reflects a base expected loss of 3.3% 
of the current balance, compared to 3.1% at Moody's 
last review. Moody's base expected loss plus realized losses is 
now 3.1% of the original pooled balance, compared 
to 3.0% at the last review. Moody's provides 
a current list of base expected losses for conduit and fusion CMBS transactions 
on moodys.com at http://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBS_SF215255.




FACTORS THAT WOULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS:




The performance expectations for a given variable indicate Moody's forward-looking 
view of the likely range of performance over the medium term. Performance 
that falls outside the given range can indicate that the collateral's 
credit quality is stronger or weaker than Moody's had previously expected.




Factors that could lead to an upgrade of the ratings include a significant 
amount of loan paydowns or amortization, an increase in the pool's 
share of defeasance or an improvement in pool performance.




Factors that could lead to a downgrade of the ratings include a decline 
in the performance of the pool, loan concentration, an increase 
in realized and expected losses from specially serviced and troubled loans 
or interest shortfalls.




METHODOLOGY UNDERLYING THE RATING ACTION




The principal methodology used in these ratings was "Approach to Rating 
US and Canadian Conduit/Fusion CMBS" published in December 2014. 
Please see the Rating Methodologies page on www.moodys.com 
for a copy of this methodology.




DESCRIPTION OF MODELS USED




Moody's review used the excel-based CMBS Conduit Model, 
which it uses for both conduit and fusion transactions. Credit 
enhancement levels for conduit loans are driven by property type, 
Moody's actual and stressed DSCR, and Moody's property 
quality grade (which reflects the capitalization rate Moody's uses 
to estimate Moody's value). Moody's fuses the conduit 
results with the results of its analysis of investment grade structured 
credit assessed loans and any conduit loan that represents 10% 
or greater of the current pool balance.




Moody's uses a variation of Herf to measure the diversity of loan 
sizes, where a higher number represents greater diversity. 
Loan concentration has an important bearing on potential rating volatility, 
including the risk of multiple notch downgrades under adverse circumstances. 
The credit neutral Herf score is 40. The pool has a Herf of 22, 
compared to 23 at last review.




DEAL PERFORMANCE




As of the 14 November, 2016 distribution date, the transaction's 
aggregate certificate balance has decreased by 5.1% to $1.056 
billion from $1.114 billion at securitization. The 
certificates are collateralized by 72 mortgage loans ranging in size from 
less than 1% to 10.5% of the pool, with the 
top ten loans (excluding defeasance) constituting 53.7% 
of the pool. This pool contains no loans with investment-grade 
credit assessments. One loan, constituting 0.4% 
of the pool, has defeased and is secured by US government securities.




Nine loans, constituting 9.0% of the pool, are 
on the master servicer's watchlist. The watchlist includes 
loans that meet certain portfolio review guidelines established as part 
of the CRE Finance Council (CREFC) monthly reporting package. As 
part of Moody's ongoing monitoring of a transaction, the agency 
reviews the watchlist to assess which loans have material issues that 
could affect performance.




One loan, constituting 0.3% of the pool, is 
currently in special servicing. The largest specially serviced 
loan is the Sullivan Apartments Loan ($3.3 million -- 
0.3% of the pool), which is secured by a 36 unit multifamily 
property located in Williston, North Dakota. The property 
was transferred to the special servicer in March 2016 due to imminent 
default as a result of the bankruptcy of the property's tenant. 
The property was previously 100% leased to an oil services company, 
which declared Chapter 15 bankruptcy in early 2016. The property 
was 14% occupied as of June 2016.




Moody's estimates an aggregate $3.0 million loss for 
specially serviced loans (89.2 % expected loss on average).




Moody's received full and partial year 2015 operating results for 98% 
of the pool, and full or partial year 2016 operating results for 
97% of the pool (excluding specially serviced and defeased loans). 
Moody's weighted average conduit LTV is 103%, compared 
to 106% at Moody's last review. Moody's conduit 
component excludes loans with structured credit assessments, defeased 
and CTL loans, and specially serviced and troubled loans. 
Moody's net cash flow (NCF) reflects a weighted average haircut 
of -13.5% to the most recently available net operating 
income (NOI). Moody's value reflects a weighted average capitalization 
rate of 9.8%.




Moody's actual and stressed conduit DSCRs are 1.54X and 1.06X, 
respectively, compared to 1.48X and 1.01X at the last 
review. Moody's actual DSCR is based on Moody's NCF 
and the loan's actual debt service. Moody's stressed 
DSCR is based on Moody's NCF and a 9.25% stress rate 
the agency applied to the loan balance.




The top three conduit loans represent 29.0% of the pool 
balance. The largest loan is The Shops and Canal Place Loan ($111.0 
million -- 10.5% of the pool), which is secured

For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and sensitivity 
analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and Sensitivity 
to Assumptions of the disclosure form.




The analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and 
performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected 
collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments. As a 
second step, Moody's estimates expected collateral losses or cash 
flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement, 
loss allocation and other structural features, to derive the expected 
loss for each rated instrument.




Moody's did not use any stress scenario simulations in its analysis.

Approximately $952 Million of Structured Securities Affected


New York, January 08, 2016 -- Moody's Investors Service (Moody's) has affirmed the ratings of 11 CMBS 
classes in GS Mortgage Securities Trust, Commercial Pass-Through 
Certificates, Series 2014-GC18 as follows: 




Cl. A-1, Affirmed Aaa (sf); previously on Jan

RATINGS RATIONALE




The ratings on the P&I classes were affirmed because the transaction's 
key metrics, including Moody's loan-to-value (LTV) 
ratio, Moody's stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and the 
transaction's Herfindahl Index (Herf), are within acceptable 
ranges.




The ratings on the IO classes were affirmed because the credit performance 
of the referenced classes is consistent with Moody's expectations.




Moody's rating action reflects a base expected loss of 3.1% 
of the current balance compared to 3.3% at Moody's 
last review. Moody's base expected loss plus realized losses is 
now 3.0% of the original pooled balance, compared 
to 3.3% at the last review. Moody's provides 
a current list of base expected losses for conduit and fusion CMBS transactions 
on moodys.com at http://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBS_SF215255. 





FACTORS THAT WOULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATING:




The performance expectations for a given variable indicate Moody's forward-looking 
view of the likely range of performance over the medium term. Performance 
that falls outside the given range can indicate that the collateral's 
credit quality is stronger or weaker than Moody's had previously expected.




Factors that could lead to an upgrade of the ratings include a significant 
amount of loan paydowns or amortization, an increase in the pool's 
share of defeasance or an improvement in pool performance.




Factors that could lead to a downgrade of the ratings include a decline 
in the performance of the pool, loan concentration, an increase 
in realized and expected losses from specially serviced and troubled loans 
or interest shortfalls.




METHODOLOGY UNDERLYING THE RATING ACTION




The principal methodology used in these ratings was "Approach to Rating 
US and Canadian Conduit/ Fusion CMBS" published in December 2014. 
Please see the Credit Policy page on www.moodys.com for 
a copy of this methodology.




DESCRIPTION OF MODELS USED




Moody's review used the excel-based CMBS Conduit Model, 
which it uses for both conduit and fusion transactions. Credit 
enhancement levels for conduit loans are driven by property type, 
Moody's actual and stressed DSCR, and Moody's property 
quality grade (which reflects the capitalization rate Moody's uses 
to estimate Moody's value). Moody's fuses the conduit 
results with the results of its analysis of investment grade structured 
credit assessed loans and any conduit loan that represents 10% 
or greater of the current pool balance. 




Moody's uses a variation of Herf to measure the diversity of loan 
sizes, where a higher number represents greater diversity. 
Loan concentration has an important bearing on potential rating volatility, 
including the risk of multiple notch downgrades under adverse circumstances. 
The credit neutral Herf score is 40. The pool has a Herf of 23, 
unchanged from Moody's last review.




DEAL PERFORMANCE




As of December 11, 2015 distribution date, the transaction's 
aggregate certificate balance has decreased by 1.5% to $1.10 
billion from $1.11 million at securitization. The 
certificates are collateralized by 74 mortgage loans ranging in size from 
less than 1% to 10% of the pool, with the top ten 
loans constituting 52% of the pool. The pool contains no 
loans with investment-grade structured credit assessments and no 
defeased loans.




Twelve loans, constituting 11% of the pool, are on 
the master servicer's watchlist. The watchlist includes loans 
that meet certain portfolio review guidelines established as part of the 
CRE Finance Council (CREFC) monthly reporting package. As part 
of Moody's ongoing monitoring of a transaction, the agency 
reviews the watchlist to assess which loans have material issues that 
could affect performance.




Moody's received full year 2014 operating results for 99% of the 
pool, and partial year 2015 operating results for 94% of 
the pool. Moody's weighted average conduit LTV is 106%, 
essentially unchanged from Moody's last review. Moody's 
conduit component excludes loans with structured credit assessments, 
defeased and CTL loans, and specially serviced and troubled loans. 
Moody's net cash flow (NCF) reflects a weighted average haircut 
of 11.4% to the most recently available net operating income 
(NOI). Moody's value reflects a weighted average capitalization 
rate of 9.8%.




Moody's actual and stressed conduit DSCRs are 1.48X and 1.01X, 
respectively, compared to 1.48X and 1.00X at the last 
review. Moody's actual DSCR is based on Moody's NCF 
and the loan's actual debt service. Moody's stressed 
DSCR is based on Moody's NCF and a 9.25% stress rate 
the agency applied to the loan balance.




The top three performing conduit loans represent 28% of the pool 
balance. The largest loan is The Shops at Canal Place Loan ($111 
million -- 10% of the pool), which is secured by a shopping 
mall located in downtown New Orleans, Louisiana. The mall 
is anchored by a Saks Fifth Avenue store, and is attached to hotel 
and office tower which are both not part of the loan collateral. 
The property was 97% occupied as of March 2015. Moody's 
LTV and stressed DSCR are 109% and 0.84X, respectively, 
unchanged from the prior review.




The second largest loan is the CityScape -- East Office/Retail Loan 
($100 million -- 9% of the pool), which represents 
a participation interest in a $185 million senior mortgage loan. 
The loan is secured by the leasehold interest in a 28-story office 
tower, plus ground level retail and parking in downtown Phoenix, 
Arizona. The retail space represents approximately 12% of 
the property's combined office / retail net rentable area (NRA). 
The property was 95% occupied as of September 2015. Approximately 
$25 million of additional, subordinate mezzanine debt is 
also associated with the property. Moody's whole loan LTV and stressed 
DSCR are 115% and 0.86X, respectively, unchanged 
from the prior review.




The third largest loan is The Crossroads Loan ($97 million -- 
9% of the pool). The loan is secured by a collateral portion 
of a 770,000 square foot regional mall located in Portage, 
Michigan, a suburb of Kalamazoo. Anchor tenants include JC 
Penney, Macy's, Sears, and Burlington. 
The total mall was 96% occupied as of September 2015. The 
loan benefits from amortization. Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR 
are 90% and, 1.11X, respectively, compared 
to 92% and 1.09X at the last review.

MOODY’S DEFINES CREDIT RISK AS THE RISK THAT AN ENTITY MAY NOT MEET ITS CONTRACTUAL, FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS AS THEY COME DUE AND ANY ESTIMATED FINANCIAL LOSS IN THE EVENT OF DEFAULT. CREDIT RATINGS DO NOT ADDRESS ANY OTHER RISK, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO: LIQUIDITY RISK, MARKET VALUE RISK, OR PRICE VOLATILITY.

NEITHER CREDIT RATINGS NOR MOODY’S PUBLICATIONS COMMENT ON THE SUITABILITY OF AN INVESTMENT FOR ANY PARTICULAR INVESTOR. MOODY’S ISSUES ITS CREDIT RATINGS AND PUBLISHES MOODY’S PUBLICATIONS WITH THE EXPECTATION AND UNDERSTANDING THAT EACH INVESTOR WILL, WITH DUE CARE, MAKE ITS OWN STUDY AND EVALUATION OF EACH SECURITY THAT IS UNDER CONSIDERATION FOR PURCHASE, HOLDING, OR SALE. MOODY’S CREDIT RATINGS AND MOODY’S PUBLICATIONS ARE NOT INTENDED FOR USE BY RETAIL INVESTORS AND IT WOULD BE RECKLESS AND INAPPROPRIATE FOR RETAIL INVESTORS TO USE MOODY’S CREDIT RATINGS OR MOODY’S PUBLICATIONS WHEN MAKING AN INVESTMENT DECISION. IF IN DOUBT YOU SHOULD CONTACT YOUR FINANCIAL OR OTHER PROFESSIONAL ADVISER. ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED HEREIN IS PROTECTED BY LAW, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, COPYRIGHT LAW, AND NONE OF SUCH INFORMATION MAY BE COPIED OR OTHERWISE REPRODUCED, REPACKAGED, FURTHER TRANSMITTED, TRANSFERRED, DISSEMINATED, REDISTRIBUTED OR RESOLD, OR STORED FOR SUBSEQUENT USE FOR ANY SUCH PURPOSE, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, IN ANY FORM OR MANNER OR BY ANY MEANS WHATSOEVER, BY ANY PERSON WITHOUT MOODY’S PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT. All information contained herein is obtained by MOODY’S from sources believed by it to be accurate and reliable. Because of the possibility of human or mechanical error as well as other factors, however, all information contained herein is provided “AS IS” without warranty of any kind. MOODY'S adopts all necessary measures so that the information it uses in assigning a credit rating is of sufficient quality and from sources MOODY'S considers to be reliable including, when appropriate, independent third-party sources. However, MOODY’S is not an auditor and cannot in every instance independently verify or validate information received in the rating process or in preparing the Moody’s publications. To the extent permitted by law, MOODY’S and its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors and suppliers disclaim liability to any person or entity for any indirect, special, consequential, or incidental losses or damages whatsoever arising from or in connection with the information contained herein or the use of or inability to use any such information, even if MOODY’S or any of its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors or suppliers is advised in advance of the possibility of such losses or damages, including but not limited to: (a) any loss of present or prospective profits or (b) any loss or damage arising where the relevant financial instrument is not the subject of a particular credit rating assigned by MOODY’S. To the extent permitted by law, MOODY’S and its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors and suppliers disclaim liability for any direct or compensatory losses or damages caused to any person or entity, including but not limited to by any negligence (but excluding fraud, willful misconduct or any other type of liability that, for the avoidance of doubt, by law cannot be excluded) on the part of, or any contingency within or beyond the control of, MOODY’S or any of its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors or suppliers, arising from or in connection with the information contained herein or the use of or inability to use any such information. NO WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE ACCURACY, TIMELINESS, COMPLETENESS, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE OF ANY SUCH RATING OR OTHER OPINION OR INFORMATION IS GIVEN OR MADE BY MOODY’S IN ANY FORM OR MANNER WHATSOEVER. Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody’s Corporation (“MCO”), hereby discloses that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from $1,500 to approximately $2,500,000. MCO and MIS also maintain policies and procedures to address the independence of MIS’s ratings and rating processes. Information regarding certain affiliations that may exist between directors of MCO and rated entities, and between entities who hold ratings from MIS and have also publicly reported to the SEC an ownership interest in MCO of more than 5%, is posted annually at www.moodys.com under the heading “Investor Relations — Corporate Governance — Director and Shareholder Affiliation Policy.” Additional terms for Australia only: Any publication into Australia of this document is pursuant to the Australian Financial Services License of MOODY’S affiliate, Moody’s Investors Service Pty Limited ABN 61 003 399 657AFSL 336969 and/or Moody’s Analytics Australia Pty Ltd ABN 94 105 136 972 AFSL 383569 (as applicable). This document is intended to be provided only to “wholesale clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. By continuing to access this document from within Australia, you represent to MOODY’S that you are, or are accessing the document as a representative of, a “wholesale client” and that neither you nor the entity you represent will directly or indirectly disseminate this document or its contents to “retail clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. MOODY’S credit rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a debt obligation of the issuer, not on the equity securities of the issuer or any form of security that is available to retail investors. It would be reckless and inappropriate for retail investors to use MOODY’S credit ratings or publications when making an investment decision. If in doubt you should contact your financial or other professional adviser. Additional terms for Japan only: Moody's Japan K.K. (“MJKK”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody's Group Japan G.K., which is wholly-owned by Moody’s Overseas Holdings Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of MCO. Moody’s SF Japan K.K. (“MSFJ”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of MJKK. MSFJ is not a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (“NRSRO”). Therefore, credit ratings assigned by MSFJ are Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings. Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings are assigned by an entity that is not a NRSRO and, consequently, the rated obligation will not qualify for certain types of treatment under U.S. laws. MJKK and MSFJ are credit rating agencies registered with the Japan Financial Services Agency and their registration numbers are FSA Commissioner (Ratings) No. 2 and 3 respectively. MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) hereby disclose that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from JPY200,000 to approximately JPY350,000,000. MJKK and MSFJ also maintain policies and procedures to address Japanese regulatory requirements.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Announcement: Moody's: No rating impact on 30 CMBS transactions in which Deutsche Bank serves as Trustee or Certificate Administrator






                    Global Credit Research - 30 Jul 2015
                









New York, July 30, 2015 -- On May 28, 2015, Moody's Investors Service ("Moody's") upgraded 
both Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas ("DBTCA") and Deutsche 
Bank National Trust Company ("DBNTC") and their operating 
trust company subsidiaries' long-term bank deposit ratings to A1 
from A3 and upgraded their short-term bank deposit ratings to P-1 
from P-2. The long-term issuer ratings for both DBTCA 
and DBNTC were downgraded to Baa1 from A3 and the Counter Party Risk Assessment 
("CRA") is A2(cr) / P-1(cr). DBTCA and DBNTC 
(collectively, "DB") have submitted a request for Rating Agency 
Confirmation ("RAC") with respect to 30 transactions for which DB serves 
as trustee and / or certificate administrator for Moody's consideration.




In the event that DB's ratings fail to meet Moody's criteria, 
DB's proposal includes the following features: 




(1) For those transactions in which DB serves as nominal trustee with 
the obligation to back-up the Master Servicer with respect to debt 
service and property protection advances: a) DB may serve in this 
capacity as long as it maintains a minimum long-term issuer rating 
of Baa2 and the Master Servicer for the transaction maintains a minimum 
long-term issuer rating of A2; b) If the Master Servicer is 
not rated, or its long-term issuer rating is lower than A2 
and DB's long-term issuer rating is lower than Baa2, 
then DB will resign as trustee within 30 days of the master servicer or 
DB both failing to meet the A2 long-term issuer rating threshold 
and be replaced by a successor trustee with a minimum long-term 
issuer rating of A2.




(2) For those transactions in which DB serves as Certificate Administrator, 
DB may serve in this capacity as long as it maintains a minimum long-term 
issuer rating of Baa2. However, if: a) DB holds distribution 
or collection account funds intraday and only intraday, those funds 
must be held in a depository institution with a minimum long-term 
bank deposit rating of Baa2 or short-term bank deposit rating of 
P-2; or b) DB holds distribution or collection account funds 
overnight or longer, those funds must be held in a depository institution 
that has a minimum long-term deposit rating of A2 or short-term 
deposit rating of P-1.




In assessing the proposal, Moody's has considered the rating implementation 
guidance entitled "The Temporary Use of Cash in Structured Finance Transactions: 
Eligible Investment and Bank Guidelines" published in March 16, 
2015. Please see the Credit Policy page on www.moodys.com 
for a copy of this rating implementation guidance.




Moody's opinion only addresses the credit impact associated with the proposal. 
Moody's is not expressing any opinion as to whether this change has, 
or could have, other noncredit related effects that may have a detrimental 
impact on the interests of note holders and/or counterparties.




Moody's will continue to monitor these ratings. Any change in the 
ratings will be publicly disseminated by Moody's through appropriate media

To the extent permitted by law, MOODY’S and its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors and suppliers disclaim liability for any direct or compensatory losses or damages caused to any person or entity, including but not limited to by any negligence (but excluding fraud, willful misconduct or any other type of liability that, for the avoidance of doubt, by law cannot be excluded) on the part of, or any contingency within or beyond the control of, MOODY’S or any of its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors or suppliers, arising from or in connection with the information contained herein or the use of or inability to use any such information. NO WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE ACCURACY, TIMELINESS, COMPLETENESS, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE OF ANY SUCH RATING OR OTHER OPINION OR INFORMATION IS GIVEN OR MADE BY MOODY’S IN ANY FORM OR MANNER WHATSOEVER. Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody’s Corporation (“MCO”), hereby discloses that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from $1,500 to approximately $2,500,000. MCO and MIS also maintain policies and procedures to address the independence of MIS’s ratings and rating processes. Information regarding certain affiliations that may exist between directors of MCO and rated entities, and between entities who hold ratings from MIS and have also publicly reported to the SEC an ownership interest in MCO of more than 5%, is posted annually at www.moodys.com under the heading “Investor Relations — Corporate Governance — Director and Shareholder Affiliation Policy.” Additional terms for Australia only: Any publication into Australia of this document is pursuant to the Australian Financial Services License of MOODY’S affiliate, Moody’s Investors Service Pty Limited ABN 61 003 399 657AFSL 336969 and/or Moody’s Analytics Australia Pty Ltd ABN 94 105 136 972 AFSL 383569 (as applicable). This document is intended to be provided only to “wholesale clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. By continuing to access this document from within Australia, you represent to MOODY’S that you are, or are accessing the document as a representative of, a “wholesale client” and that neither you nor the entity you represent will directly or indirectly disseminate this document or its contents to “retail clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. MOODY’S credit rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a debt obligation of the issuer, not on the equity securities of the issuer or any form of security that is available to retail investors. It would be reckless and inappropriate for retail investors to use MOODY’S credit ratings or publications when making an investment decision. If in doubt you should contact your financial or other professional adviser. Additional terms for Japan only: Moody's Japan K.K. (“MJKK”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody's Group Japan G.K., which is wholly-owned by Moody’s Overseas Holdings Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of MCO. Moody’s SF Japan K.K. (“MSFJ”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of MJKK. MSFJ is not a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (“NRSRO”). Therefore, credit ratings assigned by MSFJ are Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings. Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings are assigned by an entity that is not a NRSRO and, consequently, the rated obligation will not qualify for certain types of treatment under U.S. laws. MJKK and MSFJ are credit rating agencies registered with the Japan Financial Services Agency and their registration numbers are FSA Commissioner (Ratings) No. 2 and 3 respectively. MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) hereby disclose that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from JPY200,000 to approximately JPY350,000,000. MJKK and MSFJ also maintain policies and procedures to address Japanese regulatory requirements.

For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
