Synchronoss Technologies, Inc. (Synchronoss), incorporated on September 19, 2000, is a global software and services company, which provides technologies and services for the mobile transformation of business. The Company's portfolio in the Consumer and Enterprise markets contains offerings, such as personal cloud, secure-mobility, identity management and scalable messaging platforms, products and solutions. The Company's products and platforms are designed to enable multiple converged communication services to be managed across a range of distribution channels including e-commerce, m-commerce, telesales, customer stores, indirect and other retail outlets. The Company operates in and markets their solutions and services directly through their sales organizations in North America, Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA), Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region. Synchronoss delivers technologies for mobile transformation to two primary types of customers: service provider and enterprise customers in regulated verticals and use cases.The Company's products and platforms provide end-to-end integration between customer-facing channels/applications, communication services, or devices and back-office infrastructure-related systems and processes. Synchronoss' customers rely on their solutions and technology to automate the process of activation and content and settings management for their subscribers' devices while delivering additional communication services. Synchronoss' portfolio includes cloud-based sync, backup, storage and content engagement capabilities, broadband connectivity solutions, analytics, white label messaging, identity/access management that enable communications service providers (CSPs), cable operators/multi-services operators (MSOs) and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) with embedded connectivity (smartphones, laptops, tablets and mobile Internet devices (MIDs), such as automobiles, wearables for personal health and wellness, and connected homes), multi-channel retailers, as well as other customers to accelerate and monetize services for broadband networks and connected devices. The Company's cloud, messaging, security, collaboration, work flow management, predictive analytics and activation platforms manage transactions relating to a range of existing communications and digital content services across its customers.The Company's Synchronoss Enterprise solutions support a digital mobility experience for businesses and consumers enabling the accessing and protecting of their information. Its identity and access management platform helps consumers and business users to access online Websites to conduct e-commerce transactions or access important data. The Company's mobility platforms help users to store and share data. The identity and access solution supports consumers by allowing them to self-register and verify their identities, while providing non-intrusive multi-factor authentication. At the same time, the identity and access solution enables businesses to be sure that the person at the other end of the transaction is the correct person. The secure mobility solution combines the identity platform with a bring your own device (BYOD) platform that is based on a container for accessing data, applications, content and personal information management tools, such as e-mail, calendar, messaging and notes. The Synchronoss Enterprise solutions platform has three components, which drive a digital online experience in select enterprise vertical markets. These include secure mobility management, a BYOD implementation that provides the rich integration and orchestration of mobile productivity software featuring fine grain activity capture and dynamic policy execution through mobility management, security and policy management tools and productivity through behavioral analytics; data and analytics, a solution that supports fraud and cybersecurity detection/prevention, dynamic policy administration/execution and predictive productivity, and identity and access management, a solution that allows customers to self-register and verify their respective identities while providing non-intrusive multi-factor authentication, which provides businesses with the assurance that the consumer with whom they are interacting is the person authorized to conduct the transaction. The Synchronoss Enterprise solutions are targeted in markets, such as financial services, telecommunications, healthcare, life sciences and government.The Company's Synchronoss Personal Cloud platform is designed to deliver an operator-branded experience for subscribers to backup, restore, synchronize and share their personal content across smartphones, tablets, computers and other connected devices from anywhere at any time. The Synchronoss Personal Cloud platform extends a carrier's or OEM's visibility and reaches into all aspects of a subscriber's use of a connected devices. It introduces the notion of Connect-Sync-Activate for all devices. The Synchronoss Personal Cloud platform is designed to support connected devices, such as smartphones, MIDs, laptops, tablets and wirelessly enabled consumer electronics, such as wearables for health and wellness, cameras, e-readers, personal navigation devices and global positioning system (GPS), enabled devices, as well as connected automobiles. The Synchronoss Personal Cloud solution features products that facilitate the transfer of mobile content from one smart device to another and the sync, backup, storage, content management and content engagement features for mobile content.

This feature supports care channel use cases of securing content during a device wipe and also creates a value-added solution in the case of lost devices, cracked screens and other edge use cases. Furthermore, the Synchronoss Backup & Transfer solution enables the subscriber to establish a cloud account at the point of transfer and an auto sync capability to keep content backed up to the cloud account going forward. This experience is designed to drive cloud enrollment at the point of transfer (often during a new line or upgrade) and provide an opportunity to get content into the Cloud to reduce the time of transfer for the next upgrade.The Company's Synchronoss Secure Messaging platform is designed for demanding large-scale environments, with optional e-mail features.

Synchronoss Technologies, Inc. Announces Addition Of SmartMobility™ Product To ConvergenceNow® Plus+™






Business Wire




May 3, 2011 4:01 PM EDT













 


















































  Synchronoss Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: SNCR), the world’s leading provider of transaction management, cloud enablement and connectivity services for connected devices, today announced that it has enhanced its ConvergenceNow ®Plus +™ platform with the addition of the SmartMobility™ product.  The SmartMobility product will drive faster and more efficient device connectivity from the cloud. As a result, we believe that SmartMobility will revolutionize device activation, connectivity and management for connected devices across networks. Synchronoss also announced the acquisition of privately held Sapience Knowledge Systems, which brings significant domain expertise and will help to accelerate Synchronoss’ time to market with its new mobility management product.  Stephen G. Waldis, President and Chief Executive Officer of Synchronoss, said, “With the introduction of SmartMobility, Synchronoss is continuing the expansion of its ConvergenceNow Plus+ platform for enabling transaction management via the cloud directly from the device itself. Estimates for connected device adoption are reaching the billions of unit levels, and these devices will increasingly be running on multiple networks. As a result, the industry needs a more integrated solution to combine activation and synch technology with smarter connectivity, in addition to moving away from standalone software that needs to be installed and tested. The integration of SmartMobility with our ConvergenceNow Plus + platform creates a standardized way to service the industry, which benefits both enterprises and consumers by eliminating redundancies, reducing costs and streamlining faster product introductions.”  Waldis added, “We are partnering with a Tier One Service Provider as well as some Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) to roll out our SmartMobility product. We currently anticipate moving into production in late 2011 with additional functionality and partners being launched in 2012.”  “We are very excited to be a part of the Synchronoss family,” said Biju Nair, President & CEO of Sapience. “The addition of SmartMobility to Synchronoss’ ConvergenceNow Plus+ platform creates a new paradigm in mobility management that cost-effectively improves time-to-market and enables new revenue streams for our customers.”

	Q1 2017 Update and Withdrawal of FY 2017 Guidance As previously disclosed, Synchronoss expects total revenue for the first quarter of 2017 to be $13 million to $14 million less than the company's previously announced guidance Operating margins expected to be 8% - 10%, which is lower than previously announced guidance of 18% - 20% Synchronoss has not lost any material customers The primary driver of the lower revenue in the quarter was a new incremental enterprise license opportunity with a core carrier customer that did not materialize in the quarter as expected. This license miss combined with a delay in our cost reduction plan also impacted profitability in Q1 Despite an overall uptick in deal activity in Intralinks M&A business, Q1 revenues from Intralinks were softer as a result of smaller average deal sizes Our previous 2017 annual guidance is withdrawn and new guidance cannot be provided until we have completed our accounting review and our assessment of the revenue impact on future financial periods including the timing and performance of certain other incremental programs that were previously forecasted for 2017. The combination of these items will have a negative impact on our 2017 financial results as compared to our previously issued 2017 guidance We are working diligently to complete the accounting restatement and will provide revised guidance when we report our Q1 results along with our restated financial statements for 2015 and 2016

	June 2017 Reorganization Initiative per Filed 8-K On June 14, 2017 Synchronoss commenced a management streamlining and realignment plan (the Plan) The Plan, together with the management changes previously announced, is expected to realize approximately $70 million of annualized pre-tax expense savings per our filed 8-K on June 20, 2017 These expected savings are in addition to the approximate $20 million of annual pre-tax expense synergies the Company previously realized in connection with its acquisition and integration of Intralinks In addition, Synchronoss has prudently eliminated and streamlined other cost initiatives across the company for 2017 to better align our expense profile with a more recurring based revenue trajectory As a result of the Plan, the Company currently estimates that it will recognize a pre-tax charge of approximately between $22 million and $25 million, which consists of severance payments and other termination costs with cash expenditures This reorganization initiative was structured for minimal revenue disruption while optimizing efficiencies and cash flow generation
