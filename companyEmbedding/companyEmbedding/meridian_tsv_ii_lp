The following supplements the information provided in prior Schedule 13D filings by the Reporting Entities.


Meridian's prior filings have focused on the "What" and "When" elements of the securities reporting and corporate governance problems involving Cyanotech.  This filing will focus on the "Who" and "Why" elements with particular focus on the involvement of the Rudolph Steiner Foundation.


Background


On May 6, 2016, Meridian delivered a letter to Cyanotech's board of directors detailing extensive reporting and governance issues involving Cyanotech's chairman and largest shareholder, Michael Davis and its second largest shareholder, the Rudolph Steiner Foundation.  After delivering the May 6 letter, Meridian sought to discuss its contents with Cyanotech's board of directors and when it became clear that Cyanotech's board was unwilling to engage in any discussions, Meridian filed a lawsuit in Federal court on May 24, 2016.


As detailed in its October 6, 2016, Schedule 13D filing, Meridian believes Davis has created an undisclosed "group" with the Rudolph Steiner Foundation in order that Davis and RSF might control the board of directors of Cyanotech and thereby control the company's business.  While the facts speak for themselves with respect to Davis' activities in creating a group with RSF, there has remained the question as to why Davis and RSF have taken their unusual actions.  This filing explores the question of motivations for both Davis and RSF.  Whenever possible, this filing provides direct quotations from available public materials in order to make clear that Meridian is providing information that is both accurate and fair.


Rudolph Steiner Foundation d/b/a RSF Social Finance


Rudolph Steiner Foundation (RSF) is a self-described socially-responsible investment organization that "seeks to revolutionize how people relate to money" by "transforming what it means to earn a return."   On its website RSF informs that it seeks to "redirect the flow of money in local markets, and heal an economy often damaged by exploitation and resource depletion."  RSF takes its name and purpose from the work of Rudolph Steiner, a German-Austrian philosopher and social reformer who died in 1925.  Steiner founded an esoteric spiritual movement called anthroposophy, which includes teaching in the areas of education, artistic expression, medicine, and agriculture.  Steiner's ideas included a concept of "spiritual science" involving clairvoyant experiences and the belief that individuals are reincarnated in a variety of different peoples and races over successive lives.


Most relevant to Cyanotech, are RSF's beliefs concerning the practice of agriculture. According to the Biodynamic Association (BDA), an organization created in 1938 that "awakens and enlivens co-creative relationships between humans and the earth," Rudolph Steiner was the founder of the biodynamic approach to agriculture.  According to BDA, "Steiner came to the conclusion that western civilization would gradually bring destruction to itself and the earth if it did not begin to develop an understanding of the spiritual world and its interrelationship with the physical world."
Steiner is credited as being the first to "bring the perspective of the farm as a single, self-sustaining organism that thrives through biodiversity." Steiner developed "a unique and comprehensive approach to soil, plant, animal and human health that recognizes the importance of the healthy interplay of cosmic and earthly influences. With this knowledge, he developed a set of homeopathic preparations…that help build up the farm's innate immune system and vital forces."


RSF's Investment Activities


From information on its website, it appears the focus of RSF's investment activities is providing capital to support "food initiatives."  RSF reports that many of the entities it funds are "biodynamic or sympathetic to BD, melding ethical and spiritual ideas with practical farming and sustainability goals."  RSF also explains on its website that "all of our philanthropic investment options are return agnostic" and "do not seek market-rate returns as a primary goal."





 
Consistent with its "mission aligned" investment approach, RSF announced in 2010 that "in response to the indirect, opaque, impersonal and volatile nature of the stock market, RSF divest[ed] from all public equities and redirect[ed] capital to investments more closely aligned with its values."  In 2011, in partnership with Leslie Christian of Portfolio 21 Investments, RSF published a white paper entitled, "A New Foundation for Portfolio Management" that RSF says "challenges traditional notions of portfolio theory and investment management."  Stating that its own investment approach is "grounded in the understanding that economic growth cannot be infinite on a planet with finite natural resources," RSF's white paper argues that "the possibility of long-term, continuous zero or negative economic growth precipitated by ecological limits warrants deeper consideration for long-term investment portfolios."  RSF's white paper concludes with the objective that RSF serve as an example for other investors who want to engage in "whole portfolio activation", where 100% of a portfolio is aligned with mission.  This mission includes "de-coupling from Wall Street as much as possible."


RSF's Investment in Cyanotech


RSF became a shareholder of Cyanotech in 2010, and has reported in its Schedule 13G filings that it currently owns 13.5% of the company's outstanding shares.  Because RSF's filings related to Cyanotech are the only SEC ownership filings RSF has ever made, it appears that Cyanotech is the only public company in which RSF has ever held an ownership stake greater than 5%.


In studying RSF's investment in Cyanotech, we note that (i) RSF became a shareholder in 2010, the same year it reported that it was divesting of all of its public company holdings and (ii) RSF executed, what for it was an extraordinary international privately-negotiated purchase of a 9.7% block of Cyanotech shares, taking RSF's holdings above 10% and requiring RSF to file the only 13G it has ever filed, in 2011, the same year it published its investment white paper describing its intention of "de-coupling from Wall Street as much as possible."


Given RSF's strong interest in agriculture, and in particular its desire to meld "ethical and spiritual ideas with practical farming and sustainability goals," Meridian believes that its participation, with Davis, in controlling Cyanotech, has become a part of RSF's goal to "transform society" by causing Cyanotech to operate consistent with RSF's spiritual science and growth-related philosophies.


The "Group" Controlling Cyanotech


In its previous filings, Meridian has focused on the "What" and "When" elements of the "group" that has been created by RSF and Michael Davis.  After researching RSF's public statements of principles and purpose, Meridian believes it can now begin to understand the "Who" and "Why" elements of the actions it has observed taken by Cyanotech's control "group".


As discussed in Meridian's May 19, 2016 Schedule 13D filing, it is well-known to those around Cyanotech that Michael Davis has a very close relationship with RSF.  According to the company's previous CEO, Davis took the executive to visit RSF's offices on his very first day on the job with Cyanotech.  Davis has now confirmed that every single share of Cyanotech stock held by RSF was acquired with the direct participation of Davis, either as a gift of shares from a Davis-controlled entity or as a gift of cash to be used to acquire Cyanotech shares.


Having now studied the philosophy and investment strategy of RSF, Meridian believes it has a more complete understanding of what Davis and RSF have been seeking to accomplish with their control "group" at Cyanotech.  This understanding helps to explain some of the unusual business practices and strategic decisions observed at Cyanotech.  Recall first, these elements of RSF's investment strategy:






·


"de-coupling from Wall Street as much as possible"








·


"do not seek market-rate returns as a primary goal"








·


"the possibility of long-term, continuous zero or negative economic growth precipitated by ecological limits"






Next, consider the following unusual business practices and strategic decisions observed at Cyanotech:











·


The company conducts no investor relations – there are no investor calls, no investor roadshows, there is not even a PowerPoint designed to introduce investors to the company.








·


The company provides minimal disclosure in its quarterly SEC filings and press releases, following a template that discloses numeric data with very little commentary, thus leaving outside investors without material information about the company's business drivers (e.g., why is it taking so long for Cyanotech to adapt its production methodologies in order to increase the amount of Astaxanthin available for sale?)








·


The board of directors actively discourages management and employees from engaging with investors. As an example, as part of its standard practice, Meridian sent a representative to Cyanotech's 2014 annual meeting of shareholders.  As part of this standard practice, Meridian contacted the company weeks in advance to inform the company of its planned visit and request an opportunity to meet with management and directors and, if possible, tour the company's facilities in Hawaii.  A company representative replied that Cyanotech no longer provided tours and that Meridian would be welcome at the shareholder meeting.  Yet, Cyanotech's board, knowing that an investor had traveled thousands of miles to meet with company representatives, immediately cleared the room following adjournment of the formal scripted shareholder meeting, thus providing only minutes for the "meet-and-greet" that is standard at every other small public shareholder meeting Meridian has ever attended.  It was only by the personal intervention of Cyanotech founder, Gerry Cysewski, that any purpose was salvaged from the trip, as he arranged for a short tour of Cyanotech's farm.








·


Cyanotech's last two CEOs were generally well-regarded by the company's outside shareholders.  Both were terminated without explanation shortly after leading the company through periods of rapid and positive business development.  Both CEOs saw their termination result in the loss of significant cash and equity incentives that had accrued during their tenure.








·


After more than a year of Cyantech disclosing difficulties in increasing Astaxanthin production, and subsequent research by Meridian into the potential of investing in closed-systems that would protect the algae from environmental influences, Meridian twice approached the company offering to provide capital if that would help the company implement the necessary production changes.  Meridian received no response from these offers.  Instead, Meridian soon after learned that Cyanotech had terminated the employment of the CEO that had communicated Meridian's offer to the board.








·


In addition to his role as chairman of the board of directors, Davis is chairman of the board's nominating and governance committee.  In this position, Davis has established a pattern of recruiting individuals to serve on Cyanotech's board that have no prior public company board experience.








·


The directors recruited by chairman Davis have responded in a surprisingly passive manner to revelations that their chairman and largest shareholder has, for years, failed to make proper SEC filings with respect to his holdings in Cyanotech.  After an independent investigation reported that certain facts relating to the relationship between the company's two largest shareholders (Davis and RSF) "could be consistent with the existence a 'group,'" the board's reaction was to defer to Davis, urging him to "consider whether or not a "group" exists."








·


The directors recruited by chairman Davis, after having been publicly challenged concerning numerous public company corporate governance deficiencies, including multiple apparent conflicts of interest, reported to the company's outside shareholders that the board was aware of and is untroubled by such conflicts.








·


At Davis' urging, Cyanotech recently replaced its Honolulu-based law firm (Goodsill Anderson), which describes itself as focused on the "business needs of clients in Hawaii and around the world" with "practice areas, including securities law, banking, real estate, tax" and attorneys knowledgeable in such specialized areas as mergers and acquisitions, environmental law, antitrust, aviation, admiralty, [and] international trade."  The firm that replaced Cyanotech's historic corporate counsel is a San Francisco-based law firm (Farella Braun) that describes itself as "trial lawyers first" with experience including "complex litigation involving class actions, antitrust, and unfair competition; business litigation involving securities, commodities and M&A disputes."  Cyanotech's new corporate counsel had previously represented Davis and his affiliated foundations and therefore was likely involved in Davis' gifts to RSF that resulted in RSF's large holdings in Cyanotech.  The firm's website states, "we represent more than 100 philanthropic organizations from community, private, family and corporate foundations to charitable trusts and public charities" and "we have proven experience for tax efficient transfers of individual wealth to personal, familial or corporate exempt organizations, including the best and proper method to accept, account for and plan to receive gifts of value including cash, securities, real estate, art and other precious commodities."






Conclusion


In its prior filings, Meridian has focused on the actions of Michael Davis to create a "group" with RSF and to cause Cyanotech to take actions that appear inconsistent with proper public company corporate government practices and the fiduciary obligations of Cyanotech's board of directors.  Meridian believes it is important to understand why Davis decided to collaborate with RSF.  In this regard, RSF's 2011 white paper promoting a new investment approach that is 100% mission-focused on long-term investments where "the possibility of long-term, continuous zero or negative economic growth" was acceptable, appears to be central.  That same year, Davis gave RSF $2.5 million to acquire the 9.7% block that would elevate RSF's ownership in Cyanotech to 13.5% and the combined ownership of the Davis/RSF "group" to 33%.  It was also in that same year, that Davis became chairman of the board of directors of Cyanotech.







Meridian believes the control "group" of Davis and RSF are responsible for the unusual business practices and strategic decisions observed at Cyanotech.  Meridian believes these practices and decisions are preventing Cyanotech from realizing its potential and were made to advance the interests and philosophical pursuits of Davis and RSF, not the best interests of Cyanotech's outside stockholders.

The following supplements the information provided in prior Schedule 13D filings by the Reporting Entities.


Background


On May 6, 2016, Meridian delivered a letter to Cyanotech's board of directors detailing extensive reporting and governance issues involving Cyanotech's chairman and largest shareholder, Michael Davis.  After delivering the May 6 letter, Meridian sought to discuss its contents with Cyanotech's board of directors and when it became clear that Cyanotech's board was unwilling to engage in any discussions, Meridian filed a lawsuit in Federal court on May 24, 2016.  On June 8, 2016, Cyanotech announced that it had engaged counsel to represent a special committee of the board that had been formed to investigate the issues raised in Meridian's May 6 letter.  Four months later, Cyanotech disclosed a summary of the special committee's findings in a Form 8-K filing with the SEC.


In this Amendment to Schedule 13D, Meridian will update and discuss the securities reporting issues raised in its May 6 letter.  There have been three recent SEC filings made by Cyanotech or Davis that have provided new information on these topics:






(i)


Form 10-Q filed by Cyanotech on August 15, 2016








(ii)


Form 8-K filed by Cyanotech on September 9, 2016








(iii)


Schedule 13D filed by Michael Davis on September 21, 2016






These filings confirm that Davis, who himself owns 19.5% of Cyanotech's stock, caused the Rudolph Steiner Foundation (RSF) to become the holder of another 13.5%, bringing the combined ownership of the two shareholders to 33%.  While it is not illegal or even improper to become a large shareholder with substantial influence over the activities of a public company, the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, and SEC rules promulgated thereunder, require prompt and full disclosure of such facts.


The relevant SEC rules begin with the requirement that any investor acquiring more than 5% of a public company make a filing with the SEC within ten days.  Passive investors are allowed to use a short form Schedule 13G while those who have the ability or intent to influence the company, or anyone with 20% or more of the company's stock, must file on Schedule 13D.  In addition, anyone reaching the 10% level must report every transaction in the company's stock within two business days on Form 4.  Finally, even stricter requirements are placed on insiders and control entities of public companies, this includes anyone who is a named executive officer or board member.  Such persons must report all transactions, of any size and regardless of their ownership level, on Form 4 within two business days.


Davis' History of Securities Reporting Deficiencies


Meridian discovered in 2016 that Michael Davis has a long history of failing to make the required SEC disclosures regarding his ownership of Cyanotech stock.  These deficiencies raise several issues.  First, until last month Davis reported his Cyanotech holdings on short form Schedule 13G rather than the required Schedule 13D.  Persons who have the ability to control public companies, such as board members, are not eligible to file on Schedule 13G.  Davis has been on the Cyanotech board of directors for 13 years, since 2003, and has been the board's chairman since 2011.  The special committee agreed that Davis is required to file on Schedule 13D.


Second, the special committee confirmed Meridian's allegation that Davis did not even comply with the lesser Schedule 13G reporting requirements. According to the special committee, "Mr. Davis made late Schedule 13G filings (in 2004, 2005, 2010, 2011, 2014, and 2015) and failed to file reports pursuant to Section 13 in 2006, 2008, 2009 and 2012."


Third, the filings Davis did make contained misstatements and omissions.  According to the special committee, "Certain of [Davis'] prior reports in 2002, 2011 and 2013 also contained immaterial inaccuracies related to share totals, beneficial ownership calculations or co-trustee names."  Meridian believes the special committee's summary understates the problem.  The following is only one example.







The last known transaction between Michael Davis and RSF involved Davis donating 30,769 shares to RSF on 2/18/14, which was reported on a Form 4 filed by Davis on 2/20/14.  This Form 4 also reported that Davis acquired 50,000 shares in open market purchases on 2/19/14.  One month later, on 3/14/14, Davis made a Schedule 13G filing.  Filers eligible to use Schedule 13G are required to make annual reports of their year-end holdings within 45 days; this means such filings are due on or before February 14 of each year.  Davis made his filing a month late but still purported to report his holdings as of the prior year-end, 12/31/13.  But this is not what his Schedule 13G reported.  On 9/23/14, Davis filed a Form 4 to report an equity grant of 6,369 shares and then on 3/25/15, filed a Schedule 13G reporting his year-end 12/31/14 holdings as precisely 6,369 shares higher than reported in the Schedule 13G filed on 3/14/14.  This means that Davis' 3/14/14 Schedule 13G reported his holdings after the transactions on 2/18/14 and 2/19/14 rather than his holdings as of the prior year-end on 12/31/13.


Thus, in the case of this one filing, we see that (i) Davis filed on the wrong form (Schedule 13G rather than the required Schedule 13D); (ii) Davis filed his Schedule 13G a month late; and (iii) Davis misstated his holdings as of the date required for the filing and (iv) Davis misstated his holdings as of the date he claimed within his filing.  Meridian does not believe Davis' compounding of errors was accidental or that such compounding of errors by a public company's chairman of the board, who is also the company's largest shareholder, can be considered immaterial.


Fourth, Davis failed to make the required Form 4 filings when he transferred shares to RSF in 2010 and 2011.  Davis did make the required Form 4 filings with respect to his open-market purchases of Cyanotech shares during those years.  This "one-sided" reporting, with respect to acquisitions, but not all transfers out, provides linkage to the next topic relating to Davis' SEC reporting practices.


Parking


In its May 6 letter, Meridian observed that Davis' Schedule 13G filings show two seemingly related patterns.  First, Davis regularly shifted and moved his Cyanotech shares among numerous entities.  Second, he never allowed his reported holdings to go above 20%.  The additional disclosure by Davis and Cyanotech confirmed another pattern, which is Davis repeatedly donated shares to RSF when such gifts were necessary to keep his direct holdings below the 20% threshold.


Starting around August 2010 and ending around March 2011, Davis executed a series of open-market purchases in which he accumulated more than 300,000 shares of Cyanotech stock.  Davis' first gift of shares to RSF occurred in 2010 and therefore coincided with the beginning of Davis' buying activity.  The next known gift occurred in February 2011 and therefore coincided with the end of Davis' buying activity.  Davis' last known gift to RSF of 30,769 shares on February 18, 2014 made it possible for Davis to report on his subsequent Schedule 13G that he had kept his ownership below the 20% threshold.


Davis' Form 4 filing on February 20, 2014 is very interesting as it shows in a single filing, both a transaction (buying 50,000 shares) that would have taken his ownership above 20%, coinciding with a gift to RSF (30,769 shares) that reduced his holdings sufficiently for Davis to remain below the 20% threshold.  The February 18, 2014 gift of 30,769 shares came just one day prior to Davis' February 19, 2014 open market purchase of 50,000 shares.  According to the trading data available on nasdaq.com, Cyanotech's average trading volume for the ten trading days prior to Davis' February 19, 2014 purchase was only 4,002 shares.  This suggests Davis knew of an opportunity to make a large purchase and delayed that transaction until after he had reduced his holdings sufficiently (via the gift of 30,769 shares to RSF) to allow for the purchase without going above the 20% threshold.


Nasdaq rules define "parking" as the "Illegal holding of stock by a third party, or the financing of such a stock, in which the third party's sole reason for holding the stock is to conceal ownership or control."


Davis did not just transfer shares to RSF when necessary to keep his direct holdings below the 20% threshold, he also financed RSF purchases.  The recent filings confirm Meridian's allegations concerning Davis' involvement with RSF's acquisition of a 9.7% block of stock from VitaeLab.  Davis acknowledged in his Schedule 13D that when he learned of the existence of the 9.7% block, he took that information to RSF.  Davis also disclosed that "[i]n or about the same time" he provided RSF with the funds RSF used to acquire the 9.7% block.


Davis has for years been causing RSF to accumulate shares in Cyanotech while at the same time he has entered into agreements with RSF by which he retains an interest in those shares.  Cyanotech's 10-Q reports that, "the shares of Company Common Stock owned by RSF are held by RSF in an endowment fund for the benefit of Ginungagap Foundation, a non-profit corporation" and "Mr. Davis serves as the president of Ginungagap."







The recent SEC filings by Cyanotech and Davis confirm the following:






·


All of the shares held by RSF are directly traceable to Skywords, a Davis-controlled entity, either as gifts of shares or gifts of cash used by buy shares in a transaction instigated by Davis.








·


The timing of the Davis gifts corresponds with Davis' need to manage his direct holdings to maintain an ownership level below 20%.








·


RSF holds and serves as the reporting entity for all of the shares it acquired via Davis' actions, but did not spend any of its own capital on the shares and does not hold the shares for its own benefit, but rather for the benefit of Ginungagap.








·


Ginungagap, like Skywords, is a Davis-controlled entity.






Undisclosed "Group"


According to the SEC, a "group" is formed "[w]hen two or more persons agree to act together for the purpose of acquiring, holding, voting or disposing of equity securities" of a public company.  When a "group" is present, the "group" must report its combined holdings on the applicable schedule.


Here is what Cyanotech and Davis have disclosed about Davis' relationship with RSF:






·


Agreement relating to the holding of securities:  From Cyanotech's Form 10-Q: "the shares of Company Common Stock owned by RSF are held by RSF in an endowment fund for the benefit of Ginungagap Foundation, a non-profit corporation" and "Mr. Davis serves as the president of Ginungagap."  "The terms of the written agreement between Ginungagap and RSF regarding the endowment permit Ginungagap to make non-binding recommendations to RSF with regards to the investment of the endowment fund".








·


Agreement relating to the acquisition of securities:  From Davis' Schedule 13D: "In 2011, Davis learned that a significant Cyanotech customer and shareholder wished to sell its shares of Common Stock (approximately 9% of the Issuer). He put the shareholder in touch with RSF. In or about the same time, Skywords donated approximately $2.5 million to RSF with the understanding that RSF may use some or all of the funds to attempt to purchase shares of Common Stock."

Agreement relating to the disposal of securities: From Davis' 13D: "The terms of the [agreement] permit Ginungagap to make non-binding recommendations to RSF with regards to the investment of the [endowment] and to request grants from that fund to Ginungagap".






The special committee's summary report on Form 8-K acknowledged the presence of group elements: "The Special Committee notes that certain of the facts relating to the relationship between Mr. Davis and RSF could be consistent with the existence a "group" and the Special Committee "has therefore recommended that Mr. Davis consider whether or not a "group" exists and, in any case, that Mr. Davis include additional disclosures in his filings under the Exchange Act regarding the relationship between Mr. Davis and RSF"


In his subsequent Schedule 13D filing, Davis and his related entities "expressly disclaim that a "group" within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Act exists between any of [Davis and such entities] and RSF."  This claim by Davis appears inconsistent with the other recent disclosures made by Davis and Cyanotech (cited above), and with the following:
 




·


RSF has never acted with respect to the acquisition or holding of Cyanotech stock without the instigation and direct involvement of Davis.








·


RSF has never expended any of its own capital to acquire shares of Cyanotech; every share held by RSF was originally acquired or paid for by Davis.








·


Other than the $2.5 million provided by Davis that was used by RSF to acquire the 9.7% block, there is no record that Davis has made cash donations to RSF.








·


Other than with respect to Cyanotech, RSF has never held more than a 5% equity interest in any public company.








·


The transaction in which RSF acquired the 9.7% block – an international, privately-negotiated block trade of nearly 10% of a public company – is unusual for a non-profit and involved not a random company, but a company in which Michael Davis was already the largest shareholder, with such transaction resulting in RSF becoming the company's second largest shareholder.  Around the same time Davis and RSF collaborated on the purchase of the 9.7% block, Davis became chairman of the board of Cyanotech.








·


All of RSF's shares are the result of gifts from Davis' Skywords Foundation.  All the shares held by RSF are held for the benefit of Ginungagap.  Michael Davis is the president of both Skywords and Ginungagap and both Skywords and Ginungagap share office space with Michael Davis in Tiburon, California.













Meridian is always interested in hearing from fellow stockholders and has created a special email address to help Cyanotech stockholders contact us.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS


This filing contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the federal securities laws. All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this report, including statements regarding Meridian's beliefs about Cyanotech's prospects, product market position, future revenues and future stock price, are forward-looking statements. In many cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as "may," "will," "should," "expect," "plan," "anticipate," "could," "intend," "target," "project," "contemplate," "believe," "estimate," "predict," "potential" or "continue" or other similar words.


These forward-looking statements are only predictions. These statements relate to future events and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that may cause Cyanotech's actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to materially differ from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially due to action or inaction by Cyanotech's board of directors and management, Cyanotech's inability to overcome its production problems and other risks, some of which may be unknown.  Because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as guarantees of future events.

Item 4.  Purpose of Transaction.
The Meridian Entities have purchased the Shares for investment purposes.  The Meridian Entities have changed their filing status from that of a Schedule 13G filer to that of a Schedule 13D filer due to their changed perspective with respect to the need for new directors and stockholder participation in the Company's governance process.


Cyanotech is a small public company with great products, leading brands, and a stable and profitable operating business.  On top of this, Meridian believes the Company has tremendous growth and value-creation potential in its emerging astaxanthin product line.  Meridian is confident that many followers of the Company believe, as it does, that Cyanotech has the ability to deliver truly exceptional returns to its stockholders.  Yet, the Company has of late been pursuing actions that are both inexplicable and unexplained.


About Meridian


Meridian is an investment firm specializing in small public companies.  Over the past 14 years, Meridian's principals have made material investments in more than 30 such businesses.  Our model involves taking large stakes in companies we believe to be significantly undervalued by the market.  We believe such discounts are created by a variety of inefficiencies common among small cap public companies.  One of the most frequently cited of these inefficiencies is the general absence of analyst coverage.  We believe the lack of analyst coverage creates opportunities for firms such as Meridian that are able to do their own primary research.


In the case of Cyanotech, that primary research has been extensive as we began not knowing much about growing algae or harvesting astaxanthin.  In this investment, Meridian also had to overcome the challenges associated with Cyanotech's practice of conducting no out-bound investor relations – the Company conducts no earnings calls, participates in no investor conferences, does no investor road shows and, as far as we know, hasn't even produced a corporate PowerPoint.


As it does with all of its investments, Meridian has made periodic company site visits over the last two years in order to see first-hand the operations of the business and to personally meet with key personnel. In these meetings, we have always come away very impressed by the knowledge and passion of the Company's employees, and this has contributed to Meridian's optimism about Cyanotech and its prospects.


About Cyanotech


Cyanotech was formed in 1983 and has been public since 1991.  For much of its history, Cyanotech focused on growing its algae products, selling them in bulk form to third parties that pursued various commercial uses.  The Company regularly did $10 to $15 million per year in sales, managing its business more often than not to deliver a small profit.  This situation has changed over recent years as the Company has experienced periods of significant growth as it has introduced and developed its new astaxanthin product line.  This growth has been largely the result of a shift from bulk to retail sales.  Cyanotech currently has the leading retail brand in astaxanthin with 58% market share in the natural foods channel, top ranking on leading consumer websites including Amazon, a category partnership with Costco, and it has recently established a first-mover advantage in China.  This recent retail and brand success was developed under the leadership of a team of managers hired into the Company in 2011.  The team, led by CEO Brent Bailey, had previously worked together at Nature Made, leading that business to becoming the top-selling vitamin and supplements brand in the United States.







Meridian acquired its shares over the last two years based upon the prospects of the business plan being pursued by Cyanotech' management team starting in 2011.  That plan is understood to be similar to the business plan pursued by the Company's management team while building the Nature Made brand.  When, during the first half of calendar year 2015, this business model appeared to be working (as evidenced by rising production, sales and margins), the market responded, lifting the Company's stock price to levels above $10.  When, beginning in the second half of calendar year 2015, this model appeared to be stymied (as evidenced by stalled sales and disclosure of persistent production difficulties), the stock quickly declined, hitting a multi-year intraday low of $3.60 on February 11, 2016.


While obviously disappointed by the setbacks experienced by Cyanotech while it pursued its business plan, Meridian has remained confident that Cyanotech would solve its production problems and capitalize on the significant opportunities its market development efforts have created.  The production difficulties are clearly not insurmountable.  It is well-known that Cyanotech's practice of growing astaxanthin in open ponds is extremely difficult – indeed, Cyanotech is the world's only major producer of astaxanthin that utilizes this production technique.  Other major producers use enclosed systems that protect the algae from environmental factors.  Such enclosed systems are not novel to astaxanthin, web research turns up countless examples of algae farming systems utilizing bioreactors and glass tubes.  From Meridian's perspective, only time is necessary for the Company to overcome its production difficulties allowing product supply to rise to meeting the expanding market demand for Cyanotech's astaxanthin.


This very favorable situation potentially changed dramatically on April 4, 2016 when it was announced that Cyanotech's CEO had resigned and was no longer with the Company.  Given disclosure the same day of a rich severance agreement (likely more than $1 million in incremental costs will be charged to the Company in 4Q FY2016), there can be little doubt that the CEO did not leave voluntarily.


But, why would Cyanotech fire a CEO with great experience running a supplements business, particularly given that CEO's obvious success in developing awareness and demand for the Company's products?  Cyanotech is experiencing challenges, but it is clear even to outside stockholders that those problems are on the production side, not the sales side of the business.  But for the production issues, the Company would be enjoying significantly higher sales and (most likely) a much higher stock price.  Was the CEO held accountable for the production problems in Hawaii?  Alternatively, was he held accountable for the litigation, infrastructure, and sales and marketing costs that have reduced the Company's profitability during the recent periods that have lacked growth?


It cannot logically be that the Company's Board of Directors forced the CEO's resignation due to their dissatisfaction with the Company's efforts to correct the production problems.  This is because (i) the former CEO was hired for his sales and marketing abilities on the mainland, not his expertise in growing algae in Hawaii and (ii) the person the Board put in to replace the CEO (in an interim capacity) is the Company's long-term designated expert in growing algae in Hawaii.  It is almost certain that the interim CEO has far more direct accountability for the Company's production problems than does the recently departed CEO.  Thus the production problems cannot be the grounds on which the former CEO was forced to resign.


The rising costs then?  Yes, but those rising costs would have been more than offset by the rising sales the Company would have experienced but for the production problems.  The business plan is perfectly sound – all that is necessary is for Cyanotech (and its stockholders) to persevere until the production problems are resolved.  That, at least is Meridian's view.


Cyanotech's board of directors apparently has a completely different view, and they have taken action.  Not to address the production issues, but rather to address (and Meridian fears) alter the business plan.  The former CEO was hired to repeat the success he had with Nature Made and, in pursuing that business plan, he has had tremendous success.  The market's strong awareness and demand for the Company's products appears to far outstrip the Company's ability to produce those products.  Except for the unexpected (and hopefully temporary) production issues, the business model Cyanotech has been pursuing for the last several years has been a success.  Unless Meridian is wrong in believing the production issue will be resolved, the only business explanation for the CEO's ouster is the Board's decision to alter or abandon the CEO's business plan.


Characteristically, Cyanotech's stockholders have been left in the dark.  Why is the Company having so much trouble resolving the production issues?  What solutions are being pursued?  When will the solutions be implemented allowing the Company to resume growth?  Why was the CEO forced to resign?  Does the change in personnel mean a change in the business plan?







Having invested so much time and effort into understanding Cyanotech's business and the potential for its astaxanthin products, and having made a substantial investment in the Company based upon the prospects of its business plan under the leadership of proven executives, Meridian is not comfortable with recent developments.  Maybe the Board's decisions and actions were well-founded, but given the Company's unusual communication policies, we do not know nor can we expect to ever be properly informed.


Clearly Meridian is not alone with its questions and concerns.  Since the news of the CEO's departure, Cyanotech's stock price has fallen and the trading volume has plummeted.  Indicative of how uncertain those outside the Company are about its future, Valensa's CEO has taken over the Yahoo Message board apparently believing Cyanotech to now be so bereft of leadership that it is possible for him to influence the Company's future direction via his posts.  This confusion and investor uncertainty is unacceptable for a public company.


Why Is Meridian Invested in Cyanotech?


Meridian only invests in companies that it believes are significantly undervalued.  Generally, one is much more likely to find significantly undervalued companies amid small and microcap names and therefore it is in this space that Meridian exclusively invests.  The benefits of investing in quality microcaps is well-known, as it is easy to find articles and data showing that microcaps deliver higher long-term performance than any other public equity class.


The rationale for Meridian's investment in Cyanotech is very straight-forward.  Astaxanthin is a new supplement category.  It is a natural and highly-effective antioxidant and anti-inflammatory with benefits that Meridian believes will attract consumers from across the retail spectrum, from serious athletes seeking help in recovering from extreme physical exertions to seniors looking for relief from chronic inflammation related to arthritis.  Awareness and demand for astaxanthin exploded in 2012 prompting a world-wide rush of companies seeking to increase supply and win market share.  Cyanotech won the contest for market share – almost certainly due to its good fortune of having recently put in place a management team experienced in retail supplements and new product introductions.  Meridian believes Cyanotech's BioAstin Hawaiian Astaxanthin® brand has the potential to be the category-identifying brand (e.g., like Kleenex® is to facial tissue and Xerox® is to copy machines).


As awareness and demand for astaxanthin grows, Cyanotech's astaxanthin products are well-positioned to retain their current outsized market share allocation.  The Company's strong and friendly relationship with Costco is extremely relevant in this regard.  Costco is a single channel partner through whom Cyanotech can efficiently drive market awareness and brand-identification within a highly-favorable demographic group.  Costco is an enormous distributor of consumer supplements and a very strong and trusted brand in its own right.  For many Costco shoppers, learning that Costco sells something, is reason enough to considering buying that something.


Cyanotech announced the launch of its lead astaxanthin product in 15 mainland Costco locations in September 2014.  Within months, that test market was obviously considered a success and additional stores were being added.  Today, Cyanotech's astaxanthin is sold in approximately 100 of Costco's more than 400 warehouse locations.  Costco was already Cyanotech's largest customer as of March 31, 2015, adding 300 additional locations has the potential to not just increase, but significantly increase Cyanotech's revenues.


Meridian's valuation models for Cyanotech are based upon the Company's anticipated future cash flows.  Because Meridian sees Cyanotech's business as likely benefiting from substantial operating leverage as the Company grows, we believe the Company should experience strong and rising cash flows and a significantly higher stock price.  Even when modeling scenarios with results that Meridian would view as disappointing we see Cyanotech's business being worth at least $20 per share in the near future.


Meridian's first purchase of Cyanotech shares occurred on June 6, 2014 at $4.50 per share.  At that time, the Company was spending heavily defending itself against a patent infringement claim filed by Valensa.  Meridian did substantial diligence on the litigation, independently obtaining and reviewing hundreds of court filings.  We concluded that the action against Cyanotech was without merit and that even were Cyanotech to lose the litigation, the resulting judgment was unlikely to be material.  Believing market concern over the litigation likely presented a buying opportunity, Meridian acquired approximately 180,000 shares (27% of its current position) below $5.00 per share during the period ending in early November 2014.


The next period of Cyanotech's stock history began following the Company's release of 2Q FY2015 results on November 10, 2014.  The stock surged on news of significant growth, driven by a 47% increase in its retail products business.  Meridian was so impressed by this surprise performance, that it purchased more than 65,000 shares the day after the news broke, at prices above $6.00 per share.  Over the next six months, Cyanotech stock steadily rose reaching a peak price above $10.00 per share in late June 2015.  During this period, Meridian acquired an additional 225,000 shares at an average price of $6.87.  This included thousands of shares purchased at prices as high as $9.86 in June 2015.  Such purchases appeared to make sense at the time given the Company's very strong growth and increasing gross margin (Cyanotech reported gross margin of 49% during its 3Q FY2015 vs 42% reported for its 3Q FY2014).  In addition, the patent litigation had been resolved in Cyanotech's favor.







The first trigger for the significant stock price decline that would follow was Cyanotech's press release on June 29, 2015 reporting that there would be a delay in the planned filing of its fiscal year end financial statements.  There being no disclosure of the reason for this delay, the market reacted negatively, falling from above $10.00 to around $8.00 over the next two weeks.  The stock fell further, to $6.00 per share following Cyanotech's release of its year end results and then drifted lower, to around $5.00 over the subsequent months.  During this period, Meridian acquired slightly less than 40,000 shares at progressively lower prices.  These purchases brought Meridian's stake in the Company to just under 10%.


When Cyanotech reported results for 3Q FY 2016 before the market open on February 11, 2016, the Company's stock price collapsed.  The overall market also opened down, with the Dow Jones off by more than 300 points.  Meridian's premarket orders at prices above $4.00 where quickly executed and despite new orders and heavy buying by Meridian, Cyanotech's stock price continued to fall, eventually reaching a 5-year intraday low of $3.60.  Meridian ended up buying almost 85,000 shares on that day and the next, with most shares purchased below $4.00.  These purchases took the Meridian group above a 10% position in the Company necessitating that Meridian group begin reporting all of its subsequent transaction on SEC Form 4 (such filings are required within 2 business days of any transactions executed by a holder or group with a greater than 10% position).


After pausing for several days to make its required filings and to evaluate whether it should continue purchasing Cyanotech shares, Meridian resumed its buying on February 17, 2016, picking up 1400 shares.  About a week later, Meridian purchased another 300 shares.  Over the next week, Meridian purchased an additional 5000 shares.  At this point, it was Meridian's intent to gradually add to its position in Cyanotech, with small purchases continuing until such time as the stock was trading at prices above Meridian's average purchase price (this is known as an "averaging down" buying strategy; Meridian's average cost per share is currently $5.53).


We believed it wise to continue our averaging down buying due to Meridian's continued belief that Cyanotech's business plan would eventually get back on track delivering value that would eventually cause the stock to trade for $20 or more per share.  Over the course of its entire investment, Meridian had identified only four possible risks to its investment thesis:






1.


Astaxanthin proves to be nothing more than a consumer fad destined to rise and then fall as consumers move on to the next "hot" supplement.  Extensive research into the efficacy of astaxanthin, including frequent reference to the National Institutes of Health's US National Library of Medicine, available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/, and the nearly 1400 articles published there, some of which date all the way back to 1948, convinced Meridian that astaxanthin is not destined to be a consumer fad.










2.


Meridian's analysis of the patent litigation in 2014 could have proven to be wrong.  It was not; the litigation was settled in Cyanotech's favor.










3.


Cyanotech might never succeed in increasing its astaxanthin production.  Meridian's answer to this risk has always been that while growing the algae that produces astaxanthin is difficult, forcing every other large grower in the world to use bioreactor systems, those other growers have proven that bioreactors work.  If Cyanotech could not find ways to increase and improve production in its open ponds, it could shift to a bioreactor or hybrid growing process.  Cyanotech has stated within its press releases that it is actively pursuing such production changes.










4.


Cyanotech might take so long to execute on its production changes that it could lose its market leadership position due to its inability to supply the astaxanthin demanded by its potential customers.  For example, a new supplier of astaxanthin has recently been added to Costco's website.  Meridian does not know if this new supplier was brought on board due to Cyanotech's supply shortage, but it is clearly a signal from Costco that it can, and will, look beyond Cyanotech within this product category.  Concerned that Cyanotech's production changes might be delayed due to a lack of currently-available funds to finance them, Meridian has three times offered to help the Company by providing the necessary funds in whatever structure would work best for the Company – equity, debt or joint venture.  Each time Meridian was told that Cyanotech's Board of Directors was considering Meridian's offer.











The Current Situation at Cyanotech


The risk that Meridian did not identify was the possibility that Cyanotech would abandon or put at risk the business plan being executed by Brent Bailey and his team.  But as explained above, this is the only explanation Meridian can now rationalize for the April 4, 2016 forced resignation of Mr. Bailey.


Cyanotech's outside stockholders currently have no idea what is going on inside the Company.  The result has been market paralysis.  Since April 4, 2016, the day the CEO was forced to resign, Cyanotech has averaged barely 2000 shares per day – at a $5.00 share valuation, that's only $10,000 per day.


The recent action by Cyanotech's Board of Directors, and the decision to provide no explanation for the action, or to provide any guidance as to the future direction of the Company, has effectively stripped all of the Company's shareholders of investment liquidity.  Cyanotech is suddenly without the principal benefit of a public listing.  There is no reason to believe Cyanotech's Board of Directors has any plan to address this problem given that it is a Company that appears to have a steadfast policy of conducting no out-bound investor relations.


Meridian is a specialist investor in small public companies and has a long and successful history of working with management and boards of directors struggling in managing their public company status.  We believe Cyanotech needs help and that we can provide that help.  Meridian also believes that Cyanotech's Board of Directors would receive substantial benefit from adding to its ranks the perspective of an outside investor that has carefully followed the Company's ups and downs over recent years.  Among the changes Meridian would promote to the Company's Board of Directors is a much more open communication policy that anticipates the needs of market participants in understanding and evaluating the Company's business.


Prior to making this filing, Meridian communicated with Cyanotech's Board of Directors and expressed its interest in having one or more of its well-qualified representatives join Cyanotech's Board.  Meridian reserves the right to take additional actions should Cyanotech's Board react unfavorably to Meridian's request.  Given its investment in Cyanotech and Meridian's strong belief in the future potential of the Company Meridian does not believe it can stand by and watch should the Company appear to be turning away from all the work done in recent years to create the growth opportunities now before Cyanotech and its stockholders.


Meridian is always interested in hearing from fellow stockholders and has created a special email address to help Cyanotech stockholders contact us.

On May 24, 2016, Meridian filed a shareholder derivative action on behalf of Cyanotech's stockholders against the Company, its Chairman of the board of directors and the Rudolf Steiner Foundation ("RSF").  The civil complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada, seeks Declaratory and Injunctive Relief under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Nevada Control Share Statute due to the undisclosed group created by the Chairman and RSF, and that group's ability to control Cyanotech.  Meridian also claims that the misrepresentations or omissions of material facts by the Chairman caused Cyanotech to violate Section 10(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  Finally, Meridian claims that the Chairman's actions breached his fiduciary duties as a member of the board of directors of Cyanotech.  A copy of Meridian's complaint may be obtained at the following address: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8MjSICzQPrKaEZrTEtHdXQtQUU.  Meridian brought its claims in Federal court after Cyanotech's board of directors failed to take action with respect to numerous securities disclosure and corporate governance deficiencies detailed by Meridian in a letter to the board of directors.  On May 6, 2016, Meridian delivered the letter to Cyanotech's interim CEO, who is also a board member, and encouraged him to first share the letter with the chairman of the Company's audit committee and then for these two directors to consider engaging legal counsel independent of Cyanotech's Chairman to consider the contents of the letter and appropriate next steps.  Meridian believed the Company's audit committee chairman would be the person on the board with the most relevant experience and greatest ability to investigate the matters described in the letter.  Since delivering the May 6, 2016 letter, Meridian has received no indication that Cyanotech's board of directors has taken action to address the issues raised by the letter.  To the contrary, on May 23, 2016, the Company issued a press release reporting that the chairman of its audit committee had resigned from the board of directors on May 17, 2016.  One possible interpretation of this news is that the audit chairman attempted to take the appropriate actions in response to Meridian's May 6, 2016 letter, was blocked and therefore considered it impossible to continue to serve on Cyanotech's board of directors.  Meridian believes the audit chairman's resignation is further evidence of the inability of the Cyanotech board to function properly under the leadership of its current Chairman.  Once again, Meridian must emphasize that the four directors serving on Cyanotech's board with the Chairman, as they comprise a majority of the board, have the ability to exercise control over the Company.  Meridian continues to believe that the first step should involve these four directors engaging legal counsel that is independent of the Chairman.  Meridian believes that the newly appointed audit committee chairman, having prior experience as the CEO of one public company and the CFO of another, has the experience, the standing, and the ability to access independent outside legal counsel that could make him the catalyst to launching a reform process at Cyanotech.  Given the historical practices of Cyanotech's board, we cannot assume the new audit committee chairman accepted that position fully informed of the legal and governance issues that have been raised by Meridian.  Should the new audit committee chairman begin to address these concerns, he will have Meridian's support and gratitude.  Meridian is always interested in hearing from fellow stockholders and has created a special email address to help Cyanotech stockholders contact us.

Item 6.  Contracts, Arrangements, Understandings or Relationships with Respect to Securities of the Issuer. Pursuant to Rule 13d-1(k) promulgated under the Act, the Reporting Entities have entered into an agreement with respect to the joint filing of this statement, and any amendment or amendments hereto.  A copy of such agreement was filed as Exhibit A to the Schedule 13D filing of the Reporting entities on May 9, 2016. Item 7.  Material to Be Filed as Exhibits.  No change.

Item 1.  Security and Issuer.
This Schedule 13D relates to Common Stock (the "Shares") of InfuSystem Holdings, Inc. ("INFU" or the "Company") with its principal executive offices located at 31700 Research Park Drive Madison Heights, Michigan 48071.
Item 2.  Identity and Background.
This statement is filed on behalf of Meridian OHC Partners, LP, Meridian TSV II, LP, TSV Investment Partners, LLC, BlueLine Capital Partners II, LP, and BlueLine Partners, LLC (collectively, the "Reporting Entities").  TSV Investment Partners, LLC  is the sole general partner of Meridian OHC Partners, LP and Meridian TSV II, LP and BlueLine Partners, LLC is the sole general partner of BlueLine Capital Partners II, LP.  Scott Shuda is Managing Director of TSV Investment Partners, LLC and BlueLine Partners, LLC.  Mr. Shuda disclaims beneficial ownership for purposes of Rule 13d-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Act").  The address of TSV Investment Partners, LLC is 425 Weed Street New Canaan, CT 06840and the address of BlueLine Partners, LLC is 3480 Buskirk Avenue Suite 214, Pleasant Hill, CA 94523.  During the last five years, none of the Reporting Entities has been convicted in a criminal proceeding or been a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body.  Each of the Reporting Entities is a Delaware limited partnership or Delaware limited liability company.  Mr. Shuda is a U.S. citizen.
 Item 3.  Source or Amount of Funds or Other Consideration.
All of the funds used in making the purchase of the Shares described in Item 5 of this Schedule 13D came from the working capital of the Reporting Entities.
Item 4.  Purpose of Transaction.
The Reporting Entities have purchased the Shares for investment purposes.  The Reporting Entities have changed their filing status from that described by Schedule 13G to that described by Schedule 13D to reflect the fact that Mr. Shuda communicated to the Company on February 11, 2016 his interest in serving on the Board of Directors of the Company.  The Reporting Entities believe that the service of Mr. Shuda would benefit the Company and its shareholders, particularly in the area of examining and providing insights into the return on investment (ROI) of the Company's expenditures in areas such as operations infrastructure, pump inventory and IT systems. The Reporting Entities believe such insights would prove helpful in the context of future decisions concerning the best allocation of INFU's strong operating cash flows.
Item 5.  Interest in Securities of the Issuer.
As of the date of this Schedule 13D, each of the Reporting Entities may be deemed to own 2,451,972 shares of Common Stock (the "Shares").  The Shares represent approximately 10.9% of the shares of Common Stock outstanding based on 22,514,484 shares of the Company's Common Stock outstanding at November 5, 2015 as reported in the Company's Form 10-Q for the Company's fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2015 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 12, 2015.
The Reporting Entities are making this single, joint filing because they may be deemed to constitute a "group" within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Act.  Each Reporting Entity expressly disclaims beneficial ownership of any of the shares of Common Stock other than those reported herein as being owned by it.
As of the date of this Schedule 13D, Meridian OHC Partners, LP and TSV Investment Partners, LLC collectively have shared voting power with respect to 2,340,276 Shares; Meridian TSV II, LP TSV and Investment Partners, LLC collectively have shared voting power with respect to 14,028 Shares; and BlueLine Capital Partners II, LP and BlueLine Partners, LLC collectively have shared voting power with respect to 97,688 Shares.
The Reporting Entities have not effected any transactions involving the Shares during the past sixty days.  This Schedule 13D succeeds prior statements on Schedule G filed by the Reporting Entities.  To the knowledge of the Reporting Entities, none of the executive officers or directors of TSV I or BLGP I has engaged in any transaction in any shares of the Issuer's Common Stock during the sixty days immediately preceding the date hereof.
No person (other than the Reporting Entities) is known to have the right to receive or the power to direct the receipt of dividends from, or the proceeds from the sale of, the Shares that are the subject of this Schedule 13D.
Item 6.  Contracts, Arrangements, Understandings or Relationships with Respect to Securities of the Issuer.
Pursuant to Rule 13d-1(k) promulgated under the Act, the Reporting Entities have entered into an agreement with respect to the joint filing of this statement, and any amendment or amendments hereto, which is attached hereto as Exhibit A.
