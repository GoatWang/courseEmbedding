NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / July 18, 2017 / SeeThruEquity, a leading independent equity research and corporate access firm focused on small-cap and micro-cap public companies, today announced it has initiated coverage on PURE Bioscience, Inc. (OTCQB: PURE) with a 12-month price target of $2.45
The report is available here: PURE Initiation Report.
PURE is focused on developing and commercializing its proprietary silver dihydrogen citrate (SDC)-based antimicrobial products primarily in the food safety arena. SDC is non-toxic and offers superior efficacy in reducing pathogens when compared with other incumbent products. Persistent foodborne illness outbreaks and product recalls in recent times has resulted in stricter compliance norms, thereby providing huge tailwind for PURE. The new Food Safety Modernization Act, USDA's Salmonella Action Plan and increasing DoJ activity are likely to benefit PURE as companies seek superior food safety solutions to adhere to new standards. PURE's addressable opportunity is large (~$2.5 billion market) and the company is targeting to achieve ~10% market share over the long term (~$250 million revenues). We see PURE as a speculative play on the expanding food safety market, with superior product technology and an experienced management team. The company has made considerable progress over the last few years, with revenues growing ~72% YOY in 9M17. Going forward in FY18, we expect PURE to increase revenues approximately 403% YOY to $9.7 million aided by new customer acquisitions, commercialization of PURE Control®, and entry into new markets (poultry and produce processing).
Increased regulatory scrutiny to benefit PURE
With rules finalized under the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) in 2016, the FDA is stepping up compliance and enforcement efforts through increased inspections of manufacturers and processors, especially in the areas of preventive controls and environmental monitoring programs. In addition, the USDA, under its Salmonella Action Plan, has finalized new federal standards to reduce Salmonella and Campylobacter in poultry. To enforce compliance, the USDA is increasing the frequency and rigor of testing, and will be posting individual companies' food safety performance online. USDA currently estimates ~63% of plants to be out of compliance.
Moreover, the number of foodborne outbreaks and product recalls continue to persist, which negatively impacts the affected brand's value. All these challenges are pushing companies to seek superior food safety solutions, thereby providing tailwind to PURE's products.
Disruptive SDC technology with high entry barriers
PURE is commercializing patented SDC-based antimicrobial products (FDA/USDA approved PURE Control and EPA registered PURE® Hard Surface). SDC test data demonstrate proven superior efficacy over a broad spectrum of pathogens, including E. coli, Salmonella, Listeria, Campylobacter and Norovirus, when compared with other products currently in use in the food industry. PURE Hard Surface shows 90% improvement in pathogen reduction on surfaces vs. incumbent products. PURE enjoys extensive competitive barriers in the form of 12 US patents and the unique EPA, FDA and USDA approvals.
Large market size
Management is focused on commercializing SDC primarily for the food-safety-solutions industry which represents a $2.5 billion opportunity (combined for its 2 products). The company is targeting to achieve a market share of ~10% (or $250 million) driven by launch of PURE Control and accelerating sales of PURE Hard Surface Disinfectant. PURE Control has already received a first sales order in the US produce processing aids market ($300 million size), while revenue from the $350 million plus US poultry processing aids market is anticipated soon (F1Q/2Q18). Further, the company is targeting to begin commercialization of PURE Control for $400 million US beef and pork processing aids market by the end of calendar 2018. The sales pipeline for PURE Hard Surface remains robust with three additional national chains and more than 50 food processors evaluating the product for use.
Initiate coverage with 12-month price target of $2.45
We see PURE as a high risk and high reward play on the expanding food safety industry which has seen increased regulatory scrutiny over the last year amid foodborne related illness outbreaks. The target of $2.45 assumes successful commercialization of PURE Control and more traction for the existing products amid stricter compliance standards. Any delay in the launch of PURE Control could adversely impact our target price. Investors need to note the inherent risks involved.

Hank Lambert, CEO of PURE said, "We are very excited to partner with Roka in offering advanced science in both pathogen detection and elimination to the food industry. Our proven silver dihydrogen citrate based antimicrobial solutions have been adopted by Chipotle, Taylor Farms, Subway and numerous other food companies for effective pathogen reduction. Partnering with Roka will enable us to extend our solutions to their broad customer portfolio."
About PURE Bioscience, Inc. 
PURE Bioscience, Inc. (OTCQB: PURE) is focused on developing and commercializing our proprietary antimicrobial products primarily in the food safety arena -- providing solutions to the health and environmental challenges of pathogen and hygienic control. Our technology platform is based on patented stabilized ionic silver, and our initial products contain silver dihydrogen citrate, or SDC. SDC is a broad-spectrum, non-toxic antimicrobial agent, which offers 24-hour residual protection and formulates well with other compounds. As a platform technology, SDC is distinguished from existing products in the marketplace because of its superior efficacy, reduced toxicity and it mitigates bacterial resistance. PURE is headquartered in El Cajon, California (San Diego metropolitan area). Additional information on PURE is available at www.purebio.com.

PURE    Fight against Ebola?      http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-1179475   PURE Bioscience, Inc. (OTCQB: PURE) Has Joined Other Top Ebola Stock Movers  With the first recorded ebola death reaching U.S. soil, citizens are becoming more concerned about this deadly disease. As always, investors have looked for stock opportunities to arise from increased media attention. Several companies have seen excellent price action stemming from their health sector involvement and potential ebola treatment participation. Companies like Sanomedica International Hondings, Inc. (OTCQB: SIMH), Lakeland Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ: LAKE), Revolutions Medical Corp. (OTCPK: RMCP), and iBio, Inc. (NYSE: IBIO) have all seen powerful bullish price movement in recent days.  PURE's hard surface disinfectant and food contact surface sanitizer product kills bacteria in just 30 seconds. This is a powerful disinfectant, which can be used to kill pathogens like MRSA, fungi, and even some viruses like HIV, Norovirus, Influenza A, Avian Influenza, and H1N1. Updates on the effects of the disinfectant on the ebola virus have not yet been released. Investors are still waiting for this information. With the recent speculation in the bioscience industry, PURE has developed a great deal of attention from traders, seeing share prices surging as high as $1.20. Accumulation has surged on the speculation, and volume has reached record levels. Additionally, the company just released an update promising to reduce pathogens on leafy greens. The company has released exciting updates to shareholders, which is helping to catalyze this price action.   EPA-registered PURE™ Hard Surface disinfectant and food contact surface sanitizer provides an unparalleled combination of high efficacy and low toxicity with 30-second bacterial kill times and 24-hour residual protection. PURE Hard Surface completely kills resistant pathogens like MRSA and also effectively eliminates dangerous fungi and viruses including HIV, Norovirus, Influenza A, Avian Influenza and H1N1. PURE Hard Surface is registered for use on food contact surfaces and is gentle enough to be used in childcare environments.          PURE Bioscience PURE Bioscience (NASDAQ: PURE)   Corporate Overview PURE develops and markets technology-based bioscience products that provide non-toxic solutions to numerous global health challenges.

PURE Hard Surface is registered for use on food contact surfaces and is gentle enough to be used in sensitive children's areas.      Click here to see how SDC works   SDC: A Platform Technology          Why is SDC unique? Stability Traditional silver-based disinfectants have very short shelf lives - from hours to days. SDC is a stabilized silver ion complex with a shelf life of several years. The unique bond of the silver ion in SDC allows the silver ion to remain in solution while at the same time making it more bio-available for antimicrobial action. Mode of Action                SDC kills microorganisms by two modes of action: 1) the silver ion deactivates structural and metabolic membrane proteins leading to microbial death; 2) the microbes view SDC as a food source, allowing the silver ion to enter the microbe. Once inside the organism, the silver ion denatures the DNA, which halts the microbe's ability to replicate and leads to its death. This dual action makes SDC highly and quickly effective against a broad spectrum of microbes. Non Toxic SDC is non-toxic, non-caustic, colorless, odorless, tasteless and does not produce toxic fumes. While SDC is highly toxic to bacteria, fungus and virus it is non-toxic to humans and animals. Based on the EPA toxicity categorization of antimicrobial products that ranges from Category I (high toxicity) down to Category IV, at use dilutions, SDC is rated in the lowest toxicity category, IV, while traditional disinfectants fall into Categories I and II.    SDC-Based Hard Surface Disinfectant SDC is the basis for the EPA registered hard surface disinfectant, PURE Hard Surface. Twenty times faster than the leading disinfectants, PURE Hard Surface is the next generation of microbial control. Advantages of SDC include:  Powerful broad spectrum protection as a disinfectant, fungicide and virucide 	Kills germs in 30 seconds 	Provides residual protection for 24 hours 	Effective against resistant bacteria such as MRSA and VRE 	Lowest toxicity rating available 	Labeled for use in diverse environments including restaurants, homes, medical facilities, institutions, day care facilities and on children's toys and play areas  PURE Hard Surface Efficacy     SDC as an Additive or Active Ingredient PURE produces and markets varying strengths of SDC concentrate for use as an additive or active ingredient in other products. PURE pursues strategic development, licensing and distribution agreements with partner companies for the third party products containing SDC as an additive or active ingredient.

PURE has initially chosen to pursue approvals through the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) by partnering with third-party pharmaceutical development companies. Our partner companies assume responsibility for finding and managing the testing and regulatory process for potential FDA regulated SDC-based products. Current product development projects include dermatology, wound care and medical biofilm control products as well as several products for dental industry. An IND for a hand sanitizer is in process.
