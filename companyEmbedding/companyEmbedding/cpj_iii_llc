Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC

Our Story |


Our Team |


Let US Help|






It's a cruel world out there for the small business owner. And we can relate because we're entrepreneurs, just like you. We work with business owners throughout their companies' life cycles, helping them overcome the obstacles blocking effective compliance. And we provide the kind of thought leadership and guidance that will inspire and encourage their continued success, no matter the odds.
We got into this business because helping entrepreneurs is our passion. And we strongly believe in the power of private enterprise.





Wilmington, Delaware, in 1899, a young attorney named Christopher Ward had a big idea: create a firm that would make it easier for businesses to form corporations. Around the same time, another Delaware attorney named Josiah Marvel, had the very same idea.
After two decades in business, Ward and Marvel joined forces to create the first company solely dedicated to the business of being in business. At the time, it was called Corporation Service Company® (CSC®).
From Corporation Service Company to The Company Corporation® to incorporate.com, we may have changed our look but we still have more than a century's worth of experience in our business. To date, we've helped form more than 750,000 corporations or LLCs, and we've provided services to those companies that have improved their business compliance along every arduous step.





Simply put, we know what you're going through. Many of our team members ran their own companies before joining us. So when we say, "we've been there," we actually mean it. Our employees care for your orders as if they were their own, because, yeah, they've been there. And together, we've been there before more than 750,000 times.
We know that our success grows from your success, so we strive to fulfill your business needs with enthusiasm, speed, and absolute professionalism. We won't treat you like Joe Schmoe. We'll listen to you like a business partner.

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
