History[edit]
Founding[edit]
Ciber was founded in 1974 by three individuals, one of whom would remain with the company and guide its fortunes for its crucial first two decades. Of the three original founders of Ciber, Bobby G. Stevenson emerged as the key figure in Ciber's history, shaping a start-up computer consulting firm into a leading national force by the 1990s, when the computer consulting industry was generating more than $30 billion worth of business a year. A graduate of Texas Tech University, Stevenson spent the years between his formal education and the formation of Ciber working as a programmer analyst for International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) and LTV Steel in Houston. By the early 1970s, when Stevenson was in his early 30s, he and two other colleagues decided to make a go of it on their own and organized Ciber, an acronym for "consultants in business, engineering, and research."[3]
At the time, Stevenson and Ciber's other co-founders perceived a need in the corporate world for specialized, technical assistance in keeping pace with the technological advances in computer hardware and computer software. The trio saw an opportunity to provide contract computer consulting services to clients lacking either in the resources or the expertise to use the promising power of computers in their day-to-day operations. Through Ciber, the founders tapped into a market that would grow explosively in the decades ahead. Few realized at the time how important computers would become to the business world. As the use of computers increased and wave after wave of computer innovations swept away yesterday's technological vanguard, the need for sophisticated service firms like Ciber to implement the frequently indecipherable technology of tomorrow grew exponentially.[4]
Although Ciber entered the business of computer consulting services at a relatively early time, the company's physical and financial growth did not mirror the growth of its industry. Ciber grew at a modest pace initially, then embraced a new business strategy during the mid-1980s that ignited prolific growth. Stevenson watched over Ciber during both of the company's two eras, heading the company during its contrastingly slower period of growth and leading the charge during its decided rise during the 1990s.[5]
During Ciber's inaugural year of business, Stevenson served as the company's vice-president in charge of recruiting and managing the fledgling firm's technical staff, a post he would occupy until November 1977, when he was named Ciber's chief executive officer after the tragic accidental death of the CEO and Co-founder, Richard L. Ezinga. From late 1977 into the 1990s, Stevenson was responsible for all of Ciber's operations. At first, Stevenson and the two other co-founders targeted their consulting services exclusively to the automotive industry, establishing Ciber's first office in the hotbed of automotive production in the United States, Detroit, Michigan. Ciber did not remain wedded to the automotive industry for long, however. A few short years after its formation, Ciber began tailoring its services to the oil and gas industry as well, a move that occurred at roughly the same time as the company's geographic expansion. Two years after the company opened its doors in Detroit, an office in Phoenix was opened. A year later, in 1977, an office was established in Houston. A Denver office was opened in 1979, followed by the opening of a Dallas office in 1980 and an Atlanta office in 1987. The following year, Ciber relocated its corporate headquarters to Englewood, Colorado. While executive officers circulated throughout Ciber's Englewood facility, the company embarked on the most prolific growth period in its history to that point.[6]
1980s[edit]
A year after the move to Englewood and 15 years after its founding, Ciber competed in the burgeoning industry of computer consulting services as a minor player. Total sales in 1989 amounted to a mere $13 million, small change when compared with the revenue volume generated by the country's leading computer consulting firms. By this point, however, Ciber executives were plotting an era of dramatic growth for their company. During the mid-1980s, Stevenson and other Ciber executives adopted a new growth strategy that focused on the development of a new range of services and the realization of both physical and financial growth through the acquisition of established computer consulting firms. Although the strategy embraced during the mid-1980s would take half a decade to manifest itself in any meaningful way, once the strategy for the future began to take shape in tangible form, Ciber began its resolute rise to the upper echelon of its industry.[7]
By the end of 1989, when annual sales had slipped past the $10 million mark, the plans formulated midway through the decade moved from the drawing board to implementation. Ciber's expansion in 1990 included the opening of offices in Cleveland, Orlando, and Tampa, moves that were associated with the development of new clientele in the telecommunications industry. As Ciber focused its marketing efforts toward telecommunications providers during the early 1990s, securing contracts with industry giants such as AT&T, GTE, and U.S. West Communications, Inc., the company found itself occupying fertile ground in the computer consulting market. Not only were computers and their technology becoming increasingly sophisticated, progressing at a pace that demanded the help of experts such as Ciber's consultants, but the shifting dynamics of the corporate world also favored companies like Ciber.[8]
The early years of the 1990s were marked by a national economic recession that forced many of the country's corporations to alter their business strategies. As business declined and profit margins shrank, downsizing became the mantra of business leaders from coast to coast. Payroll was trimmed, entire departments were cut from corporate budgets, and, as a consequence, many companies found themselves lacking the resources and skills to perform certain tasks in-house, creating a greater need for the specialized services offered by Ciber. To meet this demand, Ciber contracted out specialists to help the nation's largest corporations complete computer projects and cope with hardware and software problems as they arose. Ciber consultants wrote and maintained software that performed a host of chores, including inventory control, accounts payable, and customer support.[9]
Although the conditions were ripe for rapid growth as the 1990s began, Ciber's stature at the start of the decade prohibited it to a certain degree from capturing a sizable share of the computer consulting market. The company was too small to realize the growth potential that surrounded it. Mac J. Slingerlend, who joined the company in 1989 as executive vice-president and chief financial officer before being named president and chief operating officer in 1996, reflected on Ciber's diminutive size years after the company had grown into a genuine national contender, noting, "We wanted to be a survivor. We were the smallest national player, and we needed to get larger quickly."[10]
1990s[edit]
Getting larger quickly ranked as Ciber's chief objective during the first half of the 1990s, engendering a period of growth that lifted the company's revenue volume from the $13 million recorded when Slingerlend joined the company to more than $150 million by the time he was promoted to the twin posts of president and chief operating officer. Growth was achieved largely by purchasing established computer consulting firms, as Ciber embarked on an acquisition program that ranked it as the most active computer consulting acquirer in the nation during the first half of the 1990s. More than a dozen acquisitions were completed in six years' time, adding more than $70 million to the company's revenue base and greatly increasing the Colorado-based firm's national presence. Equally as important as the growth achieved through acquisition was the added expertise Ciber gained by swallowing up established computer consulting firms. During the 1990s, the push was on to grow larger quickly and to gain personnel that would enable Ciber to tackle more complex projects. Instead of just writing programs tailored to the specifications of its clients, Ciber executives were endeavoring to create a consulting firm that could identify problems and provide solutions, a transformation that would propel the company into the market for higher-margin services.[11]
The majority of the acquisitions that helped Ciber expand its services and broaden its national presence were completed after the company's initial public offering of stock in March 1994. Once the company converted to public ownership (Stevenson retained control of more than 50 percent of the company's shares), acquisitions followed in steady succession. In June 1994, Ciber acquired all of the business operations of $16-million-in-sales C.P.U., Inc. for approximately $10 million. Based in Rochester, New York, C.P.U. operated as a computer consulting firm employing 190 consultants in six branch offices and served clients such as Northern Telecom and Xerox Corporation. The C.P.U. acquisition was Ciber's fifth of the decade and by far the largest. In the coming two years, as expansion picked up pace, annual sales more than doubled, and the company's net income, inflated by the move into more complex, higher-margin services, nearly quadrupled.[12]
Following the C.P.U. acquisition, Ciber purchased Holmdel, New Jersey-based Interface Systems, Inc., a systems-consulting firm with 48 consultants and $5 million in annual revenue. Interface Systems was acquired in January 1995 and was followed by the May 1995 acquisition of Spencer & Spencer Systems, Inc., a 141-consultant, $13-million-in-sales computer programming provider with offices in St. Louis and Indianapolis. Next, in June 1995, Ciber reached across to the West Coast and acquired Concord, California-based Business Information Technology, Inc., a five-branch, 125-consultant computer consulting firm with $20 million in annual sales. A fourth acquisition was completed before the end of 1995 when Ciber purchased Broadway & Seymour, Inc., its Rochester, Minnesota office, and its 45 consultants. By the end of 1995, sales had increased from the $79.8 million generated in 1994 to more than $120 million, and company executives were set to launch Ciber's CIBR2000 division, a venture representative of the company's desire to provide more complex, higher-margin services.[13]
Introduced in December 1995, CIBR2000 service was designed as a solution to a potentially devastating problem with wide-ranging ramifications. Many software programs written between the 1960s and 1990s used a two-digit date format to record calendar dates, thereby rendering a host of computer calculations inaccurate after 11:59:59 p.m., December 31, 1999. Without the ability to recognize "00" as the beginning of the new century, computer programs that performed calculations related to inventory control, invoices, interest payments, pension payments, contract expirations, license and lease renewals, and myriad other tasks would generate false reports, create computer "bugs," and perhaps cause systemwide shutdowns, all under the presumption that "00" signified the year 1900. Ciber's CIBR2000 division was created to solve the dilemma posed by the century date change and represented an area of substantial growth potential for the company during the latter half of the 1990s.[14]
At the time CIBR2000 service was being introduced, Ciber employed roughly 1,800 consultants and operated 28 branch offices scattered throughout the country. More than half of the company's sales was derived from 20 clients, including industry stalwarts such as American Express Company, AT&T, Ford Motor Company, IBM, MCI Telecommunications, Mellon Bank, Monsanto Corp., U.S. West Communications, Inc., and Xerox Corporation.
On the acquisition front, 1996 proved to be a busy year, eclipsing the achievements of 1995. In March, the company acquired Columbus, Ohio-based OASYS, Inc., a provider of contract computer programming services that gave Ciber a new geographic location in Columbus supported by 20 information technology consultants. In May 1996, Ciber acquired Practical Business Solutions, Inc., an information technology company with offices in Boston and Providence, Rhode Island. Two months later, the company completed yet another acquisition, purchasing the Business Systems Development division of DataFocus, Inc., a computer consulting firm with offices in Fairfax, Virginia and Edison, New Jersey. Not stopping there, Ciber brought another company under its corporate umbrella in September, when it acquired Spectrum Technology Group, Inc., a management consulting firm based in Somerville, New Jersey that strengthened Ciber's management consulting and project management services.[15]

Ciber, Inc. is a global information technology consulting, services and outsourcing company with commercial clients.
The company was founded in Detroit, Michigan in 1974 by Bobby Stevenson and two additional partners. They called the company Consultants in Business Engineering Research (Ciber). In May 2017, HTC Global Services acquired Ciber.[1][2]

History[edit]
Founding[edit]
Ciber was founded in 1974 by three individuals, one of whom would remain with the company and guide its fortunes for its crucial first two decades. Of the three original founders of Ciber, Bobby G. Stevenson emerged as the key figure in Ciber's history, shaping a start-up computer consulting firm into a leading national force by the 1990s, when the computer consulting industry was generating more than $30 billion worth of business a year. A graduate of Texas Tech University, Stevenson spent the years between his formal education and the formation of Ciber working as a programmer analyst for International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) and LTV Steel in Houston. By the early 1970s, when Stevenson was in his early 30s, he and two other colleagues decided to make a go of it on their own and organized Ciber, an acronym for "consultants in business, engineering, and research."[3]
At the time, Stevenson and Ciber's other co-founders perceived a need in the corporate world for specialized, technical assistance in keeping pace with the technological advances in computer hardware and computer software. The trio saw an opportunity to provide contract computer consulting services to clients lacking either in the resources or the expertise to use the promising power of computers in their day-to-day operations. Through Ciber, the founders tapped into a market that would grow explosively in the decades ahead. Few realized at the time how important computers would become to the business world. As the use of computers increased and wave after wave of computer innovations swept away yesterday's technological vanguard, the need for sophisticated service firms like Ciber to implement the frequently indecipherable technology of tomorrow grew exponentially.[4]
Although Ciber entered the business of computer consulting services at a relatively early time, the company's physical and financial growth did not mirror the growth of its industry. Ciber grew at a modest pace initially, then embraced a new business strategy during the mid-1980s that ignited prolific growth. Stevenson watched over Ciber during both of the company's two eras, heading the company during its contrastingly slower period of growth and leading the charge during its decided rise during the 1990s.[5]
During Ciber's inaugural year of business, Stevenson served as the company's vice-president in charge of recruiting and managing the fledgling firm's technical staff, a post he would occupy until November 1977, when he was named Ciber's chief executive officer after the tragic accidental death of the CEO and Co-founder, Richard L. Ezinga. From late 1977 into the 1990s, Stevenson was responsible for all of Ciber's operations. At first, Stevenson and the two other co-founders targeted their consulting services exclusively to the automotive industry, establishing Ciber's first office in the hotbed of automotive production in the United States, Detroit, Michigan. Ciber did not remain wedded to the automotive industry for long, however. A few short years after its formation, Ciber began tailoring its services to the oil and gas industry as well, a move that occurred at roughly the same time as the company's geographic expansion. Two years after the company opened its doors in Detroit, an office in Phoenix was opened. A year later, in 1977, an office was established in Houston. A Denver office was opened in 1979, followed by the opening of a Dallas office in 1980 and an Atlanta office in 1987. The following year, Ciber relocated its corporate headquarters to Englewood, Colorado. While executive officers circulated throughout Ciber's Englewood facility, the company embarked on the most prolific growth period in its history to that point.[6]
1980s[edit]
A year after the move to Englewood and 15 years after its founding, Ciber competed in the burgeoning industry of computer consulting services as a minor player. Total sales in 1989 amounted to a mere $13 million, small change when compared with the revenue volume generated by the country's leading computer consulting firms. By this point, however, Ciber executives were plotting an era of dramatic growth for their company. During the mid-1980s, Stevenson and other Ciber executives adopted a new growth strategy that focused on the development of a new range of services and the realization of both physical and financial growth through the acquisition of established computer consulting firms. Although the strategy embraced during the mid-1980s would take half a decade to manifest itself in any meaningful way, once the strategy for the future began to take shape in tangible form, Ciber began its resolute rise to the upper echelon of its industry.[7]
By the end of 1989, when annual sales had slipped past the $10 million mark, the plans formulated midway through the decade moved from the drawing board to implementation. Ciber's expansion in 1990 included the opening of offices in Cleveland, Orlando, and Tampa, moves that were associated with the development of new clientele in the telecommunications industry. As Ciber focused its marketing efforts toward telecommunications providers during the early 1990s, securing contracts with industry giants such as AT&T, GTE, and U.S. West Communications, Inc., the company found itself occupying fertile ground in the computer consulting market. Not only were computers and their technology becoming increasingly sophisticated, progressing at a pace that demanded the help of experts such as Ciber's consultants, but the shifting dynamics of the corporate world also favored companies like Ciber.[8]
The early years of the 1990s were marked by a national economic recession that forced many of the country's corporations to alter their business strategies. As business declined and profit margins shrank, downsizing became the mantra of business leaders from coast to coast. Payroll was trimmed, entire departments were cut from corporate budgets, and, as a consequence, many companies found themselves lacking the resources and skills to perform certain tasks in-house, creating a greater need for the specialized services offered by Ciber. To meet this demand, Ciber contracted out specialists to help the nation's largest corporations complete computer projects and cope with hardware and software problems as they arose. Ciber consultants wrote and maintained software that performed a host of chores, including inventory control, accounts payable, and customer support.[9]
Although the conditions were ripe for rapid growth as the 1990s began, Ciber's stature at the start of the decade prohibited it to a certain degree from capturing a sizable share of the computer consulting market. The company was too small to realize the growth potential that surrounded it. Mac J. Slingerlend, who joined the company in 1989 as executive vice-president and chief financial officer before being named president and chief operating officer in 1996, reflected on Ciber's diminutive size years after the company had grown into a genuine national contender, noting, "We wanted to be a survivor. We were the smallest national player, and we needed to get larger quickly."[10]
1990s[edit]
Getting larger quickly ranked as Ciber's chief objective during the first half of the 1990s, engendering a period of growth that lifted the company's revenue volume from the $13 million recorded when Slingerlend joined the company to more than $150 million by the time he was promoted to the twin posts of president and chief operating officer. Growth was achieved largely by purchasing established computer consulting firms, as Ciber embarked on an acquisition program that ranked it as the most active computer consulting acquirer in the nation during the first half of the 1990s. More than a dozen acquisitions were completed in six years' time, adding more than $70 million to the company's revenue base and greatly increasing the Colorado-based firm's national presence. Equally as important as the growth achieved through acquisition was the added expertise Ciber gained by swallowing up established computer consulting firms. During the 1990s, the push was on to grow larger quickly and to gain personnel that would enable Ciber to tackle more complex projects. Instead of just writing programs tailored to the specifications of its clients, Ciber executives were endeavoring to create a consulting firm that could identify problems and provide solutions, a transformation that would propel the company into the market for higher-margin services.[11]
The majority of the acquisitions that helped Ciber expand its services and broaden its national presence were completed after the company's initial public offering of stock in March 1994. Once the company converted to public ownership (Stevenson retained control of more than 50 percent of the company's shares), acquisitions followed in steady succession. In June 1994, Ciber acquired all of the business operations of $16-million-in-sales C.P.U., Inc. for approximately $10 million. Based in Rochester, New York, C.P.U. operated as a computer consulting firm employing 190 consultants in six branch offices and served clients such as Northern Telecom and Xerox Corporation. The C.P.U. acquisition was Ciber's fifth of the decade and by far the largest. In the coming two years, as expansion picked up pace, annual sales more than doubled, and the company's net income, inflated by the move into more complex, higher-margin services, nearly quadrupled.[12]
Following the C.P.U. acquisition, Ciber purchased Holmdel, New Jersey-based Interface Systems, Inc., a systems-consulting firm with 48 consultants and $5 million in annual revenue. Interface Systems was acquired in January 1995 and was followed by the May 1995 acquisition of Spencer & Spencer Systems, Inc., a 141-consultant, $13-million-in-sales computer programming provider with offices in St. Louis and Indianapolis. Next, in June 1995, Ciber reached across to the West Coast and acquired Concord, California-based Business Information Technology, Inc., a five-branch, 125-consultant computer consulting firm with $20 million in annual sales. A fourth acquisition was completed before the end of 1995 when Ciber purchased Broadway & Seymour, Inc., its Rochester, Minnesota office, and its 45 consultants. By the end of 1995, sales had increased from the $79.8 million generated in 1994 to more than $120 million, and company executives were set to launch Ciber's CIBR2000 division, a venture representative of the company's desire to provide more complex, higher-margin services.[13]
Introduced in December 1995, CIBR2000 service was designed as a solution to a potentially devastating problem with wide-ranging ramifications. Many software programs written between the 1960s and 1990s used a two-digit date format to record calendar dates, thereby rendering a host of computer calculations inaccurate after 11:59:59 p.m., December 31, 1999. Without the ability to recognize "00" as the beginning of the new century, computer programs that performed calculations related to inventory control, invoices, interest payments, pension payments, contract expirations, license and lease renewals, and myriad other tasks would generate false reports, create computer "bugs," and perhaps cause systemwide shutdowns, all under the presumption that "00" signified the year 1900. Ciber's CIBR2000 division was created to solve the dilemma posed by the century date change and represented an area of substantial growth potential for the company during the latter half of the 1990s.[14]
At the time CIBR2000 service was being introduced, Ciber employed roughly 1,800 consultants and operated 28 branch offices scattered throughout the country. More than half of the company's sales was derived from 20 clients, including industry stalwarts such as American Express Company, AT&T, Ford Motor Company, IBM, MCI Telecommunications, Mellon Bank, Monsanto Corp., U.S. West Communications, Inc., and Xerox Corporation.
On the acquisition front, 1996 proved to be a busy year, eclipsing the achievements of 1995. In March, the company acquired Columbus, Ohio-based OASYS, Inc., a provider of contract computer programming services that gave Ciber a new geographic location in Columbus supported by 20 information technology consultants. In May 1996, Ciber acquired Practical Business Solutions, Inc., an information technology company with offices in Boston and Providence, Rhode Island. Two months later, the company completed yet another acquisition, purchasing the Business Systems Development division of DataFocus, Inc., a computer consulting firm with offices in Fairfax, Virginia and Edison, New Jersey. Not stopping there, Ciber brought another company under its corporate umbrella in September, when it acquired Spectrum Technology Group, Inc., a management consulting firm based in Somerville, New Jersey that strengthened Ciber's management consulting and project management services.[15]

Lone Star Value Seeks To Upgrade Ciber's Board Of Directors

		  Criticizes Board's Poor Performance, Corporate Governance, and Compensation PracticesNominates Slate of Three Highly-Qualified Independent Director Candidates

NEW YORK, Feb. 27, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Lone Star Value Management, LLC (together with its affiliates, "Lone Star Value", "we", or "us") is a significant, long-term shareholder of Ciber, Inc. ("Ciber" or the "Company") (NYSE:   CBR) with ownership of approximately 2.7 million shares of common stock.  Lone Star Value announced today that it delivered a formal notice to Ciber of its intention to nominate three director candidates for election to the board of directors of Ciber (the "Board") at the upcoming 2015 annual meeting of Ciber shareholders (the "2015 Annual Meeting").
Lone Star Value is dedicated to enhancing shareholder value and improving shareholder rights for ALL Ciber shareholders.  In our view, upgrading the incumbent Board is a critical first step for shareholders to realize our goals. Lone Star Value believes that Ciber's stock is deeply undervalued due in large part to failures of oversight by the incumbent Board and poor corporate governance.  We fear many of the incumbent Board members are more focused on their director fees and the prestige of serving on a public board in their hometown of Denver, than they are on maximizing value for Ciber's shareholders.  During Chairman Jacobs' tenure as a Board member, for example, CBR stock has declined by more than 45%(1) while he has made over $1.2 million in director fees.(2)  In addition, average Board member compensation during Chairman Jacobs' tenure has risen from approximately $40,000 per year to approximately $200,000 per year(3) and is paid mainly in cash -- not the compensation terms shareholders want to see in a turnaround situation.  As a sign of a poorly performing Board, management team turnover has been alarmingly high over the past ten years with four different CEOs and four different CFOs.  We believe the incumbent Board, until very recently, has repeatedly failed to find a suitable CEO to lead the Company toward profitability and performance in line with its peers.  Ciber's dismal operating performance, for example, is represented by a cumulative net loss to shareholders of more than $193 million ($2.69/share) since 2010 in GAAP earnings and it has reported annual net losses in GAAP earnings every year since 2010, while its industry peers were much more profitable during this time period.(4)
To be clear, we have tremendous confidence in Ciber's new CEO, Michael Boustridge.  We believe he and his management team are beginning to execute on a long-awaited turnaround of Ciber's operations as evidenced by Ciber's improved financial results in Q4 2014.  Of course the incumbent Board will try to take credit for hiring Mr. Boustridge as CEO, but it should be pointed out that the incumbent Board only hired Mr. Boustridge as CEO after our activist effort was initiated a year ago, after Lone Star Value gained representation on the Board, and after it had become undeniable that the previous CEO, David Peterschmidt, hired by Chairman Paul Jacobs, had been a failure over his 4-year tenure.  We also have deep respect for Ciber Board member and Company founder Bobby Stevenson, both for founding the Company and for owning almost 8% of its stock.  Unlike the other Board members, we believe Mr. Stevenson thinks like an owner and is much more focused on shareholder value creation than his director fees.
We believe this Board has failed in one of the most important roles for any board -- recruiting the right management talent and creating the right incentives by compensating them based on performance.  Ciber's unfortunate history with its former CEO, Mr. Peterschmidt, is a strong example of the Board's failure in this regard.  Chairman Jacobs hired David Peterschmidt as CEO in July 2010, a time when Ciber was in desperate need of a turnaround, but, unfortunately, Mr. Peterschmidt had no turnaround expertise.  Two years into Mr. Peterschmidt's tenure, the Board had apparently become concerned about his performance and decided to appoint Mr. Boustridge to the Board so he could step in as CEO if needed.  A direct quote from Chairman Jacobs in 2014 clearly explains the reasoning behind adding Mr. Boustridge to the Board in 2012: "Michael was brought onto our Board two years ago with succession planning in mind.  We are fortunate to have a strong and qualified candidate, with global operating experience.  And, because Michael has been on our Board, he has a perspective of the role that no outside candidate could bring".(5)
Yet despite every indication that Mr. Peterschmidt was grossly underperforming and had been for two years, the Board did nothing about it for another two years.  It was not until Lone Star Value launched a campaign to seek change on the Board in 2014 that Ciber's incumbent directors finally took action to replace the failed CEO.  Even then, this Board, which well knew that Mr. Boustridge would replace Mr. Peterschmidt as CEO, still renewed Mr. Peterschmidt's contract on March 25, 2014 and kept him on the payroll as a consultant for an additional year after his replacement as CEO.  This Board, led by Chairman Jacobs, "rewarded" Mr. Peterschmidt with an exit package worth more than $2.6 million.(6)  Mr. Peterschmidt's exit package included a $710,000 one-year consulting contract, 350,000 CBR shares, medical benefits, moving costs from Colorado to California, closing costs related to the sale of Mr. Peterschmidt's home, and the cost of renewing his Executive's status as a Global Services member on United Airlines for two years.(7)  We believe Mr. Peterschmidt's superfluous addition to his compensation package was completely unnecessary and not required by his employment contract – essentially, it was a tip.
While presiding over a period of disruptive management turnover and unnecessary compensation practices, the Board has also continually had poor corporate governance, which is a sure sign of an entrenched Board.  The Board has shown little appetite for fresh perspective in the boardroom with barely any turnover over the last 10 years.  Further, the Board has sought to stifle shareholders' ability to seek change on the Board through, among other things, a classified board structure and an absolute prohibition on the shareholders' ability to call special meetings or act by written consent.  Leading proxy advisory firm, Institutional Shareholders Services (ISS), rates Ciber's overall corporate governance with the lowest possible governance score of 10 on a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 indicating maximum corporate governance risk.  Two specific corporate governance areas have been highlighted by ISS in its 10 grade maximum governance risk rating – shareholder rights and executive compensation.
Furthermore, through the course of our involvement with Ciber, the Board has shown disregard for shareholder input and nonchalance in breaking its contractual commitments to shareholders.  Last year, pursuant to an agreement with Lone Star Value, the incumbent Board agreed to add a shareholder representative on the Board, Richard Coleman, who has added tremendous value in the boardroom and whom we are re-nominating for election to the Board this year. In our agreement, the Board committed to actively search for two additional Board members in order to upgrade and enhance the talent on the Board.(8)  In the year since then, one director, Betsy Atkins, joined the Board, but promptly resigned after only three months.  Other than that, there is no evidence that the Board took its obligations to upgrade and enhance the talent on the Board seriously.  In failing to replace Ms. Atkins and to add an additional new director, the Board led by Mr. Jacobs failed to honor its responsibilities to shareholders and its agreement with us.
Lone Star Value has clearly expressed its views on the urgent need for improvement of Ciber's Board and corporate governance practices to Chairman Jacobs in numerous calls and emails.  The incumbent Board has so far refused to make the necessary changes to avoid a proxy contest.  We have reluctantly come to the conclusion that the behavior of the incumbent Board will not change unless the personnel changes.  We are convinced that reconstituting the Board is imperative to improving shareholder value and rights.  An upgraded Board will be in a far stronger position to help the new management team in their continuing turnaround efforts at Ciber.  
Accordingly, Lone Star Value today submitted formal nominations of three highly-qualified director candidates, Richard K. Coleman, Jr., Robert G. Pearse, and Joshua Schechter, for election to the Board at the 2015 Annual Meeting.  Our nominees' experience encompasses technology, telecom, business services, financial, and turnaround expertise.  Messrs. Coleman, Pearse, and Schechter not only possess substantial and relevant turnaround experience and a well-balanced mix of skills but each also boasts an exceptional track record of creating shareholder value.  Each is committed to the highest levels of corporate governance.  These proven value-creators will ensure that the Company evaluates, with an open mind and a keen sense of urgency, all strategic alternatives to maximize value for all shareholders.
If elected by our fellow shareholders, our highly-qualified and experienced Board nominees will immediately seek to align the Company's interests with maximizing shareholder value, improving the fundamental operations of the business to an operational level on par with its direct competitors, and steer the Company toward long-term profitability.  Our goal is to inject a sense of urgency, while implementing a coherent strategy between the Board and management team, which will ultimately yield an increase in shareholder value.
Shareholders can no longer put their faith in the incumbent Board that has historically eroded shareholder value, delayed Ciber's needed operating turnaround, and stubbornly refused to implement proactive change on the Board.  At this stage, change on the Board should be made by the shareholders and for the shareholders. We believe that ONLY THE SHAREHOLDERS and not the incumbent Board should be allowed to choose new directors.  We caution the Board against thinly veiled reactive measures to entrench themselves under the guise of proactive action.  We further remind the incumbent directors of their fiduciary duty to shareholders, particularly in the context of any potential proxy contest, and that actions taken in violation of shareholder rights and destructive of shareholder value may expose incumbent directors to liability that exceeds any D&O insurance coverage.
Lone Star Value remains open to a meaningful dialogue with the Board regarding its composition and corporate strategy and remains amenable to reaching a mutually agreeable resolution to re-constitute the Board in a manner that is in the best interests of all shareholders.  If no agreement is reached, however, Lone Star Value is fully prepared to solicit the support of its fellow shareholders to elect all three of its director nominees at the 2015 Annual Meeting.  Our nominees, if elected, will take their fiduciary responsibility very seriously and will represent the interests of ALL shareholders.
Lone Star Value's independent and highly-qualified candidates are:
Richard K. Coleman, Jr., age 58, is the founder and President of Rocky Mountain Venture Services.  Since 1998, his company has helped businesses plan and launch new ventures and restructuring initiatives.  As a private investor and advisor, Mr. Coleman envisions, develops, and executes strategic changes, often serving as an interim executive and/or board member.  Mr. Coleman is currently the President and Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") of Crossroads Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:  CRDS) ("Crossroads Systems"), a global provider of data archive solutions, a position he has held since November 2013.  He has also served on the Board of Directors of Crossroads since April 2013. Previously, he served as the interim President and CEO of Crossroads from May 2013 until November 2013.  Mr. Coleman has been a director of Ciber, Inc. (NYSE:  CBR), a leading global information technology company, since April 2014, where he also serves on the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee. Mr. Coleman has also served as a director of Hudson Global, Inc. ("Hudson Global"), a worldwide provider of highly specialized professional-level recruitment and related talent solutions, since May 2014, where he also serves on the Compensation Committee. Previously, Mr. Coleman served as a director of Aetrium Incorporated ("Aetrium"), a manufacturer of a variety of electromechanical equipment used in the handling and testing of semiconductor devices, from January 2013 until April 2014, where he also served as a member of its Audit and Compensation Committees as well as Chairman of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.  In addition, Mr. Coleman served on the Board of Directors of On Track Innovations Ltd.

Degree from the United States Air Force Academy, an M.B.A. from Golden Gate University, and is a graduate of the United States Air Force Communications Systems Officer School.  Lone Star Value believes that Mr. Coleman's depth of experience serving in senior executive positions and on various public company boards coupled with his extensive expertise in business development and operations well qualifies him for service as a director of the Company.
Robert G. Pearse, age 55, currently serves as a Managing Partner at Yucatan Rock Ventures, a firm he co-founded in 2004, where he specializes in technology investments and consulting.  Mr. Pearse serves as a director for Aviat Networks, Inc and member of the Compensation Committee and Nominating & Governance Committee since January 2015.  Mr. Pearse serves as a director for Crossroads Systems, Inc., Chairman of the Compensation Committee, and member of the Audit Committee and Nominating & Governance Committee since 2013.  From 2005 to 2012, Mr. Pearse served as vice president of Strategy and Market Development at NetApp, Inc. ("NetApp"), a computer storage and data management company.  Mr. Pearse played an influential role leading the NetApp's growth strategy which drove the firm to become a Fortune 500 company during his tenure.  From 1987 to 2004, Mr. Pearse held leadership positions at Hewlett-Packard, most recently as the vice president of Strategy and Corporate Development from 2001 to 2004 focusing on business strategy, business development and acquisitions. Mr. Pearse's professional experience also includes positions at PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, Eastman Chemical Company, and General Motors Company. Mr. Pearse earned a Master of Business Administration degree from the Stanford Graduate School of Business in 1986, and a Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology in 1982.  Lone Star Value believes that Mr. Pearse's extensive leadership experience and deep understanding of the technology industry will make him a valuable addition to the Board.

("Aderans"), a multi-national company engaged in hair-related business, since August 2008, and is the Executive Chairman of Aderans America Holdings, Inc., Aderans' holding company in the United States.  Mr. Schechter has also served on the Board of Directors of The Pantry, Inc. a leading independently operated convenience store chain in the southeastern United States and one of the largest independently operated convenience store chains in the country, since March 2014, where he currently serves as a member of the Audit Committee and Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee.  From 2001 to 2013, Mr. Schechter served as Managing Director of Steel Partners Ltd., a privately owned hedge fund sponsor, and its affiliates. Mr. Schechter has served as co-President of Steel Partners Japan Asset Management, LP, a private company offering investment services, since 2008.  From 2005 until 2008, Mr. Schechter served on the Board of Directors of WHX Corporation (n/k/a Handy & Harman Ltd.), a diversified manufacturer of engineered niche industrial products with leading market positions in many of the markets it serves.  Mr. Schechter was also a member of the Board of Directors of Puroflow, Inc.

Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/24/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.  Royalty trusts may have special tax treatment, so you should consult a tax advisor on the potential tax consequences of investing in them.News, commentary and events are from third-party sources unaffiliated with Fidelity.
