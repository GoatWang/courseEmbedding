Padmasree Warrior
Breaking rules to push conventional boundaries

Padmasree Warrior M.S. ’84 ChemE has had a thirty-year career in the tech sector, rising to her current position as Chief Technology and Strategy Officer at Cisco Systems. This was not her original plan.  Her plan was to earn a master’s degree in chemical engineering at Cornell in the lab of her adviser Ferdinand Rodriguez, and then to continue on to a doctorate, also with Rodriguez. “He was always very flexible and encouraged me to push boundaries,” says Warrior. Her doctoral plan was derailed, and her future altered, simply by agreeing to do a favor for a friend.

“It was by sheer accident that I ended up working,” says Warrior. “I went to a job fair with a friend of mine who was finishing up her PhD in chemical engineering. I just walked with her to keep her company.” At the job fair, one thing led to another, and before long Warrior had a job offer from Motorola. When she told Professor Rodriguez about it, she fully expected it would be a one-year position out in industry and that she would return with more focus for her research project. “He said, ‘Go for it. I’ll keep your project waiting for you.’ but I never went back. Every Christmas I would get a card from him saying ‘Hey, when are you coming back?’”

Warrior’s first job was at the Motorola facility in Arizona. She was one of only a few women working there at the time, but this was nothing new to her. While working toward her undergraduate chemical engineering degree at the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology in Delhi, Warrior was one of five women in an engineering cohort of 250 students. During her master’s study at Cornell, most of her chemical engineering classmates were male. At Cisco, a company with over $46 billion in revenues in 2013 and more than $8 billion in profits, the executive leadership team is 25 percent women, (which is more than double the average at the largest publicly traded Silicon Valley companies.)

Warrior’s long and successful career in the tech world has earned her widespread recognition, including commendations from the Women in Technology International Hall of Fame, the International Museum of Women, and Forbes Magazine, which placed her on the list of 15 Most Powerful Women in Technology for 2013. As Chief Technology and Strategy Officer at Cisco, Warrior helps shape the direction of technological research, innovation, and applications at the forefront of the digital world, including Cisco’s leading role in driving the Internet of Everything.

But she also uses her position to speak out about the need for more women in leadership roles in the tech sector. “I have been pleased to see more women in the STEM fields in schools and I think it’s trending in the right direction, but in the workforce progress is much slower,” says Warrior. When asked why it would be valuable to have more women in decision-making roles at technology companies, Warrior says “Technology, going forward, will become more blended. It is becoming a combination even in the products we build—it’s combining user experience  and user interface design with engineering.” She continues, “So you have to have a multidisciplinary approach, and I think women tend to be better at that. In the STEM fields women offer a very different perspective. We don’t think just of the technology, but also of the implications of the technology, the value of technology, the impact it will have on people’s lives, and the concerns about privacy. On all of these things women offer a very well-rounded perspective…”

When asked about the specific challenges women in leadership roles face in the tech world, Warrior says, “Women have to overcome more barriers. We don’t get as many passes as guys do. A woman in engineering and STEM fields almost has to out-perform her male peers to get recognized. It’s unfortunate, but that seems to be the norm.” Warrior sounds hopeful about the future for women in the tech sector. “As you see more women leaders in the field, that will change.” Nationally, women make up 18% of the students enrolled in undergraduate engineering degree programs. Cornell Engineering’s 2013 freshman class is 44% women. With leaders like Padmasree Warrior excelling in positions at the highest levels of the technology industry, the path for these female Cornell engineers to positions of real power may be a little easier.

Warrior has come a long way from her start in the United States, when she arrived at Cornell with an undergraduate engineering degree, $100.00 and a one-way ticket. She returns to Cornell at least twice a year now. Though these days she comes to campus for meetings of the Board of Trustees, where she was recently elected to a four-year term.

Padmasree Warrior leads upstart in push for autonomous cars

By Carolyn Said

                                                                                                    Padmasree Warrior, the CEO of the U.S. operations of NIO, is seen with the company's new corporate logo in San Jose, Calif. on Wednesday, Jan. 25, 2017. China-based NIO, which until recently was known as NextEV, is developing autonomous electric vehicles.
                
                    
Padmasree Warrior, the CEO of the U.S. operations of NIO, is seen...
 

She regularly graces lists of the most powerful women in Silicon Valley. Her resume includes long stints in the top ranks of Motorola and Cisco. But now Padmasree Warrior is taking her talents on the road.
A year ago Warrior, 56, plunged into the world of automobiles, becoming the CEO of Nio USA, a company formerly known as NextEV which is seeking to make smart, autonomous electric cars. (She’s also the chief development officer and a board member of Nio’s parent company in Shanghai.)



Dubbed “queen of the electric car biz” by Fortune, Warrior oversees more than 300 engineers at Nio’s sprawling San Jose offices, replete with creative touches like a living plant wall and graffiti art, as well as a capacious garage area. Right now Nio, which has a permit to test autonomous cars on California roads, is using “donor cars” tricked out with its sensors and software until its own cars are ready for testing in 2019. And Warrior, because she can’t yet have an autonomous Nio drive her around town, has to get behind the wheel of a Tesla Model S.


An engineer at heart, Warrior stays hands-on with everything from where to place the car doors to fabric selection. She joined Nio in December 2015 as the 16th U.S. employee. She worked in a windowless basement office and out of trailers in the parking lot while the 85,000-square-foot building Nio now inhabits was remodeled — a far cry from the executive offices of Motorola, where she spent 23 years, and Cisco, where she worked for seven years before joining Nio.

Nio  was founded in 2014 by entrepreneur William Li, the co-founder of Bitauto Holdings, which provides pricing data and other services to car dealers in China.
Press reports say the privately held, 2,000-person company has raised nearly $1 billion. Besides San Jose, where employees focus on user interfaces, it has major offices in Munich for auto design and London, the hub for its high-performance electric race car.
This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
Q: You could have had any job in Silicon Valley. Why this one?
A: I wanted to go somewhere where a whole industry is at the point of changing. I thought of transportation and education — both had tech at their periphery, not the center. Then I met William. He wanted someone to start a U.S. company that would be part of his parent company. It sounded exciting, so I jumped in.
Q: What is your vision of Nio’s product?
A: I think of the car of the future as a robot that looks like a beautiful high-performance car. Fundamentally cars haven’t changed in the past 60 or 70 years, other than improvements in fuel efficiency or adding a little more technology. Most people are OK with their cars, but they hate the time they spend in traffic and commuting. We want to give people their freedom and time back.

                                                                                                    Nio built its $1.2 million EP9 all-electric race car to show that electric cars could be super-high-performance vehicles. The EP9, which has a top speed of 194 mph, broke world records on tracks in Germany and France in 2016.
                
                    
Nio built its $1.2 million EP9 all-electric race car to show that...
Q: How will you do that?
A: We are making Car 3.0. We want to make the car your living space and your companion. It should talk to you and understand your needs.
Q: Most companies making autonomous cars expect to deploy them through a ride-hailing service. But you plan to sell directly to consumers. Why?
A: A car is a very aspirational product. For many people, it’s an extension of their personal space. I leave my water, bag, gym clothes in certain places in my car. When we have autonomous vehicles, they can be even more an extension of space, like another room, or your office.
Q: What is your timeline and what level of autonomy will you offer?
A: In 2018 we will have vehicles for sale in China. They probably will be Level 2 (see box). In the U.S. market, we will have a Level 4 car in 2020.
Q: When do you anticipate full autonomy with no driver controls?
A: The technology will probably advance fast enough to get rid of the steering wheel and pedals sooner, but regulations and people’s views will delay the adoption. Cars with no steering wheels or pedals, around 2025 to 2030.
Q: How will autonomous cars change our world?
A: I think the impact will be bigger than the shift to the mobile Internet and smartphones. The autonomous vehicle becomes a platform for commerce and content. You’ll be watching videos and movies in the car; there’s a chance for new ad revenue. You’ll be more productive, actually working in the car. We won’t need parking lots. People can move away from crowded urban centers, live in the countryside and work in the city when the commute becomes a pleasure instead of a pain. The insurance industry will change, (as will) vehicle repair.
Q: Where will you manufacture?
A: Consumer vehicles for the China market will be made in China. For the U.S. and global markets, we are still pursuing different options, looking at the U.S. as a potential place to manufacture.
Q: You’re often cited as a rival to Tesla. Who do you see as your competitors?
A: My competition is really the internal combustion engine. It’s not Tesla or anyone else. We need people to get comfortable with electric vehicles and autonomous vehicles.
Q: WIll you have a luxury price tag?
A: We aren’t targeting just exclusive, super-luxury buyers. (We’re making) something reasonably affordable. As soon as the technology costs come down, the vehicle costs come down. We want to make lives better for millions of people around the world.
Q: Why did you create the EP9 race car?
A: Most people think of electric vehicles as not serious cars, very low speed, something to run errands. We wanted to break that myth and show you can have amazing performance. Building an electric vehicle that broke world records established our credibility.

Q: Will you sell the EP9?
A: It’s a limited edition, but we’ve gotten increasingly more interest so we’re looking at making a broader platform. It’s a $1.2 million high-performance race car.
Q: You originally launched as NextEV and recently rebranded as Nio. Why change your name so early in your company’s life?
A: NextEV was about being the next-generation electric vehicle company. We didn’t intend it to be the brand name. We wanted a global brand name. Nio can be pronounced in every language and sounds like new day and new beginning. Our logo captures the vision of the company. The arrow at the bottom denotes earth; the semicircle at the top denotes sky. We always talk about the company as blue sky coming.
Q: How does the auto industry differ from the technology world?
A: We’re building a complicated machine that moves at high speeds. People’s lives depend on it. It’s a very different product experience. For consumer products, design and usability are as important as the technology. When you build a router, it’s not like a user touches it every single day or sits in it.

Self-driving car levels explained
The federal government and the auto industry have developed ranking systems to describe the levels of autonomous-car technology. Nio and other autonomous-vehicle startups are targeting various kinds of autonomy in their products.
Level zero Driver performs all control functions.
Level 1 Driver performs most functions, but a few — such as driver-assist braking — are augmented by automation.
Level 2 At least two of the car’s control functions can work together in automated mode — such as adaptive cruise control combined with lane centering — but the driver still must pay attention.
Level 3 Driver can turn over total control of the car under certain conditions, with the car largely responsible for monitoring for any sudden changes to the environment. Driver must still be available to take control if needed.
Level 4 Car is capable of driving itself but has controls for humans to drive when they choose.
Level 5 Car drives itself, with no option for human driving.

Early life[edit]
Yellepeddi Padmasree was born and raised in the city of Vijayawada in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, India. She was born in to a Telugu Hindu Brahmin family. She went to school at the Children's Montessori School and Maris Stella College in Vijayawada. Warrior received a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering from Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi in 1982.[1][2] She holds a master's degree in chemical engineering from Cornell University.[3]
Career[edit]
Work at Motorola[edit]
Warrior joined Motorola in 1984[4] Over the course of her 23 years at the company she served as Corporate Vice-President and general manager of Motorola's Energy Systems Group, and Corporate Vice-President and Chief Technology Officer in its Semiconductor Products Sector.[4]Immediately prior to becoming Motorola's CTO, she served as general manager of Thoughtbeam, a product of Motorola, in Tempe, Arizona. When named Motorola's CTO in January 2003, Warrior became a senior vice-president and in 2005 she was promoted to executive vice-president.[5][6]
During Warrior's tenure as CTO, Motorola was awarded the 2004 National Medal of Technology by the President of the United States, the first time the company had received this honour. During this period she was a proponent of "Seamless Mobility" – the concept of having seamless communication across all facets of a person's life. The dream was not fully realised and the concept was eventually dropped from Motorola marketing presentations. On 4 December 2007, she left Motorola to become CTO at Cisco Systems.[7] It was announced in June 2015 that she will be leaving Cisco Systems.[8]
Recognition[edit]
Fortune Magazine called her one of four rising stars on its Most Powerful Women list,[9] placing her between the 10 "highest paid" and the "Young and Powerful" categories. In 2005, The Economic Times ranked Warrior as the 11th Most Influential Global Indian.[10] In 2001 she was one of six women nationwide selected to receive the "Women Elevating Science and Technology" award from Working Woman Magazine.[11] As of 2014, she is listed as the 71st most powerful woman in the world by Forbes.[12]
Board participation[edit]
Warrior serves on the boards of Chicago's Joffrey Ballet[13] and Museum of Science and Industry,[14] Chicago Mayor's Technology Council,[15] Cornell University Engineering Council[16] and advisory council of Indian Institute of Technology.[17] She previously served on the Texas Governor's Council for Digital Economy,[4] the Technology Advisory Council for the FCC and on the Advisory Committee for the Computing and Information Science and Engineering of the National Science Foundation (NSF). She is also serving as a mentor in the State Department's International Women Leaders Mentoring Partnership.[17] Warrior also served on the board of directors for Corning Incorporated from 2005 through 2008.[18] In October 2013 Padmasree Warrior joined the Gap Inc. board of directors.[19] In December 2015 she joined Microsoft's board of directors.[20][21]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
