Participation and Protection: With No Annual Fees




When planning for retirement, you can’t risk everything and you can’t protect everything.
But there is a way to have some of both.










A Shield Annuity from Brighthouse Financial can help you use a portion of your assets to take advantage of market
            growth with a level of downside protection that other options may not provide. Shield is designed to provide
            some protection in an unpredictable endeavor — investing.





Protect your retirement assets
A Brighthouse Shield Annuity is designed to provide a level of protection that, when markets inevitably turn volatile,
            ensures your losses are limited.



Participate in growth opportunities
With a Shield Annuity, balance is built-in. This means that even with the protection you enjoy, you can still take
            advantage of growth opportunities in the market up to a certain percentage.



Pay no annual fees
Unlike many financial products, you pay no annual fees with a Shield Annuity.

                                            Your Retirement Big Picture: Where Do Annuities Fit?

1 Guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.
2 Shield annuities do not invest directly in any index.
3 Product guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company and are solely the responsibility of the issuing insurance company. Annuities and life insurance are issued by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company, Charlotte, NC 28277 and in New York, only by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY, New York, NY 10017 and not by MetLife.
If you're buying an annuity to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. That's because tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the annuity. References throughout this material to tax advantage, such as tax deferral and tax-free transfers, are subject to this consideration. In addition, non-qualified annuity contracts owned by corporations do not receive tax deferral on earnings. 

Prospectuses for variable annuities issued by a Brighthouse Financial insurance company, and for the investment portfolios offered thereunder, are available from Brighthouse Financial. The contract prospectus contains information about the contract's features, risks, charges and expenses. The investment objectives, risks and policies of the investment options, as well as other information about the investment options, are described in their respective prospectuses. Please read the prospectuses and consider this information carefully before investing. There is no guarantee that any of the variable investment options in a variable annuity product will meet their stated goals or objectives. The account value is subject to market fluctuations and investment risk so that, when withdrawn, it may be worth more or less than its original value even when an optional protection benefit rider is elected. Product availability and features may vary by state. Please refer to the contract prospectus for more complete details regarding the living and death benefits.

Annuities are long-term investments designed for retirement purposes. Brighthouse Financial annuities have limitations, exclusions, charges, termination provisions and terms for keeping them in force. All contract guarantees, including optional living and death benefit riders and annuity payout rates, are backed by the claims-paying ability and financial strength of issuing insurance company. They are not backed by the broker/dealer from which an annuity is purchased, by the insurance agency where an annuity is purchased, or any affiliates to those entities, and none makes any representations or guarantees regarding the claims-paying ability and financial strength of the issuing insurance company. Similarity, the issuing insurance company and the underwriter do not back the financial strength of the broker/dealer or its affiliates. Please contact your financial professional for complete details. 

Withdrawals of taxable amounts are subject to ordinary income tax and if made before age 59½, may be subject to a 10% federal income tax penalty. Some broker/dealers and financial professionals may refer to the 10% federal income tax penalty as an "additional tax" or "additional income tax" or use the terms interchangeably when discussing withdrawals taken prior to age 59½. Distributions of taxable amounts from a non-qualified annuity may also be subject to the 3.8% Unearned Income Medicare Contribution Tax on Net Investment Income if your modified adjusted gross income exceeds the applicable threshold amount. Withdrawals will reduce the living and death benefits and account value. Withdrawals may be subject to withdrawal charges. 

Any discussion of taxes is for general informational purposes only, does not purport to be complete or cover every situation, and should not be construed as legal, tax, or accounting advice. You should confer with your qualified legal, tax, and accounting advisors as appropriate.

*Data as of March 31, 2017. Total assets includes certain adjustments for transactions associated with the separation from MetLife, Inc.

A.M. Best’s Financial Strength Rating is an independent opinion of an insurer’s financial strength and ability to meet its ongoing insurance policy and contract obligations. A Financial Strength Rating is not assigned to specific insurance policies or contracts and does not address any other risk, including, but not limited to, an insurer’s claims-payment policies or procedures; the ability of the insurer to dispute or deny claims payment on grounds of misrepresentation or fraud; or any specific liability contractually borne by the policy or contract holder. A Financial Strength Rating is not a recommendation to purchase, hold, or terminate any insurance policy, contract or any other financial obligation issued by an insurer, nor does it address the suitability of any particular policy or contract, for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.ambest.com.
Fitch’s Insurer Financial Strength Rating provides an assessment of the financial strength of an insurance organization. The Insurer Financial Strength Rating is assigned to the insurance company’s policyholder obligations, including assumed reinsurance obligations and contract holder obligations, such as guaranteed investment contracts. Ratings explanations can be found at www.fitchratings.com.
Moody’s Insurance Financial Strength Rating is an opinion of the ability of an insurance company to pay punctually senior policyholder claims and obligations and also reflect the expected financial loss suffered in the event of default. Specific obligations are considered unrated unless they are individually rated because the standing of a particular insurance obligation would depend on an assessment of its relative standing under those laws governing both the obligation and the insurance company. Ratings explanations can be found at www.moodys.com.
S&P Global Insurer Financial Strength Rating is a forward-looking opinion about the financial security characteristics of an insurance organization with respect to its ability to pay under its insurance policies and contracts in accordance with their terms.

To



Prospectuses dated May 1, 2008, as Supplemented



This supplement should be read and retained with the prospectus and supplements
for your Bb Series Annuity. If you would like another copy of the prospectus or
the supplements, please call us at 1-888-PRU-2888. The terms used in this
supplement are defined in the Glossary of Terms in the prospectus, unless
specifically defined in this supplement. The optional living benefits and
optional features described in this supplement are only being offered in those
jurisdictions where we have received regulatory approval and will be offered
subsequently in other jurisdictions when we receive regulatory approval in
those jurisdictions.


I.  This supplement describes new optional living benefits available under
each of the above-referenced Annuities. If you currently own an
Annuity with a living benefit, you may terminate your existing benefit
rider (subject to our current rules) and elect these new benefits as
described below. These benefits cannot be combined with any other
living benefit or the Highest Daily Value optional death benefit.


II. This supplement also describes a new optional feature available to
current owners of Highest Daily Lifetime Five Income Benefit, Highest
Daily Lifetime Seven Income Benefit, and Spousal Highest Daily
Lifetime Seven Income Benefit that, if elected, would provide an
alternative asset transfer formula for their benefit. Except as
otherwise described in this supplement, all terms and conditions of
your Annuity and benefit rider for Highest Daily Lifetime Five Income
Benefit, Highest Daily Lifetime Seven Income Benefit or Spousal
Highest Daily Lifetime Seven Income Benefit apply and do not change.


III.In addition, this supplement also: (1) discusses that certain optional
living benefits are no longer available (subject to regulatory
approval of the benefits offered in this supplement); (2) discusses
information about Section 403(b) annuity contract exchanges;

(3) provides information regarding purchasing an Annuity if you are a
beneficiary of an annuity contract that was owned by a decedent; and

(4) provides additional information with respect to Guaranteed Return
Option Plus, Guaranteed Return Option, Highest Daily GRO, Guaranteed
Return Option Plus 2008, Highest Daily Lifetime Five, Highest Daily
Lifetime Seven and Spousal Highest Daily Lifetime Seven.

I. NEW OPTIONAL LIVING BENEFITS



1. We add the following optional living benefits to the prospectus:



HIGHEST DAILY LIFETIME 7 PLUS/SM/ INCOME BENEFIT (HD 7 Plus)/SM/



Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus is offered as a replacement to Highest Daily
Lifetime Seven and Highest Daily Lifetime Five in those jurisdictions where we
have received regulatory approval. Currently, if you elect Highest Daily
Lifetime 7 Plus and subsequently terminate the benefit, you may have a waiting
period until you can elect another lifetime withdrawal benefit. See "Election
of and Designations under the Program" and "Termination of Existing Benefits
and Election of New Benefits" below for details. The income benefit under
Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus currently is based on a single "designated life"
who is at least 45 years old on the date that the benefit is acquired. The
Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus Benefit is not available if you elect any other
optional living benefit, although you may elect any optional death benefit
other than Highest Daily Value death benefit. As long as your Highest Daily
Lifetime 7 Plus Benefit is in effect, you must allocate your Account Value in
accordance with the then permitted and available investment option(s) with this
program. For a more detailed description of the permitted investment options,
see the "Investment Options" section below and in your prospectus.


We offer a benefit that guarantees until the death of the single designated
life (the Annuitant) the ability to withdraw an annual amount (the "Annual
Income Amount") equal to a percentage of an initial principal value (the
"Protected Withdrawal Value") regardless of the impact of market performance on
the Account Value, subject to our program rules regarding the timing and amount
of withdrawals. You are guaranteed to be able to withdraw the Annual Income
Amount for the rest of your life ("Lifetime Withdrawals"), provided that you
have not made "excess withdrawals." We also permit you to make a one-time
Non-Lifetime Withdrawal from your Annuity prior to taking Lifetime Withdrawals
under the benefit. Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus may be appropriate if you
intend to make periodic withdrawals from your Annuity, and wish to ensure that
market performance will not affect your ability to receive annual payments. You
are not required to make withdrawals as part of the benefit - the guarantees
are not lost if you withdraw less than the maximum allowable amount each year
under the rules of the benefit. As discussed below, we require that you
participate in our asset transfer program in order to participate in Highest
Daily Lifetime 7 Plus.


2





Although you are guaranteed to withdraw your Annual Income Amount for life even
if your Account Value falls to zero, if you take excess withdrawals, it is
possible that your Annual Income Amount could also fall to zero. In that
scenario, no further amount would be payable under the Highest Daily Lifetime 7
Plus benefit.



Key Feature - Protected Withdrawal Value



The Protected Withdrawal Value is used to calculate the initial Annual Income
Amount. The Protected Withdrawal Value is separate from your Account Value and
not available as cash or a lump sum. On the effective date of the benefit, the
Protected Withdrawal Value is equal to your Account Value. On each Valuation
Day thereafter until the date of your first Lifetime Withdrawal (excluding any
Non-Lifetime Withdrawal discussed below), the Protected Withdrawal Value is
equal to the "Periodic Value" described in the next paragraphs.


The "Periodic Value" initially is equal to the Account Value on the effective
date of the benefit. On each Valuation Day thereafter until the first Lifetime
Withdrawal, we recalculate the Periodic Value. We stop determining the Periodic
Value upon your first Lifetime Withdrawal after the effective date of the
benefit. On each Valuation Day (the "Current Valuation Day"), the Periodic
Value is equal to the greater of:


(1) the Periodic Value for the immediately preceding business day (the
"Prior Valuation Day") appreciated at the daily equivalent of 7%
annually during the calendar day(s) between the Prior Valuation Day
and the Current Valuation Day (i.e., one day for successive Valuation
Days, but more than one calendar day for Valuation Days that are
separated by weekends and/or holidays), plus the amount of any
adjusted Purchase Payment made on the Current Valuation Day; and


(2) the Account Value.


If you have not made a Lifetime Withdrawal on or before the 10/th/, 20/th/, or
25/th/ Anniversary of the effective date of the benefit, your Periodic Value on
the 10/th/, 20/th/, or 25/th/ Anniversary of the benefit effective date is
equal to the greatest of:


(1) the Periodic Value described above or,


3





(2) the sum of:


(a) 200% (on the 10/th/ anniversary), 400% (on the 20/th/ anniversary)
or 600% (on the 25/th/ anniversary) of the Account Value on the
effective date of the benefit;


(b) 200% (on the 10/th/ anniversary), 400% (on the 20/th/ anniversary)
or 600% (on the 25/th/ anniversary) of all adjusted Purchase
Payments made within one year of the effective date of the
benefit; and


(c) All adjusted Purchase Payments made after one year following the
effective date of the benefit.


If you elect Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus with Beneficiary Income Option ("
BIO") (see below), we will stop determining the Periodic Value (as described
above) on the earlier of your first Lifetime Withdrawal after the effective
date of the benefit or the Tenth Anniversary of the effective date of the
benefit ("Anniversary Date"). This means that under the Highest Daily Lifetime
7 Plus with BIO benefit you will not be eligible for the guaranteed minimum
Periodic Values described above on the 20/th/ and 25/th /Anniversary of the
Benefit Effective Date.


On and after the date of your first Lifetime Withdrawal, your Protected
Withdrawal Value is increased by the amount of any subsequent Purchase
Payments, is reduced by withdrawals, including your first Lifetime Withdrawal
(as described below), and is increased if you qualify for a step-up (as
described below).



Return of Principal Guarantee



If you have not made a Lifetime Withdrawal before the Tenth Anniversary, we
will increase your Account Value on that Tenth Anniversary (or the next
Valuation Day, if that anniversary is not a Valuation Day), if the requirements
set forth in this paragraph are met. On the Tenth Anniversary, we add:


a) your Account Value on the day that you elected Highest Daily Lifetime 7
Plus; and


b) the sum of each Purchase Payment (including the amount of any associated
Credits) you made during the one-year period after you elected the benefit.


If the sum of (a) and (b) is greater than your Account Value on the Tenth
Anniversary, we increase your Account Value to equal the sum of (a) and (b), by
contributing funds from our general account. If the sum of (a) and (b) is less
than or equal to your Account Value on the Tenth Anniversary, we make no such
adjustment. The amount that we add to your Account Value under this provision
will be allocated to each of your variable investment options (including the
AST Investment Grade Bond Sub-account), in the same proportion that each such
Sub-account bears to your total Account Value, immediately before the
application of the amount. Any such


4





amount will not be considered a Purchase Payment when calculating your
Protected Withdrawal Value, your death benefit, or the amount of any optional
benefit that you may have selected, and therefore will have no direct impact on
any such values at the time we add this amount. Because the amount is added to
Account Value, it will also be subject to each charge under your Annuity based
on Account Value. This potential addition to Account Value is available only if
you have elected Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus and if you meet the conditions
set forth in this paragraph. Thus, if you take a withdrawal (other than a
Non-Lifetime Withdrawal) prior to the Tenth Anniversary, you are not eligible
to receive the Return of Principal Guarantee. The Return of Principal Guarantee
is referred to as the Guaranteed Minimum Account Value Credit in the benefit
rider.


Key Feature - Annual Income Amount under the Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus
Benefit


The Annual Income Amount is equal to a specified percentage of the Protected
Withdrawal Value. The percentage initially depends on the age of the Annuitant
on the date of the first Lifetime Withdrawal after election of the benefit. The
percentages are: 4% for ages 45 - less than 59  1/2, 5% for ages 59  1/2 - 74,
6% for ages 75-79, 7% for ages 80-84, and 8% for ages 85 and older. Under the
Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus benefit, if your cumulative Lifetime Withdrawals
in an Annuity Year are less than or equal to the Annual Income Amount, they
will not reduce your Annual Income Amount in subsequent Annuity Years, but any
such withdrawals will reduce the Annual Income Amount on a dollar-for-dollar
basis in that Annuity Year. If your cumulative Lifetime Withdrawals are in
excess of the Annual Income Amount ("Excess Income"), your Annual Income Amount
in subsequent years will be reduced (except with regard to required minimum
distributions for this Annuity that comply with our rules) by the result of the
ratio of the Excess Income to the Account Value immediately prior to such
withdrawal (see examples of this calculation below). Reductions are based on
the actual amount of the withdrawal, including any CDSC that may apply.
Lifetime Withdrawals of any amount up to and including the Annual Income Amount
will reduce the Protected Withdrawal Value by the amount of the withdrawal.
Withdrawals of Excess Income will reduce the Protected Withdrawal Value by the
same ratio as the reduction to the Annual Income Amount.


Note that if your withdrawal of the Annual Income Amount in a given Annuity
Year exceeds the applicable free withdrawal amount under the Annuity (but is
not considered Excess Income), we will not impose any CDSC on the amount of
that withdrawal.


5





You may use the Systematic Withdrawal program to make withdrawals of the Annual
Income Amount. Any systematic withdrawal will be deemed a Lifetime Withdrawal
under this benefit.


Any Purchase Payment that you make subsequent to the election of Highest Daily
Lifetime 7 Plus will (i) increase the then-existing Annual Income Amount by an
amount equal to a percentage of the Purchase Payment (including the amount of
any associated Credits) based on the age of the Annuitant at the time of the
first Lifetime Withdrawal (the percentages are: 4% for ages 45 - less than 59
1/2, 5% for ages 59  1/2 - 74, 6% for ages 75-79, 7% for ages 80-84, and 8% for
ages 85 and older) and (ii) increase the Protected Withdrawal Value by the
amount of the Purchase Payment (including the amount of any associated Credits).

An automatic step-up feature ("Highest Daily Auto Step-Up") is part of Highest
Daily Lifetime 7 Plus. As detailed in this paragraph, the Highest Daily Auto
Step-Up feature can result in a larger Annual Income Amount if your Account
Value increases subsequent to your first Lifetime Withdrawal. The Highest Daily
Auto Step-Up starts with the anniversary of the Issue Date of the Annuity (the
"Annuity Anniversary") immediately after your first Lifetime Withdrawal under
the benefit. Specifically, upon the first such Annuity Anniversary, we identify
the Account Value on each Valuation Day within the immediately preceding
Annuity Year after your first Lifetime Withdrawal. Having identified the
highest daily value, we then multiply each such value by a percentage that
varies based on the age of the Annuitant on the Annuity Anniversary as of which
the step-up would occur. The percentages are: 4% for ages 45 - less than 59
1/2, 5% for ages 59  1/2 - 74, 6% for ages 75-79, 7% for ages 80-84, and 8% for
ages 85 and older. Thus, we multiply the highest daily value by the applicable
percentage, adjust each such daily value for subsequent withdrawals and
Purchase Payments, and then select the highest of those values. If the highest
of those values exceeds the existing Annual Income Amount, we replace the
existing amount with the new, higher amount. Otherwise, we leave the existing
Annual Income Amount intact. The Account Value on the Annuity Anniversary Value
is considered the last daily step-up value of the Annuity Year. All daily
valuations and annual step-ups will only occur on a Valuation Day. In later
years (i.e., after the first Annuity Anniversary after the first Lifetime
Withdrawal), we determine whether an automatic step-up should occur on each
Annuity Anniversary, by performing a similar examination of the Account Values
that occurred on Valuation Days during the year. At the time that we increase
your Annual Income Amount, we also increase your Protected Withdrawal Value (if
it is higher than your Protected Withdrawal Value prior to the daily step-up,
your Protected Withdrawal Value will never be decreased as a result of a
step-up) to equal the highest daily

value upon which your step-up was based. If, on the date that we implement a
Highest Daily Auto Step-Up to your Annual Income Amount, the charge for Highest
Daily Lifetime 7 Plus has changed for new purchasers, you may be subject to the
new charge at the time of such step-up. Prior to increasing your charge for
Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus upon a step-up, we would notify you, and give you
the opportunity to cancel the automatic step-up feature. If you receive notice
of a proposed step-up and accompanying fee increase, you should carefully
evaluate whether the amount of the step-up justifies the increased fee to which
you will be subject.


If you establish a Systematic Withdrawal program, we will not automatically
increase the withdrawal amount when there is an increase to the Annual Income
Amount, unless you instruct us otherwise.


The Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus program does not affect your ability to make
withdrawals under your Annuity, or limit your ability to request withdrawals
that exceed the Annual Income Amount. Under Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus, if
your cumulative withdrawals in an Annuity Year are less than or equal to the
Annual Income Amount, they will not reduce your Annual Income Amount in
subsequent Annuity Years, but any such withdrawals will reduce the Annual
Income Amount on a dollar-for-dollar basis in that Annuity Year.


If, cumulatively, you withdraw an amount less than the Annual Income Amount in
any Annuity Year, you cannot carry over the unused portion of the Annual Income
Amount to subsequent Annuity Years.


Because each of the Protected Withdrawal Value and Annual Income Amount is
determined in a way that is not solely related to Account Value, it is possible
for the Account Value to fall to zero, even though the Annual Income Amount
remains.


Examples of dollar-for-dollar and proportional reductions, and the Highest
Daily Auto Step-Up are set forth below. The values shown here are purely
hypothetical, and do not reflect the charges for the Highest Daily Lifetime 7
Plus benefit or any other fees and charges. Assume the following for all three
examples:


.   The Issue Date is December 1, 2008


.   The Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus benefit is elected on March 5, 2009


.   The Annuitant was 70 years old when he/she elected the Highest Daily
Lifetime 7 Plus benefit.

Example of dollar-for-dollar reductions


On November 24, 2009, the Protected Withdrawal Value is $120,000, resulting in
an Annual Income Amount of $6,000 (since the Annuitant is between the ages of
59  1/2 and 74 at the time of the first Lifetime Withdrawal, the Annual Income
Amount is 5% of the Protected Withdrawal Value, in this case 5% of $120,000).
Assuming $2,500 is withdrawn from the Annuity on this date, the remaining
Annual Income Amount for that Annuity Year (up to and including December 1,
2009) is $3,500. This is the result of a dollar-for-dollar reduction of the
Annual Income Amount ($6,000 less $2,500 = $3,500).


Example of proportional reductions


Continuing the previous example, assume an additional withdrawal of $5,000
occurs on November 27, 2009 and the Account Value at the time and immediately
prior to this withdrawal is $118,000. The first $3,500 of this withdrawal
reduces the Annual Income Amount for that Annuity Year to $0. The remaining
withdrawal amount of $1,500-- reduces the Annual Income Amount in future
Annuity Years on a proportional basis based on the ratio of the excess
withdrawal to the Account Value immediately prior to the excess withdrawal.
(Note that if there were other withdrawals in that Annuity Year, each would
result in another proportional reduction to the Annual Income Amount).








Here is the calculation:

Account Value before withdrawal                               $118,000.00
Less amount of "non" excess withdrawal                        $  3,500.00
Account Value immediately before excess withdrawal of $1,500  $114,500.00
Excess withdrawal amount                                      $  1,500.00








Divided by Account Value immediately before excess withdrawal $114,500.00








Ratio                                                               1.31%
Annual Income Amount                                           $6,000.00
Less ratio of 1.31%                                            $   78.60
Annual Income Amount for future Annuity Years                  $5,921.40








Example of highest daily auto step-up


On each Annuity Anniversary date, the Annual Income Amount is stepped-up if the
appropriate percentage (based on the Annuitant's age on the Annuity
Anniversary) of the highest daily value since your first Lifetime Withdrawal
(or last Annuity Anniversary in subsequent years), adjusted


8





for withdrawals and additional Purchase Payments, is higher than the Annual
Income Amount, adjusted for excess withdrawals and additional Purchase Payments
(plus any Credits).


Continuing the same example as above, the Annual Income Amount for this Annuity
Year is $6,000. However, the excess withdrawal on November 27 reduces the
amount to $5,921.40 for future years (see above). For the next Annuity Year,
the Annual Income Amount will be stepped up if 5% (since the designated life is
younger than 75 on the date of the potential step-up) of the highest daily
Account Value adjusted for withdrawals and Purchase Payments (including the
amount of any associated Credits), is higher than $5,921.40. Here are the
calculations for determining the daily values. Only the November 25 value is
being adjusted for excess withdrawals as the November 30 and December 1
Valuation Days occur after the excess withdrawal on November 26.








                                   Highest Daily Value
                                     (adjusted with      Adjusted Annual Income
                       Account   withdrawal and Purchase   Amount (5% of the
Date*                   Value          Payments)**        Highest Daily Value)
-----                ----------- ----------------------- ----------------------
November 25, 2009    $119,000.00      $119,000.00              $5,950.00
November 26, 2009                   Thanksgiving Day
November 27, 2009    $118,000.00      $113,986.95              $5,699.35
November 30, 2009    $113,000.00      $113,986.95              $5,699.35
December 01, 2009    $119,000.00      $119,000.00              $5,950.00








.   In this example, the Annuity Anniversary date is December 1. The Valuation
Dates are every day following the first Lifetime Withdrawal. In subsequent
Annuity Years Valuation Dates will be every day following the Annuity
Anniversary. The Annuity Anniversary Date of December 1 is considered the
final Valuation Date for the year.


.   ** In this example, the first daily value after the first withdrawal is
$119,000 on November 25, results in an adjusted Annual Income Amount of
$5,950.00. This amount is adjusted on November 27 to reflect the $5,000
withdrawal. The calculations for the adjustments are:


.   The Account Value of $119,000 on November 25 is first reduced
dollar-for-dollar by $3,500 ($3,500 is the remaining Annual Income
Amount for the Annuity Year), resulting in an adjusted Account Value of
$115,500 before the excess withdrawal.


.   This amount ($115,500) is further reduced by 1.31% (this is the ratio in
the above example which is the excess withdrawal divided by the Account
Value immediately preceding the excess withdrawal) resulting in a
Highest Daily Value of $113,986.95


.   The adjusted Annual Income Amount is carried forward to the next
valuation date of November 30. At this time, we compare this amount to
5% of the Account Value on November 30. Since the November 27 adjusted
Annual Income Amount of $5,699.35 is higher than $5,650.00 (5% of
$113,000), we continue to carry $5,699.35 forward to the next and final
Valuation Date of December 1. The Account Value on December 1 is
$119,000 and 5% of this amount is $5,950. Since this is higher than
$5,699.35, the adjusted Annual Income Amount is reset to $5,950.00.


9





In this example, 5% of the December 1 value results in the highest amount of
$5,950.00. Since this amount is higher than the current year's Annual Income
Amount of $5,921.40 adjusted for excess withdrawals, the Annual Income Amount
for the next Annuity Year, starting on December 2, 2008 and continuing through
December 1, 2009, will be stepped-up to $5,950.00.



Non-Lifetime Withdrawal Feature



You may take a one-time non-lifetime withdrawal ("Non-Lifetime Withdrawal")
under Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus. It is an optional feature of the benefit
that you must elect at the time of your first withdrawal. The amount of the
Non-Lifetime Withdrawal cannot be more than the amount that would cause the
Annuity to be taken below the minimum Surrender Value after the withdrawal for
your Annuity (See "Access to Account Value" in the prospectus). This
Non-Lifetime Withdrawal will not result in the calculation of the initial
Annual Income Amount. However, the total amount of the withdrawal will
proportionally reduce all guarantees associated with the Highest Daily Lifetime
7 Plus benefit. You must tell us if your withdrawal is intended to be the
Non-Lifetime Withdrawal and not the first Lifetime Withdrawal under the Highest
Daily Lifetime 7 Plus benefit. If you don't elect the Non-Lifetime Withdrawal,
the first withdrawal you make will be the first Lifetime Withdrawal that
establishes your Protected Withdrawal Value and Annual Income Amount. Once you
elect to take the Non-Lifetime Withdrawal or Lifetime Withdrawals, no
additional Non-Lifetime Withdrawals may be taken.


The Non-Lifetime Withdrawal will proportionally reduce the Protected Withdrawal
Value, the Return of Principal guarantee, and the Periodic Value guarantees on
the tenth, twentieth and twenty-fifth anniversaries of the benefit effective
date, described above, by the percentage the total withdrawal amount (including
any applicable CDSC) represents of the then current Account Value immediately
prior to the withdrawal.


If you are participating in a Systematic Withdrawal program, the first
withdrawal under the program cannot be classified as the Non-Lifetime
Withdrawal. The first partial withdrawal in payment of any third party
investment advisory service from your Annuity also cannot be classified as the
Non-Lifetime Withdrawal.



Example - Non-Lifetime Withdrawal (proportional reduction)



This example is purely hypothetical and does not reflect the charges for the
benefit or any other fees and charges. It is intended to illustrate the
proportional reduction of the Non-Lifetime Withdrawal under this benefit.


10





Assume the following:


.   The Issue Date is December 1, 2008


.   The Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus benefit is elected on March 5, 2009


.   The Account Value at benefit election was $105,000


.   The Annuitant was 70 years old when he/she elected the Highest Daily
Lifetime 7 Plus benefit.


.   No previous withdrawals have been taken under the Highest Daily Lifetime
7 Plus benefit.


On May 2, 2009, the Protected Withdrawal Value is $125,000, the 10/th/ benefit
year minimum Periodic Value guarantee is $210,000, the 10/th/ benefit year
Return of Principal guarantee is $105,000, the 20/th/ benefit year minimum
Periodic Value guarantee is $420,000, the 25/th/ benefit year minimum Periodic
Value guarantee is $630,000 and the Account Value is $120,000. Assuming $15,000
is withdrawn from the Annuity on May 2, 2009, all guarantees associated with
the Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus benefit will be reduced by the ratio the
total withdrawal amount represents of the Account Value just prior to the
withdrawal being taken.








Here is the calculation:

Withdrawal Amount divided by                                       $    15,000
Account Value before withdrawal                                    $120,000.00
Equals ratio                                                              12.5%

All guarantees will be reduced by the above ratio (12.5%)

Protected Withdrawal Value                                         $   109,375
10/th/ benefit year Return of Premium                              $    91,875
10/th/ benefit year Minimum Periodic Value                         $   183,750
20/th/ benefit year Minimum Periodic Value                         $   367,500
25/th/ benefit year Minimum Periodic Value                         $   551,250









Required Minimum Distributions



Withdrawals that exceed the Annual Income Amount, but which you are required to
take as a required minimum distribution for this Annuity, will not reduce the
Annual Income Amount for future years. No additional Annual Income Amounts will
be available in an Annuity Year due to required minimum distributions unless
the required minimum distribution amount is greater than the Annual Income
Amount. Any withdrawal you take that exceeds the Annual Income Amount in
Annuity Years that your required minimum distribution amount is not greater
than the Annual Income Amount will be treated as an Excess Withdrawal under the
benefit. If the required minimum distribution (as calculated by us for your
Annuity) is greater than the Annual Income Amount, an amount equal to the
remaining Annual Income Amount plus the difference between


11





the required minimum distribution amount and the Annual Income Amount will be
available in the current Annuity Year without it being considered an excess
withdrawal.


Example - required minimum distributions


The following example is purely hypothetical and is intended to illustrate a
scenario in which the required minimum distribution amount in a given Annuity
Year is greater than the Annual Income Amount.



Annual Income Amount = $5,000




Remaining Annual Income Amount = $3,000




Required Minimum Distribution = $6,000



The amount you may withdraw in the current Annuity Year without it being
treated as an Excess Withdrawal is $4,000. ($3,000 +($6,000 - $5,000) = $4,000).


If the $4,000 withdrawal is taken, the remaining Annual Income Amount will be
zero and the remaining required minimum distribution amount of $2,000 may be
taken in the subsequent Annuity Year (when your Annual Income Amount is reset).



Benefits Under the Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus Program



.   To the extent that your Account Value was reduced to zero as a result of
cumulative withdrawals that are less than or equal to the Annual Income
Amount or as a result of the fee that we assess for Highest Daily
Lifetime 7 Plus, and amounts are still payable under Highest Daily
Lifetime 7 Plus, we will make an additional payment, if any, for that
Annuity Year equal to the remaining Annual Income Amount for the Annuity
Year. Thus, in that scenario, the remaining Annual Income Amount would
be payable even though your Account Value was reduced to zero. In
subsequent Annuity Years we make payments that equal the Annual Income
Amount as described in this section. We will make payments until the
death of the single designated life. To the extent that cumulative
withdrawals in the current Annuity Year that reduced your Account Value
to zero are more than the Annual Income Amount, the Highest Daily
Lifetime 7 Plus benefit terminates, and no additional payments are made.
However, if a withdrawal in the latter scenario was taken to meet
minimum distribution requirements under the Annuity, then the benefit
will not terminate, and we will continue to pay the Annual Income Amount
in the form of a fixed Annuity. If Annuity payments are to begin under
the terms of your Annuity, or if you decide to begin receiving Annuity
payments and there is an Annual Income Amount due in subsequent Annuity
Years, you can elect one of the following two options:


(1) apply your Account Value to any Annuity option available; or


12





(2) request that, as of the date Annuity payments are to begin, we make
Annuity payments each year equal to the Annual Income Amount. If this option
is elected, the Annual Income Amount will not increase after annuity
payments have begun. We will make payments until the death of the single
designated life. We must receive your request in a form acceptable to us at
our office.


.   In the absence of an election when mandatory annuity payments are to
begin, we will make annual annuity payments in the form of a single life
fixed annuity with ten payments certain, by applying the greater of the
annuity rates then currently available or the annuity rates guaranteed
in your Annuity. The amount that will be applied to provide such Annuity
payments will be the greater of:


(1) the present value of the future Annual Income Amount payments. Such
present value will be calculated using the greater of the single life fixed
annuity rates then currently available or the single life fixed annuity
rates guaranteed in your Annuity; and


(2) the Account Value.


.   If no Lifetime Withdrawal was ever taken, we will calculate the Annual
Income Amount as if you made your first Lifetime Withdrawal on the date
the annuity payments are to begin.


.   Please note that payments that we make under this benefit after the
Annuity Anniversary coinciding with or next following the annuitant's
95/th/ birthday will be treated as annuity payments.



Other Important Considerations



.   Withdrawals under the Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus benefit are subject
to all of the terms and conditions of the Annuity, including any
applicable CDSC for withdrawals that exceed the Annual Income Amount and
the Non-Lifetime Withdrawal.


.   Withdrawals made while the Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus Benefit is in
effect will be treated, for tax purposes, in the same way as any other
withdrawals under the Annuity.


.   You can make withdrawals from your Annuity while your Account Value is
greater than zero without purchasing the Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus
benefit. The Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus benefit provides a guarantee
that if your Account Value declines due to market performance, you will
be able to receive your Annual Income Amount in the form of periodic
benefit payments.


.   Upon inception of the benefit, 100% of your Account Value must be
allocated to the permitted Sub-accounts.


.   You cannot allocate Purchase Payments or transfer Account Value to the
AST Investment Grade Bond Portfolio Sub-account (see description below)
if you elect this benefit. A summary description of the AST Investment
Grade Bond Portfolio appears within the prospectus section entitled
"What Are The Investment Objectives and Policies of The Portfolios?".
Upon the initial


13





transfer of your Account Value into the AST Investment Grade Bond
Portfolio, we will send a prospectus for that Portfolio to you, along
with your confirmation. In addition, you can find a copy of the AST
Investment Grade Bond Portfolio prospectus by going to
www.prudentialannuities.com.


.   Transfers to and from the elected Sub-accounts and the AST Investment
Grade Bond Portfolio Sub-account triggered by Highest Daily Lifetime 7
Plus will not count toward the maximum number of free transfers
allowable under an Annuity.


.   We currently limit the Sub-accounts in which you may allocate Account
Value if you participate in this benefit. (See "Investment Options"
below and in the prospectus). Moreover, if you are invested in
prohibited investment options and seek to elect the benefit, we will ask
you to reallocate to permitted investment options as a prerequisite to
electing the benefit.


.   The fee for Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus is 0.70% annually of the
greater of Account Value and the Protected Withdrawal Value. We deduct
this fee at the end of each benefit quarter, where each such quarter is
part of a year that begins on the effective date of the benefit or an
anniversary thereafter. Thus, on each such quarter-end (or the next
Valuation Day, if the quarter-end is not a Valuation Day), we deduct
0.175% of the greater of the prior day's Account Value or the prior
day's Protected Withdrawal Value at the end of the quarter. We deduct
the fee pro rata from each of your Sub-accounts including the AST
Investment Grade Bond Portfolio Sub-account. Since this fee is based on
the greater of the prior day's Account Value or the prior day's
Protected Withdrawal Value, the fee for Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus
may be greater than it would have been, had it been based on the Account
Value alone. If the fee to be deducted exceeds the Account Value at the
benefit quarter, we will charge the remainder of the Account Value for
the benefit and continue the benefit as described above.



Election of and Designations under the Program



For Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus, there must be either a single Owner who is
the same as the Annuitant, or if the Annuity is entity owned, there must be a
single natural person Annuitant. In either case, the Annuitant must be at least
45 years old.


Any change of the Annuitant under the Annuity will result in cancellation of
Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus. Similarly, any change of Owner will result in
cancellation of Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus, except if (a) the new Owner has
the same taxpayer identification number as the previous owner, (b) ownership is
transferred from a custodian to the Annuitant, or vice versa or (c) ownership
is transferred from one entity to another entity.


14





Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus can be elected at the time that you purchase your
Annuity or after the Issue Date, subject to our eligibility rules and
restrictions. If you elect Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus and terminate it, you
can re-elect it on any Annuity Anniversary and for the first 30 days following
any Annuity Anniversary. Additionally, if you currently own an Annuity with a
living benefit, you may terminate your existing benefit rider and elect the
benefits offered in this supplement, as set forth under "Termination of
Existing Benefits and Election of New Benefits" below. We reserve the right to
waive, change and/or further limit the election frequency in the future. These
restrictions are waived if the Lifetime Five, Highest Daily Lifetime Five,
Highest Daily Lifetime Seven, Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus, Spousal Lifetime
Five, Spousal Highest Daily Lifetime Seven and Spousal Highest Daily Lifetime 7
Plus benefits were terminated as a result of the death of the Annuitant and the
beneficiary elected to continue the Annuity under the Spousal Assumption
provision.



Termination of the Program



You may terminate Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus at any time by notifying us. If
you terminate the benefit, any guarantee provided by the benefit will terminate
as of the date the termination is effective, and certain restrictions on
re-election will apply as described above. The benefit automatically
terminates: (i) upon your termination of the benefit, (ii) upon your surrender
of the Annuity, (iii) upon your election to begin receiving annuity payments
(although if you have elected to receive the Annual Income Amount in the form
of Annuity payments, we will continue to pay the Annual Income Amount),

(iv) upon our receipt of due proof of the death of the Annuitant, (v) if both
the Account Value and Annual Income Amount equal zero, or (vi) if you cease to
meet our requirements for issuing the benefit (see "Elections and Designations
under the Program").


Upon termination of Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus other than upon the death of
the Annuitant, we impose any accrued fee for the benefit (i.e., the fee for the
pro-rated portion of the year since the fee was last assessed), and thereafter
we cease deducting the charge for the benefit. With regard to your investment
allocations, upon termination we will: (i) leave intact amounts that are held
in the variable investment options, and (ii) transfer all amounts held in the
AST Investment Grade Bond Portfolio Sub-account to your variable investment
options, based on your existing allocation instructions or (in the absence of
such existing instructions) pro rata (i.e. in the same proportion as the
current balances in your variable investment options).


If a surviving spouse elects to continue the Annuity, the Highest Daily
Lifetime 7 Plus benefit terminates. The spouse may elect the benefit subject to
the restrictions discussed above.

How Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus Transfers Account Value Between Your
Permitted Sub-accounts and the AST Investment Grade Bond Sub-Account


As indicated above, we limit the Sub-accounts to which you may allocate Account
Value if you elect Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus. For purposes of this benefit,
we refer to those permitted Sub-accounts as the "Permitted Sub-accounts". An
integral part of Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus is the pre-determined
mathematical formula used to transfer Account Value between the Permitted
Sub-Accounts and a specified bond fund within the Advanced Series Trust (the
"AST Investment Grade Bond Sub-Account"). The AST Investment Grade Bond
Sub-account is available only with this benefit, and thus you may not allocate
Purchase Payments to the AST Investment Grade Bond Sub-account. The
mathematical formula monitors your Account Value daily and, if dictated by the
formula, systematically transfers amounts between the Permitted Sub-accounts
you have chosen and the AST Investment Grade Bond Sub-account. The formula is
set forth in Appendix F, below.


Speaking generally, the formula, which is applied each Valuation Day, operates
as follows. The formula starts by identifying an income basis for that day and
then multiplies that figure by 5%, to produce a projected (i.e., hypothetical)
income amount. Note that 5% is used in the formula, irrespective of the
Annuitant's attained age. Then it produces an estimate of the total amount
targeted in our allocation model, based on the projected income amount and
factors set forth in the formula. In the formula, we refer to that value as the
"Target Value" or "L". If you have already made a withdrawal, your projected
income amount (and thus your Target Value) would take into account any
automatic step-up, any subsequent Purchase Payments, and any excess
withdrawals. Next, the formula subtracts from the Target Value the amount held
within the AST Investment Grade Bond Sub-account on that day, and divides that
difference by the amount held within the Permitted Sub-accounts. That ratio,
which essentially isolates the amount of your Target Value that is not offset
by amounts held within the AST Investment Grade Bond Sub-account, is called the
"Target Ratio" or "r". If, on each of three consecutive Valuation Days, the
Target Ratio is greater than 83% but less than or equal to 84.5%, we will, on
such third Valuation Day, make a transfer from the Permitted Sub-accounts in
which you are invested (subject to the 90% cap discussed below) to the AST
Investment Grade Bond Sub-account. Once a transfer is made, the three
consecutive Valuation Days begin again. If, however, on any Valuation Day, the
Target Ratio is above 84.5%, it will make a transfer from the Permitted
Sub-accounts (subject to the 90% cap) to the AST Investment Grade Bond
Sub-account. If the Target Ratio falls below 78% on any Valuation Day, then a
transfer from the AST Investment Grade Bond Sub-account to the Permitted
Sub-accounts will occur. Notwithstanding the above, we will not execute a
transfer that results in more than 90% of your Account Value being allocated to
the AST Investment


16





Grade Bond Sub-account ("90% cap"). Thus, on any Valuation Day, if the formula
would require a transfer that would result in more than 90% of the Account
Value being allocated to the AST Investment Grade Bond Sub-account, only the
amount that results in exactly 90% of the Account Value being allocated to the
AST Investment Grade Bond Sub-account will be transferred. In addition, future
transfers into the AST Investment Grade Bond Sub-account will be suspended
(regardless of the performance of the AST Investment Grade Bond Sub-account and
the Permitted Sub-accounts) until there is first a transfer out of the AST
Investment Grade Bond Sub-account. Once a subsequent transfer occurs out of the
AST Investment Grade Sub-account, the suspension will be removed and amounts
may be transferred to the AST Investment Grade Bond Sub-account if dictated by
the formula (subject to the 90% cap). However, it is possible that, due to the
subsequent investment performance of your allocations in the Permitted
Sub-accounts you have selected and the amount of your Account Value in the AST
Investment Grade Bond Sub-account, your Account Value could be more than 90%
invested in the AST Investment Grade Bond Sub-account.


As you can glean from the formula, poor or flat investment performance of your
Account Value may result in a transfer of a portion of your variable Account
Value to the AST Investment Grade Bond Sub-account because such poor investment
performance will tend to increase the Target Ratio. Because the amount
allocated to the AST Investment Grade Bond Sub-account and the amount allocated
to the Permitted Sub-accounts each is a variable in the formula, the investment
performance of each affects whether a transfer occurs for your Annuity. In
deciding how much to transfer, we use another formula, which essentially seeks
to re-balance amounts held in the Permitted Sub-accounts and the AST Investment
Grade Bond Sub-account so that the Target Ratio meets a target, which currently
is equal to 80%. Once you elect Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus, the values we
use to compare to the Target Ratio will be fixed. For newly-issued Annuities
that elect Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus and existing Annuities that elect
Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus in the future, however, we reserve the right to
change such values.


Additionally, on each monthly Annuity Anniversary (if the monthly Annuity
Anniversary does not fall on a Valuation Day, the next Valuation Day will be
used), following all of the above described daily calculations, a transfer may
be made from the AST Investment Grade Bond Sub-account to the Permitted
Sub-accounts. Any such transfer will be in the same proportion that each such
Sub-account bears to your total Account Value, immediately before the transfer.
This transfer will automatically occur provided that the Target Ratio, as
described above, would be less than 83% after the transfer. The formula will
not execute a transfer if the Target Ratio after this transfer would occur
would be greater than or equal to 83%.


17





The amount of the transfer will be equal to the lesser of:


a)  The total value of all your Account Value in the AST Investment Grade
Bond Sub-account, or


b)  An amount equal to 5% of your total Account Value.


While you are not notified when your Annuity reaches a transfer trigger under
the formula, you will receive a confirmation statement indicating the transfer
of a portion of your Account Value either to or from the AST Investment Grade
Bond Sub-account. The formula by which the transfer operates is designed
primarily to mitigate the financial risks that we incur in providing the
guarantee under Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus.


Depending on the results of the calculations of the mathematical formula, we
may, on any Valuation Day:


.   Not make any transfer between the Permitted Sub-accounts and the AST
Investment Grade Bond Sub-account; or


.   If a portion of your Account Value was previously allocated to the AST
Investment Grade Bond Sub-account, transfer all or a portion of those
amounts to the Permitted Sub-accounts, based on your existing allocation
instructions or (in the absence of such existing instructions) pro rata
(i.e., in the same proportion as the current balances in your variable
investment options). (Please see above regarding allocations made
pursuant to the monthly calculation); or


.   Transfer a portion (which may be substantial) of your Account Value in
the Permitted Sub-accounts pro-rata to the AST Investment Grade Bond
Sub-account.


The amount and timing of transfers to and from the AST Investment Grade Bond
Sub-account pursuant to the mathematical formula depends upon a number of
factors unique to YOUR Annuity (and is not necessarily directly correlated with
the securities markets, bond markets, or interest rates, in general) including:


.   How long you have owned Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus or Spousal Highest
Daily Lifetime 7 Plus;


.   The performance of the Permitted Sub-accounts you have chosen;


.   The performance of the AST Investment Grade Bond Sub-account;


.   The amount you have allocated to each of the Permitted Sub-accounts you
have chosen;


.   The amount you have allocated to the AST Investment Grade Bond
Sub-account;


.   Additional Purchase Payments, if any, you make to your Annuity; and


.   Withdrawals, if any, you take from your Annuity (withdrawals are taken
pro rata from your Account Value).


18





The more of your Account Value allocated to the AST Investment Grade Bond
Sub-account under the formula, the greater the impact of the performance of
that Sub-account in determining whether (and how much) your Account Value is
transferred back to the Permitted Sub-accounts. Further, it is possible under
the formula that, if a significant portion of your Account Value is allocated
to the AST Investment Grade Bond Sub-account and that Sub-account has good
performance but the performance of your Permitted Sub-accounts is negative,
that the formula might transfer your Account Value to the Permitted
Sub-accounts. Similarly, the more you have allocated to the Permitted
Sub-accounts, the greater the impact of the performance of those Sub-accounts
will have on any transfer to the AST Investment Grade Bond Sub-account.


If you make additional Purchase Payments to your Annuity, they will be
allocated according to your allocation instructions. Once they are allocated to
your Annuity, they will also be subject to the mathematical formula described
above and therefore may be transferred to the AST Investment Grade Bond
Portfolio, if dictated by the formula.


Any Account Value in the AST Investment Grade Bond Sub-account will not be
available to participate in the investment experience of the Permitted
Sub-accounts if there is a subsequent market recovery until it is transferred
out of the AST Investment Grade Bond Sub-account.



Additional Tax Considerations



If you purchase an annuity as an investment vehicle for "qualified"
investments, including an IRA, SEP-IRA, Tax Sheltered Annuity (or 403(b)) or
employer plan under Code Section 401(a), the required minimum distribution
rules under the Code provide that you begin receiving periodic amounts from
your annuity beginning after age 70  1/2. For a Tax Sheltered Annuity or a
401(a) plan for which the participant is not a greater than five (5) percent
owner of the employer, this required beginning date can generally be deferred
to retirement, if later. Roth IRAs are not subject to these rules during the
owner's lifetime. The amount required under the Code may exceed the Annual
Income Amount, which will cause us to increase the Annual Income Amount in any
Annuity Year that required minimum distributions due from your Annuity are
greater than such amounts. In addition, the amount and duration of payments
under the annuity payment and death benefit provisions may be adjusted so that
the payments do not trigger any penalty or excise taxes due to tax
considerations such as required minimum distribution provisions under the tax
law. Please note, however, that any withdrawal (except the Non-Lifetime
Withdrawal) you take prior to the Tenth Anniversary, even if withdrawn to
satisfy required minimum distribution


19





rules, will cause you to lose the ability to receive the Return of Principal
Guarantee and the guaranteed amount described above under "KEY FEATURE -
Protected Withdrawal Value".


As indicated, withdrawals made while this benefit is in effect will be treated,
for tax purposes, in the same way as any other withdrawals under the Annuity.
Please see the Tax Considerations section of the prospectus for a detailed
discussion of the tax treatment of withdrawals. We do not address each
potential tax scenario that could arise with respect to this benefit here.
However, we do note that if you participate in Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus
through a non-qualified annuity, as with all withdrawals, once all Purchase
Payments are returned under the Annuity, all subsequent withdrawal amounts will
be taxed as ordinary income.



Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus with Beneficiary Income Option/SM/



We offer an optional death benefit feature under Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus,
the amount of which is linked to your Annual Income Amount. We refer to this
optional death benefit as the Beneficiary Income Option or BIO. (This option is
not currently available in New York.) You may choose Highest Daily Lifetime 7
Plus without also selecting the Beneficiary Income Option death benefit. You
must elect the Beneficiary Income Option death benefit at the time you elect
Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus.


If you elect this death benefit, you may not elect any other optional benefit.
You may elect the Beneficiary Income Option death benefit so long as the
Annuitant is no older than age 75 at the time of election. For purposes of this
optional death benefit, we calculate the Annual Income Amount and Protected
Withdrawal Value in the same manner that we do under Highest Daily Lifetime 7
Plus itself. However, we will stop determining the Periodic Value (as described
above) on the earlier of your first Lifetime Withdrawal after the effective
date of the benefit or the Tenth Anniversary Date. This means that under the
Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus with BIO benefit you will not be eligible for the
guaranteed minimum Periodic Values described above on the 20/th/ and 25/th
/Anniversary of the Benefit Effective Date. If you choose the Highest Daily
Lifetime 7 Plus with BIO, the maximum charge is 2.00% of the greater of Account
Value and the Protected Withdrawal Value ("PWV") annually. We deduct the
current charge of 0.95% of the greater of the Account Value and the PWV at the
end of each quarter, where each such quarter is part of a year that begins on
the effective date of the benefit or an anniversary thereafter. Thus, on each
such quarter-end (or the next Valuation Day, if the quarter-end is not a
Valuation Day), we deduct 0.2375% of the greater of the prior day's Account
Value or the prior day's Protected Withdrawal Value at the end of the quarter.
We deduct the fee pro rata from each of your Sub-accounts including the AST
Investment Grade Bond Sub-account. Because the fee for this benefit is based


20





on the greater of the prior day's Account Value or the prior day's Protected
Withdrawal Value, the fee for Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus with the
Beneficiary Income Option may be greater than it would have been based on the
Account Value alone.


Upon a death that triggers payment of a death benefit under the Annuity, we
identify the following amounts: (a) the amount of the basic death benefit under
the Annuity, (b) the Protected Withdrawal Value (less any Credits associated
with Purchase Payments applied within 12 months prior to the date of death),
and (c) the Annual Income Amount. If there were no Lifetime Withdrawals prior
to the date of death, then we calculate the Protected Withdrawal Value for
purposes of this death benefit as of the date of death, and we calculate the
Annual Income Amount as if there were a withdrawal on the date of death. If
there were Lifetime Withdrawals prior to the date of death, then we set the
Protected Withdrawal Value and Annual Income Amount for purposes of this death
benefit as of the date that we receive due proof of death.


If there is one beneficiary, he/she must choose to receive either the basic
death benefit (in a lump sum or other permitted form of distribution) or the
Beneficiary Income Option death benefit (in the form of periodic payments of
the Annual Income Amount - such payments may be annual or at other intervals
that we permit). If there are multiple beneficiaries, each beneficiary is
presented with the same choice. Each beneficiary can choose to take his/her
portion of either (a) the basic death benefit, or (b) the Beneficiary Income
Option death benefit. In order to receive the Beneficiary Income Option death
benefit, each beneficiary's share of the death benefit proceeds must be
allocated as a percentage of the total death benefit to be paid. We allow a
beneficiary who has opted to receive the Annual Income Amount to designate
another beneficiary, who would receive any remaining payments upon the former
beneficiary's death. Note also that the final payment, exhausting the Protected
Withdrawal Value, may be less than the Annual Income Amount.


Here is an example to illustrate how the death benefit may be paid:


.   Assume that (i) the basic death benefit is $50,000, the Protected
Withdrawal Value is $100,000, and the Annual Income Amount is $5,000;

(ii) there are two beneficiaries (the first designated to receive 75% of
the death benefit and the second designated to receive 25% of the death
benefit); (iii) the first beneficiary chooses to receive his/her portion
of the death benefit in the form of the Annual Income Amount, and the
second beneficiary chooses to receive his/her portion of the death
benefit with reference to the basic death benefit.


.   Under those assumptions, the first beneficiary will be paid a pro-rated
portion of the Annual Income Amount for 20 years (the 20 year pay out
period is derived from the $5,000 Annual


21





Income Amount, paid each year until it exhausts the entire $100,000 Protected
Withdrawal Value). The pro-rated portion of the Annual Income Amount, equal to
$3,750 annually (i.e., the first beneficiary's 75% share multiplied by $5,000),
is then paid each year for the 20 year period. Payment of $3,750 for 20 years
results in total payments of $75,000 (i.e., the first beneficiary's 75% share
of the $100,000 Protected Withdrawal Value). The second beneficiary would
receive 25% of the basic death benefit amount (or $12,500).


If you elect to terminate Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus with Beneficiary Income
Option, both Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus and that death benefit option will
be terminated. You may not terminate the death benefit option without
terminating the entire benefit. If you terminate Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus
with Beneficiary Income Option, your ability to elect other optional living
benefits will be affected as indicated in the "Election and Designations under
the Program" section, above.



Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus with Lifetime Income Accelerator/SM/.



We offer another version of Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus that we call Highest
Daily Lifetime 7 Plus with Lifetime Income Accelerator ("Highest Daily Lifetime
7 Plus with LIA"). This version is only being offered in those jurisdictions
where we have received regulatory approval and will be offered subsequently in
other jurisdictions when we receive regulatory approval in those jurisdictions.
(This option is not currently available in New York.) Highest Daily Lifetime 7
Plus with LIA is offered as an alternative to other lifetime withdrawal
options. If you elect this benefit, you may not elect any other optional
benefit. The income benefit under Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus with LIA
currently is based on a single "designated life" who is between the ages of 45
and 75 on the date that the benefit is elected.


Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus with LIA guarantees, until the death of the
single designated life, the ability to withdraw an amount equal to double the
Annual Income Amount (which we refer to as the "LIA Amount") if you meet the
conditions set forth below. If you choose the Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus
with LIA, the maximum charge is 2.00% of the greater of Account Value and the
Protected Withdrawal Value ("PWV") annually. We deduct the current charge of
0.95% of the greater of Account Value and the PWV at the end of each quarter,
where each such quarter is part of a year that begins on the effective date of
the benefit or an anniversary thereafter. Thus, on each such quarter-end (or
the next Valuation Day, if the quarter-end is not a Valuation Day), we deduct
0.2375% of the greater of the prior day's Account Value, or the prior day's
Protected Withdrawal Value at the end of the quarter. We deduct the fee pro
rata from each of your Sub-accounts including the AST Investment Grade Bond
Sub-account. Since this fee is based on the


22





greater of the prior day's Account Value or the prior day's Protected
Withdrawal Value, the fee for Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus with LIA may be
greater than it would have been, had it been based on the Account Value alone.
If the fee to be deducted exceeds the current Account Value, we will reduce the
Account Value to zero, and continue the benefit as described below.


If this benefit is being elected on an Annuity held as a 403(b) plan, then in
addition to meeting the eligibility requirements listed below for the LIA
Amount you must separately qualify for distributions from the 403(b) plan
itself.


You may choose Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus without also electing LIA, however
you may not elect LIA without Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus. All terms and
conditions of Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus apply to this version of the
benefit, except as described herein. Currently, if you elect Highest Daily
Lifetime 7 Plus with LIA and subsequently terminate the benefit, you will be
able to re-elect Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus with LIA but all conditions of
the benefit described below must be met, and you may be subject to a waiting
period until you can elect this or another lifetime withdrawal benefit.


Eligibility Requirements for LIA Amount. Both a waiting period of 36 months
from the benefit effective date, and an elimination period of 120 days, from
the date of notification that one or both of the requirements described
immediately below have been met, apply before you can become eligible for the
LIA Amount. Assuming the 36 month waiting period has been met and we have
received the notification referenced in the immediately preceding sentence, the
LIA amount would be available for withdrawal on the Valuation Day immediately
after the 120/th/ day. The waiting period and the elimination period may run
concurrently. In addition to satisfying the waiting and elimination period, at
least one of the following requirements ("LIA conditions") must be met.


(1) The designated life is confined to a qualified nursing facility. A
qualified nursing facility is a facility operated pursuant to law or any state
licensed facility providing medically necessary in-patient care which is
prescribed by a licensed physician in writing and based on physical limitations
which prohibit daily living in a non-institutional setting.


(2) The designated life is unable to perform two or more basic abilities of
caring for oneself or "activities of daily living." We define these basic
abilities as:


i. Eating: Feeding oneself by getting food into the body from a receptacle
(such as a plate, cup or table) or by a feeding tube or intravenously.


ii. Dressing: Putting on and taking off all items of clothing and any
necessary braces, fasteners or artificial limbs.


23





iii. Bathing: Washing oneself by sponge bath; or in either a tub or shower,
including the task of getting into or out of the tub or shower.


iv. Toileting: Getting to and from the toilet, getting on and off the
toilet, and performing associated personal hygiene.


v. Transferring: Moving into or out of a bed, chair or wheelchair.


vi. Continence: Maintaining control of bowel or bladder function; or when
unable to maintain control of bowel or bladder function, the ability to perform
personal hygiene (including caring for catheter or colostomy bag).


You must notify us when the LIA conditions have been met. If, when we receive
such notification, there are more than 120 days remaining until the end of the
waiting period described above, you will not be eligible for the LIA Amount. If
there are 120 days or less remaining until the end of the waiting period when
we receive notification that the LIA conditions are met, we will determine
eligibility for the LIA Amount through our then current administrative process,
which may include, but is not limited to, documentation verifying the LIA
conditions and/or an assessment by a third party of our choice. Such assessment
may be in person and we will assume any costs associated with the
aforementioned assessment. Once eligibility is determined, the LIA Amount is
equal to double the Annual Income Amount as described above under the Highest
Daily Lifetime 7 Plus Benefit.


Additionally, we will reassess your eligibility on an annual basis although
your LIA benefit for the year that immediately precedes our reassessment will
not be affected if it is determined that you are no longer eligible. Your first
reassessment may occur in the same year as your initial assessment. If we
determine that you are no longer eligible to receive the LIA Amount, upon the
next Annuity Anniversary the Annual Income Amount would replace the LIA Amount.
There is no limit on the number of times you can become eligible for the LIA
Amount, however, each time would require the completion of the 120-day
elimination period, notification that the designated life meets the LIA
conditions, and determination, through our then current administrative process,
that you are eligible for the LIA Amount, each as described above.


LIA amount at the first Lifetime Withdrawal. If your first lifetime withdrawal
subsequent to election of Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus with LIA occurs while
you are eligible for the LIA Amount, the available LIA Amount is equal to
double the Annual Income Amount.


LIA amount after the First Lifetime Withdrawal. If you become eligible for the
LIA Amount after you have taken your first lifetime withdrawal, the available
LIA amount for the current and


24





subsequent Annuity Years is equal to double the then current Annual Income
Amount, however the available LIA amount in the current Annuity Year is reduced
by any withdrawals that have been taken in the current Annuity Year. Cumulative
withdrawals in an Annuity Year which are less than or equal to the LIA Amount
(when eligible for the LIA amount) will not reduce your LIA Amount in
subsequent Annuity Years, but any such withdrawals will reduce the LIA Amount
on a dollar-for-dollar basis in that Annuity Year.


Withdrawals In Excess of the LIA amount. If your cumulative lifetime
withdrawals in an Annuity Year are in excess of the LIA Amount when you are
eligible ("Excess Withdrawal"), your LIA Amount in subsequent years will be
reduced (except with regard to required minimum distributions) by the result of
the ratio of the excess portion of the withdrawal to the Account Value
immediately prior to the Excess Withdrawal. Reductions include the actual
amount of the withdrawal, including any CDSC that may apply. Withdrawals of any
amount (excluding the Non-Lifetime Withdrawal) up to and including the LIA
Amount will reduce the Protected Withdrawal Value by the amount of the
withdrawal. Excess Withdrawals will reduce the Protected Withdrawal Value by
the same ratio as the reduction to the LIA Amount. Any withdrawals that are
less than or equal to the LIA amount (when eligible) but in excess of the free
withdrawal amount available under this Annuity will not incur a CDSC.


Withdrawals are not required. However, subsequent to the first lifetime
withdrawal, the LIA Amount is not increased in subsequent Annuity Years if you
decide not to take a withdrawal in an Annuity Year or take withdrawals in an
Annuity Year that in total are less than the LIA Amount.


Purchase Payments. If you are eligible for the LIA Amount as described under
"Eligibility Requirements for LIA Amount" and you make an additional Purchase
Payment, we will increase your LIA Amount by double the amount we add to your
Annual Income Amount.


Step Ups. If your Annual Income Amount is stepped up, your LIA Amount will be
stepped up to equal double the stepped up Annual Income Amount.


Guarantee Payments. If your Account Value is reduced to zero as a result of
cumulative withdrawals that are equal to or less than the LIA Amount, or as a
result of the fee that we assess for Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus with LIA,
and there is still a LIA Amount available, we will make an additional payment
for that Annuity Year equal to the remaining LIA Amount. Thus, in that
scenario, the remaining LIA Amount would be payable even though your Account
Value was reduced to zero. In subsequent Annuity Years we make payments that
equal the LIA Amount as


25





described in this section. We will make payments until the death of the single
designated life. Should the designated life no longer qualify for the LIA
amount (as described under "Eligibility Requirements for LIA Amount" above),
the Annual Income Amount would continue to be available. Subsequent eligibility
for the LIA Amount would require the completion of the 120 day elimination
period as well as meeting the LIA conditions listed above under "Eligibility
Requirements for LIA Amount". To the extent that cumulative withdrawals in the
current Annuity Year that reduce your Account Value to zero are more than the
LIA Amount (except in the case of required minimum distributions), Highest
Daily Lifetime 7 Plus with LIA terminates, and no additional payments are made.


Annuity Options. In addition to the Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus Annuity
Options described above, after the 10th benefit anniversary you may also
request that we make annuity payments each year equal to the Annual Income
Amount. In any year that you are eligible for the LIA Amount, we make annuity
payments equal to the LIA Amount. If you would receive a greater payment by
applying your Account Value to receive payments for life under your Annuity, we
will pay the greater amount. Prior to the 10th benefit anniversary this option
is not available.


We will continue to make payments until the death of the Designated Life. If
this option is elected, the Annual Income Amount and LIA Amount will not
increase after annuity payments have begun.


If you elect Highest Daily Lifetime 7 with LIA, and never meet the eligibility
requirements you will not receive any additional payments based on the LIA
Amount.



SPOUSAL HIGHEST DAILY LIFETIME 7 PLUS/SM/ INCOME BENEFIT (SHD7 Plus)/SM/



Spousal Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus is the spousal version of Highest Daily
Lifetime 7 Plus. Currently, if you elect Spousal Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus
and subsequently terminate the benefit, you may have a waiting period until you
can elect another lifetime withdrawal benefit. See "Termination of Existing
Benefits and Election New Benefits" for details. Spousal Highest Daily Lifetime
7 Plus must be elected based on two Designated Lives, as described below. The
youngest Designated Life must be at least 50 years old and the oldest
Designated Life must be at least 55 years old when the benefit is elected.
Spousal Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus is not available if you elect any other
optional benefit. As long as your Spousal Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus Benefit
is in effect, you must allocate your Account Value in accordance with the then
permitted and available investment option(s) with this program. For a more
detailed description of permitted investment options, see the Investment
options section of the prospectus and this supplement below.


26





We offer a benefit that guarantees until the later death of two natural persons
who are each other's spouses at the time of election of the benefit and at the
first death of one of them (the "Designated Lives", and each, a "Designated
Life") the ability to withdraw an annual amount (the "Annual Income Amount")
equal to a percentage of an initial principal value (the "Protected Withdrawal
Value") regardless of the impact of market performance on the Account Value,
subject to our program rules regarding the timing and amount of withdrawals. We
also permit a one-time Non-Lifetime Withdrawal from your Annuity prior to
taking Lifetime Withdrawals under the benefit. The benefit may be appropriate
if you intend to make periodic withdrawals from your Annuity, wish to ensure
that market performance will not affect your ability to receive annual
payments, and wish either spouse to be able to continue the Spousal Highest
Daily Lifetime 7 Plus benefit after the death of the first spouse. You are not
required to make withdrawals as part of the program - the guarantees are not
lost if you withdraw less than the maximum allowable amount each year under the
rules of the benefit. As discussed below, we require that you participate in
our asset transfer program in order to participate in Spousal Highest Daily
Lifetime 7 Plus.


Although you are guaranteed to withdraw your Annual Income Amount for life even
if your Account Value falls to zero, if you take excess withdrawals, it is
possible that your Annual Income Amount could also fall to zero. In that
scenario, no further amount would be payable under Spousal Highest Daily
Lifetime 7 Plus.



Key Feature - Protected Withdrawal Value



The Protected Withdrawal Value is used to calculate the initial Annual Income
Amount. The Protected Withdrawal Value is separate from your Account Value and
not available as cash or a lump sum. On the effective date of the benefit, the
Protected Withdrawal Value is equal to your Account Value. On each Valuation
Day thereafter until the date of your first Lifetime Withdrawal (excluding any
Non-Lifetime Withdrawal discussed below), the Protected Withdrawal Value is
equal to the "Periodic Value" described in the next paragraph.


The "Periodic Value" initially is equal to the Account Value on the effective
date of the benefit. On each Valuation Day thereafter until the first Lifetime
Withdrawal, we recalculate the Periodic Value. We stop determining the Periodic
Value upon your first Lifetime Withdrawal after the


27





effective date of the benefit. On each Valuation Day (the "Current Valuation
Day"), the Periodic Value is equal to the greater of:


(1) the Periodic Value for the immediately preceding business day (the
"Prior Valuation Day") appreciated at the daily equivalent of 7% annually
during the calendar day(s) between the Prior Valuation Day and the Current
Valuation Day (i.e., one day for successive Valuation Days, but more than
one calendar day for Valuation Days that are separated by weekends and/or
holidays), plus the amount of any adjusted Purchase Payment made on the
Current Valuation Day; and


(2) the Account Value.


If you have not made a Lifetime Withdrawal on or before the 10/th/, 20/th/, or
25/th/ Anniversary of the effective date of the benefit, your Periodic Value on
the 10/th/, 20/th/, or 25/th/ Anniversary of the benefit effective date is
equal to the greatest of:


(1) the Periodic Value described above or,


(2) the sum of:


(a) 200% (on the 10/th/ anniversary), 400% (on the 20/th/ anniversary)
or 600% (on the 25/th/ anniversary) of the Account Value on the
effective date of the benefit;


(b) 200% (on the 10/th/ anniversary), 400% (on the 20/th/ anniversary)
or 600% (on the 25/th/ anniversary) of all adjusted Purchase Payments
made within one year of the effective date of the benefit; and


(c) All adjusted Purchase Payments made after one year following the
effective date of the benefit.


If you elect Spousal Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus with Beneficiary Income
Option ("BIO") (see below), we will stop determining the Periodic Value (as
described above) on the earlier of your first Lifetime Withdrawal after the
effective date of the benefit or the Tenth Anniversary of the effective date
of the benefit ("Tenth Anniversary"). This means that under the Spousal
Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus with BIO benefit you will not be eligible for
the guaranteed minimum Periodic Values described above on the 20/th/ and
25/th /Anniversary of the Benefit Effective Date



Return of Principal Guarantee



If you have not made a Lifetime Withdrawal before the Tenth Anniversary, we
will increase your Account Value on that Tenth Anniversary (or the next
Valuation Day, if that anniversary is not a Valuation Day), if the requirements
set forth in this paragraph are met. On the Tenth Anniversary, we add:


a) your Account Value on the day that you elected Spousal Highest Daily
Lifetime 7 Plus; and


28





b) the sum of each Purchase Payment (including the amount of any associated
Credits) you made during the one-year period after you elected the benefit.


If the sum of (a) and (b) is greater than your Account Value on the Tenth
Anniversary, we increase your Account Value to equal the sum of (a) and (b), by
contributing funds from our general account. If the sum of (a) and (b) is less
than or equal to your Account Value on the Tenth Anniversary, we make no such
adjustment. The amount that we add to your Account Value under this provision
will be allocated to each of your variable investment options (including than
the AST Investment Grade Bond Sub-account used with this benefit), in the same
proportion that each such Sub-account bears to your total Account Value,
immediately before the application of the amount. Any such amount will not be
considered a Purchase Payment when calculating your Protected Withdrawal Value,
your death benefit, or the amount of any optional benefit that you may have
selected, and therefore will have no direct impact on any such values at the
time we add this amount. This potential addition to Account Value is available
only if you have elected Spousal Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus and if you meet
the conditions set forth in this paragraph. Thus, if you take a withdrawal,
including a required minimum distribution, (other than a Non-Lifetime
Withdrawal) prior to the Tenth Anniversary, you are not eligible to receive the
Return of Principal Guarantee.


Key Feature - Annual Income Amount under the Spousal Highest Daily Lifetime 7
Plus Benefit


The Annual Income Amount is equal to a specified percentage of the Protected
Withdrawal Value. The percentage initially depends on the age of the youngest
Designated Life on the date of the first Lifetime Withdrawal after election of
the benefit. The percentages are: 4% for ages 50 - less than 59  1/2, 5% for
ages 59  1/2 - 79, 6% for ages 80 to 84, 7% for ages 85 to 89, and 8% for ages
90 and older. We use the age of the youngest Designated Life even if that
Designated Life is no longer a participant under the Annuity due to death or
divorce. Under the Spousal Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus benefit, if your
cumulative Lifetime Withdrawals in an Annuity Year are less than or equal to
the Annual Income Amount, they will not reduce your Annual Income Amount in
subsequent Annuity Years, but any such withdrawals will reduce the Annual
Income Amount on a dollar-for-dollar basis in that Annuity Year. If your
cumulative Lifetime Withdrawals are in excess of the Annual Income Amount for
any Annuity Year ("Excess Income"), your Annual Income Amount in subsequent
years will be reduced (except with regard to required minimum distributions for
this Annuity that comply with our rules) by the result of the ratio of the
Excess Income to the Account Value immediately prior to such withdrawal (see
examples of this


29





calculation below). Reductions are based on the actual amount of the
withdrawal, including any CDSC that may apply. Lifetime Withdrawals of any
amount up to and including the Annual Income Amount will reduce the Protected
Withdrawal Value by the amount of the withdrawal. Withdrawals of Excess Income
will reduce the Protected Withdrawal Value by the same ratio as the reduction
to the Annual Income Amount.


You may use the Systematic Withdrawal program to make withdrawals of the Annual
Income Amount. Any systematic withdrawal will be deemed a Lifetime Withdrawal
under this benefit.


Any Purchase Payment that you make subsequent to the election of Spousal
Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus will (i) increase the then-existing Annual Income
Amount by an amount equal to a percentage of the Purchase Payment (including
the amount of any associated Credit) based on the age of the younger Annuitant
at the time of the first Lifetime Withdrawal (the percentages are: 4% for ages

50 - less than 59  1/2, 5% for ages 59  1/2 - 79, 6% for ages 80-84, 7% for
ages 85-89, and 8% for ages 90 and older), and (ii) increase the Protected
Withdrawal Value by the amount of the Purchase Payment (including the amount of
any associated Credit).


Note that if your withdrawal of the Annual Income Amount in a given Annuity
Year exceeds the applicable free withdrawal amount under the Annuity (but is
not considered Excess Income), we will not impose any CDSC on the amount of
that withdrawal.



Highest Daily Auto Step-Up



An automatic step-up feature ("Highest Daily Auto Step-Up") is part of this
benefit. As detailed in this paragraph, the Highest Daily Auto Step-Up feature
can result in a larger Annual Income Amount if your Account Value increases
subsequent to your first Lifetime Withdrawal. The Highest Daily Step-Up
starting with the anniversary of the Issue Date of the Annuity (the "Annuity
Anniversary") immediately after your first withdrawal under the benefit.
Specifically, upon the first such Annuity Anniversary, we identify the Account
Value on each Valuation Day within the immediately preceding Annuity Year after
your first Lifetime Withdrawal. Having identified the highest daily value, we
then multiply each such value by a percentage that varies based on the age of
the youngest Designated Life) on the Annuity Anniversary as of which the
step-up would occur. The percentages are 4% for ages 50 - less than 59 1/2, 5%
for ages 59  1/2 - 79, 6% for ages 80-84, 7% for ages 85-89, and 8% for ages 90
and older. Thus, we multiply the highest daily value by the applicable
percentage, adjust each such highest daily value for subsequent withdrawals and
Purchase Payments, and then select the highest of those values. If the highest
of those values exceeds the existing Annual Income Amount, we replace the
existing amount with


30





the new, higher amount. Otherwise, we leave the existing Annual Income Amount
intact. In later years (i.e., after the first Annuity Anniversary after the
first Lifetime Withdrawal), we determine whether an automatic step-up should
occur on each Annuity Anniversary by performing a similar examination of the
Account Values that occurred on Valuation Days during the year. At the time
that we increase your Annual Income Amount, we also increase your Protected
Withdrawal Value (if it is higher than your Protected Withdrawal Value prior to
the daily step-up, your Protected Withdrawal Value will never be decreased as a
result of a step-up) to equal the highest daily value upon which your step-up
was based. If, on the date that we implement a Highest Daily Auto Step-Up to
your Annual Income Amount, the charge for Spousal Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus
has changed for new purchasers, you may be subject to the new charge at the
time of such step-up. Prior to increasing your charge for Spousal Highest Daily
Lifetime 7 Plus upon a step-up, we would notify you, and give you the
opportunity to cancel the automatic step-up feature. If you receive notice of a
proposed step-up and accompanying fee increase, you should carefully evaluate
whether the amount of the step-up justifies the increased fee to which you will
be subject.


If you establish a Systematic Withdrawal program, we will not automatically
increase the withdrawal amount when there is an increase to the Annual Income
Amount, unless you instruct us otherwise.


The Spousal Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus program does not affect your ability
to make withdrawals under your Annuity, or limit your ability to request
withdrawals that exceed the Annual Income Amount. Under Spousal Highest Daily
Lifetime 7 Plus, if your cumulative withdrawals in an Annuity Year are less
than or equal to the Annual Income Amount, they will not reduce your Annual
Income Amount in subsequent Annuity Years, but any such withdrawals will reduce
the Annual Income Amount on a dollar-for-dollar basis in that Annuity Year.


If, cumulatively, you withdraw an amount less than the Annual Income Amount in
any Annuity Year, you cannot carry-over the unused portion of the Annual Income
Amount to subsequent Annuity Years.


Because each of the Protected Withdrawal Value and Annual Income Amount is
determined in a way that is not solely related to Account Value, it is possible
for the Account Value to fall to zero, even though the Annual Income Amount
remains.


31





Examples of dollar-for-dollar and proportional reductions, and the Highest
Daily Auto Step-Up are set forth below. The values shown here are purely
hypothetical, and do not reflect the charges for the Spousal Highest Daily
Lifetime 7 Plus benefit or any other fees and charges. Assume the following for
all three examples:


.   The Issue Date is December 1, 2008


.   The Spousal Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus benefit is elected on March 5,
2009


.   The younger Annuitant was 70 years old when he/she elected the Spousal
Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus benefit.


Example of dollar-for-dollar reductions


On November 24, 2009, the Protected Withdrawal Value is $120,000, resulting in
an Annual Income Amount of $6,000 (since the youngest designated life is
between the ages of 59  1/2 and 74 at the time of the first Lifetime
Withdrawal, the Annual Income Amount is 5% of the Protected Withdrawal Value,
in this case 5% of $120,000). Assuming $2,500 is withdrawn from the Annuity on
this date, the remaining Annual Income Amount for that Annuity Year (up to and
including December 1, 2009) is $3,500. This is the result of a
dollar-for-dollar reduction of the Annual Income Amount ($6,000 less $2,500 =
$3,500).


Example of proportional reductions


Continuing the previous example, assume an additional withdrawal of $5,000
occurs on November 27, 2009 and the Account Value at the time and immediately
prior to this withdrawal is $118,000. The first $3,500 of this withdrawal
reduces the Annual Income Amount for that Annuity Year to $0. The remaining
withdrawal amount of $1,500-- reduces the Annual Income Amount in future
Annuity Years on a proportional basis based on the ratio of the excess
withdrawal to the Account Value immediately prior to the excess withdrawal.
(Note that if there were other withdrawals in that Annuity Year, each would
result in another proportional reduction to the Annual Income Amount).








Here is the calculation:

Account Value before withdrawal                               $118,000.00
Less amount of "non" excess withdrawal                        $  3,500.00
Account Value immediately before excess withdrawal of $1,500  $114,500.00
Excess withdrawal amount                                      $  1,500.00








Divided by Account Value immediately before excess withdrawal $114,500.00








Ratio                                                               1.31%
Annual Income Amount                                           $6,000.00
Less ratio of 1.31%                                            $   78.60
Annual Income Amount for future Annuity Years                  $5,921.40








32





Example of highest daily auto step-up


On each Annuity Anniversary date, the Annual Income Amount is stepped-up if the
appropriate percentage (based on the youngest designated life's age on the
Annuity Anniversary) of the highest daily value since your first Lifetime
Withdrawal (or last Annuity Anniversary in subsequent years), adjusted for
withdrawals and additional Purchase Payments, is higher than the Annual Income
Amount, adjusted for excess withdrawals and additional Purchase Payments
(including the amount of any associated Credits).


Continuing the same example as above, the Annual Income Amount for this Annuity
Year is $6,000. However, the excess withdrawal on November 27 reduces the
amount to $5,921.40 for future years (see above). For the next Annuity Year,
the Annual Income Amount will be stepped up if 5% (since the youngest
designated life is younger than 75 on the date of the potential step-up) of the
highest daily Account Value adjusted for withdrawals and Purchase Payments
(including credits), is higher than $5921.40. Here are the calculations for
determining the daily values. Only the November 25 value is being adjusted for
excess withdrawals as the November 30 and December 1 Valuation Days occur after
the excess withdrawal on November 26.








                                   Highest Daily Value
                                     (adjusted with      Adjusted Annual Income
                       Account   withdrawal and Purchase   Amount (5% of the
Date*                   Value          Payments)**        Highest Daily Value)
-----                ----------- ----------------------- ----------------------
November 25, 2009    $119,000.00      $119,000.00              $5,950.00
November 26, 2009                   Thanksgiving Day
November 27, 2009    $118,000.00      $113,986.95              $5,699.35
November 30, 2009    $113,000.00      $113,986.95              $5,699.35
December 01, 2009    $119,000.00      $119,000.00              $5,950.00








.   In this example, the Annuity Anniversary date is December 1. The Valuation
Dates are every day following the first Lifetime Withdrawal. In subsequent
Annuity Years Valuation Dates will be every day following the Annuity
Anniversary. The Annuity Anniversary Date of December 1 is considered the
final Valuation Date for the year.


.   ** In this example, the first daily value after the first withdrawal is
$119,000 on November 25, results in an adjusted Annual Income Amount of
$5,950.00. This amount is adjusted on November 27 to reflect the $5,000
withdrawal. The calculations for the adjustments are:


.   The Account Value of $119,000 on November 25 is first reduced
dollar-for-dollar by $3,500 ($3,500 is the remaining Annual Income
Amount for the Annuity Year), resulting in an adjusted Account Value of
$115,500 before the excess withdrawal.


.   This amount ($115,500) is further reduced by 1.31% (this is the ratio in
the above example which is the excess withdrawal divided by the Account
Value immediately preceding the excess withdrawal) resulting in a
Highest Daily Value of $113,986.95 .


33





.   The adjusted Annual Income Amount is carried forward to the next
valuation date of November 30. At this time, we compare this amount to
5% of the Account Value on November 30. Since the November 27 adjusted
Annual Income Amount of $5,699.35 is higher than $5,650.00 (5% of
$113,000), we continue to carry $5,699.35 forward to the next and final
Valuation Date of December 1. The Account Value on December 1 is
$119,000 and 5% of this amount is $5,950. Since this is higher than
$5,699.35, the adjusted Annual Income Amount is reset to $5,950.00.


In this example, 5% of the December 1 value results in the highest amount of
$5,950.00. Since this amount is higher than the current year's Annual Income
Amount of $5,921.40 adjusted for excess withdrawals, the Annual Income Amount
for the next Annuity Year, starting on December 2, 2008 and continuing through
December 1, 2009, will be stepped-up to $5,950.00.



Non-Lifetime Withdrawal Feature



You may take a one-time non-lifetime withdrawal ("Non-Lifetime Withdrawal")
under Spousal Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus. It is an optional feature of the
benefit that you must elect at the time of your first withdrawal. The amount of
the Non-Lifetime Withdrawal cannot be more than the amount that would cause the
Annuity to be taken below the minimum Surrender Value after the withdrawal for
your Annuity (See "Access to Account Value" in the prospectus). This
Non-Lifetime Withdrawal will not stop the pre-lifetime withdrawal calculations
of the benefit described above. However, the total amount of the withdrawal
will proportionally reduce the guarantees associated with the Highest Daily
Lifetime 7 Plus benefit. You must tell us if your withdrawal is intended to be
the Non-Lifetime Withdrawal and not the first lifetime withdrawal under the
Spousal Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus benefit. If you don't elect the
Non-Lifetime Withdrawal, the first withdrawal you make will be the first
Lifetime Withdrawal that establishes your Protected Withdrawal Value and Annual
Income Amount. Once you elect the Non-Lifetime Withdrawal or Lifetime
Withdrawal, no additional Non-Lifetime withdrawals may be taken.


The Non-Lifetime Withdrawal will proportionally reduce the Protected Withdrawal
Value, the Return of Principal guarantee and the Periodic Value guarantees on
the tenth, twentieth and twenty-fifth anniversaries of the benefit effective
date, described above, by the percentage the total withdrawal amount (including
any applicable CDSC) represents of the then current Account Value immediately
prior to the time of the withdrawal.


If you are participating in a Systematic Withdrawal program, the first
withdrawal under the program cannot be classified as the Non-Lifetime
Withdrawal. The first partial withdrawal in payment of any third party
investment advisory service from your Annuity also cannot be classified as the
Non-Lifetime Withdrawal


34






Example - Non-Lifetime Withdrawal (proportional reduction)



This example is purely hypothetical and does not reflect the charges for the
benefit or any other fees and charges. It is intended to illustrate the
proportional reduction of the Non-Lifetime Withdrawal under this benefit.


Assume the following:


.   The Issue Date is December 1, 2008


.   The Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus benefit is elected on March 5, 2009


.   The Account Value at benefit election was $105,000


.   The Annuitant was 70 years old when he/she elected the Highest Daily
Lifetime 7 Plus benefit.


.   No previous withdrawals have been taken under the Highest Daily Lifetime
7 Plus benefit.


On May 2, 2009, the Protected Withdrawal Value is $125,000, the 10/th/ benefit
year minimum Periodic Value guarantee is $210,000, the 10/th/ benefit year
Return of Principal guarantee is $105,000, the 20/th/ benefit year minimum
Periodic Value guarantee is $420,000, the 25/th/ benefit year minimum Periodic
Value guarantee is $630,000 and the Account Value is $120,000. Assuming $15,000
is withdrawn from the Annuity on May 2, 2009, all guarantees associated with
the Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus benefit will be reduced by the ratio the
total withdrawal amount represents of the Account Value just prior to the
withdrawal being taken.








Here is the calculation:

Withdrawal Amount divided by                                       $    15,000
Account Value before withdrawal                                    $120,000.00
Equals ratio                                                              12.5%
Protected Withdrawal Value                                         $   109,375

All guarantees will be reduced by the above ratio (12.5%)

10/th/ benefit year Return of Premium                              $    91,875
10/th/ benefit year Minimum Periodic Value                         $   183,750
20/th/ benefit year Minimum Periodic Value                         $   367,500
25/th/ benefit year Minimum Periodic Value                         $   551,250









Required Minimum Distributions



Withdrawals that exceed the Annual Income Amount, but which you are required to
take as a required minimum distribution for this Annuity, will not reduce the
Annual Income Amount for


35





future years. No additional Annual Income Amounts will be available in an
Annuity Year due to required minimum distributions unless the required minimum
distribution amount is greater than the Annual Income Amount. Any withdrawal
you take that exceeds the Annual Income Amount in Annuity Years that your
required minimum distribution amount is not greater than the Annual Income
Amount will be treated as an Excess Withdrawal under the benefit. If the
required minimum distribution (as calculated by us for your Annuity) is greater
than the Annual Income Amount, an amount equal to the remaining Annual Income
Amount plus the difference between the required minimum distribution amount and
the Annual Income Amount will be available in the current Annuity Year without
it being considered an excess withdrawal.


The following example is purely hypothetical and is intended to illustrate a
scenario in which the required minimum distribution amount in a given Annuity
Year is greater than the Annual Income Amount.



Annual Income Amount = $5,000




Remaining Annual Income Amount = $3,000




Required Minimum Distribution = $6,000



The amount you may withdraw in the current Annuity Year without it being
treated as an Excess Withdrawal is $4,000. ($3,000 +($6,000 - $5,000) =$4,000).


If the $4,000 withdrawal is taken, the remaining Annual Income Amount will be
zero and the remaining required minimum distribution amount of $2,000 may be
taken in the subsequent Annuity Year (when your Annual Income Amount is reset).



Benefits Under the Spousal Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus Program



.   To the extent that your Account Value was reduced to zero as a result of
cumulative withdrawals that are equal to or less than the Annual Income
Amount or as a result of the fee that we assess for Spousal Highest
Daily Lifetime 7 Plus, and amounts are still payable under Spousal
Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus, we will make an additional payment, if
any, for that Annuity Year equal to the remaining Annual Income Amount
for the Annuity Year. Thus, in that scenario, the remaining Annual
Income Amount would be payable even though your Account Value was
reduced to zero. In subsequent Annuity Years we make payments that equal
the Annual Income Amount as described in this section. We will make
payments until the death of the first of the Designated Lives to die,
and will continue to make payments until the death of the second
Designated Life as long as the Designated Lives were spouses at the time
of the first death. To the extent that cumulative withdrawals in the
current Annuity Year that reduced your Account


36





Value to zero are more than the Annual Income Amount, the Spousal Highest
Daily Lifetime 7 Plus benefit terminates, and no additional payments
will be made. However, if a withdrawal in the latter scenario was taken
to meet required minimum distribution requirements under the Annuity the
benefit will not terminate, and we will continue to pay the Annual
Income Amount in the form of a fixed annuity.


.   If Annuity payments are to begin under the terms of your Annuity, or if
you decide to begin receiving Annuity payments and there is an Annual
Income Amount due in subsequent Annuity Years, you can elect one of the
following two options:


(1) apply your Account Value to any Annuity option available; or


(2) request that, as of the date Annuity payments are to begin, we make
Annuity payments each year equal to the Annual Income Amount. We will make
payments until the first of the Designated Lives to die, and will continue
to make payments until the death of the second Designated Life as long as
the Designated Lives were spouses at the time of the first death. If, due to
death of a Designated Life or divorce prior to annuitization, only a single
Designated Life remains, then Annuity payments will be made as a life
annuity for the lifetime of the Designated Life. We must receive your
request in a form acceptable to us at our office.


In the absence of an election when mandatory annuity payments are to begin, we
will make annual annuity payments as a joint and survivor or single (as
applicable) life fixed annuity with ten payments certain, by applying the
greater of the annuity rates then currently available or the annuity rates
guaranteed in your Annuity. The amount that will be applied to provide such
Annuity payments will be the greater of:


(1) the present value of the future Annual Income Amount payments. Such
present value will be calculated using the greater of the joint and survivor
or single (as applicable) life fixed annuity rates then currently available
or the joint and survivor or single (as applicable) life fixed annuity rates
guaranteed in your Annuity; and


(2) the Account Value.


.   If no Lifetime Withdrawal was ever taken, we will calculate the Annual
Income Amount as if you made your first Lifetime Withdrawal on the date
the annuity payments are to begin.


.   Please note that payments that we make under this benefit after the
Annuity Anniversary coinciding with or next following the older of the
owner or Annuitant's 95/th/ birthday, will be treated as annuity
payments.


37






Other Important Considerations



.   Withdrawals under the Spousal Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus benefit are
subject to all of the terms and conditions of the Annuity, including any
applicable CDSC for withdrawals that exceed the Annual Income Amount and
the Non-Lifetime Withdrawal.


.   Withdrawals made while the Spousal Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus Benefit
is in effect will be treated, for tax purposes, in the same way as any
other withdrawals under the Annuity. You can make withdrawals from your
Annuity while your Account Value is greater than zero without purchasing
the Spousal Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus benefit. The Spousal Highest
Daily Lifetime 7 Plus benefit provides a guarantee that if your Account
Value declines due to market performance, you will be able to receive
your Annual Income Amount in the form of periodic benefit payments.


.   Upon inception of the benefit, 100% of your Account Value must be
allocated to the permitted Sub-accounts.


.   You cannot allocate Purchase Payments or transfer Account Value to the
AST Investment Grade Bond Portfolio Sub-account (as described below) if
you elect this benefit. A summary description of the AST Investment
Grade Bond Portfolio appears within the prospectus section entitled
"What Are The Investment Objectives and Policies of The Portfolios?".
Upon the initial transfer of your Account Value into the AST Investment
Grade Bond Portfolio, we will send a prospectus for that Portfolio to
you, along with your confirmation. In addition, you can find a copy of
the AST Investment Grade Bond Portfolio prospectus by going to
www.prudentialannuities.com.


.   You can make withdrawals from your Annuity without purchasing the
Spousal Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus benefit. The Spousal Highest Daily
Lifetime 7 Plus benefit provides a guarantee that if your Account Value
declines due to market performance, you will be able to receive your
Annual Income Amount in the form of periodic benefit payments.


.   Transfers to and from the elected Sub-accounts and the AST Investment
Grade Bond Portfolio Sub-account triggered by the Spousal Highest Daily
Lifetime 7 Plus benefit will not count toward the maximum number of free
transfers allowable under an Annuity.


.   We currently limit the Sub-accounts in which you may allocate Account
Value if you participate in this benefit (see "Investment Options" below
and in the prospectus). Moreover, if you are invested in prohibited
investment options and seek to elect the benefit, we will ask you to
reallocate to permitted investment options as a prerequisite to electing
the benefit.


.   The fee for Spousal Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus is 0.85% annually of
the greater of Account Value and the Protected Withdrawal Value. We
deduct this fee at the end of each quarter, where each such quarter is
part of a year that begins on the effective date of the benefit or an
anniversary thereafter. Thus, on each such quarter-end (or the next
Valuation Day, if the quarter-end is not a Valuation Day), we deduct
0.2125% of the greater of the prior day's Account Value,


38





or the prior day's Protected Withdrawal Value at the end of the quarter.
We deduct the fee pro rata from each of your Sub-accounts including the
AST Investment Grade Bond Sub-account. Since this fee is based on the
greater of the prior day's Account Value and the prior day's Protected
Withdrawal Value, the fee for Spousal Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus may
be greater than it would have been, had it been based on the Account
Value alone. If the fee to be deducted exceeds the Account Value, we
will reduce the Account Value to zero, and continue the benefit as
described above.



Election of and Designations under the Program



Spousal Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus can only be elected based on two
Designated Lives. Designated Lives must be natural persons who are each other's
spouses at the time of election of the program and at the death of the first of
the Designated Lives to die. Currently, Spousal Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus
only may be elected where the Owner, Annuitant, and Beneficiary designations
are as follows:


.   One Annuity Owner, where the Annuitant and the Owner are the same person
and the beneficiary is the Owner's spouse. The youngest Owner/Annuitant
and the beneficiary must be at least 50 years old and the oldest must be
at least 55 years old at the time of election; or


.   Co-Annuity Owners, where the Owners are each other's spouses. The
beneficiary designation must be the surviving spouse, or the spouses
named equally. One of the owners must be the Annuitant. The youngest
Owner must be at least 50 years old and the oldest owner must be at
least 55 years old at the time of election; or


.   One Annuity Owner, where the Owner is a custodial account established to
hold retirement assets for the benefit of the Annuitant pursuant to the
provisions of Section 408(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (or any
successor Code section thereto) ("Custodial Account"), the beneficiary
is the Custodial Account, and the spouse of the Annuitant is the
Contingent Annuitant. The youngest Annuitant and the Contingent
Annuitant must be at least 50 years old and the oldest must be at least
55 years old at the time of election.


We do not permit a change of Owner under this benefit, except as follows:


(a) if one Owner dies and the surviving spousal Owner assumes the Annuity, or

(b) if the Annuity initially is co-owned, but thereafter the Owner who is not
the Annuitant is removed as Owner. We permit changes of beneficiary under this
benefit. If the Designated Lives divorce, the Spousal Highest Daily Lifetime 7
Plus benefit may not be divided as part of the divorce settlement or judgment.
Nor may the divorcing spouse who retains ownership of the Annuity appoint a new
Designated Life upon re-marriage.


39





Spousal Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus can be elected at the time that you
purchase your Annuity or after the Issue Date, subject to our eligibility rules
and restrictions. See "Elections of Designations under the Program" above and
"Termination of Existing Benefits and Election of New Benefits" below for
information pertaining to elections, terminations and re-election of benefits.
We reserve the right to waive, change and/or further limit the election
frequency in the future.



Termination of the Program



You may terminate the benefit at any time by notifying us. If you terminate the
benefit, any guarantee provided by the benefit will terminate as of the date
the termination is effective, and certain restrictions on re-election will
apply (as described above). The benefit automatically terminates: (i) if upon
the death of the first Designated Life, the surviving Designated Life opts to
take the death benefit under the Annuity (thus, the benefit does not terminate
solely because of the death of the first Designated Life), (ii) upon the death
of the second Designated Life, (iii) upon your termination of the benefit
(although if you have elected to take annuity payments in the form of the
Annual Income Amount, we will continue to pay the Annual Income Amount),

(iv) upon your surrender of the Annuity, (v) upon your election to begin
receiving annuity payments, (vi) if both the Account Value and Annual Income
Amount equal zero, or (vii) if you cease to meet our requirements for issuing
the benefit (see "Election of and Designations under the Program").


Upon termination of Spousal Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus other than upon death
of a Designated Life, we impose any accrued fee for the benefit (i.e., the fee
for the pro-rated portion of the year since the fee was last assessed), and
thereafter we cease deducting the charge for the benefit. With regard to your
investment allocations, upon termination we will: (i) leave intact amounts that
are held in the variable investment options, and (ii) transfer all amounts held
in the AST Investment Grade Bond Portfolio Sub-account (as defined below) to
your variable investment options pro rata (i.e. in the same proportion as the
current balances in your variable investment options).

Additional Tax Considerations



If you purchase an annuity as an investment vehicle for "qualified"
investments, including an IRA, SEP-IRA, Tax Sheltered Annuity (or 403(b)) or
employer plan under Code Section 401(a), the required minimum distribution
rules under the Code provide that you begin receiving periodic amounts from
your annuity beginning after age 70  1/2. For a Tax Sheltered Annuity or a
401(a) plan for which the participant is not a greater than five (5) percent
owner of the employer, this required beginning date can generally be deferred
to retirement, if later. Roth IRAs are not subject to these rules during the
owner's lifetime. The amount required under the Code may exceed the Annual
Income Amount, which will cause us to increase the Annual Income Amount in any
Annuity Year that required minimum distributions due from your Annuity are
greater than such amounts. In addition, the amount and duration of payments
under the annuity payment and death benefit provisions may be adjusted so that
the payments do not trigger any penalty or excise taxes due to tax
considerations such as required minimum distribution provisions under the tax
law. Please note, however, that any withdrawal (except the Non-Lifetime
Withdrawal) you take prior to the Tenth Anniversary, even if withdrawn to
satisfy required minimum distribution rules, will cause you to lose the ability
to receive the Return of Principal Guarantee and the guaranteed amount
described above under "KEY FEATURE - Protected Withdrawal Value".


As indicated, withdrawals made while this benefit is in effect will be treated,
for tax purposes, in the same way as any other withdrawals under the Annuity.
Please see the Tax Considerations section of the prospectus for a detailed
discussion of the tax treatment of withdrawals. We do not address each
potential tax scenario that could arise with respect to this benefit here.
However, we do note that if you participate in Spousal Highest Daily Lifetime 7
Plus through a non-qualified annuity, as with all withdrawals, once all
Purchase Payments are returned under the Annuity, all subsequent withdrawal
amounts will be taxed as ordinary income.



Spousal Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus with Beneficiary Income Option/SM/



We offer an optional death benefit feature under Spousal Highest Daily Lifetime
7 Plus, the amount of which is linked to your Annual Income Amount under the
benefit. We refer to the death benefit as the Beneficiary Income Option or BIO.
(This option is not currently available in New York.) As detailed below, a
beneficiary taking the Annuity's death benefit under this feature is paid the
Annual Income Amount until the Protected Withdrawal Value is depleted. (Note
that the final payment, exhausting the Protected Withdrawal Value, may be less
than the Annual Income Amount).


41





You may choose Spousal Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus without also selecting the
Beneficiary Income Option death benefit. If you elect Spousal Highest Daily
Lifetime 7 Plus without the Beneficiary Income Option and would like to add
this feature later, you must terminate the Spousal Highest Daily Lifetime 7
Plus benefit and elect the Spousal Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus with
Beneficiary Income Option.


If you elect the Beneficiary Income Option death benefit, you may not elect any
other optional benefit. You may elect the Beneficiary Income Option death
benefit so long as each Designated Life is no older than age 75 at the time of
election. This death benefit is not transferable in the event of a divorce, nor
may the benefit be split in accordance with any divorce proceedings or similar
instrument of separation. If you choose the Spousal Highest Daily Lifetime 7
Plus with BIO, the maximum charge is 2.00% of the greater of Account Value and
the Protected Withdrawal Value ("PWV") annually. We deduct the current charge
of 0.95% of the greater of Account Value and the PWV at the end of each
quarter, where each such quarter is part of a year that begins on the effective
date of the benefit or an anniversary thereafter. Thus, on each such
quarter-end (or the next Valuation Day, if the quarter-end is not a Valuation
Day), we deduct 0.2375% of the greater of the prior day's Account Value or the
prior day's Protected Withdrawal Value at the end of the quarter. We deduct the
fee pro rata from each of your Sub-accounts, including the AST Investment Grade
Bond Sub-account. Because the fee for this benefit is based on the greater of
the prior day's Account Value or the prior day's Protected Withdrawal Value,
the fee for Spousal Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus with the Beneficiary Income
Option may be greater than it would have been based on the Account Value alone.


For purposes of this optional death benefit, we calculate the Annual Income
Amount and Protected Withdrawal Value in the same manner that we do under
Spousal Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus itself. However, we will stop determining
the Periodic Value (as described above) on the earlier of your first Lifetime
Withdrawal after the effective date of the benefit or the Tenth Anniversary
Date. This means that under the Spousal Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus with BIO
benefit you will not be eligible for the guaranteed minimum Periodic Values
described above on the 20/th/ and 25/th /Anniversary of the Benefit Effective
Date. Upon the first death of a Designated Life, no amount is payable under the
Beneficiary Income Option death benefit. Upon the second death of a Designated
Life, we identify the following amounts: (a) the amount of the base death
benefit under the Annuity, (b) the Protected Withdrawal Value (less any credits
associated with Purchase Payments applied within 12 months prior to the date of
death), and (c) the Annual Income Amount. If there were no lifetime withdrawals
prior to the date of death, then we calculate the Protected Withdrawal Value
for purposes of this death benefit as of the date of death, and we


42





calculate the Annual Income Amount as if there were a lifetime withdrawal on
the date of death. If there were Lifetime Withdrawals prior to the date of
death, then we set the Protected Withdrawal Value and Annual Income Amount for
purposes of this death benefit as of the date that we receive due proof of
death.


If there is one beneficiary, he/she must choose to receive either the base
death benefit (in a lump sum or other permitted form of distribution) or the
Beneficiary Income Option death benefit (in the form of annual payment of the
Annual Income Amount - such payments may be annual or at other intervals that
we permit). If there are multiple beneficiaries, each beneficiary is presented
with the same choice. Thus, each beneficiary can choose to take his/her portion
of either (a) the basic Death Benefit, or (b) the Beneficiary Income Option
death benefit. In order to receive the Beneficiary Income Option Death Benefit,
each beneficiary's share of the death benefit proceeds must be allocated as a
percentage of the total death benefit to be paid. We allow a beneficiary who
has opted to receive the Annual Income Amount to designate another beneficiary,
who would receive any remaining payments upon the former beneficiary's death.
Note also that the final payment, exhausting the Protected Withdrawal Value,
may be less than the Annual Income Amount.


Here is an example to illustrate how the death benefit may be paid:


.   Assume that (i) the basic death benefit is $50,000, the Protected
Withdrawal Value is $100,000, and the Annual Income Amount is $5,000;

(ii) there are two beneficiaries (the first designated to receive 75% of
the death benefit and the second designated to receive 25% of the death
benefit); (iii) the first beneficiary chooses to receive his/her portion
of the death benefit in the form of the Annual Income Amount, and the
second beneficiary chooses to receive his/her portion of the death
benefit with reference to the basic death benefit.


.   Under those assumptions, the first beneficiary will be paid a pro-rated
portion of the Annual Income Amount for 20 years (the 20 year pay out
period is derived from the $5,000 Annual Income Amount, paid each year
until it exhausts the entire $100,000 Protected Withdrawal Value). The
pro-rated portion of the Annual Income Amount equal to $3,750 (i.e., the
first beneficiary's 75% share multiplied by $5,000) is then paid each
year for the 20 year period. Payment of $3,750 for 20 years results in
total payments of $75,000 (i.e., the first beneficiary's 75% share of
the $100,000 Protected Withdrawal Value). The second beneficiary would
receive 25% of the basic death benefit amount (or $12,500).


43





If you elect to terminate Spousal Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus with
Beneficiary Income Option, both Spousal Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus and that
death benefit option will be terminated. You may not terminate the death
benefit option without terminating the entire benefit. If you terminate Spousal
Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus with Beneficiary Income Option, your ability to
elect other optional living benefits will be affected as indicated in the
"Termination of Existing Benefits and Election of New Benefits" section, below.


2. The following is added to your prospectus:



Termination of Existing Benefits and Election of New Benefits



If you currently own an Annuity with an optional living benefit, you may
terminate the benefit rider and elect one of the benefits described in this
supplement, subject to availability of the benefit at that time. There may be a
waiting period before you are able to re-elect a new benefit. We reserve the
right to waive, change and/or further limit availability and election
frequencies in the future. Check with your financial professional regarding the
availability of re-electing a benefit and any waiting period. The benefit you
re-elect may be more expensive than the benefit you are terminating. Note that
once you terminate an existing benefit, you lose the guarantees that you had
accumulated under your existing benefit and will begin the new guarantees under
the new benefit you elect based on your Account Value as of the date the new
benefit becomes active. You should carefully consider whether terminating your
existing benefit and electing a new benefit is appropriate for you.


3. We add the following information to your prospectus regarding currently
available and permitted investment options when you choose Highest Daily
Lifetime 7 Plus or Spousal Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus.


As a condition to your participating in Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus and
Spousal Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus, we limit the investment options to which
you may allocate your Account Value. Broadly speaking, we offer two groups of
permitted funds. Under the first group, your allowable investment options are
more limited, but you are not subject to mandatory quarterly re-balancing.
Under the second group, you may allocate your Account Value between a broader
range of investment options, but must participate in quarterly re-balancing.
The set of tables immediately below describes the first category of permitted
investment options.


While those who do not participate in any optional benefit generally may invest
in any of the investment options described in the prospectus, only those who
participate in Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus and Spousal Highest Daily Lifetime
7 Plus may participate in the second category


44





(along with its attendant re-balancing requirement). This second category is
called our "Optional Allocation and Rebalancing Program." If you participate in
the Optional Allocation and Rebalancing Program, you may not participate in a
Dollar Cost Averaging Program or Automatic Rebalancing Program. We may modify
or terminate the Optional Allocation and Rebalancing Program at any time. Any
such modification or termination will (i) be implemented only after we have
notified you in advance, (ii) not affect the guarantees you had accrued under
Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus and Spousal Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus or your
ability to continue to participate in those optional benefits, and (iii) not
require you to transfer Account Value out of any Portfolio in which you
participated immediately prior to the modification or termination.

income portfolios (currently, the AST PIMCO Total Return Bond Portfolio and the
AST Western Asset Core Plus Bond Portfolio).


(b) you may allocate up to 80% in the equity and other portfolios listed in the
table below.


(c) on each quarter (or the next Valuation Day, if the quarter-end is not a
Valuation Day), we will automatically re-balance your Account Value, so that
the percentages devoted to each Portfolio


45





remain the same as those in effect on the immediately preceding quarter-end.
Note that on the first quarter-end following your participation in the Optional
Allocation and Rebalancing Program, we will re-balance your Account Value so
that the percentages devoted to each Portfolio remain the same as those in
effect when you began the Optional Allocation and Rebalancing Program.


(d) between quarter-ends, you may re-allocate your Account Value among the
investment options permitted within this category. If you reallocate, the next
quarterly rebalancing will restore the percentages to those of your most recent
reallocation.

How Charge is Determined



Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus. Charge for this benefit is assessed against the
Protected Withdrawal Value ("PWV"). As discussed in the description of the
benefit, the charge is taken out of the Sub-accounts. 0.70% of PWV is in
addition to 0.95% annual charge of amounts invested in the Sub-accounts.


Spousal Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus. Charge for this benefit is assessed
against the Protected Withdrawal Value ("PWV"). As discussed in the description
of the benefit, the charge is taken out of the Sub-accounts. 0.85% of PWV is in
addition to 0.95% annual charge of amounts invested in the Sub-accounts.


Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus with BIO. Charge for this benefit is assessed
against the Protected Withdrawal Value ("PWV"). As discussed in the description
of the benefit, the charge is taken out of the Sub-accounts. 0.95% of PWV is in
addition to 0.95% annual charge of amounts invested in the Sub-accounts.


Spousal Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus with BIO. Charge for this benefit is
assessed against the Protected Withdrawal Value ("PWV"). As discussed in the
description of the benefit, the charge is taken out of the Sub-accounts. 0.95%
of PWV is in addition to 0.95% annual charge of amounts invested in the
Sub-accounts.


Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus with LIA. Charge for this benefit is assessed
against the Protected Withdrawal Value ("PWV"). As discussed in the description
of the benefit, the charge is taken out of the Sub-accounts. 0.95% of PWV is in
addition to 0.95% annual charge of amounts invested in the Sub-accounts.


2. The Total Annual Charge includes the Insurance Charge and Distribution
Charge (if applicable) assessed against the average daily net assets allocated
to the Sub-accounts. If you elect more than one optional benefit, the Total
Annual Charge would be increased to include the charge for each optional
benefit.


3. We reserve the right to increase the charge to the maximum charge indicated,
upon any step-up or reset under the benefit, or new election of the benefit.
However, we have no present intention of doing so.

5. Expense Examples. The following Expense Examples replace the Expense
Examples in the prospectus. All the assumptions set forth in the prospectus
remain the same, except that these Expense Examples assume that you elect the
Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus Income Benefit (which is the maximum combination
of optional benefit charges) instead of the Lifetime Five Income Benefit.

Transfers Account Value between Your Permitted Sub-accounts and the AST
Investment Grade Bond Sub-account


The following is added as Appendix F in your Annuity Prospectus, describing the
mathematical formula used in connection with the optional living benefits
described in this supplement



HIGHEST DAILY LIFETIME 7 PLUS INCOME BENEFIT AND

SPOUSAL HIGHEST DAILY LIFETIME 7 PLUS INCOME BENEFIT

TRANSFERS OF ACCOUNT VALUE BETWEEN YOUR PERMITTED SUB-ACCOUNTS AND

THE AST INVESTMENT GRADE BOND SUB-ACCOUNT



Terms and Definitions referenced in the calculation formulas:


.   Cu - the upper target is established on the effective date of the
Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus/Spousal Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus
benefit (the "Effective Date") and is not changed for the life of the
guarantee. Currently, it is 83%.


50









.   Cu\\s\\ - The secondary upper target is established on the effective
    date of the Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus/Spousal Highest Daily Lifetime
    7 Plus benefit (the "Effective Date") and is not changed for the life of
    the guarantee. Currently it is 84.5%







.   Ct - the target is established on the Effective Date and is not changed
for the life of the guarantee. Currently, it is 80%.


.   Cl - the lower target is established on the Effective Date and is not
changed for the life of the guarantee. Currently, it is 78%.


.   L - the target value as of the current Valuation Day.


.   r - the target ratio.


.   a - factors used in calculating the target value. These factors are
established on the Effective Date and are not changed for the life of
the guarantee. (See the prospectus for the table of "a" factors)


.   V\\v\\ - the total value of all Permitted Sub-accounts in the Annuity.


.   V\\F\\ the total value of all elected Fixed Rate Options in the Annuity


.   B - the total value of the AST Investment Grade Bond Portfolio
Sub-account.


.   P - Income Basis. Prior to the first Lifetime Withdrawal, the Income
Basis is the Protected Withdrawal Value calculated as if the first
Lifetime Withdrawal were taken on the date of calculation. After the
first Lifetime Withdrawal, the Income Basis is equal to the greater of

(1) the Protected Withdrawal Value at the time of the first Lifetime
Withdrawal, increased for additional Purchase Payments, including the
amount of any associated Credits, and adjusted proportionally for excess
withdrawals*, and (2) any highest daily value occurring on or after the
date of the first Lifetime Withdrawal and prior to or including the date
of calculation increased for additional Purchase Payments including the
amount of any associated Credits, and adjusted for Lifetime Withdrawals.


.   T - the amount of a transfer into or out of the AST Investment Grade
Bond Portfolio Sub-account


.   Tm = the amount of a monthly transfer out of the AST Investment Grade
Bond Portfolio


.   Note: Lifetime Withdrawals of less than the Annual Income Amount do not
reduce the Income Basis.



Daily Calculations




Target Value Calculation:



On each Valuation Day, a target value (L) is calculated, according to the
following formula. If the variable Account Value (V\\V\\ + V\\F\\) is equal to
zero, no calculation is necessary.


L = 0.05 * P * a



Transfer Calculation:



The following formula, which is set on the Benefit Effective Date and is not
changed for the life of the guarantee, determines when a transfer is required:



Target Ratio r = (L - B) / (V\\V\\ + V\\F\\).



51





.   If on the third consecutive Valuation Day r > Cu and r (less or =)






Cu\\s\\ or if on any day r > Cu\\s\\, and transfers have not been
suspended due to the 90% cap rule (see above), assets in the Permitted
Sub-accounts are transferred to the AST Investment Grade Bond Portfolio
Sub-account.







.   If r < Cl, and there are currently assets in the AST Investment Grade
Bond Portfolio Sub-account (B > 0), assets in the AST Investment Grade
Bond Portfolio Sub-account are transferred to the Permitted Sub-accounts
according to most recent allocation instructions.


The following formula, which is set on the Benefit Effective Date and is not
changed for the life of the guarantee, determines the transfer amount:


T = Min (MAX(0,(0.90*(V\\V\\ + V\\F\\ + B)) - B), [L - B - (V\\V\\ + V\\F\\) *
C\\t\\] / (1 - C\\t\\))Money is transferred from the elected Sub-accounts and
Fixed Rate Options to the AST Investment Grade Bond Sub-account


T = {Min (B, - [L - B -(V\\V\\ + V\\F\\)* C\\t\\] / (1 - C\\t\\))} Money is
transferred from the AST Investment Grade Bond Sub-account to the elected
Sub-accounts



Monthly Calculation



On each monthly anniversary of the Annuity Issue Date and following the daily
Transfer Calculation above, the following formula determines if a transfer from
the AST Investment Grade Bond Sub-account to the elected Sub-Accounts will
occur:


If, after the daily Transfer Calculation is performed,



{Min (B, .05*(Vv + VF +B))} < (Cu*(Vv + VF) - L + B) / (1 - Cu), then



Tm = {Min (B, .05*(Vv + VF +B))} Money is transferred from the AST Investment
Grade Bond Sub-account to the elected Sub-accounts.

II. NEW OPTIONAL FEATURE FOR HIGHEST DAILY LIFETIME FIVE INCOME BENEFIT,
HIGHEST DAILY LIFETIME SEVEN INCOME BENEFIT AND SPOUSAL HIGHEST DAILY LIFETIME
SEVEN INCOME BENEFIT


1. In the section entitled "Living Benefit Programs - Highest Daily Lifetime
Five (SM) Income Benefit", we add and amend certain information contained in
that section as follows:


52





If you currently own an Annuity and have elected, as of the date of this
Supplement, the Highest Daily Lifetime Five Income Benefit, you can elect this
feature which utilizes a new asset transfer formula. (This feature is not
currently available in New York.) The new formula is described below and will
replace the "Transfer Calculation" portion of the asset transfer formula
currently used in connection with your benefit on a prospective basis. This
election may only be made once and may not be revoked once elected. The new
asset transfer formula is added to Appendix C in your prospectus and is
provided below.


Under the new formula, we will not execute a transfer that results in more than
90% of your Account Value being allocated to the Benefit Fixed Rate Account
("90% cap"). Thus, on any Valuation Day, if the formula would require a
transfer that would result in more than 90% of the Account Value being
allocated to the Benefit Fixed Rate Account, only the amount that results in
exactly 90% of the Account Value being allocated to the Benefit Fixed Rate
Account will be transferred. In addition, future transfers into the Benefit
Fixed Rate Account will be suspended (regardless of the performance of the
Benefit Fixed Rate Account and the Permitted Sub-accounts) until there is first
a transfer out of the Benefit Fixed Rate Account. Once a subsequent transfer
occurs out of the Benefit Fixed Rate Account, we will lift the suspension and
amounts may be transferred to the Benefit Fixed Rate Account if dictated by the
formula (subject to the 90% cap). At no time will we make a transfer that
results in greater than 90% of your Account Value being allocated to the
Benefit Fixed Rate Account. However, it is possible that, due to the investment
performance of your allocations in the Benefit Fixed Rate Account and your
allocations in the Permitted Sub-accounts you have selected, your Account Value
could be more than 90% invested in the Benefit Fixed Rate Account. We will
continue to monitor your Account Value daily and, if dictated by the formula,
systematically transfer amounts between the Permitted Sub-accounts you have
chosen and the Benefit Fixed Rate Account as dictated by the mathematical
formula. Once you elect this feature, the new transfer formula described above
and set forth below will be the asset transfer formula for your Annuity. In the
event that more than ninety percent (90%) of your Account Value is allocated to
the Benefit Fixed Rate Account on the effective date of this feature, up to ten
percent (10%) of your Account Value currently allocated to the Benefit Fixed
Rate Account will be transferred to your Permitted Sub-accounts, such that
after the transfer, 90% of your Account Value on the date of the transfer is in
the Benefit Fixed Rate Account. The transfer to the Permitted Sub-accounts will
be based on your existing allocation instructions or (in the absence of such
existing instructions) pro rata (i.e., in the same proportion as the current
balances in your variable investment options). Amounts taken out of the Benefit
Fixed Rate Account will be withdrawn for this purpose on a last-in, first-out
basis (an amount renewed into a new guarantee period under the Benefit Fixed
Rate Account will be deemed a


53





new investment for purposes of this last-in, first- our rule). On each
Valuation Day thereafter, your Account Value will be subject to the new asset
transfer formula.



Important Considerations When Electing this Feature:



.   The interest rate that we pay with respect to the Benefit Fixed Rate
Account is reduced by an amount that corresponds generally to the charge
that we assess against your variable Sub-accounts for Highest Daily
Lifetime Five. In addition, because the charge for the Highest Daily
Lifetime Five is assessed against the average daily net assets of the
Sub-accounts, that charge will be assessed against all assets
transferred into the Permitted Sub-accounts.


.   If this feature is elected, any Account Value transferred to the
Permitted Sub-accounts is subject to the investment performance of those
Sub-accounts. Your Account Value can go up or down depending of the
performance of the Sub-accounts you select.


If you elect this feature, the following replaces the "Transfer Calculation"
section in Appendix C:



Transfer Calculation:



The following formula, which is set on the effective date of this feature and
is not changed for the life of the guarantee, determines when a transfer is
required: On the effective date of this feature (and only on the effective date
of this feature), the following asset transfer calculation is performed to
determine the amount of Account Value allocated to the Benefit Fixed Rate
Account:


If (F/(V+F) >.90) then

T = F-(V+F*.90)


If T is greater than $0 as described above, then no additional transfer
calculations are performed on the effective date.


On each Valuation Day thereafter (including the effective date of this feature
provided F/(V+F) <=.90), the following asset transfer calculation is performed



Target Ratio r = (L - F) / V.



.   If r > C\\u\\, assets in the Permitted Sub-accounts are transferred to
Benefit Fixed Rate Account.


54





.   If r <C\\l\\and there are currently assets in the Benefit Fixed Rate
Account (F > 0), assets in the Benefit Fixed Rate Account are
transferred to the Permitted Sub-accounts.


The following formula, which is set on the Effective Date of this feature and
is not changed for the life of the guarantee, determines the transfer amount:


T = Min (MAX (0,(0.90*(V+ F)) - F), [L - F - V* C\\t\\] / (1 - C\\t\\))Money is
transferred from the elected Permitted Sub-accounts to Benefit Fixed Rate
Account


T = {Min(F, [L - F - V * C\\t\\] / (1 - C\\t\\))} T<0, Money is transferred
from the Benefit Fixed Rate Account to the Permitted Sub-accounts.


2. In the section entitled "Living Benefit Programs - Highest Daily Lifetime
Seven (SM) Income Benefit and Spousal Highest Daily Lifetime Seven (SM)
Income Benefit", we add and amend certain information contained in that
section as follows:


If you currently own an Annuity and have elected, as of the date of this
Supplement, the Highest Daily Lifetime Seven Income Benefit (including Highest
Daily Lifetime Seven with Beneficiary Income Option and Highest Daily Lifetime
Seven with Lifetime Income Accelerator) or Spousal Highest Daily Lifetime Seven
Income Benefit (including Spousal Highest Daily Lifetime Seven with Beneficiary
Income Option), you can elect this feature which utilizes a new asset transfer
formula. The new formula is described below and will replace the "Transfer
Calculation" portion of the asset transfer formula currently used in connection
with your benefit on a prospective basis. This election may only be made once
and may not be revoked once elected. The new asset transfer formula is added to
Appendix E in your prospectus and is provided below.


Under the new formula, we will not execute a transfer that results in more than
90% of your Account Value being allocated to the AST Investment Grade Bond
Sub-account ("90% cap"). Thus, on any Valuation Day, if the formula would
require a transfer that would result in more than 90% of the Account Value
being allocated to the AST Investment Grade Bond Sub-account, only the amount
that results in exactly 90% of the Account Value being allocated to the AST
Investment Grade Bond Sub-account will be transferred. In addition, future
transfers into the AST Investment Grade Bond Sub-account will be suspended
(regardless of the performance of the AST Investment Grade Bond Sub-account and
the Permitted Sub-accounts) until there is first a transfer out of the AST
Investment Grade Bond Sub-account. Once a subsequent transfer occurs out of the
AST Investment Grade Bond Sub-account, we will lift the suspension and amounts
may be transferred to the AST Investment Grade Bond Sub-account if dictated by
the formula (subject


55





to the 90% cap). At no time will we make a transfer that results in greater
than 90% of your Account Value being allocated to the AST Investment Grade Bond
Sub-account. However, it is possible that, due to the investment performance of
your allocations in the AST Investment Grade Bond Sub-account and your
allocations in the Permitted Sub-accounts you have selected, your Account Value
could be more than 90% invested in the AST Investment Grade Bond Ssub-account.
We will continue to monitor your Account Value daily and, if dictated by the
formula, systematically transfer amounts between the Permitted Sub-accounts you
have chosen and the AST Investment Grade Bond Sub-account as dictated by the
mathematical formula. Once you elect this feature, the new transfer formula
described above and set forth below will be the asset transfer formula for your
Annuity. In the event that more than ninety percent (90%) of your Account Value
is allocated to the AST Investment Grade Bond Sub-account on the effective date
of this feature, up to ten percent (10%) of your Account Value currently
allocated to the AST Investment Grade Bond Sub-account will be transferred to
your Permitted Sub-accounts, such that after the transfer, 90% of your Account
Value on the date of the transfer is in the AST Investment Grade Bond
Sub-account. The transfer to the Permitted Sub-accounts will be based on your
existing allocation instructions or (in the absence of such existing
instructions) pro rata (i.e., in the same proportion as the current balances in
your variable investment options). On each Valuation Day thereafter, your
Account Value will be subject to the new asset transfer formula.



Important Consideration When Electing this Feature:



.   If this feature is elected, any Account Value transferred to the
Permitted Sub-accounts is subject to the investment performance of those
Sub-accounts. Your Account Value can go up or down depending of the
performance of the Sub-accounts you select.


If you elect this feature, the following replaces the "Transfer Calculation"
section in Appendix E:


Transfer Calculation if you elected Highest Daily Lifetime Seven or Spousal
Highest Daily Lifetime Seven on or after July 21, 2008:


The following formula, which is set on the effective date of this feature and
is not changed for the life of the guarantee, determines when a transfer is
required:


On the effective date of this feature (and only on the effective date of this
feature), the following asset transfer calculation is performed to determine
the amount of Account Value allocated to the AST Investment Grade Bond
sub-account:


If (F/(V\\v\\ +V\\f\\ +B) >.90) then

T = B-(V\\v\\+V\\f\\+B*.90)


56





If T is greater than $0 as described above, then no additional transfer
calculations are performed on the effective date.


On each Valuation Day thereafter (including the effective date of this feature
provided B/( V\\v\\ +V\\f\\ +B) <=.90), the following asset transfer
calculation is performed



Target Ratio r = (L - B) / (V\\V\\ + V\\F\\).



.   If r > C\\u\\, assets in the Permitted Sub-accounts are transferred to
the AST Investment Grade Bond Portfolio Sub-account.


.   If r < C\\l\\, and there are currently assets in the AST Investment
Grade Bond Portfolio Sub-account (B > 0), assets in the AST Investment
Grade Bond Portfolio Sub-account are transferred to the Permitted
Sub-accounts according to most recent allocation instructions.


The following formula, which is set on the Benefit Effective Date and is not
changed for the life of the guarantee, determines the transfer amount:


T = Min (MAX(0,(0.90*(V\\V\\ + V\\F\\ + B)) - B), [L - B - (V\\V\\ + V\\F\\) *
C\\t\\] / (1 - C\\t\\)) Money is transferred from the elected Sub-accounts to
the AST Investment Grade Bond Sub-account


T = {Min (B,-[L - B -( V\\v\\ +V\\f\\ +B)* C\\t\\] / (1-C\\t\\))} Money is
transferred from the AST Investment Grade Sub-account to the elected
Sub-accounts


Transfer Calculation if you elected Highest Daily Lifetime Seven or Spousal
Highest Daily Lifetime Seven prior to July 21, 2008:


The following formula, which is set on the effective date of this feature and
is not changed for the life of the guarantee, determines when a transfer is
required: On the effective date of this feature (and only on the effective date
of this feature), the following asset transfer calculation is performed to
determine the amount of Account Value allocated to the AST Investment Grade
Bond Sub-account:


If (B/(V+B) >.90) then

T = B-(V+B*.90)


57





If T is greater than $0 as described above, then no additional transfer
calculations are performed on the effective date.


On each Valuation Day thereafter (including the effective date of this feature
provided B/(V+B) <=.90), the following asset transfer calculation is performed



Target Ratio r = (L - B) / V.



.   If r > C\\u\\, assets in the Permitted Sub-accounts are transferred to
AST Investment Grade Bond Sub-account.


.   If r <C\\l\\ and there are currently assets in the Benefit Fixed Rate
Account (F > 0), assets in the AST Investment Grade Bond Sub-account are
transferred to the Permitted Sub-accounts.


The following formula, which is set on the Effective Date of this feature and
is not changed for the life of the guarantee, determines the transfer amount:


T = Min (MAX (0,(0.90*(V+ B)) - B), [L - B - V* C\\t\\] / (1 - C\\t\\))Money is
transferred from the elected Permitted Sub-accounts to AST Investment Grade
Bond Sub-Account


T = {Min(B, [L - B - V * C\\t\\] / (1 - C\\t\\))} T<0, Money is transferred
from the AST Investment Grade Bond Sub-account to the Permitted Sub-accounts.



III.



1. Discontinuance of Certain Optional Living Benefits. As of the date of
this supplement and subject to regulatory approval (except under certain
circumstances) of Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus Income Benefit or Spousal
Highest Daily Lifetime 7 Plus Income Benefit in your state, you may no
longer elect the following income benefits: Highest Daily Lifetime Seven
Income Benefit, Highest Daily Lifetime Seven Income Benefit with Beneficiary
Income Option, Highest Daily Lifetime Seven Income Benefit with Lifetime
Income Accelerator, Spousal Highest Daily Lifetime Seven Income Benefit, and
Spousal Highest Daily Lifetime Seven Income Benefit with Beneficiary Income
Option . Check with your financial professional regarding availability of
these benefits in your state.


2. We add the following paragraph to the prospectus section "Tax
Considerations - Types of Tax-favored Plans"


58





Caution: Recent IRS regulations may affect the taxation of 403(b) tax deferred
annuity contract exchanges that occur after September 24, 2007.


Certain transactions, often called "Revenue Ruling 90-24" exchanges or
transfers, are a common non-taxable method to exchange one tax deferred annuity
contract for another. The IRS has issued regulations that may impose
restrictions on your ability make such an exchange. The regulations are
generally effective in 2009 but there is great uncertainty about their
application to contract exchanges that take place during the period following
September 24, 2007 and before January 1, 2009 (the "gap period"). Because of
this uncertainty, it is possible that an exchange that takes place during the
gap period may cause you to incur taxation on the value of the contract. But it
is also possible that such an exchange will not have adverse tax consequences.
We have asked the IRS to provide more guidance on this critical issue. In the
meantime, before you request an exchange during the gap period you should
consult with your tax advisor. We intend to begin accepting such transfers on
or about ______but only if we have entered into an information-sharing
agreement, or its functional equivalent, with the applicable employer or its
agent. In addition, in order to comply with the regulations, starting on or
about ______we will only process certain transactions (e.g, transfers,
withdrawals, hardship distributions and, if applicable, loans) with employer
approval. This means that if you request one of these transactions we will not
consider your request to be in good order, and will not therefore process the
transaction, until we receive the employer's approval in written or electronic
form.


3. The following is added to your prospectus at the end of the section
entitled "Purchasing Your Annuity":


"Beneficiary" Annuity


You may purchase an Annuity if you are a beneficiary of an annuity that was
owned by a decedent, subject to the following requirements. You may transfer
the proceeds of the decedent's annuity into one of the Annuities described in
this prospectus and continue receiving the distributions that are required by
the tax laws. This transfer option is only available for purchase of an IRA,
Roth IRA, or a non-qualified annuity, for distributions based on lives age 70
or under. This transfer option is also not available if the proceeds are being
transferred from an annuity issued by us or one of our affiliates and the
annuity offers a "Beneficiary Continuation Option".


Upon purchase, the Annuity will be issued in the name of the decedent for your
benefit. We will calculate your required distributions based on life expectancy
in the year of the decedent's death, using Table 1 in IRS Publication 590. You
must take distributions at least annually. For IRAs and Roth IRAs,
distributions must begin by December 31 of the


59





year following the year of the decedent's death. If you are the surviving
spouse beneficiary, distributions may be deferred until the decedent would have
attained age 70  1/2, however you must notify us when you would like
distributions to begin. For additional information regarding the tax
considerations applicable to beneficiaries of an IRA or Roth IRA, see "Required
Distributions Upon Your Death for Qualified Annuity Contracts" in the Tax
Considerations section of your prospectus. For non-qualified Annuities,
distributions must begin within one year of the decedent's death. For
additional information regarding the tax considerations applicable to
beneficiaries of a non-qualified Annuity see "Required Distributions Upon Your
Death for Nonqualified Annuity Contracts" in the Tax Consideration section of
your prospectus.


You may choose to take more than your required distribution. You may take
withdrawals in excess of your required distributions, however your withdrawal
may be subject to the Contingent Deferred Sales Charge. Any withdrawals reduce
the required distribution for the year. All applicable charges will be assessed
against your Annuity, such as the Insurance Charge and the Annual Maintenance
Fee.


The Annuity will provide a basic Death Benefit, and you may name a "successor"
who may either receive the Death Benefit as a lump sum or continue receiving
distributions after your death under the Beneficiary Continuation Option.


Please note the following additional limitations:


.   No additional Purchase Payments are permitted. You may only make a
one-time initial Purchase Payment transferred to us directly from the
decedent's annuity. You may not make your Purchase Payment as an
indirect rollover.


.   You may not elect any optional living or death benefits. Annuity Rewards
are not available.


.   You may not annuitize the Annuity; no annuity options are available.


.   You may participate only in the following programs: Auto-Rebalancing,
Dollar Cost Averaging (but not Enhanced Dollar Cost Averaging),
Systematic Withdrawals, and Third Party Investment Advisor.


.   You may not assign or change ownership of the Annuity, and you may not
designate another life from which distributions are based.


.   If the Annuity is funded by means of transfer from another "beneficiary
annuity" with another company, we require that the sending company or
the beneficial owner provide certain information in order to ensure that
applicable required distributions have been made prior to the transfer
of the contract proceeds to us.


60





We further require appropriate information to enable us to accurately
determine future distributions from the Annuity. Please note we are unable
to accept a transfer of another "beneficiary annuity" that has annuitized
where taxes are calculated based on an exclusion ratio of earnings to
original investment.


.   The beneficial owner of the Annuity can be an individual, grantor trust,
or, for an IRA or Roth IRA, a qualified trust. In general, a qualified
trust (1) must be valid under state law; (2) must be irrevocable or
became irrevocable by its terms upon the death of the IRA or Roth IRA
owner; and (3) the beneficiaries of the trust who are beneficiaries with
respect to the trust's interest in this Annuity must be identifiable
from the trust instrument and must be individuals. A qualified trust
must provide us with a list of all beneficiaries to the trust (including
contingent and remainder beneficiaries with a description of the
conditions on their entitlement), all of whom must be individuals, as of
September 30/th/ of the year following the year of death of the IRA or
Roth IRA owner, or date of Annuity application if later. The trustee
must also provide a copy of the trust document upon request.


.   If this Beneficiary Annuity is transferred to another company as a
tax-free exchange with the intention of qualifying as a beneficiary
annuity with the receiving company, we will require certifications from
the receiving company that required distributions will be made as
required by law.


.   We must receive your transfer request at least 45 days prior to your
first required distribution.


4. Under the section of the prospectus entitled "Guaranteed Return Option
Plus", we remove the first paragraph and the last paragraph under "Key
Feature - Allocation of Account Value", and replace it with the following:


GRO Plus uses a mathematical formula that we operate in our sole discretion
to help manage your guarantees through all market cycles. We reserve the
right to change the mathematical formula at our sole discretion, subject to
regulatory approval if required. We also reserve the right to change the
mathematical formula with respect to existing programs, where allowed by
law. Each Valuation Day, the formula determines if any portion of your
Account Value needs to be transferred into or out of the Fixed Allocations,
through reference to a "reallocation trigger". At any given time, some,
none, or all of your Account Value may be allocated to the Fixed
Allocations. With respect to any amounts held within the Fixed Allocations,
we can give no assurance how long the amounts will reside there or if such
amounts will transfer out of the Fixed Allocations. If you make additional
Purchase Payments to your Annuity, they will be allocated to the
Sub-accounts according to your allocation instructions. Such additional
Purchase Payments may or may not cause the formula to transfer money in or
out of the Fixed Allocations. Once the Purchase Payments are allocated to
your Annuity, they will also be subject to the mathematical formula, which
may result in immediate transfers to or from the Fixed Allocations, if
dictated by the formula.


The amount that is transferred to and from the Fixed Allocations pursuant to
the mathematical formula depends upon a number of factors unique to your
Annuity (and is not necessarily directly correlated with the securities
markets, bond markets, or interest rates, in general) including:


.   The difference between your Account Value (including any Market Value
Adjustment) and your Protected Principal Value(s);


.   The amount of time until the maturity of your guarantee(s);


.   The amount invested in, and the performance of, the Sub-accounts;


.   The amount invested in, and interest earned within, the Fixed
Allocations;


.   The current crediting rates associated with Fixed Allocations;


.   Additional Purchase Payments, if any, that you make to the Annuity; and


.   Withdrawals, if any, taken from the Annuity.


Any amounts invested in the Fixed Allocations will affect your ability to
participate in a subsequent market recovery within the Sub-accounts.
Conversely, the Account Value may be higher at the beginning of the recovery,

e.g. more of the Account Value may have been protected from decline and
volatility than it otherwise would have been had the benefit not been elected.


While you are not notified when your Account Value reaches a reallocation
trigger, you will receive a confirmation statement indicating the transfer of a
portion of your Account Value either to or from Fixed Allocations.


You should be aware of the following potential ramifications of the
reallocation mechanism:


.   Transfers of your Account Value can be frequent, and under some
scenarios may occur on a daily basis. As indicated, each such transfer
may be subject to a Market Value Adjustment, which can be positive or
negative. Thus, a Market Value Adjustment will directly increase or
reduce your Account Value.


.   As indicated, we retain sole discretion under the allocation mechanism
(the mathematical formula) to maintain some, or even all, of your
Account Value in the Fixed Allocations. The greater the Account Value
held in Fixed Allocations, the larger (in dollar terms) the Market Value
Adjustment upon any transfer of such Account Value to the Sub-accounts.

Transfers do not impact any guarantees that have already been locked-in.


Under the section of the prospectus entitled "Guaranteed Return Option ", we
remove the first paragraph and the last paragraph under "Key Feature -
Allocation of Account Value", and replace it with the following:


GRO uses a mathematical formula that we operate in our sole discretion to help
manage your guarantees through all market cycles. We reserve the right to
change the mathematical formula at our sole discretion, subject to regulatory
approval if required. We also reserve the right to change the mathematical
formula with respect to existing programs, where allowed by law. Each Valuation
Day, the formula determines if any portion of your Account Value needs to be
transferred into or out of the Fixed Allocations, through reference to a
"reallocation trigger". At any given time, some, none, or all of your Account
Value may be allocated to the Fixed Allocations. If your entire Account Value
is transferred to the Fixed Allocations, the formula will not transfer amounts
out of the Fixed Allocations to the Sub-accounts and the entire Account Value
would remain in the Fixed Allocations. If you make additional Purchase Payments
to your Annuity, they will be allocated to the Sub-accounts according to your
allocation instructions. Such additional Purchase Payments may or may not cause
the formula to transfer money in or out of the Fixed Allocations. Once the
Purchase Payments are allocated to your Annuity, they will also be subject to
the mathematical formula, which may result in immediate transfers to or from
the Fixed Allocations, if dictated by the formula.


The amount that is transferred to and from the Fixed Allocations pursuant to
the mathematical formula depends upon a number of factors unique to your
Annuity (and is not necessarily directly correlated with the securities
markets, bond markets, or interest rates, in general) including:


.   The difference between your Account Value (including any Market Value
Adjustment) and your Protected Principal Value(s);


.   The amount of time until the maturity of your guarantee(s);


.   The amount invested in, and the performance of, the Sub-accounts;


.   The amount invested in, and interest earned within, the Fixed
Allocations;


.   The current crediting rates associated with Fixed Allocations;


.   Additional Purchase Payments, if any, that you make to the Annuity; and


.   Withdrawals, if any, taken from the Annuity.


Any amounts invested in the Fixed Allocations will affect your ability to
participate in a subsequent market recovery within the Sub-accounts.
Conversely, the Account Value may be higher at the beginning of the recovery,

e.g. more of the Account Value may have been protected from decline and
volatility than it otherwise would have been had the benefit not been elected.


You should be aware of the following potential ramifications of the allocation
mechanism:


.   Transfers of your Account Value can be frequent, and under some
scenarios may occur on a daily basis. As indicated, each such transfer
may be subject to a Market Value Adjustment, which can be positive or
negative. Thus, a Market Value Adjustment will directly increase or
reduce your Account Value.


.   As indicated, we retain sole discretion under the allocation mechanism
(the mathematical formula) to maintain some, or even all, of your
Account Value in the Fixed Allocations. The greater the Account Value
held in Fixed Allocations, the larger (in dollar terms) the Market Value
Adjustment upon any transfer of such Account Value to the Sub-accounts.


62





Transfers do not impact your guarantees that have already been locked-in.


Under the section of the prospectus entitled "Guaranteed Return Option Plus
2008" and the section entitled "Highest Daily GRO", we add the following to
the end of the sub-section entitled "Key Feature--Allocation of Account
Value":


Each of Highest Daily Guaranteed Return Option (HD GRO) and Guaranteed Return
Option Plus 2008 (GRO Plus 2008) uses a pre-determined mathematical formula to
help manage your guarantees through all market cycles. Each Valuation Day, the
formula analyzes the difference between your Account Value and your guarantees,
as well as how long you have owned the benefit, and determines if any portion
of your Account Value needs to be transferred into or out of the AST Bond
Portfolio Sub-accounts (the "Bond Portfolios"). Therefore, at any given time,
some, none, or all of your Account Value may be allocated to the Bond
Portfolios. If your entire Account Value is transferred to the Bond Portfolios,
then based on the way the formula operates, the formula will not transfer
amounts out of the Bond Portfolios to the Sub-accounts and the entire Account
Value would remain in the Bond Portfolios. If you make additional Purchase
Payments to your Annuity, they will be allocated to the Sub-accounts according
to your allocation instructions. Such additional Purchase Payments may or may
not cause the formula to transfer money in or out of the Bond Portfolios. Once
the Purchase Payments are allocated to your Annuity, they will also be subject
to the mathematical formula, which may result in immediate transfers to or from
the Bond Portfolios, if dictated by the formula.


The amount that is transferred to and from the Bond Portfolios pursuant to the
mathematical formula depends upon a number of factors unique to your Annuity
(and is not necessarily directly correlated with the securities markets, bond
markets, or interest rates, in general) including:


.   The difference between your Account Value and your Guarantee Amount(s);


.   The amount of time until the maturity of your Guarantee(s);


.   The amount invested in, and the performance of, the Permitted
Sub-accounts;


.   The amount invested in, and the performance of, the Bond Portfolios;


.   The discount rate used to determine the present value of your
Guarantee(s);


.   Additional Purchase Payments, if any, that you make to the Annuity; and


.   Withdrawals, if any, taken from the Annuity.


Any amounts invested in the Bond Portfolios will affect your ability to
participate in a subsequent market recovery within the Permitted Sub-accounts.
Conversely, the Account Value may be higher at the beginning of the recovery,

e.g. more of the Account Value may have been protected from decline and
volatility than it otherwise would have been had the benefit not been elected.


63





Transfers do not impact any guarantees that have already been locked-in.


We replace the section of the prospectus entitled "Asset Transfer Component
of Highest Daily Lifetime Five" with the following:



Asset Transfer Component of Highest Daily Lifetime Five



As indicated above, we limit the sub-accounts to which you may allocate Account
Value if you elect Highest Daily Lifetime Five. For purposes of this benefit,
we refer to those permitted sub-accounts as the "Permitted Sub-accounts". As a
requirement of participating in Highest Daily Lifetime Five, we require that
you participate in our specialized asset transfer program, under which we may
transfer Account Value between the Permitted Sub-accounts and a fixed interest
rate account that is part of our general account (the "Benefit Fixed Rate
Account"). We determine whether to make a transfer, and the amount of any
transfer, under a non-discretionary formula, discussed below. The Benefit Fixed
Rate Account is available only with this benefit, and thus you may not allocate
Purchase Payments to the Benefit Fixed Rate Account. The interest rate that we
pay with respect to the Benefit Fixed Rate Account is reduced by an amount that
corresponds generally to the charge that we assess against your variable
Sub-accounts for Highest Daily Lifetime Five. The Benefit Fixed Rate Account is
not subject to the Investment Company Act of 1940 or the Securities Act of 1933.


Under the asset transfer component of Highest Daily Lifetime Five, we monitor
your Account Value daily and, if necessary, systematically transfer amounts
between the Permitted Sub-accounts you have chosen and the Benefit Fixed Rate
Account. Any transfer would be made in accordance with a formula, which is set
forth in the schedule supplement to the endorsement for this benefit (and also
appears in the Appendices to the prospectus). Speaking generally, the formula,
which we apply each Valuation Day, operates as follows. The formula starts by
identifying your Protected Withdrawal Value for that day and then multiplies
that figure by 5%, to produce a projected (i.e., hypothetical) Highest Daily
Annual Income Amount. Then, using our actuarial tables, we produce an estimate
of the total amount we would target in our allocation model, based on the
projected Highest Daily Annual Income Amount each year for the rest of your
life. In the formula, we refer to that value as the "Target Value" or "L". If
you have already made a withdrawal, your projected Highest Daily Annual Income
Amount (and thus your Target Value) would take into account any automatic
step-up that was scheduled to occur according to the step-up formula described
above. Next, the formula subtracts from the Target Value the amount held within
the Benefit Fixed Rate Account on that day, and divides that difference by the
amount held within the Permitted Sub-accounts. That ratio, which essentially
isolates the amount of your Target Value that is not offset by amounts held
within the Benefit Fixed Rate Account, is


64





called the "Target Ratio" or "r". If the Target Ratio exceeds a certain
percentage (currently 83%) it means essentially that too much Target Value is
not offset by assets within the Benefit Fixed Rate Account, and therefore we
will transfer an amount from your Permitted Sub-accounts to the Benefit Fixed
Rate Account. Conversely, if the Target Ratio falls below a certain percentage
(currently 77%), then a transfer from the Benefit Fixed Rate Account to the
Permitted Sub-accounts would occur. Note that the formula is calculated with
reference to the Highest Daily Annual Income Amount, rather than with reference
to the Annual Income Amount. If you elect the new asset transfer formula
calculation offered in this supplement, see the discussion above regarding the
90% cap.


As you can glean from the formula, poor investment performance of your Account
Value may result in a transfer of a portion of your variable Account Value to
the Benefit Fixed Rate Account, because such poor investment performance will
tend to increase the Target Ratio. Moreover, "flat" investment returns of your
Account Value over a period of time also could result in the transfer of your
Account Value to the Benefit Fixed Rate Account. Because the amount allocated
to the Benefit Fixed Rate Account and the amount allocated to the Permitted
Sub-accounts each is a variable in the formula, the investment performance of
each affects whether a transfer occurs for your Annuity. In deciding how much
to transfer, we use another formula, which essentially seeks to re-balance
amounts held in the Permitted Sub-accounts and the Benefit Fixed Rate Account
so that the Target Ratio meets a target, which currently is equal to 80%. Once
you elect Highest Daily Lifetime Five, the ratios we use will be fixed. For
newly issued annuities that elect Highest Daily Lifetime Five and existing
annuities that elect Highest Daily Lifetime Five, however, we reserve the right
to change the ratios.


While you are not notified when your Annuity reaches a reallocation trigger,
you will receive a confirmation statement indicating the transfer of a portion
of your Account Value either to or from the Benefit Fixed Rate Account. The
formula by which the reallocation triggers operate is designed primarily to
mitigate the financial risks that we incur in providing the guarantee under
Highest Daily Lifetime Five.


Depending on the results of the calculation relative to the reallocation
triggers, we may, on any day:


.   Not make any transfer between the Permitted Sub-accounts and the Benefit
Fixed Rate Account; or


.   If a portion of your Account Value was previously allocated to the
Benefit Fixed Rate Account, transfer all or a portion of those amounts
to the Permitted Sub-accounts, based on your existing


65





allocation instructions or (in the absence of such existing instructions)
pro rata (i.e., in the same proportion as the current balances in your
variable investment options). Amounts taken out of the Benefit Fixed
Rate Account will be withdrawn for this purpose on a last-in, first-out
basis (an amount renewed into a new guarantee period under the Benefit
Fixed Rate Account will be deemed a new investment for purposes of this
last-in, first-out rule); or


.   Transfer all or a portion of your Account Value in the Permitted
Sub-accounts pro-rata to the Benefit Fixed Rate Account. The interest
that you earn on such transferred amount will be equal to the annual
rate that we have set for that day, and we will credit the daily
equivalent of that annual interest until the earlier of one year from
the date of the transfer or the date that such amount in the Benefit
Fixed Rate Account is transferred back to the Permitted Sub-accounts.


If your entire Account Value is transferred to the Benefit Fixed Rate Account,
then based on the way the formula operates, the formula will not transfer
amounts out of the Benefit Fixed Rate Account to the Permitted Sub-accounts and
the entire Account Value would remain in the Benefit Rate Fixed Account. If you
make additional Purchase Payments to your Annuity, they will be allocated to
the Sub-accounts according to your allocation instructions. Such additional
Purchase Payments may or may not cause the formula to transfer money in or out
of the Benefit Fixed Rate Account. Once the Purchase Payments are allocated to
your Annuity, they will also be subject to the mathematical formula, which may
result in immediate transfers to or from the Benefit Fixed Rate Account, if
dictated by the formula.


The amount that is transferred to and from the Benefit Fixed Rate Account
pursuant to the mathematical formula depends upon a number of factors unique to
YOUR Annuity (and is not necessarily directly correlated with the securities
markets, bond markets, or interest rates, in general) including:


.   How long you have owned Highest Daily Lifetime Five;


.   The performance of the Permitted Sub-accounts you have chosen;


.   The performance of the Benefit Fixed Rate Account (i.e., the amount of
interest credited to the Benefit Fixed Rate Account);


.   The amount you have allocated to each of the Permitted Sub-accounts you
have chosen;


.   The amount you have allocated to the Benefit Fixed Rate Account;


.   Additional Purchase Payments, if any, you make to your Annuity;


.  Withdrawals, if any, you take from your Annuity (withdrawals are taken
pro rata from your Account Value).


Any Account Value in the Benefit Fixed Rate Account will not be available to
participate in the investment experience of the Permitted Sub-accounts if there
is a market recovery until it is moved out of the Benefit Fixed Rate Account.


66





The more of your Account Value allocated to the Benefit Fixed Rate Account
under the formula, the greater the impact of the performance of the Benefit
Fixed Rate Account in determining whether (and how much) of your Account Value
is transferred back to the Permitted Sub-accounts. Further, it is possible
under the formula, that if a significant portion your Account Value is
allocated to the Benefit Fixed Rate Account and that Account has good
performance but the performance of your Permitted Sub-accounts is negative,
that the formula might transfer your Account Value to the Permitted
Sub-accounts. Thus, the converse is true too (the more you have allocated to
the Permitted Sub-accounts, the greater the impact of the performance of those
Sub-accounts will have on any transfer to the Benefit Fixed Rate Account).


We replace the sections of the prospectus entitled "Asset Transfer Component
of Highest Daily Lifetime Seven" and "Asset Transfer Component of Spousal
Highest Daily Lifetime Seven" (as applicable) with the following:


Asset Transfer Component of Highest Daily Lifetime Seven/Spousal Highest Daily
Lifetime Seven As indicated above, we limit the Sub-accounts to which you may
allocate Account Value if you elect Highest Daily Lifetime Seven/Spousal
Highest Daily Lifetime Seven. For purposes of the benefit, we refer to those
permitted Sub-accounts as the "Permitted Sub-accounts". As a requirement of
participating in Highest Daily Lifetime Seven/Spousal Highest Daily Lifetime
Seven, we require that you participate in our specialized asset transfer
program, under which we may transfer Account Value between the Permitted
Sub-accounts and a specified bond fund within the Advanced Series Trust (the
"AST Investment Grade Bond Sub-account"). We determine whether to make a
transfer, and the amount of any transfer, under a non-discretionary
mathematical formula, discussed below. The AST Investment Grade Bond
Sub-account is available only with this benefit, and thus you may not allocate
Purchase Payments to the AST Investment Grade Bond Sub-account. Under the asset
transfer component of Highest Daily Lifetime Seven/Spousal Highest Daily
Lifetime Seven, we monitor your Account Value daily and, if dictated by the
formula, systematically transfer amounts between the Permitted Sub-accounts you
have chosen and the AST Investment Grade Bond Sub-account. Any transfer would
be made in accordance with a formula, which is set forth in the Appendices to
this prospectus.


Speaking generally, the formula, which we apply each Valuation Day, operates as
follows. The formula starts by identifying an income basis for that day and
then multiplies that figure by 5%, to produce a projected (i.e., hypothetical)
income amount. Note that we use 5% in the formula, irrespective of the
Annuitant's attained age. Then we produce an estimate of the total amount we


67





would target in our allocation model, based on the projected income amount and
factors set forth in the formula. In the formula, we refer to that value as the
"Target Value" or "L". If you have already made a withdrawal, your projected
income amount (and thus your Target Value) would take into account any
automatic step-up, any subsequent purchase payments, and any excess
withdrawals. Next, the formula subtracts from the Target Value the amount held
within the AST Investment Grade Bond Sub-account on that day, and divides that
difference by the amount held within the Permitted Sub-accounts. That ratio,
which essentially isolates the amount of your Target Value that is not offset
by amounts held within the AST Investment Grade Bond Sub-account, is called the
"Target Ratio" or "r". If the Target Ratio exceeds a certain percentage
(currently 83%), it means essentially that too much Target Value is not offset
by assets within the AST Investment Grade Bond Sub-account, and therefore we
will transfer an amount from your Permitted Sub-accounts to the AST Investment
Grade Bond Sub-account. Conversely, if the Target Ratio falls below a certain
percentage (currently 77%), then a transfer from the AST Investment Grade Bond
Sub-account to the Permitted Sub-accounts would occur.


If you elect the new asset transfer formula calculation offered in this
supplement, see the discussion above regarding the 90% cap.


As you can glean from the formula, poor investment performance of your Account
Value may result in a transfer of a portion of your variable Account Value to
the AST Investment Grade Bond Sub-account because such poor investment
performance will tend to increase the Target Ratio. Moreover, "flat" investment
returns of your Account Value over a period of time also could result in the
transfer of your Account Value from the Permitted Sub-accounts to the AST
Investment Grade Bond Sub-account. Because the amount allocated to the AST
Investment Grade Bond Sub-account and the amount allocated to the Permitted
Sub-accounts each is a variable in the formula, the investment performance of
each affects whether a transfer occurs for your Annuity. In deciding how much
to transfer, we use another formula, which essentially seeks to re-balance
amounts held in the Permitted Sub-accounts and the AST Investment Grade Bond
Sub-account so that the Target Ratio meets a target, which currently is equal
to 80%. Once you elect Highest Daily Lifetime Seven/Spousal Highest Daily
Lifetime Seven, the ratios we use will be fixed. For newly-issued Annuities
that elect Highest Daily Lifetime Seven/Spousal Highest Daily Lifetime Seven
and existing Annuities that elect Highest Daily Lifetime Seven/Spousal Highest
Daily Lifetime Seven, however, we reserve the right to change the ratios.


While you are not notified when your Annuity reaches a reallocation trigger,
you will receive a confirmation statement indicating the transfer of a portion
of your Account Value either to or from the AST Investment Grade Bond
Sub-account. The formula by which the reallocation triggers


68





operate is designed primarily to mitigate the financial risks that we incur in
providing the guarantee under Highest Daily Lifetime Seven/Spousal Highest
Daily Lifetime Seven.


Depending on the results of the calculation relative to the reallocation
triggers, we may, on any day:


.   Not make any transfer between the Permitted Sub-accounts and the AST
Investment Grade Bond Sub-account; or


.   If a portion of your Account Value was previously allocated to the AST
Investment Grade Bond Sub-account, transfer all or a portion of those
amounts to the Permitted Sub-accounts, based on your existing allocation
instructions or (in the absence of such existing instructions) pro rata
(i.e., in the same proportion as the current balances in your variable
investment options). Amounts taken out of the AST Investment Grade Bond
Sub-account will be withdrawn for this purpose on a last-in, first-out
basis; or


.   Transfer all or a portion of your Account Value in the Permitted
Sub-accounts pro-rata to the AST Investment Grade Bond Sub-account.


If your entire Account Value is transferred to the AST Investment Grade Bond
Sub-account, then based on the way the formula operates, the formula will not
transfer amounts out of the AST Investment Grade Bond Sub-account to the
Permitted Sub-accounts and the entire Account Value would remain in the AST
Investment Grade Bond Sub-account. If you make additional Purchase Payments to
your Annuity, they will be allocated to the Sub-accounts according to your
allocation instructions. Such additional Purchase Payments may or may not cause
the formula to transfer money in or out of the AST Investment Grade Bond
Sub-account. Once the Purchase Payments are allocated to your Annuity, they
will also be subject to the mathematical formula, which may result in immediate
transfers to or from the AST Investment Grade Bond Sub-accounts, if dictated by
the formula.


The amount that is transferred to and from the AST Investment Grade Bond
Sub-account pursuant to the mathematical formula depends upon a number of
factors unique to YOUR Annuity (and is not necessarily directly correlated with
the securities markets, bond markets, or interest rates, in general) including:


.   How long you have owned Highest Daily Lifetime Seven/Spousal Highest
Daily Lifetime Seven;


.   The performance of the Permitted Sub-accounts you have chosen;


.   The performance of the AST Investment Grade Bond Sub-account;


.   The amount you have allocated to each of the Permitted Sub-accounts you
have chosen;


.   The amount you have allocated to the AST Investment Grade Bond
Sub-account;


.   Additional Purchase Payments, if any, you make to your Annuity;


.   Withdrawals, if any, you take from your Annuity (withdrawals are taken
pro rata from your Account Value).


69





Any Account Value in the AST Investment Grade Bond Sub-account will not be
available to participate in the investment experience of the Permitted
Sub-accounts if there is a market recovery until it is moved out of the AST
Investment Grade Bond Sub-account.


The more of your Account Value allocated to the AST Investment Grade Bond
Sub-account under the formula, the greater the impact of the performance of
that Sub-account in determining whether (and how much) of your Account Value is
transferred back to the Permitted Sub-accounts. Further, it is possible under
the formula, that if a significant portion your Account Value is allocated to
the AST Investment Grade Bond Sub-account and that Sub-account has good
performance but the performance of your Permitted Sub-accounts is negative,
that the formula might transfer your Account Value to the Permitted
Sub-accounts. Thus, the converse is true too (the more you have allocated to
the Permitted Sub-accounts, the greater the impact of the performance of those
Sub-accounts will have on any transfer to the AST Investment Grade Bond
Sub-account).

	Supplement dated August 16, 2016




	to Prospectuses dated April 29, 2016







	This Supplement should be read in conjunction with the current Prospectus for your Annuity and should be retained for future reference.  This Supplement is intended to update certain information in the Prospectus for the variable annuity you own and is not intended to be a prospectus or offer for any other variable annuity that you do not own.  Defined terms used herein and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings given to them in the Prospectuses and Statements of Additional Information.







	We are issuing this Supplement to reflect changes to the AST Money Market Portfolio of Advanced Series Trust.  

	Please check your Annuity Prospectus to determine which of the following changes affect the Annuity that you own.

	  If you would like another copy of the current Annuity Prospectus, please call us at 1-888-PRU-2888.








	AST Money Market Portfolio – Conversion to AST Government Money Market Portfolio








	At a meeting of the Board of Trustees of Advanced Series Trust, the Board approved changes to the AST Money Market Portfolio’s (the “Portfolio”) investment policies, in order to qualify the Portfolio as a government money market fund.  Pursuant to the investment policy changes approved by the Board, the Portfolio will be managed as a government money market fund, which means that it will invest at least 99.5% or more of its assets in cash, government securities, and/or repurchase agreements that are fully collateralized with cash or other government securities.  In recognition of these investment policy changes, the Board also approved changing the name of the Portfolio, to be known as the AST Government Money Market Portfolio.  As a government money market fund, the Portfolio will seek to maintain a stable $1.00 NAV and will not implement redemption gates or liquidity fees.







	Accordingly, effective on or about September 12, 2016, the AST Money Market Portfolio will change its name to the AST Government Money Market Portfolio, and the Portfolio will be managed as a government money market fund.







	We thus make the following changes to your Annuity Prospectus:







	(1) The annual expenses for the AST Government Money Market Portfolio are shown below.  The table captioned “Underlying Mutual Fund Portfolio Annual Expenses” in the “Summary of Contract Fees and Charges” section of the Prospectus is revised as follows:

	The Manager has contractually agreed to waive a portion of the management fee for the Portfolio by implementing the following management fee schedule:  0.30% to $3.25 billion; 0.2925% on the next $2.75 billion; 0.2625% on the next $4 billion; and 0.2425% over $10 billion of average daily net assets.  This waiver may not be terminated or modified prior to June 30, 2017 without the prior approval of the Trust's Board of Trustees.







	(2) In the section captioned “Variable Investment Options” the table providing a summary description of the Portfolio is revised as follows:













	PORTFOLIO

	PGIM, Inc.















	(3) Effective on or about September 12, 2016, all references to the “AST Money Market Portfolio” are hereby changed to the “AST Government Money Market Portfolio.”




























	THIS SUPPLEMENT SHOULD BE READ AND RETAINED FOR FUTURE REFERENCE

DISCOVERY SELECT VARIABLE ANNUITY

INDEX OF SPECIAL TERMS



We have tried to make this prospectus as readable and understandable as
possible. By the nature of the contract, however, certain technical words or
terms are unavoidable. We have identified the following as some of these words
or terms.




ACCUMULATION PHASE. The period that begins with the contract date (see below
definition) and ends when you start receiving income payments or earlier if
contract is terminated through a full withdrawal or payment of a death benefit.


ACCUMULATION UNIT. A unit of measure used to calculate the value of your assets
allocated to the variable investment options during the accumulation phase.


ANNUITANT. The person(s) whose life determines how long the contract lasts and
the amount of income payments that will be paid. If there are co-annuitants,
"annuitant" means both persons unless otherwise stated.


ANNUITY DATE.  The date when income payments are scheduled to begin.


BENEFICIARY. The person(s) or entity you have chosen to receive a death benefit.


CASH VALUE. This is the total value of your contract amount minus any withdrawal
charge(s) or market-value adjustment, if applicable.


CONTRACT DATE. The date we receive your initial purchase payment and all
necessary paperwork in good order. Contract anniversaries are measured from the
contract date.


CONTRACTOWNER (OWNER OR YOU). The person entitled to the ownership rights under
the contract.


CONTRACT VALUE. The total value of the amounts in a contract allocated to the
variable investment options and the interest rate options as of a particular

INCOME OPTIONS. Options under the contract that define the frequency and
duration of income payments. In your contract, these are referred to as payout
or annuity options.


INTEREST-RATE OPTION. An investment option that offers a fixed-rate of interest
for either a one year (fixed-rate option) or a seven-year period (market-value
adjustment option).


PURCHASE PAYMENTS. The amount you pay to Pruco Life to buy the contract. You can
make additional purchase payments at any time during the accumulation phase.


PRUDENTIAL ANNUITY SERVICE CENTER. P.O. Box 14205, New Brunswick, New Jersey,
08906-4205. The phone number is 1-888-PRU-2888.


SEPARATE ACCOUNT. Purchase payments allocated to the variable investment options
are held by us in a separate account called the Pruco Life Flexible Premium
Variable Annuity Account. The Separate Account is set apart from all of the
general assets of Pruco Life.


TAX DEFERRAL. This is a way to increase your assets without currently being
taxed. You do not pay taxes on your contract earnings until you take money out
of your contract.


VARIABLE INVESTMENT OPTION. When you choose a variable investment option,
purchase shares of the mutual fund which is used as an investment by that
option. We hold these shares in the Separate Account. The division of the
Separate Account of Pruco Life that invests in a particular mutual fund is
referred to in your contract as a subaccount.

DISCOVERY SELECT VARIABLE ANNUITY




SUMMARY




FOR A MORE COMPLETE DISCUSSION OF THE FOLLOWING TOPICS, SEE THE CORRESPONDING


SECTION IN THE PROSPECTUS.


1. WHAT IS THE DISCOVERY SELECT VARIABLE ANNUITY?


This variable annuity contract, offered by Pruco Life, is a contract
between you, as the owner, and us. The contract allows you to invest on a
tax-deferred basis in one or more of 22 variable investment options. There are
also two fixed interest rate options which are available in most states. The
contract is intended for retirement savings or other long-term investment
purposes and provides for a death benefit and guaranteed income options.


The variable investment options are designed to offer the opportunity for a
better return than the fixed account. However, this is NOT guaranteed. It is
possible, due to market changes, that your investments may decrease in value.


The fixed interest-rate options offer an interest rate that is guaranteed.
While your money is in the fixed account, both the interest amount that your
money will earn and your principal amount is guaranteed by us.


You can invest your money in any or all of the variable investment options
and the interest-rate options. You are allowed 12 tax free transfers each
contract year among the variable investment options, without a charge. There are
certain restrictions on transfers involving the interest-rate options.


The contract, like all deferred annuity contracts, has two phases: the
accumulation phase and the income phase. During the accumulation phase, earnings
grow on a tax-deferred basis and are taxed as income when you make a withdrawal.
The income phase starts when you choose to begin receiving regular payments from
your contract. The amount of money you are able to accumulate in your contract
during the accumulation phase will help determine the amount of payments you
will receive during the income phase. Other factors will affect the amount of
your payments such as, age, gender and payout option you selected.


FREE LOOK. If you change your mind about owning Discovery Select, YOU MAY
CANCEL YOUR CONTRACT WITHIN 10 DAYS AFTER RECEIVING IT (or whatever time period
is required in the state where the contract was issued).

DISCOVERY SELECT VARIABLE ANNUITY



Depending upon market conditions, you may earn or lose money in any of these
options. The value of your contract will fluctuate depending upon the investment
performance of the mutual funds used by the variable investment option(s).
Performance information for the variable investment options is provided in
Appendix B and in the Statement of Additional Information (SAI). Past
performance is not a guarantee of future results.


You can also put your money into a fixed interest-rate option or the
market-value adjustment option.


3. WHAT KIND OF PAYMENTS WILL I RECEIVE DURING THE INCOME PHASE? (ANNUITIZATION)


If you want to receive regular income from your annuity, you can choose one
of several options, including guaranteed payments for the annuitant's lifetime.
Once you begin receiving regular payments, you cannot change your payment plan.


4. WHAT IS THE DEATH BENEFIT?


If the sole or last surviving annuitant dies before the income phase of the
contract begins, the person(s) or entity that you have chosen as your
beneficiary will receive a death benefit.


5. HOW CAN I PURCHASE A DISCOVERY SELECT ANNUITY CONTRACT?


You can purchase this contract, under most circumstances, with a $10,000
initial purchase payment. You can add $1,000 or more at any time during the
accumulation phase of the contract. Your financial professional can help you
fill out the proper forms.


6. WHAT ARE THE EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE DISCOVERY SELECT CONTRACT?


The contract has insurance features and investment features, and there are
costs related to each.


Each year we deduct a $30 contract maintenance charge if your contract
value is less than $50,000. For insurance and administrative costs, we also
deduct an annual charge of 1.40% of the average daily value of all assets
allocated to the variable investment options. This charge is not assessed
against amounts allocated to the interest-rate investment options.


There are a few states/jurisdictions that assess a premium tax when you
begin receiving regular income payments from your annuity. In those states, we
will assess the required premium tax charge which can range up to 5%.


There are also charges made by the mutual funds which are invested in by
the variable investment options. These annual charges currently range from 0.37%
to 1.40% of the average daily value of the mutual fund.


7. HOW CAN I ACCESS MY MONEY?


You may take money out at any time during the accumulation phase. Each
year, you withdraw up to 10% of your total purchase payments without charge.
Withdrawals in excess of 10% of your purchase payments may be subject to a
surrender charge. This charge decreases 1% each year. After the 7th year, there
is no charge for a withdrawal. You may subject to income tax and a tax penalty.


8. WHAT ARE THE TAX CONSIDERATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DISCOVERY SELECT
CONTRACT?


Your earnings are not taxed until withdrawn. If you take money out during
the accumulation phase, purchase payments are withdrawn first and are taxed as
income. If you are younger than 59 1/2 when you take money out, you may be
charged a 10% federal tax penalty on the earnings in addition to ordinary
taxation. A portion of the payments you receive during the income phase is
considered partly a return of your original investment. As a result, that
portion of each payment is not taxable as income. Generally, all amounts
withdrawn from IRA contracts are taxable and subject to the 10% penalty if
withdrawn prior to age 59 1/2.

(1) Janus Aspen Series: The information for each portfolio includes fee waivers
by Janus Capital Corporation. Fee waivers reduced the management fee of the
portfolios to the level of the corresponding Janus retail fund. Without these
waivers or reductions, the Management Fee, Other Expenses and Total Operating
Expenses for the portfolios would have been 0.74%,0.04% and 0.78% for the Growth
Portfolio and 0.79%, 0.29% and 1.08% for the International Growth Portfolio.
Janus Capital Corporation may change the waivers or reductions at any time, with
at least 90 days notice to the Trustees.


(2) OCC Accumulation Trust: Other Expenses shown include expense offsets
credited to the Portfolios that lowered overall custody expenses. Total Expenses
for the Small Cap and Managed Portfolios are limited so that their annualized
operating expenses (net of any expense offsets) do not exceed 1.00% of their
average daily net assets. Without these expense limitations and without giving
effect to any expense offsets, the Management Fees, Other Expenses and Total
Portfolio Annual Expenses for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1997 would have
been: 0.80%, 0.17% and 0.97%, for the Small Cap Portfolio and 0.80%, 0.07% and
0.87%, for the Managed Portfolio. Expense offsets for each Portfolio for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 1997 amounted to less than one basis point for
each Portfolio.


(3) T. Rowe Price Funds: Investment Management Fees include the ordinary
expenses of operating the Funds.


(4) Warburg Pincus Trust. The expense figures shown above are based on actual
expenses for fiscal year 1997, including fee waivers and/or expense
reimbursements by the Portfolio's investment advisor and co-administrator. If
the waivers and/or reimbursements were not included in the Investment Management
Fee it would equal 1.25%, Other Expenses would equal 0.33%, and Total Fund
Annual Expenses would have equaled 1.58%.

DISCOVERY SELECT VARIABLE ANNUITY




EXPENSE EXAMPLES





These examples will help you compare the fees and expenses of the different
variable investment options offered by Discovery Select. You can also use the
examples to compare the cost of Discovery Select with other variable annuity
contracts.







EXAMPLE 1 - IF YOU WITHDRAW YOUR ASSETS



Example 1 assumes that you invest $10,000 in Discovery Select and that you
allocate all of your assets to one of the variable investment options and
withdraw all your assets at the end of the time period indicated. The example
also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the mutual

that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the mutual fund's
operating expenses remain the same. Your actual costs may be higher or lower,

These examples do not show past or future expenses. Actual expenses for a

particular year may be more or less than those shown in the examples.


Notes: (cont.) If your contract value is less than $50,000, on your contract
anniversary (and upon a surrender), Pruco Life deducts a $30 fee. The examples
use an average number as the amount of the annual contract fee. This amount was
calculated by taking the total annual contract fees collected in the calendar
year of 1998 and then dividing that number by the total assets allocated to the
investment options using the mutual funds shown in the examples. Your actual
fees will vary based on the amount of your contract and your specific
allocation(s). A table of accumulation unit values of interests in each variable
investment option, appears in an Appendix to this prospectus on Page .
Premium taxes are not reflected in these examples. Premium taxes may apply,
depending on the State where you live.

DISCOVERY SELECT VARIABLE ANNUITY



1.     WHAT IS THE DISCOVERY SELECT VARIABLE ANNUITY?


The Discovery Select Variable Annuity is a contract between you, the owner, and
us, the insurance company, Pruco Life Insurance Company (Pruco Life, We or Us).


Under our contract or agreement, in exchange for your payment to us, we promises
to pay you a guaranteed income stream that can begin any time after the first
contract anniversary. (Maryland residents must wait until the end of the seventh
contract year.). Your annuity is in the accumulation phase. until you decide to
begin receiving annuity payments. The date you begin receiving annuity payments
is the annuity date. On the annuity date, your contract switches to the income
phase.


This annuity contract benefits from tax deferral. Tax deferral means that you
are not taxed on earnings or appreciation on the assets in your contract until
you withdraw money from your contract.


Discovery Select is a variable annuity contract. This means that during the
accumulation phase, you can allocate your assets among 22 variable investment
options as well as 2 guaranteed interest-rate options. (If you live in Maryland,
Oregon or Washington, both interest-rate options may not be available to you.)
If you select a variable investment option, the amount of money you are able to
accumulate in your contract during the accumulation phase depends upon the
investment performance of the mutual fund invested in by that variable
investment option. Because the mutual funds' portfolios fluctuate in value
depending upon market conditions, your assets can either increase or decrease in
value. This is important, since the amount of the annuity payments you receive
during the income phase depends upon the value of your contract at the time you
begin receiving payments.


As mentioned above, Discovery Select also contains 2 guaranteed interest-rate
options; a fixed-rate option and a market-value adjustment option. The
fixed-rate option offers an interest rate that is guaranteed by us for one year
and will always be at least 3.0% per year. The market-value adjustment option
guarantees a stated interest rate, generally higher than the fixed-rate option,
however, assets must be held for a seven-year period. (This option is not
available to residents of Maryland, Oregon or Washington.)


As the owner of the contract, you have all of the decision making rights under
the contract. You will also be the annuitant unless you designate someone else.
The annuitant is the person who receives the annuity payments when the income
phase begins. The annuitant is also the person whose life is used to determine
how much and how long these payments will continue. On and after the annuity
date, the annuitant is the owner and may not be changed. The beneficiary becomes
the owner when a death benefit is payable.


The beneficiary is the person(s) or entity designated to receive any death
benefit if the annuitant(s) dies during the accumulation phase. You may change
the beneficiary any time prior to the annuity date by making a written request
to us. Your request becomes effective when we approve it.

DISCOVERY SELECT VARIABLE ANNUITY




SHORT TERM CANCELLATION RIGHT OR "FREE LOOK


If you change your mind about owning Discovery Select, you may cancel your
contract within 10 days after receiving it (or whatever period is required in
the state where the contract was issued). You can request a refund by returning
the contract either to the financial professional who sold it to you, or to the
Prudential Annuity Service Center at the address shown on the first page of this
prospectus. You will receive, depending on applicable law:


o   Your full purchase payment; or

o   The amount your contract is worth as of the day we receive your request.
amount may be more or less than your original payment.


2.   WHAT INVESTMENT
OPTIONS CAN I CHOOSE?


The contract gives you the choice of allocating your purchase payments to any
one or more of 22 variable investment options, as well as 2 guaranteed
interest-rate options. The 22 variable investment options use mutual funds
managed by leading investment advisors. Each of these mutual funds has a
separate prospectus that is provided with this prospectus. YOU SHOULD READ THE
MUTUAL FUND PROSPECTUS BEFORE YOU DECIDE TO ALLOCATE YOUR ASSETS TO THE VARIABLE
INVESTMENT OPTION USING THAT FUND.

seven-year guaranteed interest rate.


When you select one of these options, your payment will earn interest at the
established rate for the applicable interest rate period. A new interest rate
period is established every time you allocate or transfer money into a fixed
interest-rate option. You may have money allocated in more than one interest
rate period at the same time. This could result in your money earning interest
at different rates and each interest rate period maturing at a different time.


If you transfer or withdraw assets or annuitize from the market-value adjustment
option before a interest rate period is over, the assets will be subject to a
market value adjustment.


The market-value adjustment may increase or decrease the amount being withdrawn
or transferred and may be substantial. The adjustment, whether up or down will
never be greater


10






DISCOVERY SELECT VARIABLE ANNUITY



The amount of the market-value adjustment is based on the difference between
the:


1. Guaranteed interest rate for the amount you are withdrawing or
transferring; and

2. Stated interest rate on the date of withdrawal
or transfer.


The amount of time left in the interest rate period is also a factor. You will
find a detailed description of how the market-value adjustment is calculated on
Page C-___ of this prospectus. (If your contract was issued in the state of
Pennsylvania, please see page C-___ of this prospectus.)



TRANSFERS AMONG OPTIONS


You can transfer money among the variable investment options and the fixed
interest-rate options. Your transfer request may be made by telephone or in
writing to the Prudential Annuity Service Center. [Only two transfers per month
may be made by telephone. After that, all transfer requests must be in writing
with an original signature.] We have procedures in place to confirm that
instructions received by telephone are genuine. We will not be liable
for following telephone instructions that we reasonably believe to be genuine.
Your transfer request will take effect at the end of the business day on which
it was received.


YOU CAN MAKE TRANSFERS OUT OF A FIXED INTEREST-RATE OPTION BUT ONLY DURING THE
30-DAY PERIOD FOLLOWING THE END OF AN INTEREST RATE PERIOD. If you transfer
money from a market-value adjustment option after the 30-day period has ended,
the money may be subject to a market-value adjustment.


During the contract accumulation phase, you can make 12 transfers each contract
year, among the investment options without charge. If you make more than 12
transfers in one contract year, you will be charged $25 for each additional
transfer. (Dollar Cost Averaging and Auto-Rebalancing transfers do not count
toward the 12 free transfers per year.)



DOLLAR COST AVERAGING


The Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) feature allows you to systematically transfer
either a fixed dollar amount or a percentage out of any one variable investment
option or fixed rate option and into any other variable investment option(s).
You can transfer money to more than one variable investment option. The
investment option used for the transfers is designated as the DCA account. You
can have these automatic transfers made from the DCA account monthly, quarterly,
semiannually or annually. By allocating amounts on a regular schedule instead of
allocating the total amount at one particular time, you may be less susceptible
to the impact of market fluctuations.


Your initial transfer must be at least 3% of your DCA account. After that,
transfers will continue automatically until the entire amount in your DCA
account has been transferred or until you tell us to discontinue the transfers.
If your DCA account balance drops below $250, the entire remaining balance of
the account will be transferred on the next transfer date, You can allocate
subsequent purchase payments to re-open the DCA account at any time.


Your transfers will be made on the last calendar day of each transfer period you
have selected, provided that the New York Stock Exchange is open on that date.
If the New York Stock Exchange is not open on a particular transfer date, the
transfer will take effect on the next business day.


Any transfers you make because of Dollar Cost Averaging are not counted toward
the 12 free transfers you are allowed per year. This feature is available only
during the contract accumulation phase.



ASSET ALLOCATION PROGRAM


We recognize the value of having advice when deciding on the allocation of your
money. If you choose to participate in the Asset Allocation Program, your
financial professional will give you a questionnaire to complete that will help
determine a program that is appropriate for you. Your asset allocation will be
prepared based on your answers to the questionnaire. You will not be charged for
this service and you are not obligated to participate or to invest according to
program recommendations



AUTO-REBALANCING


Once your money has been allocated among the variable investment options, the
actual performance


11






DISCOVERY SELECT VARIABLE ANNUITY



of mutual funds may cause your allocation to shift. For example, an investment
option that initially holds only a small percentage of your assets could perform
much better than another investment option. Over time, this option could
increase to a larger percentage of your assets than you desire. You can direct
us to automatically rebalance your assets to return to your original allocation
by selecting the Auto-Rebalancing feature. The fixed interest-rate options and
the DCA account cannot participate in this feature.


Your rebalancing will be done monthly, quarterly, semiannually or annually based
on your choice. The rebalancing will be done on the last calendar day of the
period you have chosen, provided that the New York Stock Exchange is open on
that date. If the New York Stock Exchange is not open on that date, the
rebalancing will take effect on the next business day.


Any transfers you make because of Auto-Rebalancing are not counted toward the 12
free transfers you are allowed per year. This feature is available only during
the contract accumulation phase.



VOTING RIGHTS


We are the legal owner of the shares in the mutual funds representing the
variable investment options. However, we vote the shares of the mutual
funds according to voting instructions it receives from contractowners. We will
mail you a proxy which is a form you need to complete and return to us to tell
us how you wish to vote. When we receive those instructions, we will vote all of
the shares we own on your behalf, in proportion to those instructions. This will
also include any shares that we own on our own behalf. We may
change the way your voting instructions are calculated if it is required by
federal regulation.



SUBSTITUTION


We may substitute one or more of the mutual funds used by the variable
investment options. We may also cease to allow investments in existing funds. We
would do this only if events such as investment policy changes or tax law
changes make the mutual fund unsuitable. We would not do this without the
approval of the Securities and Exchange Commission and necessary state insurance
department approvals. You will be given specific notice in advance of any
substitution we intend to make.


3.   WHAT KIND OF PAYMENTS WILL I RECEIVE DURING THE INCOME PHASE?

(ANNUITIZATION)



PAYMENT PROVISIONS


The annuitant can begin receiving annuity payments any time after the first
contract anniversary. (Maryland residents must wait until after the seventh
anniversary.) Your annuity payments must begin no later than the contract
anniversary that coincides with or follows the annuitant's 90th birthday (unless
we agree to another date).


You may choose among the income plans described below at any time before the
annuity date. These plans are called annuity options. During the income phase,
all of the annuity options under this contract are fixed annuity options. This
means that your participation in the variable investment options ends on the
annuity date. If you have not selected an annuity option by the annuity date,
the Interest Payment Option (Option 3, described below) will automatically be
selected unless prohibited by applicable law. ONCE THE ANNUITY PAYMENTS BEGIN,
YOU CANNOT CHANGE THE ANNUITY OPTION.


12






DISCOVERY SELECT VARIABLE ANNUITY




OPTION 1.  ANNUITY PAYMENTS FOR A FIXED PERIOD


Under this option, we will make equal payments for a period you choose, up to 25
years. The annuity payments may be made monthly, quarterly, semiannually, or
annually for as long as the annuitant is alive. If the annuitant dies during the
income phase, a lump sum payment will be made to the beneficiary. The amount of
the lump sum payment is determined by calculating the present value of the
unpaid future payments. This is done by using the interest rate used to compute
the actual payments. The interest rate used will always be at least 3.50% a
year. For payment periods of 10 years or more, we will waive any withdrawal
charge that otherwise would have been applied.



OPTION 2.  LIFE ANNUITY WITH 120 PAYMENTS


(10 YEARS) CERTAIN

Under this option, we will make annuity payments to the annuitant monthly,
quarterly, semiannually, or annually as long as the annuitant is alive. If the
annuitant dies before we have made 10 years worth of payments, we will pay the
beneficiary the present value of the remaining annuity payments in one lump sum
unless the annuitant has specifically instructed that the remaining monthly
annuity payments continue to be paid to the beneficiary. The present value of
the remaining annuity payments is calculated by using the interest rate used to
compute the amount of the original 120 payments. The interest rate used will
always be at least 3.50% a year. No withdrawal charge is applicable under this
option.



OPTION 3.  INTEREST PAYMENT OPTION


Under this option, you can choose to have us hold all or a portion of your
contract assets in order to accumulate interest. You can receive interest
payments on a monthly, quarterly, semiannual or annual basis or you can allow
the interest to accrue on your contract assets. If you have not selected an
annuity option by the annuity date, this is the option we will automatically
select for you, unless prohibited by applicable law. Under this option, we will
pay you interest at an effective rate of at least 3% a year.


This option is not available if your contract is held in an Individual
Retirement Account.



OPTION 4.  OTHER ANNUITY OPTIONS


We currently offer a variety of other annuity options not described above. At
the time you choose to receive your annuity payments, we may make available to
you any of the annuity options that are offered at your annuity date. You should
be aware that depending on your contract date and the annuity option you choose,
you may have to pay withdrawal charges.


4.     WHAT IS THE DEATH BENEFIT?
If the annuitant (or the last surviving annuitant, if there are co-annuitants)
dies during the accumulation phase, we will, upon receiving appropriate proof of
death, pay a death benefit to the beneficiary designated by the contractowner.
The death benefit feature protects the value of the contract for the
beneficiary.



BENEFICIARY


The beneficiary is the person(s) or entity you name to receive any death
benefit. The beneficiary is named at the time the contract is issued, unless you
change it at a later date. Unless an irrevocable beneficiary has been named, you
can change the beneficiary at any time before the annuitant or last surviving
annuitant dies.



CALCULATION OF THE DEATH BENEFIT


If the annuitant dies prior to age 80, the beneficiary will receive the greater
of the following:


o    Current value of the total assets in the contract; or


o    The highest value of the contract on any contract anniversary date. This is
called the step-up value. Between anniversary dates, the step-up


13






DISCOVERY SELECT VARIABLE ANNUITY



value is only increased by additional amounts invested and reduced
proportionally by withdrawals; or


o    The total of all purchase payments compounded daily at an effective annual
rate of 5%, subject to a 200% cap. This is called the roll-up value and is
also reduced proportionally by withdrawals. (This calculation is not
available to contracts that were issued in New York.)


Upon reaching age 80, the step-up value and roll-up value are locked-in and can
only be increased by additional purchase payments, but will continue to be
reduced proportionally by the withdrawals. For this purpose, an annuitant is
deemed to reach age 80 on the contract anniversary on or following the
annuitant's actual 80th birthday.


Here is an example of proportional reduction:


If an owner withdrew 50% of a contract valued at $100,000 and if the step-up
value was $80,000, the new step-up value following the withdrawal, would be
$40,000 or 50% of what it had been prior to the withdrawal.


If the contractowner and annuitant are not the same, the death benefit is
payable only in the event of the death of a sole annuitant or last surviving
annuitant, not the contractowner.


Certain terms of this death benefit are limited in Oregon. In addition, this
death benefit was enhanced in January, 1998, to provide for an annual step-up
value calculation. Certain contract owners must elect an endorsement for this
enhanced death benefit to apply. See the Statement of Additional Information
(SAI) for details.


5. HOW CAN I PURCHASE A DISCOVERY SELECT CONTRACT?



PURCHASE PAYMENTS


A purchase payment is the amount of money you give us to purchase the contract.
The minimum purchase payment is $10,000. You can make additional purchase
payments of at least $1,000 or more at any time during the accumulation phase.
You must get our prior approval for any purchase payments over $2 million.



ALLOCATION OF PURCHASE PAYMENTS


When you purchase a contract, we will allocate your purchase payment among the
variable investment options and the fixed interest-rate options based on the
percentages you choose. The percentage of your allocation to a specific
investment option can range in whole percentages from 0% to 100%. If you make
additional purchase payments, they will be allocated in the same way as your
most recent purchase payment, unless you tell us otherwise. We will credit these
purchase payments to your contract as of the end of the business day on which
the payment is received. Our business day closes when the New York Stock
Exchange does, usually at [4:15 p.m.] Eastern time.



CALCULATING CONTRACT VALUE


The value of the variable portion of your contract will go up or down depending
on the investment performance of the variable investment option(s) you choose.
To determine the value of your contract, we use a unit of measure called an
accumulation unit. An accumulation unit works like a share of a mutual fund.


Every day we determine the value of an accumulation unit for each of the
variable investment options. We do this by:


1.   Adding up the total amount of money allocated to a specific investment
option;


2.   Subtracting from that amount insurance charges and any other charges
such as taxes; and


3.   Dividing this amount by the number of outstanding accumulation units.


When you make a purchase payment, we credit your contract with accumulation
units. The number of


14






DISCOVERY SELECT VARIABLE ANNUITY



accumulation units credited to your contract is determined by dividing the
amount of the purchase payment allocated to an investment option by the unit
price of the accumulation unit for that investment option. We calculate the unit
price for each investment option after the New York Stock Exchange closes each
day and then credit your contract. The value of the accumulation units can
increase, decrease, or remain the same from day to day. The Accumulation Unit
Values chart on page ___ gives you more detailed information about the
accumulation units of the variable investment options.


We cannot guarantee that the value of your contract will increase or that it
will not fall below the amount of your total purchase payments. However, we do
guarantee a minimum interest rate of 3.0% a year on that portion of the contract
allocated to the fixed interest-rate options.


6.     WHAT ARE THE EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE DISCOVERY SELECT CONTRACT?


There are charges and other expenses associated with the contract that reduce
the return on your investment. These charges and expenses are described below.



INSURANCE CHARGES


Each day, We makes a deduction for our insurance charges. The insurance charges
have two parts:


1.     Mortality and expense risk charge

2.     Administrative expense charge


1.     Mortality and Expense Risk Charge
The mortality risk charge is for assuming the risk that the annuitant(s) will
live longer than expected based on our life expectancy tables. When this
happens, we pay a greater number of annuity payments. The expense risk
charge is for assuming that the current charges will be insufficient in the
future to cover the cost of administering the contract.


The mortality and expense risk charge is equal, on an annual basis, to 1.25% of
the daily value of the contract invested in the variable investment options,
after expenses have been deducted. This charge is not assessed against amounts
allocated to the interest-rate options.


If the charges under the contract are not sufficient, then we will bear the
loss. We do, however, expect to profit from this charge. The mortality and
expense risk charge cannot be increased. Any profits made from this charge may
be used by us to pay for the costs of distributing the contracts.


2.   Administrative Expense Charge
This charge is for the expenses associated with the administration of the
contract. The administration of the contract would include preparing and issuing
the contract, establishment and maintenance of contract records, confirmations,
annual reports, personnel costs, legal and accounting fees, filing fees, and
systems costs.


This charge is equal, on an annual basis, to 0.15% of the daily value of the
contract invested in the variable investment option, after expenses have been
deducted.



ANNUAL CONTRACT FEE



During the accumulation phase, if your contract assets are less than $50,000, we
will deduct $30 per contract year (this fee may differ in certain states). This
annual contract fee is used for administrative expenses and cannot be increased.
The $30 charge will be deducted proportionately from each of the contract's
variable investment options. This charge will also be deducted when you
surrender your contract if your contract assets are less than $50,000.


15






DISCOVERY SELECT VARIABLE ANNUITY




WITHDRAWAL CHARGE


During the accumulation phase you can make withdrawals from your contract. When
you make a withdrawal, money will be taken first from your purchase payments.
When your purchase payments have been used up, then we will take the money from
your earnings. You will not have to pay any withdrawal charge when you withdraw
your earnings.


The withdrawal charge is for the payment of the expenses involved in selling and
distributing the contracts, including sales commissions, printing of
prospectuses, sales administration, preparation of sales literature and other
promotional activities.


You can withdraw up to 10% of your total purchase payments each contract year
without paying a withdrawal charge. This amount is referred to as the
"charge-free amount." If any of the charge-free amount from the previous year is
not used, it will be carried over to the next contract year. During the first
seven contract years, if your withdrawal of purchase payments is more than the
charge-free amount, a withdrawal charge will be applied. This charge is based on
your contract date.


The following table shows the percentage withdrawal charges that would apply:








During contract year 1 ............... 7%
During contract year 2 ............... 6%
During contract year 3 ............... 5%
During contract year 4 ............... 4%
During contract year 5 ............... 3%
During contract year 6 ............... 2%
During contract year 7 ............... 1%








After that ...... 0%



CRITICAL CARE ACCESS


We will allow you to withdraw money from the contract and waive any withdrawal
and annual contract fee, if the annuitant or the last surviving co-annuitant (if
applicable) becomes confined to an eligible nursing home or hospital for a
period of at least three consecutive months. You would need to provide proof of
the confinement to us. If a physician has certified that the annuitant or last
surviving co-annuitant is terminally ill (has six months or less to live) there
will be no charge imposed for withdrawals. Critical Care Access is not available
in all states. This option is not available to the contractowner if he or she is
not the annuitant.



PREMIUM TAXES


Some states and/or municipalities charge premium taxes or similar taxes. We are
responsible for the payment of these taxes and will make a deduction from the
value of the contract to pay for them. Some of these taxes are due when the
contract is issued, others are due when annuity payments begin. It is our
current practice not to deduct these taxes until annuity payments begin. In the
few states that impose a tax, the current rates range up to 5%. This amount may
vary from state to state if the contract is issued in connection with an IRA.



TRANSFER FEE


You can make 12 free transfers every year. We measure a year from the date we
issue your contract (contract date). If you make more than 12 transfers in a
year (excluding Dollar Cost Averaging and Auto-Rebalancing), we will deduct a
transfer fee of $25 for each additional transfer. The transfer fee will be
deducted proportionately from all the affected investment options. A
market-value adjustment will be made only on the funds remaining in the MVA
account after the transfer fee is deducted.



INCOME TAXES


We will pay the taxes on the earnings of the Separate Account. We are
not currently charging the Separate Account for company federal income taxes. We
will periodically review the issue of charging the Separate Account for federal
income taxes.

DISCOVERY SELECT VARIABLE ANNUITY



7.     HOW CAN I ACCESS MY MONEY?


You can access your money by:


o    Making a withdrawal (either partial or complete); or


o    Electing to receive annuity payments during the income phase.



YOU CAN MAKE WITHDRAWALS ONLY DURING THE ACCUMULATION PHASE.



When you make a complete withdrawal, you will receive the value of your contract
on the day you made the withdrawal, less any applicable charges.


Unless you tell us otherwise, any partial withdrawal will be made
proportionately from all of the affected investment options and interest-rate
options. You will have to receive our consent to make a partial withdrawal if
the amount is less than $500.


We will generally pay the withdrawal amount, less any required tax withholding,
within seven days after we receive a properly completed withdrawal request. We
will deduct applicable charges, including a market-value adjustment, if any,
from the assets in your contract.


INCOME TAXES, TAX PENALTIES AND CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS MAY APPLY TO ANY WITHDRAWAL
YOU MAKE. For a more complete explanation, see Section 8 of this prospectus and
the discussion in the Statement of Additional Information.



AUTOMATED WITHDRAWALS


We offer an Automated Withdrawal feature. This feature enables you to
receive periodic withdrawals in monthly, quarterly, semiannual or annual
intervals. We will process your withdrawals at the end of the business day in
the intervals you specify. We will continue at these intervals until you tell us
otherwise.


You can make withdrawals from any designated investment option or proportionally
from all investment options. Market-value adjustments may apply. Withdrawal
charges may be deducted if the withdrawals in any contract year are more than
the charge-free amount. The minimum automated withdrawal amount you can make is
$250.



INCOME TAXES AND A 10% PENALTY TAX ON EARNINGS MAY APPLY TO AUTOMATED
WITHDRAWALS.




SUSPENSION OF PAYMENTS OR TRANSFERS


We may be required to suspend or postpone payments made in connection
with withdrawals or transfers for any period when:


1.   The New York Stock Exchange is closed (other than customary weekend
and holiday closings);


2.   Trading on the New York Stock Exchange is restricted;


3.   An emergency exists during which sales of shares of the mutual funds
are not reasonable or we cannot reasonably value the
accumulation units; or


4.   The Securities and Exchange Commission, by order, so permits
suspension or postponement of payments for the protection of owners.


We expect to pay the amount of any withdrawal or transfer made from the
interest-rate options promptly upon request.


17





8.     WHAT ARE THE TAX CONSIDERATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DISCOVERY
SELECT CONTRACT?


We have prepared the following information on taxes as a general discussion of
the subject. This discussion is based on current laws and interpretations which
may change. It is not intended as tax advice to any individual. You should
consult your own tax adviser about your own circumstances. We have included in
the Statement of Additional Information more detailed discussion about taxes.


We believes the contract is an annuity for federal income tax purposes.
Accordingly, no tax should generally be payable by a contractowner as a result
of any increase in the value of the contract rather, the contractowner will be
taxed when he receives money from the contract.


If you expect to accumulate savings over a long period of time, there should be
a tax advantage in purchasing an annuity rather than, for example, a mutual fund
with a similar investment policy and the same level of expected earnings. This
is because the investment return of an annuity compounds without deduction for
income taxes. The advantage may be considerably greater if you choose monthly
annuity payments after your retirement, and even more so if your income and tax
rate are lower at that time.



ANNUITY CONTRACTS IN GENERAL


Annuity contracts are a means of setting aside money for future needs - usually
retirement. Congress recognized how important saving for retirement was and
provided special rules in the Internal Revenue Code (Code) for annuities.


Simply stated, these rules provide that you will not be taxed on the earnings on
the money held in your annuity contract until you take the money out. This is
referred to as tax deferral. There are different rules as to how you are taxed
depending on how you take the money out and the type of contract qualified or
non-qualified (see following sections).


You, as the owner, are not to be taxed on increases in the value of your
contract until a distribution occurs - either as a withdrawal or as annuity
payments. When you make a withdrawal, you are taxed on the amount of the
withdrawal that is earnings. For annuity payments, different rules apply. A
portion of each annuity payment is treated as a partial return of your purchase
payments and is not taxed. The remaining portion of the annuity payment is
treated as ordinary income. How the annuity payment is divided between taxable
and non-taxable portions depends upon the period over which the annuity payments
are expected to be made. Annuity payments received after you have received all
of your purchase payments are fully includible in income.



QUALIFIED AND NON-QUALIFIED CONTRACTS


If you purchase the Discovery Select contract as an individual and not under any
pension plan, specially sponsored program or an individual retirement annuity,
your contract is referred to as a non-qualified contract. If you purchase the
contract under a pension plan or an individual retirement annuity, your contract
is referred to as a qualified contract. Examples of qualified plans are:

Individual Retirement Accounts or Annuities (IRAs) and pension and
profit-sharing plans, which include 401(k) plans. Tax considerations differ
depending on whether your contract is qualified or non-qualified. Currently, the
only way for a Discovery Select contract to be treated as a qualified contract
is if it is held as an IRA.



CONSIDERATIONS FOR NON-QUALIFIED CONTRACTS




Taxes Payable by Contractowners



o TAXES ON WITHDRAWALS AND SURRENDERS
Until all investment income has been withdrawn, withdrawals and surrenders by a
contractowner, before annuity payments begin, are taxed as ordinary income,
rather than as return of purchase payments.


The assignment of all or part of the contract as collateral for a loan will be
treated as a withdrawal. Also, election of the interest payment option is taxed
as a surrender of the contract.


Certain transfers of a contract for less than full consideration, such as a
gift, will trigger tax on the investment income in the contract. This rule does
not apply to certain transfers between spouses or incident to divorce.


In addition, a transfer of the contract to or the designation of a beneficiary
who is either 37-1/2 years younger than the contractowner or a grandchild of
the contract owner may have Generation Skipping Transfer tax consequences under
section 2601 of the Code.


o TAXES ON ANNUITY PAYMENTS
Annuity payments are taxed more favorably than withdrawals and surrenders. A
portion of each annuity payment you receive will be treated as a partial return
of your purchase payments and will not be taxed. The remaining portion will be
taxed as ordinary income. Annuity payments are divided into taxable and
non-taxable portions based on the proportion of investment in the contract to
the total of the expected payments.


Annuity payments received after the annuitant recovers the full amount of his
investment will be taxable. If annuity payments stop due to the death of the
annuitant before his investment has been fully recovered a tax deduction is
allowed for the unrecovered amount.


18





o PENALTY TAXES ON WITHDRAWALS AND ANNUITY PAYMENTS
Any taxable amount received under an annuity contract may be subject to a 10%
penalty tax. Withdrawals will be exempt from the penalty if:


o    Made on or after the contractowner reaches age 59-1/2 or dies;


o    Attributable to the contractowner becoming disabled (as defined in
Internal Revenue Code section 72(m)(7));


o    Made in the form of level annuity payments paid not less frequently
than annually under a lifetime annuity;


o    Allocable to investment in the contract before August 14, 1982;


o    Under a qualified funding asset (defined by Internal Revenue Code
section 130(d)); or


o    Under an immediate annuity contract (as defined in Internal Revenue
Code section 72(u)(4)).


o TAXES PAYABLE BY BENEFICIARIES
Generally, the same tax rules apply to amounts received by the beneficiary as
those set forth above with respect to the contractowner. The election of an
annuity payment option may defer taxes otherwise payable upon the receipt of a
lump sum death benefit. Certain minimum distribution requirements apply in the
case where the owner dies. See Required Distributions on Death of Owner, below.


o WITHHOLDING OF TAX FROM DISTRIBUTIONS
Taxable amounts distributed from annuity contracts are subject to tax
withholding. You may generally elect not to have tax withheld from your
payments, or to elect the number of withholding exemptions to be used for
calculating the amount of withholding. These elections must be made on the
appropriate We forms. Absent these elections We will withhold the tax amounts
required by the applicable tax regulations.



ANNUITY REQUIREMENTS




DIVERSIFICATION


The Internal Revenue Code (the "Code") provides that the underlying investments
for a variable annuity must satisfy certain diversification requirements. Each
of the mutual funds in which we invest on behalf of contract holders has
represented that it will comply with these requirements. The prospectuses of the
mutual funds provided further detail about the diversification requirements.



INVESTOR CONTROL


IRS regulations do not provide guidance concerning the extent to which
contractowners may direct their investment in the particular investment options
without causing the contract owners instead of us to be considered the owners of
the underlying assets. Because of this uncertainty, we reserve the right to make
such changes as we deem necessary to assure that the contract qualifies as an
annuity for tax purposes. Any such changes will apply uniformly to affected
contract owners and will be made with such notice to affected contractowners as
is feasible under the circumstances.



DISTRIBUTIONS ON DEATH OF OWNER


If the contractowner dies before the entire interest in the contract is
distributed, the value of the contract must be distributed to the designated
beneficiary as described in this section so that the contract qualifies as an
annuity under the Internal Revenue Code.


If the death occurs on or after the annuity date, the remaining portion of the
interest in the contract must be distributed at least as rapidly as under the
method of distribution being used as of the date of death.


If the owner dies before the annuity date, the entire interest in the contract
must be distributed within 5 years after the date of death. However, if an
annuity payment option is selected by the designated beneficiary and if annuity
payments begin within 1 year of the owner's death, the value of the contract may
be distributed over the beneficiary's life or a period not exceeding the
beneficiary's life expectancy. The owner's designated beneficiary is the person
to whom ownership of the contract passes by reason of death, and must be a
natural person.


If any portion of the contractowner's interest is payable to (or for the benefit
of) the surviving spouse of the owner, such portion of the contract may be
continued with the surviving spouse as the owner.


Additional Matter for Non-Qualified Contracts
Ownership of annuities by corporations and other entities, the IRS requirement
to aggregate certain annuities and the favorable treatment of purchase payments
made before August 14, 1982, and the tax on nonresident aliens are discussed
briefly below. You should consult with a qualified tax adviser for complete
information and advice on annuity contracts and particularly these subjects if
they apply to you.



ENTITY OWNERS


The discussion above does not apply when contracts held by or for non-natural
persons like a corporation. Where a contract is held by a non-natural person,
other than as agent or nominee for a natural person, the contract will generally
not be treated as an annuity and increases in the value of the contract will be
subject to tax.


19






AGGREGATION REQUIREMENTS


All annuity contracts issued by the same company (and affiliates) to the same
contractowner during any calendar year must be treated as one annuity contract
for purposes of determining whether an amount is subject to tax.



PURCHASE PAYMENTS MADE BEFORE AUGUST 14, 1982


If your contract was issued in exchange for a contract containing purchase
payments made before August 14, 1982, favorable tax rules may apply to certain
withdrawals from the contract.



NONRESIDENT ALIENS


Special tax withholding rules apply to nonresident aliens.


Considerations for Qualified Contracts

The above information describing the taxation of non-qualified contracts does
not apply to qualified contracts. The different rules that govern qualified
contracts are discussed below and more detailed discussion appears in the
Statement of Additional Information.



IRA FREE LOOK


If you buy a contract for use as an IRA, we will provide you a copy of the
prospectus, contract and a brochure containing information about eligibility,
contribution limits, tax particulars and other IRA information. In addition to
this information (some of which is summarized below), the IRS requires that you
have a "free look" after making an initial contribution to the contract. During
this time, you can cancel the contract by notifying us in writing, and we will
refund your full purchase payment under the contract or the amount your contract
is worth as of the day we receive this cancellation notice. This amount may be
more or less than your original payment.



CONTRIBUTIONS LIMITS/ROLLOVERS


Because of the way the contract is designed, you may only purchase a contract
for an IRA in connection with a "rollover" of amounts from a qualified
retirement plan. You must make a minimum initial payment of $10,000 to purchase
a contract. This minimum is greater than the maximum amount of any annual
contribution you may make to an IRA (which is generally $2,000/year). The
"rollover" rules under the Code are fairly technical; however, an individual or
his or her surviving spouse may generally "roll over" certain distributions from
tax favored retirement plans if he or she meets the requirements for
distribution. This can either be done directly or within 60 days from the date
of these distributions. These plans include Section 401(a) pension or
profit-sharing plans (like a Section 401(k) plan), TDAs, and IRAs. Once you buy
the contract, you can make regular IRA contributions under the contract to the
extent permitted by law. However, if you make such regular IRA contributions,
you should note that you will not be able to treat the contract as a "conduit
IRA," which means that you will not be able subsequently to "roll over" the
contract funds into another Section 401(a) plan or TDA (although you may be able
to transfer the funds to another IRA)



REQUIRED PROVISIONS


Contracts that are IRAs (or endorsements that are part of the contract) must
contain certain provisions:


o    You, as owner of the contract, must be the "annuitant" under the
contract (except in certain cases involving the division of property
under a decree of divorce);


o    Your rights as owner are non-forfeitable;


o    You cannot sell, assign or pledge the contract, other than to We;


o    The annual premium you pay cannot be greater than $2,000 (which does
not include any rollover amounts);


o    The date on which annuity payments must begin cannot be later than
April 1st of the calendar year after the calendar year you turn age
701/2; and o Death and annuity payments must meet "minimum
distribution requirements" (described below).


Usually, the full amount of any distribution from an IRA (including a
distribution from this contract) which is not a rollover is taxable. As taxable
income, these distributions are subject to the general tax withholding rules
described earlier. In addition to this normal tax liability, you may also be
liable for the following, depending on your actions:


o    A 10% "early distribution penalty" (described below);


o    Liability for "prohibited transactions" if you, for example, borrow
against the value of an IRA; or


o    Failure to take a minimum distribution (described below).



ROTH IRAs


Congress amended the Code in 1997 to add a new Section 408A, creating the "ROTH
IRA" as a new type of individual retirement plan. Like standard IRAs, income
within a ROTH IRA accumulates tax-free, and contributions are subject to
specific limits. ROTH IRAs are different in the following ways:


o    Contributions to a ROTH IRA cannot be deducted from your gross income;


20





o    "Qualified distributions" (generally, held for 5 years and payable on
account of death, disability, attainment of age 59 1/2, or first
time-home buyer) from Roth IRAs are excludable from your gross income;
and


o    If eligible, you may make contributions to a ROTH IRA after attaining
age 70 1/2, and distributions are not required to begin upon attaining
such age or at any time thereafter.


Because the contract's minimum initial payment of $10,000 is greater than the
maximum annual contribution permitted to be made to a ROTH IRA (generally,
$2,000 less any contributions to a traditional IRA), you may purchase a contract
as a ROTH IRA only in connection with a "rollover" or "conversion" of the
proceeds of another traditional IRA, conduit IRA, SEP, SIMPLE-IRA, or ROTH IRA.
The Code permits persons who meet certain income limitations (generally,
adjusted gross income under $100,000), and who receive certain qualifying
distributions from such non-ROTH IRAs, to directly rollover or make, within 60
days, a "rollover" of all or any part of the amount of such distribution to a
ROTH IRA which they establish. This conversion triggers current taxation but is
not subject to a 10% early distribution penalty. Once the contract has been
purchased, regular ROTH IRA contributions will be accepted to the extent
permitted by law.



MINIMUM DISTRIBUTION OPTION


If you hold the contract under an IRA or other tax favored plan, you can satisfy
the IRS minimum distribution requirements described above (generally,
distribution after age 70 1/2) under the contract without either annuitizing or
"cash surrendering" a portion of the contract. You, as owner of the contract,
can select either a "calculation" or "recalculation" method to determine the
minimum distribution. We will send you a check for the minimum distribution
amount, less any other partial withdrawals that you made during the year. More
information on the mechanics of this calculation is available on request.



PENALTY FOR EARLY WITHDRAWALS


You may owe a 10% penalty tax to the taxable part of distributions received from
an IRA, SEP, SIMPLE-IRA (which may increase to 25%), ROTH IRA, TDA or qualified
retirement plan before you attain age 59 1/2. There are only limited exceptions
to this tax, and you should consult your tax adviser for further details.



WITHHOLDING


The Code requires a mandatory 20% federal income tax withholding for certain
distributions from a qualified retirement plan, unless the distribution is an
eligible rollover contribution that is "directly" rolled into another qualified
plan, IRA (including the IRA variations described above). For all other
distributions, unless you elect otherwise, We will withhold federal income tax
from the taxable portion of such distribution at an appropriate percentage. The
rate of withholding on annuity payments where no mandatory withholding is
required is determined on the basis of the withholding certificate that you file
with We. If you do not file a certificate, We will automatically withhold
federal taxes on the following basis:


o    For any annuity payments not subject to mandatory withholding, you
will have taxes withheld by us as if you are a married individual,
with 3 exemptions; and


o    For all other distributions, you will be withheld at a 10% rate.


We will provide you with forms and instructions concerning the right to elect
that no amount be withheld from payments in the ordinary course. However, you
should know that, in any event, you are liable for payment of federal income
taxes on the taxable portion of the distributions, and you should consult with
your tax advisor to find out more information on your potential liability if you
fail to pay such taxes.



ERISA DISCLOSURE/REQUIREMENTS


ERISA (the "Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974") prevents a
fiduciary and other "parties in interest" with respect to a plan, from receiving
any benefit from any party dealing with the plan as a result of the sale of the
contract. For these purposes, an IRA constitutes a "plan." Administrative
exemptions under ERISA generally permit the sale of insurance/annuity products
to plans, provided that certain information is disclosed to the person
purchasing the contract. This information has to do primarily with the fees,
charges, discounts and other costs related to the contract, as well as any
commissions paid to any agent selling the contract.


o    Information about any applicable fees, charges, discounts, penalties
or adjustments may be found under "What Are the Expenses Associated
with the Discovery Select Contract" starting on page [17]; and


o    Information about sales representatives and commissions may be found
under "Other Information."


21





Other relevant information required by the exemptions is contained in the
contract and the SAI. Please consult your tax adviser if you have any additional
questions.


9. OTHER INFORMATION



PRUCO LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY


Pruco Life Insurance Company is a stock life insurance company organized in 1971
under the laws of the State of Arizona. Pruco Life is licensed to sell life
insurance and annuities in the District of Columbia, Guam and in all states
except New York and therefore is subject to the insurance laws and regulations
of all the jurisdictions where it is licensed to do business. Pruco Life is a
wholly-owned subsidiary of The Prudential Life Insurance Company of America
(Prudential), a mutual insurance company founded in 1875 under the laws of the
State of New Jersey.


Prudential is considering converting from a mutual insurance company to a stock
insurance company. This process is called demutualization. Legislation allowing
Prudential to demutualize has been enacted by the state of New Jersey, however,
no plan of demutualization has been adopted by the Board of Directors or
approved by policyholders and appropriate state insurance regulators. Once it
has been adopted, this process could take two or more years to complete and
there will be a continuing evaluation by the Board of Directors and senior
management of the company of the potential impact of the process on
contractowners.



THE SEPARATE ACCOUNT


We have established a separate account, the Pruco Life Flexible Premium Variable
Annuity Account (Separate Account), to hold the assets that are associated with
the contracts. The Separate Account was established under Arizona law on June
16, 1995, and is registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as a unit investment trust, which is a
type of investment company. The assets of the Separate Account are held in the
name of Pruco Life and legally belong to us. These assets are kept separate from
all of our other assets and may not be charged with liabilities arising out of
any other business we may conduct. More detailed information about Pruco Life,
including its audited financial statements, are provided in Appendices C and D.



SALE OF THE CONTRACT; DISTRIBUTOR


Prudential Investment Management Services LLC ("PIMS"), 751 Broad Street,
Newark, New Jersey 07102-3777, acts as the distributor of the contracts. PIMS is
a wholly-owned subsidiary of Prudential and is a limited liability corporation
organized under Delaware law in 1996. It is a registered broker-dealer under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and a member of the National Association of
Securities Dealers, Inc. Commissions for the sales of contracts are paid to
Prudential financial professionals and to other independent broker-dealers who
sell the contracts. Registered representatives of independent broker-dealers may
be paid on a different basis than those affiliated with PIMS. The maximum
commission that will be paid to the broker-dealer to cover both the individual
representative's commission and other distribution expenses will not be more
than 6% of the purchase payment.



ASSIGNMENT


You can assign the contract at any time during your lifetime. We will not be
bound by the assignment until we receive written notice. We will not be liable
for any payment or other action we take in accordance with the contract if that
action occurs before we receive notice of the assignment. An assignment, like
any other change in ownership, may trigger a taxable event.


If the contract is issued under a qualified plan, there may be limitations on
your ability to assign the contract. For further information please speak to
your registered representative.

YEAR 2000 COMPLIANCE



Many computer systems are programmed to recognize only the last two digits in a
date. As a result, any computer system that has date-sensitive programming may
recognize a date using "00" as the year 1900 rather than the year 2000. If this
anomaly is not corrected, the year "00" could cause systems to perform date
comparisons and calculations incorrectly which could in turn affect the accuracy
and compromise the integrity of business records.


22





To address this potential problem, Prudential established a Company-wide Program
Office (CPO) to develop and coordinate an operating framework for the Year 2000
compliance activities. Prudential's CPO structured the Year 2000 program into
three major components: Business Applications; Infrastructure; and Business
Partners. The CPO also established quality assurance procedures including a
certification process. This process will monitor and evaluate enterprise-wide
progress of each component of Prudential's program for conversion and upgrading
of systems for Year 2000 compliance.


While Prudential and its subsidiaries believe that they are well positioned to
mitigate its Year 2000 issue, this issue, by its nature contains inherent
uncertainties, including the uncertainty of Year 2000 readiness of third
parties. Consequently, Prudential is unable to determine at this time whether
the consequences of Year 2000 failures will have a material adverse effect on
Prudential's or Pruco Life's operations, liquidity or financial condition. In
the worst case, it is possible that any technology failure, including an
internal or external Year 2000 failure, could have a material impact on
Prudential's or Pruco Life's operations, liquidity, or financial position.


Prudential is enhancing existing business contingency plans to mitigate Year
2000 risk. Current contingency plans include planned responses to the failure of
specific business applications or infrastructure components. These responses are
being reviewed and expected to be finalized by June 1999 to ensure that they are
workable under the special conditions of a Year 2000 failure. The plans are also
being updated to reduce the level of uncertainty about the Year 2000 problem
including readiness of Prudential's Business Partners.

Market-Value Adjustment Formula



WITH RESPECT TO RESIDENTS OF STATES, OTHER THAN PENNSYLVANIA, IN WHICH
DISCOVERY SELECT IS BEING OFFERED. WITH RESPECT TO RESIDENTS OF PENNSYLVANIA,
SEE PAGE C-4.



MARKET-VALUE ADJUSTMENT FORMULA



The Market-Value Adjustment, which is applied to withdrawals and transfers
made at any time other than the 30-day period following the end of an interest
rate period, involves three amounts:


1.   The number of whole months remaining in the existing interest rate
period.


2.   The guaranteed interest rate.


3.   The interest rate that Pruco Life declares for a duration of one year
longer than the number of whole years remaining on the existing cell
being withdrawn from.


Stated as a formula, the Market Value Factor is equal to:


(M/12) x (R-C), not to exceed +0.40 or be less than -0.40;


Where,


M    = the number of whole months (not to be less than one) remaining in the
interest rate period.


R    = the Contract's guaranteed interest rate expressed as a decimal. Thus 6.2%
is converted to 0.062.


C    = the interest rate, expressed as a decimal, that Pruco Life declares for a
duration equal to the number of whole years remaining in the present
interest rate period, plus 1 year as of the date the request for a
withdrawal or transfer is received.


The Market-Value Adjustment is then equal to the Market Value Factor
multiplied by the amount subject to a Market-Value Adjustment.


The steps below explain how a Market-Value Adjustment is calculated.


Step 1: Divide the number of whole months left in the existing interest
rate period (not to be less than one) by 12.


Step 2: Divide the interest rate Pruco Life declares on the date the
request for withdrawal or transfer is received for a duration of years
equal to the whole number of years determined in Step 1, plus 1 additional
year. Subtract this interest rate from the guaranteed interest rate. The
result could be negative.


Step 3: Multiply the results of Step 1 and Step 2. Again, the result could
be negative. If the result is less than -0.4, use the value -0.4. If the
result is in between -0.4 and 0.4, use the actual value. If the result is
more than 0.4, use the value 0.4.


Step 4: Multiply the result of Step 3 (which is the Market Value Factor) by
the value of the amount subject to a Market-Value Adjustment. The result is
the Market-Value Adjustment.


Step 5: The result of Step 4 is added to the interest cell. If the
Market-Value Adjustment is positive, the interest cell will go up in value.
If the Market-Value Adjustment is negative, the interest cell will go down
in value.


Depending upon when the withdrawal request is made, a withdrawal charge may
apply.


E-1





The following example will illustrate the application of a Market-Value
Adjustment and the determination of the withdrawal charge. Suppose a Contract
owner made two invested purchase payments, the first in the amount of $10,000 on
December 1, 1995, all of which was allocated to the Equity Subaccount, and the
second in the amount of $5,000 on October 1, 1997, all of which was allocated to
the MVA Option with a guaranteed interest rate of 8% (0.08) for 7 years. A
request for withdrawal of $8,500 is made on February 1, 2000 (the Contract owner
does not provide any withdrawal instructions). On that date the amount in the
Equity Subaccount is equal to $12,000 and the amount in the interest cell with a
maturity date of September 30, 2004 is $5,985.23, so that the Contract Fund on
that date is equal to $17,985.23.


On February 1, 2000, the interest rates declared by Pruco Life for the
duration of 5 years (4 whole years remaining until September 30, 2004, plus 1
year) is 11%.


The following computations would be made:


1.   Calculate the Contract Fund value as of the effective date of the
transaction. This would be $17,985.23.


2.   Calculate the charge-free amount (the amount of the withdrawal that is not
subject to a withdrawal charge).








  DATE          PAYMENT        FREE
-------        --------       ------
12/1/95         $10,000       $1,000
12/1/96                       $2,000
10/1/97         $ 5,000       $2,500
12/1/97                       $4,000
12/1/98                       $5,500
12/1/99                       $7,000








The charge-free amount in the fifth Contract year is 10% of $15,000
(total purchase payments) plus $5,500 (the charge-free amount
available in the fourth Contract year) for a total of $7,000.


3.   Since the withdrawal request is in the fifth Contract year, a 3% withdrawal
charge rate applies to any portion of the withdrawal which is not
charge-free.








 $8,500.00          requested withdrawal amount
-$7,000.00          charge-free
----------
 $1,500.00          additional amount needed to complete withdrawal








The Contract provides that the Contract Fund will be reduced by an amount
which, when reduced by the withdrawal charge, will equal the amount
requested. Therefore, in order to produce the amount needed to complete the
withdrawal request ($1,500), we must "gross-up" that amount, before
applying the withdrawal charge rate. This is done by dividing by 1 minus
the withdrawal charge rate.


$1,500.00 / (1-.03) =

$1,500.00 / 0.97 = $1,546.39 grossed-up amount


Please note that a 3% withdrawal charge on this grossed-up amount reduces
it to $1,500, the balance needed to complete the request.








$1,546.39    grossed-up amount
    ? .03    withdrawal charge rate
----------
  $ 46.39    withdrawal charge








E-2





4.   The Market Value Factor is determined as described in steps 1 through 5,
above. In this case, it is equal to 0.08 (8% is the guaranteed rate in the
existing cell) minus 0.11 (11% is the interest rate that would be offered
for an interest cell with a duration of the remaining whole years plus 1),
which is -0.03, multiplied by 4.58333 (55 months remaining until September
30, 2004, divided by 12) or -0.13750. Thus, there will be a negative
Market-Value Adjustment of 14% of the amount in the interest cell that is
subject to the adjustment.








-0.13750 ? $5,985.23 =                   -822.97  negative MVA
                                       $5,985.23  unadjusted value
                                      -----------
                                       $5,162.26  adjusted value
                                      $12,000.00  Equity value
                                      -----------
                                      $17,162.26  adjusted Contract Fund








5.   The total amount to be withdrawn, $8,546.39, (sum of the surrender charge,
$46.39, and the requested withdrawal amount of $8,500) is apportioned over
all accounts making up the Contract Fund following the Market-Value
Adjustments, if any, associated with the MVA option.








Equity           ($12,000/$17,162.26) ? $8,546.39 =      $5,975.71
7-Yr MVA       ($5,162.26/$17,162.26) ? $8,546.39 =      $2,570.68
                                                         ---------
                                                         $8,546.39








6.   The adjusted value of the interest cell, $5,162.26, reduced by the
withdrawal of $2,570.68 leaves $2,591.58. This amount must be "unadjusted"
by dividing it by 0.86250 (1 plus the Market-Value Adjustment of -0.13750)
to determine the amount remaining in the interest cell to which the
guaranteed interest rate of 8% will continue to be credited until September
30, 2004 or a subsequent withdrawal. That amount is $3,004.73.



WITH RESPECT TO RESIDENTS OF PENNSYLVANIA ONLY.




MARKET-VALUE ADJUSTMENT FORMULA



The Market-Value Adjustment, which is applied to withdrawals and transfers made
at any time other than the 30-day period following the end of an interest rate
period, involves three amounts:


1.   The number of whole months remaining in the existing interest rate
period.


2.   The guaranteed interest rate.


3.   The interpolated value of the interest rates that Pruco Life declares
for the number of whole years remaining and the duration 1 year longer
than the number of whole years remaining in the existing interest rate
period.


Stated as a formula, the Market Value Factor is equal to:

(M/12) x (R-C), not to exceed +0.40 or be less than -0.40;
Where,


M    = the number of whole months (not to be less than one) remaining in the
interest rate period.


R    = the Contract's guaranteed interest rate expressed as a decimal. Thus 6.2%
is converted to 0.062.


C    = the interpolated value of the interest rates, expressed as a decimal,
that Pruco Life declares for the number of whole years remaining and the
duration 1 year longer than the number of whole years remaining as of the
date the request for a withdrawal or transfer is received or m/365 x (n+1)
year rate + (365-m)/365 ? n year rate, where "n' equals years and "m'
equals days remaining in year "n' of the existing interest rate period.


The Market-Value Adjustment is then equal to the Market Value Factor
multiplied by the amount subject to a Market-Value Adjustment.


E-3





The steps below explain how a Market-Value Adjustment is calculated.


Step 1: Divide the number of whole months left in the existing interest
rate period (not to be less than one) by 12.


Step 2: Interpolate the interest rates Pruco Life declares on the date the
request for withdrawal or transfer is received for the duration of years
equal to the whole number of years determined in Step 1, plus the whole
number of years plus 1 additional year.


Step 3: Subtract this interpolated interest rate from the guaranteed
interest rate. The result could be negative.


Step 4: Multiply the results of Step 1 and Step 2. Again, the result could
be negative. If the result is less than -0.4, use the value -0.4. If the
result is in between -0.4 and 0.4, use the actual value. If the result is
more than 0.4, use the value 0.4.


Step 5: Multiply the result of Step 3 (which is the Market Value Factor) by
the value of the amount subject to a Market-Value Adjustment. The result is
the Market-Value Adjustment.


Step 6: The result of Step 4 is added to the interest cell. If the
Market-Value Adjustment is positive, the interest cell will go up in value.
If the Market-Value Adjustment is negative, the interest cell will go down
in value.


Depending upon when the withdrawal request is made, a withdrawal charge may
apply.


The following example will illustrate the application of a Market-Value
Adjustment and the determination of the withdrawal charge. Suppose a Contract
owner made two invested purchase payments, the first in the amount of $10,000 on
December 1, 1995, all of which was allocated to the Equity Subaccount, and the
second in the amount of $5,000 on October 1, 1997, all of which was allocated to
the MVA Option with a guaranteed interest rate of 8% (0.08) for 7 years. A
request for withdrawal of $8,500 is made on February 1, 2000 (the Contract owner
does not provide any withdrawal instructions). On that date the amount in the
Equity Subaccount is equal to $12,000 and the amount in the interest cell with a
maturity date of September 30, 2004 is $5,985.23, so that the Contract Fund on
that date is equal to $17,985.23.


On February 1, 2000, the interest rates declared by Pruco Life for the
durations 4 and 5 years (4 whole years remaining until September 30, 2004, plus
1 year) are 10.8% and 11.4%, respectively.


The following computations would be made:


1.   Calculate the Contract Fund value as of the effective date of the
transaction. This would be $17,985.23.


2.   Calculate the charge-free amount (the amount of the withdrawal that is not
subject to a withdrawal charge).








  DATE          PAYMENT        FREE
-------        --------       ------
12/1/95         $10,000       $1,000
12/1/96                       $2,000
10/1/97         $ 5,000       $2,500
12/1/97                       $4,000
12/1/98                       $5,500
12/1/99                       $7,000








The charge-free amount in the fifth Contract year is 10% of $15,000 (total
purchase payments) plus $5,500 (the charge-free amount available in the
fourth Contract year) for a total of $7,000.


3.   Since the withdrawal request is in the fifth Contract year, a 3% withdrawal
charge rate applies to any portion of the withdrawal which is not
charge-free.


E-4











 $8,500.00          requested withdrawal amount
-$7,000.00          charge-free
----------
 $1,500.00          additional amount needed to complete withdrawal








The Contract provides that the Contract Fund will be reduced by an amount
which, when reduced by the withdrawal charge, will equal the amount
requested. Therefore, in order to produce the amount needed to complete the
withdrawal request ($1,500), we must "gross-up" that amount, before
applying the withdrawal charge rate. This is done by dividing by 1 minus
the withdrawal charge rate.


$1,500.00 / (1-.03) =
$1,500.00 / 0.97 = $1,546.39 grossed-up amount


Please note that a 3% withdrawal charge on this grossed-up amount reduces
it to $1,500, the balance needed to complete the request.








 $1,546.39    grossed-up amount
     ? .03    withdrawal charge rate
----------
   $ 46.39    withdrawal charge








4.   The Market Value Factor is determined as described in steps 1 through 5,
above. In this case, it is equal to 0.08 (8% is the guaranteed rate in the
existing cell) minus 0.11 (11% is the interpolated value for the interest
rates that would be offered for interest cells with durations of whole
years remaining and whole year plus 1 remaining in the existing interest
rate period), which is -0.03, multiplied by 4.58333 (55 months remaining
until September 30, 2004, divided by 12) or -0.13750. Thus, there will be a
negative Market-Value Adjustment of approximately 14% of the amount in the
interest cell that is subject to the adjustment.








-0.13750 ? $5,985.23 =             -822.97  negative MVA
                                 $5,985.23  unadjusted value
                                -----------
                                 $5,162.26  adjusted value
                                $12,000.00  Equity value
                                -----------
                                $17,162.26  adjusted Contract Fund








5.   The total amount to be withdrawn, $8,546.39, (sum of the surrender charge,
$46.39, and the requested withdrawal amount of $8,500) is apportioned over
all accounts making up the Contract Fund following the Market-Value
Adjustments, if any, associated with the MVA option.








Equity           ($12,000/$17,162.26) ? $8,546.39 =      $5,975.71
7-Yr MVA       ($5,162.26/$17,162.26) ? $8,546.39 =      $2,570.68
                                                         ---------
                                                         $8,546.39








6.   The adjusted value of the interest cell, $5,162.26, reduced by the
withdrawal of $2,570.68 leaves $2,591.58. This amount must be "unadjusted"
by dividing it by 0.86250 (1 plus the Market-Value Adjustment of -0.13750)
to determine the amount remaining in the interest cell to which the
guaranteed interest rate of 8% will continue to be credited until September
30, 2004 or a subsequent withdrawal. That amount is $3,004.73.

OTHER INFORMATION CONCERNING THE ACCOUNT




PRINCIPAL UNDERWRITER



Prudential Investment Management Services LLC ("PIMS"), an indirect wholly-owned
subsidiary of Prudential which was organized in 1996 as a limited liability
corporation under Delaware law, acts as the principal underwriter of the
Contract. PIMS is registered as a broker-dealer under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 and is a member of the National Association of Securities Dealers,
Inc. The principal business address of PIMS is 751 Broad Street, Newark, New
Jersey 07102-3777.


The Contract is currently sold by registered representatives of broker-dealers
authorized by the principal underwriter and which are affiliated with
Prudential. PIMS may enter into selling agreements with broker-dealers otherwise
unaffiliated with Prudential. Registered representatives of such other
unaffiliated broker-dealers may be paid on a different basis than registered
representatives of the principal underwriter or broker-dealers affiliated with
Prudential. The maximum commission that will be paid to the broker-dealer to
cover both the individual representative's commission and other distribution
expenses will not exceed 6% of the purchase payment. In addition, trail
commissions based on the size of the contract Fund may be paid.



DETERMINATION OF SUBACCOUNT UNIT VALUES



The value for each Subaccount Unit is computed as of the end of each "valuation
period" as defined in the prospectus (also referred to in this section as
"business day"). On any given business day the value of a Unit in each
subaccount will be determined by multiplying the value of a Unit of that
subaccount for the preceding business day by the net investment factor for that
subaccount for the current business day. The net investment factor for any
business day is determined by dividing the value of the assets of the subaccount
for that day by the value of the assets of the subaccount for the preceding
business day (ignoring, for this purpose, changes resulting from new purchase
payments and withdrawals), and subtracting from the result the daily equivalent
of the 1.4% annual charge for administrative expenses and mortality and expense
risks. (See CHARGES, FEES, AND DEDUCTIONS in the prospectus.) The value of the
assets of a subaccount is determined by multiplying the number of shares of The
Prudential Series Fund, Inc. (the "Series Fund") or other Fund held by that
subaccount by the net asset value of each share and adding the value of
dividends declared by the Series Fund or other Fund but not yet paid.





PERFORMANCE INFORMATION



The tables that follow provide performance information for each subaccount
through December 31, 1998. The performance information is based on historical
experience and does not indicate or represent future performance.


B-2






AVERAGE ANNUAL TOTAL RETURN



The DISCOVERY SELECT Annuity is a relatively new contract. The returns shown
below were calculated using historical investment returns of the Funds. All
fees, expenses and charges associated with the DISCOVERY SELECT Annuity and the
Funds have been reflected in these returns, as if the Contract had existed from
the inception date of each Funds' portfolios.


Table 1 below shows the average annual rates of total return on hypothetical
investments of $1,000 for periods ended December 31, 1997 in each subaccount
other than the Money Market Subaccount. These figures assume withdrawal of the
investments at the end of the period other than to effect an annuity under the
Contract. This table assumes deferred sales charges.



TABLE 1

AVERAGE ANNUAL TOTAL RETURN




[PERFORMANCE INFORMATIOIN TO BE PROVIDED BY AMENDMENT]




Note 1: This table assumes deferred sales charges.




Note 2: Based on results of the Quest for Value Accumulation Trust and its


predecessor. On September 16, 1994, an investment company which had commenced
operations on August 1, 1988, then called Quest for Value Accumulation Trust
(the "Old Trust"), was effectively divided into two investment funds--the Old
Trust and the present Quest for Value Accumulation Trust (the "Present
Trust")--at which time the Present Trust Commenced Operations.



Note 3: All tables assume a $30.00 annual charge for contracts under $50,000.



The average annual rates of total return shown above are computed by finding the
average annual compounded rates of return over the periods shown that would
equate the initial amount invested to the withdrawal value, in accordance with
the following formula: P(1+T)(n)=ERV. In the formula, P is a hypothetical
investment of $1,000; T is the average annual total return; "n" is the number of
years; and ERV is the withdrawal value at the end of the periods shown. These
figures assume deduction of the maximum withdrawal charge that may be applicable
to a particular period.


B-3






NON-STANDARD TOTAL RETURN



Table 2 below shows the average annual rates of return as in Table 1, but
assumes that the investments are not withdrawn at the end of the period or that
the Contract owner annuitizes at the end of the period. This table assumes no
deferred sales charges.

MONEY MARKET SUBACCOUNT YIELD



The "yield" and "effective yield" figures for the Money Market Subaccount shown
below were calculated using historical investment returns of the Money Market
Portfolio of the Prudential Series Fund. All fees, expenses and charges
associated with the DISCOVERY SELECT Annuity and the Series Fund have been
reflected.


The "yield" and "effective yield" of the Money Market Subaccount for the seven
days ended December 31, 1998 were [4.20]% and [4.29]%, respectively.


The yield is computed by determining the net change, exclusive of capital
changes, in the value of a hypothetical pre-existing account having a balance of
one accumulation unit of the Money Market Subaccount at the beginning of the
period, subtracting a hypothetical charge reflecting deductions from contract
owner accounts, and dividing the difference by the value of the subaccount at
the beginning of the base period to obtain the base period return, and then
multiplying the base period return by (365/7), with the resulting figure carried
to the nearest ten-thousandth of 1%.


The deduction referred to above consists of the 1.25% charge for mortality and
expense risks and the 0.15% charge for administration. It does not reflect the
withdrawal charge.


The effective yield is obtained by taking the base period return, adding 1,
raising the sum to a power equal to 365 divided by 7, and subtracting 1 from the
result, according to the following formula: Effective Yield--([base period
return + 1] 365/7)-1.


The yields on amounts held in the Money Market Subaccount will fluctuate on a
daily basis. Therefore, the stated yields for any given period are not an
indication of future yields.

Item 26. PERSONS CONTROLLED BY OR UNDER COMMON CONTROL WITH THE DEPOSITOR OR
REGISTRANT



Pruco Life Insurance Company ("Pruco Life"), a corporation organized under the
laws of Arizona, is a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of The Prudential
Insurance Company of America, ("Prudential"), a mutual life insurance company
organized under the laws of New Jersey. The subsidiaries of Prudential and short
descriptions of each are set forth on the following pages.


Pruco Life may be deemed to control its two wholly-owned subsidiaries, Pruco
Life Insurance Company of New Jersey ("Pruco Life of New Jersey") and The
Prudential Insurance Company of Arizona ("PLICA"). Pruco Life may also be deemed
to control the following separate accounts which are registered as unit
investment trusts under the Investment Company Act of 1940: the Pruco Life
Variable Appreciable Account, the Pruco Life Variable Insurance Account, the
Pruco Life Single Premium Variable Life Account, the Pruco Life Variable
Universal Account, the Pruco Life PRUvider Variable Appreciable Account, the
Pruco Life Single Premium Variable Annuity Account, the Pruco Life Flexible
Premium Variable Annuity Account (Registrant) (separate accounts of Pruco Life),
the Pruco Life of New Jersey Variable Appreciable Account, the Pruco Life of New
Jersey Variable Insurance Account, the Pruco Life of New Jersey Single Premium
Variable Life Account, and the Pruco Life of New Jersey Single Premium Variable
Annuity Account (separate accounts of Pruco Life of New Jersey).


The above-referenced separate accounts, along with Prudential and certain of
Prudential's separate accounts, hold all the shares of The Prudential Series
Fund, Inc., a Maryland corporation. In addition, The Prudential holds all the
shares of Prudential's Gibraltar Fund, a Maryland Corporation, in three of its
separate accounts. The Prudential Series Fund, Inc. and Prudential's Gibraltar
Fund are registered as open-end diversified, management investment companies
under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Additionally, the aforementioned
separate accounts of Prudential are registered as unit investment trusts under
the Investment Company Act of 1940.

Prudential Variable Contract Account-2, The Prudential Variable Contract
Account-10, and The Prudential Variable Contract Account-11, separate accounts
of Prudential, all of which are registered as open-end, diversified, management
investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and with the
Prudential Variable Contract Account-24, a registered unit investment trust.


The subsidiaries of Prudential and short descriptions of each are listed under

Item 27. NUMBER OF CONTRACT OWNERS



As of November 30, 1998, there were ________ Contractowners of qualified
Contracts and ________________ owners of non-qualifed Contracts offered by the
Registrant.



Item 28. INDEMNIFICATION



The Registrant, in conjunction with certain affiliates, maintains insurance on
behalf of any person who is or was a trustee, director, officer, employee, or
agent of the Registrant, or who is or was serving at the request of the
Registrant as a trustee, director, officer, employee or agent of such other
affiliated trust or corporation, against any liability asserted against and
incurred by him or her arising out of his or her position with such trust or
corporation.


Arizona, being the state of organization of Pruco Life Insurance Company
("Pruco"), permits entities organized under its jurisdiction to indemnify
directors and officers with certain limitations. The relevant provisions of
Arizona law permitting indemnification can be found in Section 10-850 et. seq.
of the Arizona Statutes Annotated. The text of Pruco's By-law, Article VIII,
which relates to indemnification of officers and directors, is incorporated by
reference to Exhibit 3(ii) to its form 10-Q filed August 15, 1997.


Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of
1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the
Registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions or otherwise, the Registrant has
been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such
indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is,
therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against
such liabilities (other than the payment by the Registrant of expenses incurred
or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the Registrant in the
successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such
director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being
registered, the Registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter
has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate
jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public
policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of
such issue.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements                                      
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. BUSINESS                                                                     
Pruco Life Insurance Company or "the Company," is a stock life insurance        
company, organized in 1971 under the laws of the state of Arizona. Pruco Life   
Insurance Company is licensed to sell interest sensitive individual life        
insurance, variable life insurance, term life insurance, variable and fixed     
annuities, and a non-participating guaranteed interest contract or, "GIC,"      
called Prudential Credit Enhanced GIC or, "PACE," in the District of Columbia,  
Guam and in all states except New York. Pruco Life Insurance Company also had   
marketed individual life insurance through its branch office in Taiwan. The     
branch office was transferred to an affiliated Company on January 31, 2001, as  
described in Note 13.                                                           

Pruco Life Insurance Company has three subsidiaries, which include one wholly   
owned life insurance subsidiary, Pruco Life Insurance Company of New Jersey or, 
"PLNJ," and two subsidiaries formed in 2003 for the purpose of acquiring and    
investing in municipal fixed maturities from an affiliated company (see Note    
13). Pruco Life Insurance Company and its subsidiaries are referred to as "the  
Company" and all financial information is shown on a consolidated basis         
throughout this document.                                                       

PLNJ is a stock life insurance company organized in 1982 under the laws of the  
state of New Jersey. It is licensed to sell individual life insurance, variable 
life insurance, term life insurance, fixed and variable annuities only in the   
states of New Jersey and New York.                                              

The Company is a wholly owned subsidiary of The Prudential Insurance Company of 
America ("Prudential Insurance"), an insurance company founded in 1875 under the
laws of the state of New Jersey. On December 18, 2001 or, "the date of          
demutualization," Prudential Insurance converted from a mutual life insurance   
company to a stock life insurance company and became an indirect wholly owned   
subsidiary of Prudential Financial, Inc. or "Prudential Financial."             

Prudential Insurance intends to make additional capital contributions to the    
Company, as needed, to enable it to comply with its reserve requirements and    
fund expenses in connection with its business. Generally, Prudential Insurance  
is under no obligation to make such contributions and its assets do not back the
benefits payable under the Company's policyholder contracts.                    

The Company is engaged in a business that is highly competitive because of the  
large number of stock and mutual life insurance companies and other entities    
engaged in marketing insurance products, and individual and group annuities.    

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES                                   

Restatement of Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows                            

The Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2004,
2003 and 2002 have been restated to reflect the following:                      

Changes in the net receivable/payable from unsettled investment purchases and   
sales, previously classified within "adjustments to reconcile net income to cash
provided by operating activities," have been reclassified to cash flows from    
(used in) investing activities, to the extent such balances pertained to        
investments classified as available for sale.                                   

The net change in the policy loans receivable, previously reported in cash flows
from operating activities, is now reported as a component of cash flows from    
(used in) investing activities.                                                 

Changes in the presentation of bank overdrafts and various other items          
previously reported in cash flows from operating activities, are now reported as
a component of cash flows from (used in) financing activities.

As a result of the restatements, previously reported cash flows from operating  
activities, cash flows (used in) investing activities and cash flows from (used 
in) financing activities were increased or reduced for the years ended December
31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 as follows:

The restatements had no impact on the total change in cash and cash equivalents 
within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows or on the Consolidated         
Statements of Operations or Statements of Financial Position.                   

Basis of Presentation                                                           
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Pruco Life        
Insurance Company and its subsidiaries. The consolidated financial statements   
have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted  
in the United States of America, "GAAP." The Company has extensive transactions 
and relationships with Prudential Insurance and other affiliates, as more fully 
described in Note 13. Due to these relationships, it is possible that the terms 
of these transactions are not the same as those that would result from          
transactions among wholly unrelated parties.                                    

Use of Estimates                                                                
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires        
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities, in particular deferred policy acquisition costs,        
investments, future policy benefits, provision for income taxes, disclosure of  
contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported 
amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Actual results could differ 
from those estimates.                                                           

Stock Options                                                                   
Effective January 1, 2003, Prudential Financial changed its accounting for      
employee stock options to adopt the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS   
No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," as amended, prospectively   
for all new awards granted to employees on or after January 1, 2003.            
Accordingly, results of operations of the Company for the years ended December
31, 2004 and 2003, include costs of $0.3 million and $0.9 million, respectively,
associated with employee stock options issued by Prudential Financial to certain
employees of the Company. Prior to January 1, 2003, Prudential Financial        
accounted for employee stock options using the intrinsic value method of APB No.
25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and related interpretations.    
Under this method, Prudential Financial and the Company did not recognize any   
stock-based compensation costs as all options granted had an exercise price     
equal to the market value of Prudential Financial's Common Stock on the date of 
grant.                                                                          

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R, "Share-Based Payment," which   
replaces FASB Statement No. 123. SFAS 123R requires all entities to apply the   
fair value based measurement method in accounting for share-based payment       
transactions with employees except for equity instruments held by employee share
ownership plans. As described above Prudential Financial had previously adopted 
the fair value recognition provisions of the original SFAS 123 for all new      
awards granted to employees on or after January 1, 2003. SFAS 123R is effective 
for interim and annual periods beginning after June

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)                       

15, 2005. Prudential Financial will adopt the fair value recognition provisions 
of this statement on July 1, 2005 for those awards issued prior to January 1,
2003. By that date, the unvested stock options issued prior to January 1, 2003, 
will be recognized over the remaining vesting period of approximately six       
months.                                                                         

Prudential Financial and the Company account for non-employee stock options     
using the fair value method of SFAS No. 123 in accordance with Emerging Issues  
Task Force Issue ("EITF") No. 96-18 "Accounting for Equity Instruments That Are 
Issued to Other Than Employees" and related interpretations in accounting for   
its non-employee stock options.                                                 

Investments                                                                     
Fixed maturities classified as "available for sale" are carried at fair value.  
The amortized cost of fixed maturities is written down to fair value if a       
decline in value is considered to be other than temporary. See the discussion   
below on realized investment gains and losses for a description of the          
accounting for impairment adjustments. Unrealized gains and losses on fixed     
maturities "available for sale", including the effect on deferred policy        
acquisition costs and policyholders' account balances that would result from the
realization of unrealized gains and losses are included in "Accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss)."                                                   

Policy loans are carried at unpaid principal balances.                          

Securities repurchase and resale agreements and securities borrowed and loaned  
transactions are used to generate income, to borrow funds, or to facilitate     
trading activity. Securities repurchase and resale agreements are generally     
short-term in nature, and therefore, the carrying amounts of these instruments  
approximate fair value. Securities repurchase and resale agreements are         
collateralized principally by U.S. government and government agency securities. 
Securities borrowed or loaned are collateralized principally by cash or U.S.    
government securities. For securities repurchase agreements and securities      
loaned transactions used to generate income, the cash received is typically     
invested in cash equivalents, short-term investments or fixed maturities.       

Securities repurchase and resale agreements that satisfy certain criteria are   
treated as collateralized financing arrangements. These agreements are carried  
at the amounts at which the securities will be subsequently resold or           
reacquired, as specified in the respective agreements. For securities purchased 
under agreements to resell, the Company's policy is to take possession or       
control of the securities and to value the securities daily. Securities to be   
resold are the same, or substantially the same, as the securities received. For 
securities sold under agreements to repurchase, the market value of the         
securities to be repurchased is monitored, and additional collateral is obtained
where appropriate, to protect against credit exposure. Securities to be         
repurchased are the same, or substantially the same as those sold. Income and   
expenses related to these transactions executed within the general account and  
it's insurance subsidiary used to generate income are reported as "Net          
investment income," however, for transactions used to borrow funds, the         
associated borrowing cost is reported as interest expense (included in "General 
and administrative expenses").                                                  

Securities borrowed and securities loaned transactions are treated as financing 
arrangements and are recorded at the amount of cash advanced or received. With  
respect to securities loaned transactions, the Company obtains collateral in an 
amount equal to 102% and 105% of the fair value of the domestic and foreign     
securities, respectively. The Company monitors the market value of the          
securities borrowed and loaned on a daily basis with additional collateral      
obtained or provided as necessary. Substantially all of the Company's securities
borrowed transactions are with brokers and dealers, commercial banks and        
institutional clients. Substantially all of the Company's securities loaned     
transactions are with large brokerage firms. Income and expenses associated with
securities borrowing transactions are reported as "Net investment income."      
Income and expenses associated with securities loaned transactions used to      
generate income are generally reported as "Net investment income;" however, for 
securities loaned transactions used for funding purposes the associated rebate  
is reported as interest expense (included in "General and administrative        
expenses").                                                                     

Short-term investments consist of highly liquid debt instruments with a maturity
of greater than three months and less than twelve months when purchased. These  
investments are carried at amortized cost, which because of their short-term    
nature approximates fair value.                                                 

Other long-term investments consist of the Company's investments in joint       
ventures and limited partnerships in which the Company does not exercise        
control, as well as investments in the Company's own separate accounts, which   
are carried at estimated fair value, and investment real estate. Joint venture  
and partnership interests are generally accounted for using the equity method of
accounting, except in instances in which the Company's interest is so minor that
it exercises virtually no influence over operating and financial policies. In   
such instances, the Company applies the cost method of accounting. The Company's
net income from investments in joint ventures and partnerships is generally     
included in "Net investment income."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)                       

Realized investment gains (losses), net are computed using the specific         
identification method. Costs of fixed maturities and equity securities are      
adjusted for impairments, which are declines in value that are considered to be 
other than temporary. Impairment adjustments are included in "Realized          
investment losses, net." In evaluating whether a decline in value is other than 
temporary, the Company considers several factors including, but not limited to  
the following: (1) the extent (generally if greater than 20%) and the duration  
(generally if greater than six months); (2) the reasons for the decline in value
(credit event, interest related or market fluctuation); (3) the Company's       
ability and intent to hold the investments for a period of time to allow for a  
recovery of value; and (4) the financial condition of and near-term prospects of
the issuer.                                                                     

There are a number of significant risks and uncertainties inherent in the       
process of monitoring impairments and determining if an impairment is other than
temporary. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: (1)   
the risk that our assessment of an issuer's ability to meet its obligations     
could change, (2) the risk that the economic outlook could be worse than        
expected or have more of an impact on the issuer than anticipated, (3) the risk 
that we are making decisions based on fraudulent or misstated information in the
financial statements provided by issuers and (4) the risk that new information  
obtained by us or changes in other facts and circumstances, including those not 
related to the issuer, could lead us to change our intent to hold the security  
to maturity or until it recovers in value. Any of these situations could result 
in a change in our impairment determination, and hence a charge to earnings in a
future period.                                                                  

Cash and cash equivalents                                                       
Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, amounts due from banks, money   
market instruments, and other debt issues with maturities of three months or    
less when purchased.                                                            

Deferred policy acquisition costs                                               
The Company is charged distribution expenses from Prudential Insurance's agency 
network for both its domestic life and annuity products through a transfer      
pricing agreement, which is intended to reflect a market based pricing          
arrangement. These costs include commissions and variable field office expenses.
The Company is also allocated costs of policy issuance and underwriting from    
Prudential Insurance's general and administrative expense allocation system. The
Company also is charged commissions from third parties, which are primarily     
capitalized.                                                                    

The costs that vary with and that are related primarily to the production of new
insurance and annuity business are deferred to the extent such costs are deemed 
recoverable from future profits. For annuity products, the entire transfer      
pricing fee is deemed to be related to the production of new annuity business   
and is capitalized. For life products, there is a look-through into the expenses
incurred by the Prudential agency network and expenses that are considered to be
related to the production of new insurance business are deferred. The cost of   
policy issuance and underwriting are also considered to be related primarily to 
the production of new insurance and annuity business and are fully capitalized. 

Deferred policy acquisition costs ("DAC") are subject to recoverability testing 
at the end of each accounting period. DAC, for applicable products, are adjusted
for the impact of unrealized gains or losses on investments as if these gains or
losses had been realized, with corresponding credits or charges included in     
"Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)."                                

Policy acquisition costs related to interest-sensitive and variable life        
products and certain investment-type products are deferred and amortized over   
the expected life of the contracts (periods ranging from 25 to 30 years) in     
proportion to estimated gross profits arising principally from investment       
results, mortality and expense margins, and surrender charges based on          
historical and anticipated future experience, which is updated periodically. The
effect of changes to estimated gross profits on unamortized deferred acquisition
costs is reflected in "General administrative and other expenses" in the period 
such estimated gross profits are revised.                                       

DAC related to non-participating term insurance are amortized over the expected 
life of the contracts in proportion to premium income. For guaranteed investment
contracts, acquisition costs are expensed as incurred.                          

The Company and Prudential Insurance have offered programs under which          
policyholders, for a selected product or group of products, can exchange an     
existing policy or contract issued by the Company or Prudential Insurance for   
another form of policy or contract. These transactions are known as internal    
replacements. If the terms of the new policies are not substantially similar to 
those of the former policy, the unamortized DAC on the surrendered policies is  
immediately charged to expense. If the new policies have terms that are         
substantially similar to those of the earlier policies, the DAC is retained with
respect to the new policies and amortized over the life of the new policies.    

Reinsurance recoverables and payables                                           
Reinsurance recoverables and payables include receivables and corresponding     
payables associated with reinsurance arrangements with affiliates. See Note 13  
for additional information about these arrangements.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)                       

Separate account assets and liabilities                                         
Separate account assets and liabilities are reported at fair value and represent
segregated funds which are invested for certain policyholders, pension funds and
other customers. The assets consist of common stocks, fixed maturities, real    
estate related investments, real estate mortgage loans and short-term           
investments. The assets of each account are legally segregated and are generally
not subject to claims that arise out of any other business of the Company.      
Investment risks associated with market value changes are borne by the          
customers, except to the extent of minimum guarantees made by the Company with  
respect to certain accounts. See Note 12 for additional information regarding   
separate account arrangements with contractual guarantees. The investment income
and gains or losses for separate accounts generally accrue to the policyholders 
and are not included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Mortality,   
policy administration and surrender charges assessed against the accounts are   
included in "Policy charges and fee income." Asset management fees charged to   
the accounts are included in "Asset management fees."                           

Deferred sales inducements and other assets, and other liabilities              
The Company provides sales inducements to contractholders, which primarily      
include an up-front bonus added to the contractholder's initial deposit for     
certain annuity contracts. These costs are deferred and recognized on the       
statement of financial position in other assets. They are amortized using the   
same methodology and assumptions used to amortized deferred policy acquisition  
costs. The amortization expense is included as a component of interest credited 
to policyholders' account balances. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, deferred  
sales inducement costs included in other assets were $110 million and $79       
million, respectively.                                                          

Other assets consist primarily of deferred sales inducements costs, premiums    
due, certain restricted assets, and receivables resulting from sales of         
securities that had not yet settled at the balance sheet date. Other liabilities
consist primarily of accrued expenses, technical overdrafts, and payables       
resulting from purchases of securities that had not yet been settled at the     
balance sheet date.                                                             

Policyholders' Account Balances                                                 
The Company's liability for policyholders' account balances represents the      
contract value that has accrued to the benefit of the policyholder as of the    
balance sheet date. This liability is generally equal to the accumulated account
deposits plus interest credited less policyholders' withdrawals and other       
charges assessed against the account balance. These policyholders' account      
balances also include provision for benefits under non-life contingent payout   
annuities.                                                                      

Future Policy Benefits                                                          
The Company's liability for future policy benefits is primarily comprised of the
present value of estimated future payments to or on behalf of policyholders,    
where the timing and amount of payment depends on policyholder mortality, less  
the present value of future net premiums. For life insurance, expected mortality
is generally based on the Company's historical experience or standard industry  
tables. Interest rate assumptions are based on factors such as market conditions
and expected investment returns. Although mortality and interest rate           
assumptions are "locked-in" upon the issuance of new insurance or annuity       
business with fixed and guaranteed terms, significant changes in experience or  
assumptions may require us to provide for expected future losses on a product by
establishing premium deficiency reserves. The Company's liability for future    
policy benefits is also inclusive of liabilities for guarantee benefits related 
to certain non-traditional long duration life and annuity contracts, which are  
discussed more fully in Note 8.                                                 

Unpaid Claims                                                                   
Unpaid claims include estimates of claims that the Company believes have been   
incurred, but have not yet been reported ("IBNR") as of the balance sheet date. 
Consistent with industry accounting practice, we do not establish loss reserves 
until a loss has occurred. These IBNR estimates, and estimates of the amounts of
loss we will ultimately incur on reported claims, which are based in part on our
historical experience, are regularly adjusted to reflect actual claims          
experience. When actual experience differs from our previous estimate, the      
resulting difference will be included in our reported results for the period of 
the change in estimate in the "Policyholders' benefits" caption in our          
statements of operations. On an ongoing basis, trends in actual experience are a
significant factor in the determination of claim reserve levels.                

Contingencies                                                                   
Amounts related to contingencies are accrued if it is probable that a liability 
has been incurred and an amount is reasonably estimable. Management evaluates   
whether there are incremental legal or other costs directly associated with the 
ultimate resolution of the matter that are reasonably estimable and, if so, they
are included in the accrual.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)                       

Insurance Revenue and Expense Recognition                                       
Premiums from life insurance policies, excluding interest-sensitive life        
contracts, are recognized when due. Benefits are recorded as an expense when    
they are incurred. A liability for future policy benefits is recorded when      
premiums are recognized using the net level premium method.                     

Certain annuity contracts provide the holder a guarantee that the benefit       
received upon death will be no less than a minimum prescribed amount that is    
based upon a combination of net deposits to the contract, net deposits to the   
contract accumulated at a specified rate or the highest historical account value
on a contract anniversary. These contracts are discussed in further detail in   
Note 8. Also, as more fully discussed in Note 8, the liability for the          
guaranteed minimum death benefit under these contracts is determined each period
end by estimating the accumulated value of a percentage of the total assessments
to date less the accumulated value of death benefits in excess of the account   
balance.                                                                        

Amounts received as payment for interest-sensitive life, deferred annuities and 
guaranteed investment contracts are reported as deposits to "Policyholders'
account balances". Revenues from these contracts reflected as "Policy charges   
and fee income" consist primarily of fees assessed during the period against the
policyholders' account balances for mortality charges, policy administration    
charges and surrender charges. Benefits and expenses for these products include 
claims in excess of related account balances, expenses of contract              
administration, interest credited to policyholders' account balances and        
amortization of DAC.                                                            

Premiums, benefits and expenses are stated net of reinsurance ceded to other    
companies. Estimated reinsurance recoverables and the cost of reinsurance are   
recognized over the life of the reinsured policies using assumptions consistent 
with those used to account for the underlying policies.                         

Foreign currency translation adjustments                                        
Assets and liabilities of the Taiwan branch are translated to U.S. dollars at   
the exchange rate in effect at the end of the period. Revenues, benefits and    
other expenses are translated at the average rate prevailing during the period. 
Cumulative translation adjustments arising from the use of differing exchange   
rates from period to period are charged or credited directly to "Other          
comprehensive income (loss)." The cumulative effect of changes in foreign       
exchange rates are included in "Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)". 

Asset management fees                                                           
Beginning on February 1, 2002, the Company received asset management fee income 
from policyholders' account balances invested in The Prudential Series Funds or,
"PSF," which are a portfolio of mutual fund investments related to the Company's
separate account products (see Note 13). In addition, the Company receives fees 
from policyholders' account balances invested in funds managed by companies     
other than Prudential Insurance. Asset management fees are recognized as income 
when earned.                                                                    

Derivative Financial Instruments                                                
Derivatives are financial instruments whose values are derived from interest    
rates, foreign exchange rates, financial indices, or the value of securities or 
commodities. Derivative financial instruments used by the Company include swaps 
and futures, and may be exchange-traded or contracted in the over-the-counter   
market. Derivative positions are carried at fair value, generally by obtaining  
quoted market prices or through the use of pricing models. Values can be        
affected by changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads,  
market volatility and liquidity. Values can also be affected by changes in      
estimates and assumptions used in pricing models.                               

Derivatives are used to manage the characteristics of the Company's             
asset/liability mix, manage the interest rate and currency characteristics of   
assets or liabilities. Additionally, derivatives may be used to seek to reduce  
exposure to interest rate and foreign currency risks associated with assets held
or expected to be purchased or sold, and liabilities incurred or expected to be 
incurred.                                                                       

The Company designates derivatives as either (1) a hedge of the fair value of a 
recognized asset or liability or unrecognized firm commitment ("fair value"     
hedge), (2) a hedge of a forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flows
to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability ("cash flow"  
hedge), (3) a foreign currency fair value or cash flow hedge ("foreign currency"
hedge), (4) a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, or (5) a        
derivative entered into as an economic hedge that does not qualify for hedge    
accounting. As of December 31, 2004, none of the Company's derivatives qualify  
for hedge accounting treatment.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)                       

If a derivative does not qualify for hedge accounting, all changes in its fair  
value, including net receipts and payments, are included in "Realized investment
gains (losses), net" without considering changes in the fair value of the       
economically associated assets or liabilities.                                  

The Company is a party to financial instruments that may contain derivative     
instruments that are "embedded" in the financial instruments. At inception, the 
Company assesses whether the economic characteristics of the embedded derivative
are clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the remaining
component of the financial instrument (i.e., the host contract) and whether a   
separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded instrument would meet   
the definition of a derivative instrument. When it is determined that (1) the   
embedded derivative possesses economic characteristics that are not clearly and 
closely related to the economic characteristics of the host contract, and (2) a 
separate instrument with the same terms would qualify as a derivative           
instrument, the embedded derivative is separated from the host contract, carried
at fair value, and changes in its fair value are included in "Realized          
investment gains (losses), net."                                                

Income Taxes                                                                    
The Company and its subsidiaries are members of the consolidated federal income 
tax return of Prudential Financial and file separate company state and local tax
returns. Pursuant to the tax allocation arrangement with Prudential Financial,  
total federal income tax expense is determined on a separate company basis.     
Members with losses record tax benefits to the extent such losses are recognized
in the consolidated federal tax provision.                                      

Deferred income taxes are recognized, based on enacted rates, when assets and   
liabilities have different values for financial statement and tax reporting     
purposes. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce a deferred tax asset to   
the amount expected to be realized.                                             

New Accounting Pronouncements                                                   
In March 2004, the EITF of the FASB reached a final consensus on Issue 03-1,    
"The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and its Application to Certain  
Investments." This Issue establishes impairment models for determining whether  
to record impairment losses associated with investments in certain equity and   
debt securities. It also requires income to be accrued on a level-yield basis   
following an impairment of debt securities, where reasonable estimates of the   
timing and amount of future cash flows can be made. The Company's policy is     
generally to record income only as cash is received following an impairment of a
debt security. In September 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position ("FSP")   
EITF 03-1-1, which defers the effective date of a substantial portion of EITF   
03-1, from the third quarter of 2004, as originally required by the EITF, until 
such time as FASB issues further implementation guidance, which is expected     
sometime in 2005. The Company will continue to monitor developments concerning  
this Issue and is currently unable to estimate the potential effects of         
implementing EITF 03-1 on the Company's consolidated financial position or      
results of operations.                                                          

In December 2003, the FASB issued FIN No. 46(R), "Consolidation of Variable     
Interest Entities," which revised the original FIN No. 46 guidance issued in    
January 2003. FIN No. 46(R) addresses whether certain types of entities,        
referred to as variable interest entities ("VIEs"), should be consolidated in a 
company's financial statements. A VIE is an entity that either (1) has equity   
investors that lack certain essential characteristics of a controlling financial
interest (including the ability to control the entity, the obligation to absorb 
the entity's expected losses and the right to receive the entity's expected     
residual returns) or (2) lacks sufficient equity to finance its own activities  
without financial support provided by other entities, which in turn would be    
expected to absorb at least some of the expected losses of the VIE. An entity   
should consolidate a VIE if, as the primary beneficiary, it stands to absorb a  
majority of the VIE's expected losses or to receive a majority of the VIE's     
expected residual returns. On December 31, 2003, the Company adopted FIN No. 46 
(R) for all special purpose entities ("SPEs") and for relationships with all    
VIEs that began on or after February 1, 2003. On March 31, 2004, the Company    
implemented FIN No. 46 (R) for relationships with potential VIEs that are not   
SPEs. The transition to FIN No. 46(R) did not have a material effect on the     
Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations.             

In July 2003, the Accounting Standards Executive Committee ("AcSEC") of the     
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants ("AICPA") issued Statement of
Position ("SOP") 03-1, "Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for   
Certain Nontraditional Long-Duration Contracts and for Separate Accounts." AcSEC
issued this SOP to address the need for interpretive guidance in three areas:   
separate account presentation and valuation; the classification and valuation of
certain long-duration contract liabilities; and the accounting recognition given
sales inducements (bonus interest, bonus credits and persistency bonuses).

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements                                      
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)                       

The effect of adopting SOP 03-1 was a charge of $9 million, net of $5 million of
taxes, which was reported as a "Cumulative effect of accounting change, net of  
taxes" in the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2004. This  
charge reflects the net impact of converting certain individual market value    
adjusted annuity contracts from separate account accounting treatment to general
account accounting treatment, including carrying the related liabilities at     
accreted value, and the effect of establishing reserves for guaranteed minimum  
death benefit provisions of the Company's variable annuity and variable life    
contracts. The Company also recognized a cumulative effect of accounting change 
related to unrealized investment gains within "Other comprehensive income, net  
of taxes" of $4 million, net of $3 million of taxes, for the year ended December
31, 2004. Upon adoption of SOP 03-1, approximately $400 million in "Separate    
account assets" were reclassified resulting in an increase in "Fixed maturities,
available for sale", as well as changes in other non-separate account assets.   
Similarly, upon adoption, approximately $400 million in "separate account       
liabilities" were reclassified resulting in increases in "Policyholders' account
balances" as well as changes in other non-separate account liabilities.         

In June 2004, the FASB issued FSP No. 97-1, "Situations in Which Paragraphs     
17(b) and 20 of FASB Statement No. 97, Accounting and Reporting by Insurance    
Enterprises for Certain Long-Duration Contracts and for Realized Gains and      
Losses from the Sale of Investments, Permit or Require Accrual of an Unearned   
Revenue Liability." FSP 97-1 clarifies the accounting for unearned revenue      
liabilities of certain universal-life type contracts under SOP 03-1. The        
Company's adoption of FSP 97-1 on July 1, 2004 did not change the accounting for
unearned revenue liabilities and, therefore, had no impact on the Company's     
consolidated financial position or results of operations. In September 2004, the
AICPA SOP 03-1 Implementation Task Force issued a Technical Practice Aid ("TPA")
to clarify certain aspects of SOP 03-1. The implementation of this TPA during   
the third quarter of 2004 had no impact on the Company's consolidated financial 
position or results of operations.                                              

In April 2003, the FASB issued Statement No. 133 Implementation Issue No. B36,  
"Embedded Derivatives: Modified Coinsurance Arrangements and Debt Instruments   
That Incorporate Credit Risk Exposures That Are Unrelated or Only Partially     
Related to the Creditworthiness of the Obligor Under Those Instruments."        
Implementation Issue No. B36 indicates that a modified coinsurance arrangement  
("modco"), in which funds are withheld by the ceding insurer and a return on    
those withheld funds is paid based on the ceding company's return on certain of 
its investments, generally contains an embedded derivative feature that is not  
clearly and closely related to the host contract and should be bifurcated in    
accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative      
Instruments and Hedging Activities." Effective October 1, 2003, the Company     
adopted the guidance prospectively for existing contracts and all future        
transactions. As permitted by SFAS No. 133, all contracts entered into prior to 
January 1, 1999, were grandfathered and are exempt from the provisions of SFAS  
No. 133 that relate to embedded derivatives. The application of Implementation  
Issue No. B36 in 2003 had no impact on the consolidated financial position or   
results of operations of the Company.                                           

In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, "Accounting for Certain Financial    
Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity." SFAS No. 150  
generally applies to instruments that are mandatorily redeemable, that represent
obligations that will be settled with a variable number of company shares, or   
that represent an obligation to purchase a fixed number of company shares. For  
instruments within its scope, the statement requires classification as a        
liability with initial measurement at fair value. Subsequent measurement depends
upon the certainty of the terms of the settlement (such as amount and timing)   
and whether the obligation will be settled by a transfer of assets or by        
issuance of a fixed or variable number of equity shares. The Company's adoption 
of SFAS No. 150, as of July 1, 2003, did not have a material effect on the      
Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations.             

In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated    
with Exit or Disposal Activities." SFAS No. 146 requires that a liability for   
costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured   
initially at fair value only when the liability is incurred. Prior to the       
adoption of SFAS No. 146, such amounts were recorded upon the Company's         
commitment to a restructuring plan. The Company has adopted this statement for  
applicable transactions occurring on or after January 1, 2003.                  

In November 2002, the FASB issued FIN No. 45, "Guarantor's Accounting and       
Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of        
Indebtedness of Others." FIN No. 45 expands existing accounting guidance and    
disclosure requirements for certain guarantees and requires the recognition of a
liability for the fair value of certain types of guarantees issued or modified  
after December 31, 2002. The January 1, 2003 adoption of the Interpretation's   
guidance did not have a material effect on the Company's financial position.    

Reclassifications                                                               
Certain amounts in the prior years have been reclassified to conform to the     
current year presentation.

As of December 31, 2004, gross unrealized losses on fixed maturities totaled $12
million comprising 250 issuers. Of this amount, there was $10 million in the    
less than twelve months category comprising 238 issuers and $2 million in the   
greater than twelve months category comprising 12 issuers. There were no        
individual issuers with gross unrealized losses greater than $1.1 million. The  
$10 million of gross unrealized losses of less than twelve months is comprised  
of investment grade securities. The $2 million of gross unrealized losses of    
twelve months or more were concentrated in the finance sector. Based on a review
of the above information in conjunction with other factors as outlined in our   
policy surrounding other than temporary impairments (see Note 2), we have       
concluded that an adjustment for other than temporary impairments is not        
warranted at December 31, 2004.                                                 

Included in other long-term investments are equity securities, which have been  
in a loss position for less than 12 months with a fair value of $377 thousand   
and a gross unrealized loss of $24 thousand.

Life insurance liabilities include reserves for death benefits and other policy 
benefits. Annuity liabilities include reserves for annuities that are in payout 
status.                                                                         

Future policy benefits for domestic and Taiwan traditional life insurance are   
based on the net level premium method, calculated using the guaranteed mortality
and nonforfeiture rates which range from 2.50% to 8.75% for domestic insurance  
and 6.25% to 7.50% for Taiwan reserves. Less than 1% of the reserves are based  
on interest rates in excess of 8%.                                              

Future policy benefits for individual and group annuities are equal to the      
aggregate of 1) the present value of expected future payments on the basis of   
actuarial assumptions established at issue, and 2) any premium deficiency       
reserves. Assumptions as to mortality are based on the Company's experience when
the basis of the reserve is established. The interest rates used in the         
determination of the individual annuities reserves range from 4.75% to 14.75%,  
with approximately 15% of the reserves based on an interest rate in excess of   
8%. The interest rate used in the determination of group annuities reserves is  
14.75%.

Policyholders' account balances for interest-sensitive life, individual         
annuities, and guaranteed investment contracts represent an accumulation of     
account deposits plus credited interest less withdrawals, expenses and mortality
charges, if applicable. Interest crediting rates range from 1.50% to 5.90% for  
interest-sensitive life contracts. Interest crediting rates for individual      
annuities range from 1.50% to 14.00%, with less than 1% of policyholders'       
account balances with interest crediting rates in excess of 8%. Interest        
crediting rates for guaranteed investment contracts range from 3.02% to 8.03%,  
with less than 1% of policyholders' account balances with interest crediting    
rates in excess of 8%.                                                          

6. REINSURANCE                                                                  
The Company participates in reinsurance, with Prudential Insurance, Prudential  
of Taiwan, PARCC and other companies, in order to provide greater               
diversification of business, provide additional capacity for future growth and  
limit the maximum net loss potential arising from large risks. Life reinsurance 
is accomplished through various plans of reinsurance, primarily yearly renewable
term and coinsurance. Reinsurance ceded arrangements do not discharge the       
Company as the primary insurer. Ceded balances would represent a liability of   
the Company in the event the reinsurers were unable to meet their obligations to
the Company under the terms of the reinsurance agreements. The likelihood of a  
material reinsurance liability reassumed by the Company is considered to be     
remote.                                                                         

Reinsurance premiums, commissions, expense reimbursements, benefits and reserves
related to reinsured long-duration contracts are accounted for over the life of 
the underlying reinsured contracts using assumptions consistent with those used 
to account for the underlying contracts. Amounts recoverable from reinsurers,   
for both long and short duration reinsurance arrangements, are estimated in a   
manner consistent with the claim liabilities and policy benefits associated with
the reinsured policies. The affiliated reinsurance agreements, including the    
Company's reinsurance of all its Taiwan business as of February 1, 2001, are    
described further in Note 13.                                                   

Reinsurance amounts included in the Statement of Operations and Comprehensive   
Income for the years ended December 31 are below.

7. INCOME TAXES (CONTINUED)                                                     

Management believes that based on its historical pattern of taxable income, the 
Company and its subsidiaries will produce sufficient income in the future to    
realize its deferred tax assets. Adjustments to the valuation allowance will be 
made if there is a change in management's assessment of the amount of the       
deferred tax asset that is realizable. At December 31, 2003 the Company had     
state operating loss carryforwards of $826 million.                             

The Internal Revenue Service (the "Service") has completed all examinations of  
the consolidated federal income tax returns through 1996. Tax years 1997 through
2001 are currently under examination. Management believes sufficient provisions 
have been made for potential adjustments.                                       

8. CERTAIN NONTRADITIONAL LONG-DURATION CONTRACTS                               

The Company issues traditional variable annuity contracts through its separate  
accounts for which investment income and investment gains and losses accrue     
directly to, and investment risk is borne by, the contractholder. The Company   
also issues variable annuity contracts with general and separate account options
where the Company contractually guarantees to the contractholder a return of no 
less than (a) total deposits made to the contract less any partial withdrawals  
("return of net deposits"), (b) total deposits made to the contract less any    
partial withdrawals plus a minimum return ("minimum return"), or (c) the highest
contract value on a specified anniversary date minus any withdrawals following  
the contract anniversary ("anniversary contract value"). These guarantees       
include benefits that are payable in the event of death or annuitization.       

The Company also issues annuity contracts with market value adjusted investment 
options ("MVAs"), which provide for a return of principal plus a fixed rate of  
return if held to maturity, or, alternatively, a "market adjusted value" if     
surrendered prior to maturity. The market value adjustment may result in a gain 
or loss to the Company, depending on crediting rates or an indexed rate at      
surrender, as applicable.                                                       

In addition, the Company issues variable life, variable universal life and      
universal life contracts where the Company contractually guarantees to the      
contractholder a death benefit even when there is insufficient value to cover   
monthly mortality and expense charges, whereas otherwise the contract would     
typically lapse ("no lapse guarantee"). Variable life and variable universal    
life contracts are offered with general and separate account options.           

The assets supporting the variable portion of both traditional variable         
annuities and certain variable contracts with guarantees are carried at fair    
value and reported as "Separate account assets" with an equivalent amount       
reported as "Separate account liabilities." Amounts assessed against the        
contractholders for mortality, administration, and other services are included  
within revenue in "Policy charges and fee income" and changes in liabilities for
minimum guarantees are generally included in "Policyholders' benefits." In 2004 
there were no gains or losses on transfers of assets from the general account to
a separate account.                                                             

For those guarantees of benefits that are payable in the event of death, the net
amount at risk is generally defined as the current guaranteed minimum death     
benefit in excess of the current account balance at the balance sheet date. For 
guarantees of benefits that are payable at annuitization, the net amount at risk
is generally defined as the present value of the minimum guaranteed annuity     
payments available to the contractholder determined in accordance with the terms
of the contract in excess of the current account balance. The Company's         
contracts with guarantees may offer more than one type of guarantee in each     
contract; therefore, the amounts listed may not be mutually exclusive. As of    
December 31, 2004, the Company had the following guarantees associated with     
these contracts, by product and guarantee type:

8. CERTAIN NONTRADITIONAL LONG-DURATION CONTRACTS (continued)                   

Liabilities For Guarantee Benefits                                              

The table below summarizes the changes in general account liabilities for       
guarantees on variable contracts. The liabilities for guaranteed minimum death  
benefits ("GMDB") and guaranteed minimum income benefits ("GMIB") are included  
in "Future policy benefits" and the related changes in the liabilities are      
included in "Policyholders' benefits."

                                  ==========       ========      ========== 

The GMDB liability is determined each period end by estimating the accumulated  
value of a percentage of the total assessments to date less the accumulated     
value of the death benefits in excess of the account balance. The percentage of 
assessments used is chosen such that, at issue, the present value of expected   
death benefits in excess of the projected account balance and the percentage of 
the present value of total expected assessments over the lifetime of the        
contracts are equal. The Company regularly evaluates the estimates used and     
adjusts the GMDB liability balance, with a related charge or credit to earnings,
if actual experience or other evidence suggests that earlier assumptions should 
be revised. The GMIB liability was determined at December 31, 2004 by estimating
the accumulated value of a percentage of the total assessments to date less the 
accumulated value of the projected income benefits in excess of the account     
balance.                                                                        

The present value of death benefits in excess of the projected account balance  
and the present value of total expected assessments for GMDB's were determined  
over a reasonable range of stochastically generated scenarios. For variable     
annuities and variable universal life, 5,000 scenarios were stochastically      
generated and, from these, 200 scenarios were selected using a sampling         
technique. For variable life, various scenarios covering a reasonable range were
weighted based on a statistical lognormal model. For universal life, 10,000     
scenarios were stochastically generated and, from these, 100 were selected.     

Sales Inducements                                                               

The Company defers sales inducements and amortizes them over the anticipated    
life of the policy using the same methodology and assumptions used to amortize  
deferred policy acquisition costs. These deferred sales inducements are included
in "Other assets." The Company offers various types of sales inducements. These 
inducements include: (i) a bonus whereby the policyholder's initial account     
balance is increased by an amount equal to a specified percentage of the        
customer's initial deposit and (ii) additional interest credits after a certain 
number of years a contract is held. Changes in deferred sales inducements are as
follows:

9. STATUTORY NET INCOME AND SURPLUS AND DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS                   

The Company is required to prepare statutory financial statements in accordance 
with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the Arizona Department of  
Insurance. Statutory accounting practices primarily differ from GAAP by charging
policy acquisition costs to expense as incurred, establishing future policy     
benefit liabilities using different actuarial assumptions and valuing           
investments, deferred taxes, and certain assets on a different basis.           

Statutory net loss for the Company amounted to $4 million, $141 million, and    
$239 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002,             
respectively. Statutory surplus of the Company amounted to $572 million and $517
million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The statutory losses in    
2003 and 2002 were primarily attributed to the surplus strain from new business,
which results from higher commissions and selling expenses that are not deferred
under statutory accounting, and from increases to reserves. During late 2003 and
in 2004, the Company obtained reinsurance on the term life business from a      
captive affiliate, mitigating the surplus strain on that business. The agreement
is discussed further in Note 13, below.                                         

The Company prepares its statutory financial statements in accordance with      
accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the Arizona Department of       
Insurance. Prescribed statutory accounting practices include publications of the
NAIC, state laws, regulations, and general administrative rules. Permitted      
statutory accounting practices encompass all accounting practices not so        
prescribed.                                                                     

In 2001, the Company received approval from the Arizona Department of Insurance 
to treat, as assumption reinsurance, the transfer of Pruco Life of Taiwan (Pruco
Taiwan) business to a sister company Prudential Life Insurance Company of       
Taiwan, Inc. (Prudential of Taiwan). According to Statement of Statutory        
Accounting Principles #61, Life, Deposit-Type and Accident and Health           
Reinsurance of the NAIC Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual, this type of
transfer of business would be treated as indemnity reinsurance rather than      
assumption reinsurance because there is no concept of novation under Taiwanese  
law. However, other than not meeting the strict requirements for a novation, the
transfer of Pruco Taiwan's business has the other elements of assumption        
reinsurance. The effect of this permitted practice was an increase to statutory 
capital of $113.7 million as of December 31 2001. The GAAP accounting treatment 
for this transaction is discussed in Note 13.                                   

The Company is subject to Arizona law, which limits the amount of dividends that
insurance companies can pay to stockholders without approval of the Arizona     
Department of Insurance. The maximum dividend, which may be paid in any         
twelve-month period without notification or approval, is limited to the lesser  
of 10% of statutory surplus as of December 31 of the preceding year or the net  
gain from operations of the preceding calendar year. Cash dividends may only be 
paid out of surplus derived from realized net profits. Based on these           
limitations, the Company would not be permitted a dividend distribution without 
prior approval in 2005. There have been no dividend payments to the parent in   
2004, 2003 or 2002.                                                             

10. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS                                         

The fair values presented below have been determined by using available market  
information and by applying valuation methodologies. Considerable judgment is   
applied in interpreting data to develop the estimates of fair value. These fair 
values may not be realized in a current market exchange. The use of different   
market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies could have a material effect 
on the fair values. The methods and assumptions discussed below were used in    
calculating the fair values of the instruments. See Note 11 for a discussion of 
derivative instruments.                                                         

Fixed maturities                                                                
The fair values of public fixed maturity securities are based on quoted market  
prices or estimates from independent pricing services. However, for investments 
in private placement fixed maturity securities, this information is not         
available. For these private investments, the fair value is determined typically
by using a discounted cash flow model, which considers current market credit    
spreads for publicly traded issues with similar terms by companies of comparable
credit quality, and an additional spread component for the reduced liquidity    
associated with private placements. This additional spread component is         
determined based on surveys of various third party financial institutions.      
Historically, changes in estimated future cash flows or the assessment of an    
issuer's credit quality have been the more significant factors in determining   
fair values.                                                                    

Policy loans                                                                    
The fair value of policy loans is calculated using a discounted cash flow model 
based upon current U.S. Treasury rates and historical loan repayment patterns.  

Investment contracts                                                            
For guaranteed investment contracts, income annuities and other similar         
contracts without life contingencies, fair values are derived using discounted  
projected cash flows based on interest rates being offered for similar contracts
with maturities consistent with those of the contracts being valued. For        
individual deferred annuities and other deposit liabilities, carrying value     
approximates fair value.

11. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS                                                      

Types of Derivative Instruments                                                 

Interest rate swaps are used by the Company to manage interest rate exposures   
arising from mismatches between assets and liabilities (including duration      
mismatches) and to hedge against changes in the value of assets it anticipates  
acquiring and other anticipated transactions and commitments. Swaps may be      
specifically attributed to specific assets or liabilities or may be based on a  
portfolio basis. Under interest rate swaps, the Company agrees with other       
parties to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed rate  
and floating rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon    
notional principal amount. Generally, no cash is exchanged at the outset of the 
contract and no principal payments are made by either party. Cash is paid or    
received based on the terms of the swap. These transactions are entered into    
pursuant to master agreements that provide for a single net payment to be made  
by one counterparty at each due date.                                           

Exchange-traded futures and options are used by the Company to reduce market    
risks from changes in interest rates, to alter mismatches between the duration  
of assets in a portfolio and the duration of liabilities supported by those     
assets, and to hedge against changes in the value of securities it owns or      
anticipates acquiring or selling. In exchange-traded futures transactions, the  
Company agrees to purchase or sell a specified number of contracts, the values  
of which are determined by the values of designated classes of securities, and  
to post variation margin on a daily basis in an amount equal to the difference  
in the daily market values of those contracts. The Company enters into          
exchange-traded futures and options with regulated futures commissions merchants
who are members of a trading exchange.                                          

Futures typically are used to hedge duration mismatches between assets and      
liabilities. Futures move substantially in value as interest rates change and   
can be used to either modify or hedge existing interest rate risk. This strategy
protects against the risk that cash flow requirements may necessitate           
liquidation of investments at unfavorable prices resulting from increases in    
interest rates. This strategy can be a more cost effective way of temporarily   
reducing the Company's exposure to a market decline than selling fixed income   
securities and purchasing a similar portfolio when such a decline is believed to
be over.                                                                        

Currency derivatives, including exchange-traded currency futures and currency   
swaps, are used by the Company to reduce market risks from changes in currency  
exchange rates with respect to investments denominated in foreign currencies    
that the Company either holds or intends to acquire or sell. The Company also   
uses currency forwards to hedge the currency risk associated with net           
investments in foreign operations and anticipated earnings of its foreign       
operations.

11. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS (continued)                                          

Under currency swaps, the Company agrees with other parties to exchange, at     
specified intervals, the difference between one currency and another at a       
forward exchange rate and calculated by reference to an agreed principal amount.
Generally, the principal amount of each currency is exchanged at the beginning  
and termination of the currency swap by each party. These transactions are      
entered into pursuant to master agreements that provide for a single net payment
to be made by one counterparty for payments made in the same currency at each   
due date.                                                                       

The table below summarizes the Company's outstanding positions by derivative    
instrument types as of December 31, 2004 and 2003. All of the derivatives are   
carried on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position at estimated fair  
value.

Credit Risk                                                                     
The Company is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance  
by counterparties to derivative financial instruments. Generally, the current   
credit exposure of the Company's derivative contracts is limited to the fair    
value at the reporting date. The credit exposure of the Company's               
over-the-counter derivative transactions is represented by the fair value       
(market value) of contracts with a positive fair value (market value) at the    
reporting date. Because exchange-traded futures and options are effected through
regulated exchanges, and positions are marked to market on a daily basis, the   
Company has little exposure to credit-related losses in the event of            
nonperformance by counterparties to such financial instruments.                 

The Company manages credit risk by entering into transactions with creditworthy 
counterparties and obtaining collateral where appropriate and customary. In     
addition, the Company enters into over-the-counter swaps pursuant to master     
agreements that provide for a single net payment to be made by one counterparty 
to another at each due date and upon termination. Likewise, the Company effects 
exchange-traded futures and options through regulated exchanges and these       
positions are marked to market on a daily basis.                                

12. COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND LITIGATION AND REGULATORY MATTERS            

Commitments                                                                     
The Company has made commitments to fund $49 million of commercial loans in     
2005.                                                                           

Contingencies                                                                   
On an ongoing basis, our internal supervisory and control functions review the  
quality of our sales, marketing and other customer interface procedures and     
practices and may recommend modifications or enhancements. In certain cases, if 
appropriate, we may offer customers remediation and may incur charges, including
the cost of such remediation, administrative costs and regulatory fines.        

It is possible that the results of operations or the cash flow of the Company in
a particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected as a result
of payments in connection with the matters discussed above depending, in part,  
upon the results of operations or cash flow for such period. Management         
believes, however, that the ultimate payments in connection with these matters  
should not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position.

12. COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND LITIGATION AND REGULATORY MATTERS (continued)

Litigation and Regulatory Proceedings                                           
The Company is subject to legal and regulatory actions in the ordinary course of
their businesses, which may include class action lawsuits. Pending legal and    
regulatory actions include proceedings relating to aspects of the businesses and
operations that are specific to the Company and that are typical of the         
businesses in which the Company operates. Class action and individual lawsuits  
may involve a variety of issues and/or allegations, which include sales         
practices, underwriting practices, claims payment and procedures, premium       
charges, policy servicing and breach of fiduciary duties to customers. We may   
also be subject to litigation arising out of our general business activities,   
such as our investments and third party contracts. In certain of these matters, 
the plaintiffs may seek large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive  
or exemplary damages.                                                           

The Company has received formal requests for information relating to its        
variable annuity business and unregistered separate accounts from regulators,   
including, among others, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the State of
New York Attorney General's office. The Company is cooperating with all such    
inquiries.                                                                      

The Company's litigation is subject to many uncertainties, and given the        
complexity and scope, the outcomes cannot be predicted. It is possible that the 
results of operations or the cash flow of the Company in a particular quarterly 
or annual period could be materially affected by an ultimate unfavorable        
resolution of litigation and regulatory matters. Management believes, however,  
that the ultimate outcome of all pending litigation and regulatory matters      
should not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position.  

13. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS                                                  

The Company has extensive transactions and relationships with Prudential        
Insurance and other affiliates. It is possible that the terms of these          
transactions are not the same as those that would result from transactions among
wholly unrelated parties.                                                       

Expense Charges and Allocations                                                 
Many of the Company's expenses are allocations or charges from Prudential       
Insurance or other affiliates. These expenses can be grouped into general and   
administrative expenses and agency distribution expenses.                       

The Company's general and administrative expenses are charged to the Company    
using allocation methodologies based on business processes. Management believes 
that the methodology is reasonable and reflects costs incurred by Prudential    
Insurance to process transactions on behalf of the Company. The Company operates
under service and lease agreements whereby services of officers and employees,  
supplies, use of equipment and office space are provided by Prudential          
Insurance. Beginning in 2003, general and administrative expenses also includes 
allocations of stock compensation expenses related to a stock option program and
a deferred compensation program issued by Prudential Financial.                 

The Company is charged distribution expenses from Prudential Insurance's agency 
network for both its domestic life and annuity products through a transfer      
pricing agreement, which is intended to reflect a market based pricing          
arrangement.                                                                    

Affiliated Asset Management Fee Income                                          
In accordance with a revenue sharing agreement with Prudential Investments LLC, 
which began on February 1, 2002, the Company receives fee income from           
policyholders' account balances invested in the Prudential Series Funds ("PSF").
These revenues are recorded as "Asset management fees" in the Consolidated      
Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.                              

Corporate Owned Life Insurance                                                  
The Company has sold four Corporate Owned Life Insurance or, "COLI," policies to
Prudential Insurance. The cash surrender value included in separate accounts for
the COLI policies was $1.101 billion and $1.018 billion at December 31, 2004 and
December 31, 2003, respectively. Fees related to the COLI policies were $13     
million, $12 million and $21 million for the years ending December 31, 2004,    
2003, and 2002.

13. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS (continued)                                      

Reinsurance with affiliates                                                     
Pruco Reinsurance Ltd reinsurance agreement                                     
During September 2003, the Company implemented an agreement to reinsure its term
life insurance policies with an affiliated company, Pruco Reinsurance Ltd. or,  
"Pruco Re." The Company reinsured with Pruco Re a significant portion of the    
risks under such policies through an automatic and facultative coinsurance      
agreement. This Agreement covered all significant risks under the policies      
reinsured. The Company is not relieved of its primary obligation to the         
policyholder as a result of these reinsurance transactions. This coinsurance    
agreement replaced the yearly renewable term agreements with external reinsurers
that were previously in effect on this block of business. The initial cost of   
this transaction of $8 million was deferred and would be amortized over the life
of the underlying insurance policies; $1 million was amortized in 2003 less than
$1 million in 2004 and was recorded in other income. Reinsurance recoverables   
related to this transaction were $29 million at December 31, 2003, including the
unamortized portion of the initial cost of $7 million. Premiums and benefits    
ceded in 2003 were $31 million and $7 million, respectively.                    

During September 2004, this transaction was recaptured by the Company and       
replaced with a new coinsurance with PARCC, described in more detail below.     
Premiums ceded in 2004 were $58 million prior to the recapture.                 

PARCC 
In September 2004, the Company entered into an agreement to reinsure its term   
life insurance policies with an affiliated company, PARCC. The Company reinsures
with PARCC 90 percent of the risks under such policies through an automatic and 
facultative coinsurance agreement. The Company is not relieved of its primary   
obligation to the policyholder as a result of these reinsurance transactions.   

Concurrent with implementing this new agreement, the Company recaptured the     
policies previously reinsured under a coinsurance treaty with an affiliated     
offshore captive company, Pruco Re Ltd. The agreement had covered all term      
policies written on or after October 1, 2002.                                   

The coinsurance agreement with PARCC also replaces the yearly renewable term    
agreements with external reinsurers that were previously in effect on this block
of business. There was no net cost associated with the initial transaction and  
initial transactions. Reinsurance recoverables related to this transaction were 
$226 million as of December 31, 2004. Premiums and benefits ceded in 2004 were  
$102 million and $52 million, respectively.                                     

Prudential Insurance                                                            
In December 2004, the Company recaptured the excess of loss reinsurance         
agreement with Prudential Insurance and replaced it with a revised agreement to 
reinsure all risks, not otherwise reinsured. Reinsurance recoverables related to
this agreement were $47 million as of December 31, 2004. The Company is not     
relieved of its primary obligation to the policyholder as a result of these     
reinsurance transactions.                                                       

Other affiliated reinsurance agreements                                         
In addition, the Company currently has two other reinsurance agreements in place
with Prudential Insurance and affiliates. Specifically, the Company has a       
reinsurance Group Annuity Contract, whereby the reinsurer, in consideration for 
a single premium payment by the Company, provides reinsurance equal to 100% of  
all payments due under the contract. In addition, there are two yearly renewable
term agreements in which the Company may offer and the reinsurer may accept     
reinsurance on any life in excess of the Company's maximum limit of retention.  
The Company is not relieved of its primary obligation to the policyholder as a  
result of these reinsurance transactions.                                       

Affiliated premiums and policy charges ceded from domestic life reinsurance     
agreements for the periods ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002 were $--13   
million, $12 million, and $11 million respectively. Affiliated benefits ceded   
for the periods ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002 from domestic life      
reinsurance agreements are $21 million, $38 million, and $33 million.           

Group annuities affiliated benefits ceded were $2 million in 2004, $3 million in
2003, and $3 million in 2002.

13. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS (continued)                                      

Taiwan branch reinsurance agreement                                             
On January 31, 2001, the Company transferred all of its assets and liabilities  
associated with the Company's Taiwan branch including Taiwan's insurance book of
business to an affiliated Company, Prudential Life Insurance Company of Taiwan  
Inc. ("Prudential of Taiwan"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Prudential          
Financial.                                                                      

The mechanism used to transfer this block of business in Taiwan is referred to  
as a "full acquisition and assumption" transaction. Under this mechanism, the   
Company is jointly liable with Prudential of Taiwan for two years from the      
giving of notice to all obligees for all matured obligations and for two years  
after the maturity date of not-yet-matured obligations. Prudential of Taiwan is 
also contractually liable, under indemnification provisions of the transaction, 
for any liabilities that may be asserted against the Company. The transfer of   
the insurance related assets and liabilities was accounted for as a             
long-duration coinsurance transaction under accounting principles generally     
accepted in the United States. Under this accounting treatment, the insurance   
related liabilities remain on the books of the Company and an offsetting        
reinsurance recoverable is established.                                         

As part of this transaction, the Company made a capital contribution to         
Prudential of Taiwan in the amount of the net equity of the Company's Taiwan    
branch as of the date of transfer. In July 2001, the Company dividended its     
interest in Prudential of Taiwan to Prudential Financial.                       

Affiliated premiums ceded for the periods ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002
from the Taiwan coinsurance agreement were $85 million, $84 million and $80     
million, respectively. Affiliated benefits ceded for the periods ended December
31, 2004, 2003 and 2002; from the Taiwan coinsurance agreement were $12 million,
$13 million and $14 million, respectively.                                      

Included in the total reinsurance recoverable balances for both domestic        
(including PARCC and Pruco Re) and Taiwan agreements were affiliated reinsurance
recoverables of $752 million and $455 million at December 31, 2004 and December
31, 2003, respectively. Of these affiliated amounts, the reinsurance recoverable
related to the Taiwan coinsurance agreement was $467 million and $376 million at
December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, respectively.                          

Purchase of fixed maturities from an affiliate                                  
During 2003, the Company invested $112 million in the preferred stock of two    
Delaware corporations (the "DE Subs"), which were created to acquire municipal  
fixed maturity investments from an affiliate of the Company. The DE Subs are    
included in the Company's consolidated financial statements. Prudential         
Financial, Inc., the Company's ultimate parent company, owns a nominal common   
stock investment in each of the DE Subs.                                        

The DE Subs purchased municipal fixed maturity investments for $112 million, the
acquisition-date fair value, but reflected the investments at historic amortized
cost of the affiliate. The difference between the historic amortized cost and   
the fair value, net of taxes was reflected as a reduction to paid-in-capital.   
The fixed maturity investments are categorized in the Company's consolidated    
balance sheet as available-for-sale debt securities, and are therefore carried  
at fair value, with the difference between amortized cost and fair value        
reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income.                            

In addition, the Company also purchased corporate fixed maturities with a fair  
value of $52 million from the same affiliate. These investments were reflected  
in the same manner as is described above, with the difference between the       
historic amortized cost and the fair value, net of taxes reflected as a         
reduction of paid-in-capital with an offsetting increase to accumulated other   
comprehensive income. The difference between the historic amortized cost and the
fair value, net of taxes for both the municipal securities and the corporate    
securities was $8 million.                                                      

During 2004, the Company invested an additional $110 million in fixed maturities
owned by Prudential Insurance, but reflected these investments at amortized cost
of $99 million. The Company also sold $31 million of fixed maturities           
securities, recorded at an amortized cost of $29 million, to PARCC. The net     
difference between the historic amortized cost and the fair value, net of taxes 
for both of these transactions was $5 million and was recorded as a decrease to 
paid in capital as described above.                                             

Debt Agreements                                                                 
The Company has a revolving line of credit facility of up to $800 million with  
Prudential Funding, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Prudential Insurance. The

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the Board of Directors and Stockholder of                                    
Pruco Life Insurance Company                                                    

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying
index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Pruco 
Life Insurance Company (a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Prudential Insurance   
Company of America) and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the 
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in 
the period ended December 31, 2004, in conformity with accounting principles    
generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements  
are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to    
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We        
conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards      
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit    
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and        
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles    
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall   
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a          
reasonable basis for our opinion.                                               

As described in Note 2, the Company adopted American Institute of Certified     
Public Accountants Statement of Position 03-1, "Accounting and Reporting by     
Insurance Enterprises for Certain Nontraditional Long-Duration Contracts and for
Separate Accounts" as of January 1, 2004, and the fair value provisions of      
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based
Compensation" as of January 1, 2003.                                            

As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has
restated its 2004, 2003 and 2002 consolidated financial statements.

Participation and Protection: With No Annual Fees




When planning for retirement, you can’t risk everything and you can’t protect everything.
But there is a way to have some of both.










A Shield Annuity from Brighthouse Financial can help you use a portion of your assets to take advantage of market
            growth with a level of downside protection that other options may not provide. Shield is designed to provide
            some protection in an unpredictable endeavor — investing.





Protect your retirement assets
A Brighthouse Shield Annuity is designed to provide a level of protection that, when markets inevitably turn volatile,
            ensures your losses are limited.



Participate in growth opportunities
With a Shield Annuity, balance is built-in. This means that even with the protection you enjoy, you can still take
            advantage of growth opportunities in the market up to a certain percentage.



Pay no annual fees
Unlike many financial products, you pay no annual fees with a Shield Annuity.

1 Guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.
2 Shield annuities do not invest directly in any index.
3 Product guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company and are solely the responsibility of the issuing insurance company. Annuities and life insurance are issued by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company, Charlotte, NC 28277 and in New York, only by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY, New York, NY 10017 and not by MetLife.
If you're buying an annuity to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. That's because tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the annuity. References throughout this material to tax advantage, such as tax deferral and tax-free transfers, are subject to this consideration. In addition, non-qualified annuity contracts owned by corporations do not receive tax deferral on earnings. 

Prospectuses for variable annuities issued by a Brighthouse Financial insurance company, and for the investment portfolios offered thereunder, are available from Brighthouse Financial. The contract prospectus contains information about the contract's features, risks, charges and expenses. The investment objectives, risks and policies of the investment options, as well as other information about the investment options, are described in their respective prospectuses. Please read the prospectuses and consider this information carefully before investing. There is no guarantee that any of the variable investment options in a variable annuity product will meet their stated goals or objectives. The account value is subject to market fluctuations and investment risk so that, when withdrawn, it may be worth more or less than its original value even when an optional protection benefit rider is elected. Product availability and features may vary by state. Please refer to the contract prospectus for more complete details regarding the living and death benefits.

Annuities are long-term investments designed for retirement purposes. Brighthouse Financial annuities have limitations, exclusions, charges, termination provisions and terms for keeping them in force. All contract guarantees, including optional living and death benefit riders and annuity payout rates, are backed by the claims-paying ability and financial strength of issuing insurance company. They are not backed by the broker/dealer from which an annuity is purchased, by the insurance agency where an annuity is purchased, or any affiliates to those entities, and none makes any representations or guarantees regarding the claims-paying ability and financial strength of the issuing insurance company. Similarity, the issuing insurance company and the underwriter do not back the financial strength of the broker/dealer or its affiliates. Please contact your financial professional for complete details. 

Withdrawals of taxable amounts are subject to ordinary income tax and if made before age 59½, may be subject to a 10% federal income tax penalty. Some broker/dealers and financial professionals may refer to the 10% federal income tax penalty as an "additional tax" or "additional income tax" or use the terms interchangeably when discussing withdrawals taken prior to age 59½. Distributions of taxable amounts from a non-qualified annuity may also be subject to the 3.8% Unearned Income Medicare Contribution Tax on Net Investment Income if your modified adjusted gross income exceeds the applicable threshold amount. Withdrawals will reduce the living and death benefits and account value. Withdrawals may be subject to withdrawal charges. 

Any discussion of taxes is for general informational purposes only, does not purport to be complete or cover every situation, and should not be construed as legal, tax, or accounting advice. You should confer with your qualified legal, tax, and accounting advisors as appropriate.

*Data as of March 31, 2017. Total assets includes certain adjustments for transactions associated with the separation from MetLife, Inc.

A.M. Best’s Financial Strength Rating is an independent opinion of an insurer’s financial strength and ability to meet its ongoing insurance policy and contract obligations. A Financial Strength Rating is not assigned to specific insurance policies or contracts and does not address any other risk, including, but not limited to, an insurer’s claims-payment policies or procedures; the ability of the insurer to dispute or deny claims payment on grounds of misrepresentation or fraud; or any specific liability contractually borne by the policy or contract holder. A Financial Strength Rating is not a recommendation to purchase, hold, or terminate any insurance policy, contract or any other financial obligation issued by an insurer, nor does it address the suitability of any particular policy or contract, for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.ambest.com.
Fitch’s Insurer Financial Strength Rating provides an assessment of the financial strength of an insurance organization. The Insurer Financial Strength Rating is assigned to the insurance company’s policyholder obligations, including assumed reinsurance obligations and contract holder obligations, such as guaranteed investment contracts. Ratings explanations can be found at www.fitchratings.com.
Moody’s Insurance Financial Strength Rating is an opinion of the ability of an insurance company to pay punctually senior policyholder claims and obligations and also reflect the expected financial loss suffered in the event of default. Specific obligations are considered unrated unless they are individually rated because the standing of a particular insurance obligation would depend on an assessment of its relative standing under those laws governing both the obligation and the insurance company. Ratings explanations can be found at www.moodys.com.
S&P Global Insurer Financial Strength Rating is a forward-looking opinion about the financial security characteristics of an insurance organization with respect to its ability to pay under its insurance policies and contracts in accordance with their terms. This opinion is not specific to any particular policy or contract, nor does it address the suitability of a particular policy or contract for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.standardandpoors.com.

More Information about Annuities





What exactly is an Annuity?

                        An annuity is an investment product that provides safe, tax-deferred growth of your
                        retirement nest egg. Annuities are considered low-risk, and can provide guaranteed, monthly
                        income when
                        you retire. There are many types of annuities with varying features & benefits. These include:
                        fixed,
                        variable, immediate, deferred & hybrid. We strongly suggest you consult with a financial
                        professional to
                        help you understand the various types of annuities before you purchase.
                    








Is an Annuity Right for You?

                        Annuities are NOT a good fit for everyone. Annuities are designed for people looking for
                        guaranteed, monthly income when they retire - they are NOT a high-risk / high-return investment.
                        They are considered to be in the mainstream of conservative retirement planning - over $225
                        billion in annuities have been purchased in the past 12 months alone!
                    








What are your Next Steps?

                        The first thing to do is to see if an annuity fits your specific profile and financial
                        situation. This "fit" is based on the amount of retirement savings you currently have, how old
                        you are, and the State you live in. Simply fill in the information above and our system will
                        generate a free, tailor-made Annuity Report that will include annuity rate quotes from A+ rated
                        companies in your area.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
