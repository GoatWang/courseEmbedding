Mufflers & Exhaust Services






Your Muffler May Wear Out, But Your Warranty Won't!
Exhaust systems today are better than ever.  They have to be to provide better:

Fuel efficiency
Pollution and noise control
Safety

However, your muffler, exhaust pipe and catalytic converter are still vulnerable to corrosion and damage. After all, they’re under your car. The next time your vehicle is on the lift, ask for a FREE exhaust system and muffler check.
The Benefits


You save money on gas. Higher operating temperatures and catalytic converters help engines burn fuel more efficiently.
You breathe easier. More of the harmful gases and compounds are burned in the exhaust system and catalytic converter before they are released into the atmosphere. This helps reduce the pollutants that can cause smog.

Call on The Experts at Emission Control
Inspection and repair of today’s exhaust systems requires special training, testing equipment, and tools.

If your car begins to growl, your engine chokes, or you suspect an exhaust system leak, don’t wait. Bring your vehicle to the experts at Monro.
Our ASE certified technicians will inspect your exhaust for FREE and provide a written estimate of any required repairs.
Save big on mufflers and catalytic converters. Our mufflers come with a LIFETIME warranty on parts and 30-day Best Price Guarantee.
Request an appointment online for an exhaust system and muffler check. Or, stop by at your convenience. Same day appointments available. We're open evenings, Saturdays and Sundays.

Oil Change Services






Protect Your Engine With Regular Oil Changes

Oil changes are an integral part of your vehicle’s routine maintenance schedule. Regular oil changes help keep your vehicle on the road longer in every sense of the word - by improving gas mileage, protecting your engine and its service life, and maintaining your vehicle manufacturer’s warranty.
Request an appointment for an oil change today. 

Does my car need an oil change?
Knowing when to have your vehicle’s oil changed is crucial to maintaining the health and longevity of your vehicle. Many vehicles have an oil life monitoring system, that will indicate when it’s time for you to change your oil. To be certain, refer to the instructions in your owner's manual, where you’ll find the maximum recommended mileage between oil changes. 

Not sure? Luckily, the expert technicians near you at Monro Muffler have your back – and your bumper. Not only will we provide your vehicle with the optimal oil type for its make and model, but we’ll also tell you when to come in for your next express oil change. Ask for a FREE print out of your service schedule at your next visit. 
 






Your Vehicle & Motor Oil: FAQ

What are the benefits of regular oil changes?
Regular oil changes will improve your gas mileage, help maintain your vehicle manufacturer’s warranty, and protect your engine and extend its service life. Not to mention, avoiding a $2,000 engine repair is never a bad thing!

Should I use conventional or synthetic oil?
Today’s full synthetic and synthetic-mineral blends are excellent for tough conditions such as stop-and-go driving, frequent trips, and towing. And for engine fills and top-offs, they are considered equivalent or superior to conventional oil. In fact, many newer car and truck models specify synthetic oil. 

Speak to your Monro Muffler brake service technician about the best oil brand and grade for your car or truck and type of driving.

Visit our Conventional vs. Synthetic Oil page to see a quick video on making the right oil choice and print Synthetic Oil Change coupons.

ROCHESTER, N.Y., July  20, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Monro Muffler Brake, Inc. (Nasdaq:MNRO), a leading provider of automotive undercar repair and tire services, today provided financial results for its first quarter ended June 24, 2017.
First Quarter Results
Sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 increased 18.4% to $278.5 million, as compared to $235.3 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The total sales increase for the first quarter of $43.2 million was due to sales from new stores of $41.5 million, including sales from recent acquisitions of $34.8 million and a comparable store sales increase of 1.4%, as compared to a decrease of 6.9% in the prior year period. Comparable store sales increased approximately 6% for brakes, 3% for front end/shocks, were flat for tires and maintenance services and decreased approximately 2% for alignments.
Gross margin decreased 120 basis points to 40.5% in the first quarter from 41.7% in the prior year period, primarily due to the impact of sales mix from recent acquisitions. On a comparable store basis, gross margin increased approximately 110 basis points largely due to the benefit of lower material costs as a percentage of sales. Total operating expenses increased by $12.4 million to $79.1 million, or 28.4% of sales, and remained flat as a percentage of sales compared to the same period last year. The year-over-year dollar increase represents expenses from 55 net new stores and fees related to the management transition. On a comparable store basis, excluding management transition costs, total operating expenses increased approximately $2.9 million, primarily due to increases in performance-based store manager compensation and advertising expense.
Operating income was $33.7 million, or 12.1% of sales, or 12.4% excluding management transition costs, as compared to $31.3 million, or 13.3% of sales in the prior year period. Interest expense was $5.7 million as compared to $4.5 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2017.
Net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 was $17.6 million, as compared to $16.8 million in the same period of the prior year. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $.53, or $.55 when adjusting for $.02 per share in management transition costs, achieving the higher end of the Company's guidance range of $.52 to $.56. This compares to diluted earnings per share of $.50 in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and represents a 10% increase in earnings per share year-over-year. Net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 reflects an effective tax rate of 37.2%, as compared to 37.9% in the prior year period.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company opened seven and closed six Company-operated locations, ending the quarter with 1,119 Company-operated stores.  
John Van Heel, President and Chief Executive Officer stated, "We are pleased to report that the outperformance of our recent acquisitions and positive comparable store sales in the first quarter, combined with our continued focus on margin improvement, enabled us to deliver earnings per share at the high end of our guidance range, when adjusting for management transition costs. These positive trends have continued into July with an increase in comparable store sales of approximately 1.5% quarter-to-date and higher margins in both our tire and service categories."
Acquisitions Update 
The Company also announced today that it has signed definitive agreements to acquire 20 stores, including eight from an existing Car-X franchisee. These stores fill-in the existing markets of Michigan, Illinois and Indiana and are expected to add approximately $13 million in annualized sales, representing a sales mix of 95% service and 5% tires. Twelve of these stores will operate under the Monro name and the remaining eight will continue to operate under the Car-X brand. The acquisitions are expected to close in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 and be breakeven to diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2018.
Leadership Transition
As previously announced on June 28, 2017, the Company's Board of Directors elected Brett Ponton as Monro's next President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Ponton will join Monro as President on August 1, 2017 and assume the role of Chief Executive Officer on October 2, 2017. Mr. Ponton will succeed John Van Heel, who will serve as an advisor to Monro until March 31, 2018. Lead director Robert Mellor was also elected as independent Chairman of the Board of Directors, as Robert Gross, prior Executive Chairman, will retire from the Board and the Company at the conclusion of the annual shareholder meeting on August 15, 2017.
Company Outlook
Based on current visibility, business and economic trends, and recently completed and announced acquisitions, the Company anticipates fiscal 2018 sales to be in the range of $1.135 billion to $1.155 billion, an increase of 11% to 13% as compared to fiscal 2017 sales. In light of comparable store sales trends fiscal year-to-date, guidance for fiscal 2018 comparable store sales has been revised to an increase in the range of 1.5% to 2.5% on a 52-week basis (3.5% to 4.5% including an extra week in the fourth quarter), as compared to prior guidance of an increase of 2.0% to 4.0% on a 52-week basis (4% to 6% including an extra week in the fourth quarter).
The Company has also updated its fiscal 2018 diluted earnings per share guidance to be in the range of $2.05 to $2.20, to reflect $0.06 in incremental costs related to the management transition and the revised comparable store sales guidance. This compares to previous guidance of $2.10 to $2.30. The diluted earnings per share guidance continues to include approximately $.10 of contribution from the 53rd week, $.15 to $.19 in accretion from recent acquisitions and is based on 33.4 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. At the midpoint of the range, the revised guidance represents a 15% increase in diluted earnings per share, as compared to $1.85 in fiscal 2017.    
For the second quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company anticipates sales to be in the range of $278 million to $285 million, representing an increase of 13% to 16%, over sales of $246 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Fiscal 2018 second quarter sales guidance is based on a comparable store sales increase of 1.0% to 2.5%, as compared to a 4.3% decline in the prior year period. The Company expects diluted earnings per share for the second quarter to be in the range of $.52 to $.56, which includes $.02 of management transition costs and assumes slight accretion from recent acquisitions. This compares to diluted earnings per share of $.53 in the second quarter of fiscal 2017.  
Mr. Van Heel concluded, "I am confident that our team will be able to effectively leverage Monro's unique business model and capitalize on the significant opportunities for profitable growth both organically and through accretive acquisitions and greenfield expansion. The outlook for the industry remains positive, with the total vehicles in operation, particularly those six years old and older, set to grow significantly over the next several years. Going forward, the Company is well positioned to build on this strong foundation and deliver value to our customers, associates and shareholders."

07/04/2017 - Kelly - Edge A/S
1st 1000 miles. Handle well and grip the road in wet weather.  Surprisingly love the sidewall look. Lightweight tire for a 17" size. Meaty tread should do well in the snow this winter.





06/23/2017 - Yokohama - Tornante
I have had these on my Buick Lucerne.  I drive very hard and these tires handle well especially in rain and provide a soft ride.  I just bought another set after going back to recompare all brands.  I couldn't find a better tire for the money.  





06/18/2017 - Pirelli - Scorpion STR
I love these tires.  They look great and perform great!





06/16/2017 - Goodyear - Fortera HL
Very happy with tire ride, comfort and lack of noise level





06/16/2017 - Goodyear - Assurance Fuel Max
This is my second set of these tires, I really like them. They have great traction, gets me through Pennsylvania winters and rain storms. Not noisy, seem to be wearing even. Comfortable ride. Had one set on a civic and now on my elantra. Got them to order them because these were what I wanted to go with again.





06/15/2017 - Economy - All Season
These tires ride so smooth and are a great value.





06/14/2017 - Yokohama - Tornante
I switched from Avid Ascends to these on a Toyota Sienna after sliding out and spinning anytime the road was damp.  These are fantastic tires for a great price.





06/05/2017 - Yokohama - Tornante
The Tornante has quiet ride, it’s great in the rain, and very good in the snow. These tires are on my Honda Pilot with 4 wheel drive. These tires inspire confidence when riding in less than satisfactory conditions. Little or no tread ware in the 8 months that I have owned them, highly recommended! 





05/20/2017 - BLACKLION - VORACIO HT BC86
Excellent  all weather tire for a great price.





05/18/2017 - Economy - Performance
Great tires, fast installation. Definitely buying again!





05/18/2017 - Economy - All Season
Love my tires, I feel so safe on the road. I got the entire set for a great price. I have an old car, so I was not looking to spend too much on tires. These were perfect!





04/20/2017 - Economy - All Season
An inexpensive, yet very good quality tire!

Company history[edit]
Early history[edit]
The company was founded by Charles J. August in 1957, originally as a franchise of another company, Midas Muffler.[3]
In the mid-1960s, "Chuck" August decided that his muffler shops should offer an expanded list of services. This was not in line with the other organization's wishes. In 1966, he discontinued his affiliation with Midas Muffler.[3] August launched a new muffler service company under the name Monro Muffler with his brother, Burton S. August, and Sheldon Lane. August named the new company after Monroe County, New York, but without the "e" at the end of the name.[2] August added brake services several years later and renamed the company, Monro Muffler Brake, Inc.[2]
Monro began a deliberate course of prudent expansion, arriving at 20 stores by 1977.[3] They had a warehouse on West Henrietta Road. By the end of 1979, they had about 43 stores in New York. From this warehouse, drivers would load the trucks and deliver to all the 43 stores throughout New York. Afterwards, a more aggressive expansion program was instituted when the company began to make a number of large acquisitions. By the mid-1980s, there were 59 stores which generated $21 million in sales annually.[2] Most of those locations were located in upstate New York.[2]
Expansion[edit]




Headquarters in Rochester, New York


In 1984, the company's founder, Charles J. August sold his controlling interest in Monro Muffler and Brake to a New York City-based investors group headed by Donald Glickman and Peter J. Solomon.[2][3] August remained on the company's board of directors until 2002.[3]
In 1991, Monro Muffler made its initial public offering.[3] Monro's stock began trading on NASDAQ under the symbol "MNRO".
Under the leadership of Robert G. Gross, who joined the company in 1998 as president and CEO and currently serves as executive chairman, Monro aggressively expanded outside of its traditional base in upstate New York.[3] In September 1998, the company successfully purchased all 205 Speedy Muffler King locations within the United States from Speedy Muffler King, Inc. of Toronto, Canada. In 2004, Monro purchased the 25 stores and 10 kiosks of Mr. Tire, a Baltimore, Maryland chain which trademarked “On the Rim and Out the Door” pricing. Later that year, Monro bought five Rice Tire locations and rebranded them as Mr. Tire Auto Service Centers. Monro now operates 132 Mr. Tire outlets.
In 2006, Monro obtained 75 ProCare shops from bankruptcy, converting 44 to Monro Muffler Brake & Service centers and 31 to Mr. Tire outlets. In fiscal 2010, the company purchased the 26 Autotire stores in Missouri and Illinois, its first venture into the mid-West, and the 41 Tire Warehouse Central stores in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Vermont and New Hampshire. Fiscal 2011 began with the acquisition of Import Export Tire Co., five retail tire and auto repair stores in the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania metro region, and Courthouse Tire, three tire and undercar care facilities in the Fredericksburg, Virginia area who's sales substantially declined after the acquisition.
In fiscal 2012, the company acquired eight local auto service and retail groups, including Tire Barn Warehouse, 31 stores in Indiana, Illinois and Tennessee, and Ken Towery's Tire & AutoCare, 27 stores in Kentucky and Indiana, two chains that Monro continues to manage under the local brand names. This is also true of Curry's Auto Service In Virginia and Maryland, a 10-store acquisition in fiscal 2013. That year, the company also purchased four S&S Firestone stores in Kentucky and six Carl King Tire Stores in Delaware and Maryland.
Monro entered three new states with major acquisitions in 2014: Michigan - Lentz USA/Kan Rock Tire, 19 stores; Florida - The Tire Choice & Total Car Care, 35 stores; Gold Coast Tire & Auto Centers, 9 stores; and Martino Tire, 8 stores; and, Georgia - Wood & Fullerton, 9 stores. The company operates its Florida stores under the Tire Choice brand.
In fiscal 2015, the company purchased the Car-X trade name and franchise rights to 146 locations in Illinois, Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota, and Texas. Since 2000, Monro has made more than 30 acquisitions totaling more than 500 stores and producing revenue of 650 million.
Under Monro's current CEO John Van Heel, the company continues to pursue a growth strategy of increased market share through incremental store sales, low-cost acquisitions, and strategic new store openings.
Monro serviced 5.5 million vehicles in 2015 and posted record sales of $894.4 million, record net income of $61.7 million, and earnings of $1.94 per share.[1] The company operates under several regional brands, most acquired in the past 15 years, including: Monro Muffler Brake & Service, Mr. Tire Auto Service Centers, Tread Quarters Discount Tire Auto Service Centers, Autotire Car Care Centers, Ken Towery's Tire & AutoCare, Curry's Auto Service, The Tire Choice & Total Car Care, Tire Warehouse Tires for Less, and Tire Barn Warehouse.

                            History shows that great innovations stand the test of time. Over the years, Monroe has been committed to product quality, customer satisfaction and new product technology. This commitment is a tradition that dates back to the early 1900's when small improvements were done on a simple tire pump.                             
                        
















                                    
                                        Monroe has been a driving force of innovation over the past century.

What is "Positive Molding Technology" and why is it better?


    Positive Molding Technology is a key performance-enhancing feature of Monroe® Premium Brake Pads. This press-curing process, the same used by leading OE manufacturers, guarantees that full friction-material density is reached on every part.  Most aftermarket competitors utilize the "Flash Mold" process, requiring high resin content to make the friction material flow. High resin creates fade, which can increase stopping distances up to 50%.
BACK TO TOP  



What are the differences between the Ceramics and Dynamics formulations?


    To maintain the braking performance of any vehicle, it's generally recommended to follow the OE manufacturer's choice of friction material  (replacing semi-metallic with semi-metallic, organic with organic, etc.). There are, however, options for improving braking performance. That's why  Monroe® offers choices to assist in making the best selection for each vehicle. Monroe Ceramics® brake pads feature a non-ferrous formulation to reduce noise and dusting. Monroe Dynamics® semi-metallic formulations and manufacturing technologies increase overall pad life. Both offer stable friction performance across wide temperature ranges.
BACK TO TOP  



How do I know if my vehicle originally came with ceramic or metallic brake pads?


    Monroe® highlights the original equipment formulation in the catalog. Simply look for the bold-face part number.
BACK TO TOP  



Are the Monroe® pads application-specific?


    Monroe® manufactures a comprehensive range of friction products, each engineered to fit and perform like OE for each application.
BACK TO TOP  



Does Monroe® make brake shoes?


    Yes. Click here to view detailed information about Monroe® Brake Shoes. 
BACK TO TOP  



Where can I buy Monroe Brakes®?


    Use this web site's Dealer Locator to find a dealer.
BACK TO TOP  



Do Monroe® brake pads include shims?


    As Total Solution™ for brake specialists, Monroe® pads are shipped complete with advanced rubberized shims pre-attached, as well as all required clips and lubrication for most applications.
BACK TO TOP  



Do Monroe Brakes® include noise elimination clips?


    Total Solution™ pads, shims, clips and lubrication are packaged together in a single box to ensure you have all of the parts you need for a perfect repair for most applications.
BACK TO TOP  



How do Monroe® pads help reduce brake fade? 


    Monroe's "Positive Molding Technology" (O.E.-specified constant pressure molding process for bonding the pad to the backing plate) reduces resin content by 50%,resulting in more active ingredient in the friction material. This denser material performs better, lasts longer, produces less dust and is quieter.
BACK TO TOP  



How are the Monroe® backing plates better?


    The Monroe® pads' Q-lock textured backing plate holds friction material better than conventional stamped-steel for less pad separation, less vibration and less noise.
BACK TO TOP  



What is the noise reduction system?


    This includes the abutment hardware/clips and moly-based silicone lubricant included with each set of Monroe® brake pads to ensure satisfaction.
BACK TO TOP  



Why is integrally molded better than riveted backing plates?


    Integrally molded, or molded directly to the backing plate, results in much more strength and less flex than the riveting process.
BACK TO TOP  



Why should the brake rotors be washed when installing new pads?


    The quality of today's drums and rotors requires removal of any and all dust, particles and/or residues. Residual contaminants may be present from reconditioning or shipping. Monroe® recommends removing contaminants with detergent, warm water and a clean cloth. CAUTION: Shop towels are chemically treated and may leave a residue that will result in glazing.
BACK TO TOP  



What should I use to wash brake rotors?


    Monroe® recommends removing contaminants with detergent, warm water and a clean cloth. CAUTION: Shop towels are chemically treated and may leave a residue that will result in glazing.
BACK TO TOP  



Should I turn my new rotors prior to installation?


    The CNC lathe used during rotor manufacturing creates a surface roughness (Ra) that meets or exceeds the OE standard. It is difficult to obtain this Ra when reconditioning, or turning, new rotors so Monroe® does not recommend turning new rotors.
BACK TO TOP  



Can I use semi metallic pads on a vehicle that originally came with ceramic pads?


    To maintain the braking performance of any vehicle, the generally accepted recommendation is to follow the manufacturer's choice of friction material when replacing brake pads (replace semi-metallic with semi-metallic, organic with organic, etc.). There are, however, options for improving braking performance, and Monroe® offers choices to assist in making the best selection to meet vehicle braking requirements.
BACK TO TOP  



I recently had new brakes installed on my vehicle and now experience pedal pulsations.  Why?


    Pedal pulsation may occur when rotors or drums have been overheated or incorrectly machined. Rotor run out and thickness variations are often the result of incorrect torquing of wheel lug nuts.
BACK TO TOP  



I recently had new brakes installed on my vehicle and now experience a pull. Why?


    Disc brakes do not have return springs. A sticky piston or dirty or rusty sliding surface may prevent the pads from sufficiently releasing, allowing them to drag on the rotor. Brake pull may also be caused by worn a wheel bearing, suspension components or tires of unequal sizes generating different levels of leverage.
BACK TO TOP  



I recently had new brakes installed on my vehicle and now experience a soft pedal. Why?


    A soft pedal could indicate an internal master cylinder leaking, air in system or  drum brakes out of adjustment.
BACK TO TOP  



How often should a brake lath be indexed?


    Refer to manufacturer's manual for service and calibration or indexing schedule.
BACK TO TOP  



What should I use to clean the surface of the brake pads?


    As a rule, nothing should ever be applied to the surface of the brake pad. In the event that the surface becomes contaminated,  clean with detergent and warm water. ("Brake Clean" may be used to remove heavy soiling, but must be followed with detergent and warm water).
BACK TO TOP  



What causes my wheels to be constantly covered with brake dust?


    As the friction material wears, the brake lining material becomes airborne. The rotation of the wheel assembly causes a magnetic field that may attract ferrous metals from the lining material. Monroe Ceramics® are a genuine ceramic formulation with virtually no ferrous metal content, and Monroe® Dymanics are formulated to have the least ferrous metal content of any semi-metallic friction material available.
BACK TO TOP  



Are Monroe® pads chamfered and / or slotted?


    Monroe® utilizes OE processes to manufacture integrally-molded, O.E.-quality premium disc brake pads for the aftermarket. Slots and/or chamfers match OE specifications.
BACK TO TOP  



What is the recommended "break-in" procedure for Monroe® brake pads?


    Proper break-in is one of the most important factors in determining brake pad performance, as it seats the pads for optimum performance. Monroe® recommends 15 to 20 gentle stops from 20 mph. Monroe® Premium Brake Pads' positive molding technology does not require burnishing.
BACK TO TOP  



How often should my brake system be inspected?


    Manufacturers recommendation is that the brake system should be inspected every 12 months.
BACK TO TOP  



My ABS light comes on and sometimes goes off. What could be causing that?


    Common causes include worn brake pads, low brake fluid level, and worn wheel bearings/hub assembly.
BACK TO TOP  



What could be causing my brakes to squeal?


    A squealing noise can be caused by: worn brake pads/shoes; wrong brake pads/shoes; improper rotor finish; lack of lubrication; worn hardware; and/or fatigued brake shoe hold-down springs.

Holes and slots also expel water, for optimal pad contact in the rain, and they vent gasses from the brake pads to reduce brake fade and increase pad life. We offer rotors in standard and larger than stock sizes in one-piece design and two-piece with lightweight aluminum center construction. Most have curved and directional internal vanes to maximize airflow for cooling. Our brake pads come in a myriad of organic, ceramic, and metallic compounds, so you can get the friction material that’s ideally suited to your needs.We offer both direct replacement calipers, and for the ultimate in performance, fixed calipers with multiple opposed pistons on each side of the brake disc. Both are made from lightweight aluminum. Fixed calipers transfer pressure to the brake pads more efficiently than the typical OE floating calipers, and multiple pistons apply more even pressure to the pads. Performance calipers often have larger pistons, which can provide more clamping pressure. Many calipers with 6 or more pistons have bore sizes that increase in size from front to rear, to keep the brake pad flat against the rotor and prevent pad taper.One of the easiest upgrades you can make to your brake system is replacing the stock rubber brake hoses with stainless steel. Stainless steel brake hoses have a Teflon inner hose with a braided stainless steel covering. This construction prevents expansion when the hose is pressurized, eliminating the mushy pedal feel that you can experience with ordinary rubber hoses, especially when the brake fluid temperature is elevated under performance driving conditions. The stainless steel also provides better protection against debris and abrasion, and provides a much better appearance as well. 
When building a race car and using calipers with different piston bores, the master cylinder bore diameter may also need to be changed to maintain proper pedal travel. Space is often at a premium on racing vehicles and the master cylinder may have to be smaller in size or mounted in a different location. We offer a large selection of master cylinders so you can get the one that’s best for your application, including tandem master cylinders, compact remote flange mount master cylinders, high volume master cylinders, and master cylinders designed for remote reservoirs.Disc brakes are the gold standard of braking, but if your vehicle is afflicted with drum brakes our drum-to-disc brake conversion kits are the performance remedy. Their ineffective drum brakes were the weakness of classic muscle cars, but with our conversion kits you can upgrade to disc brakes and enjoy stopping power that matches the go power. We offer everything from basic kits with front spindles, backing plates and caliper brackets that allow you to build your own system, to complete front and 4-wheel kits that include the above plus calipers, rotors, bearings, hoses, master cylinder and booster. We also have rear disc brake conversion kits to upgrade many late model pickups to 4-wheel disc brakes.
Brake fluid is one of the most important components of a high performance brake system. Ordinary DOT 3 fluid does not have a high enough boiling point for performance use and even lesser grades of DOT 4 fluid can be too hygroscopic and attract moisture, which lowers the boiling point. The high performance fluid we offer has been tested to 626°F, it has low moisture affinity, and resists aeration and compressibility to maintain firm pedal feel. We also offer DOT 5 silicone fluid for classic and show cars, which won’t harm paint if spilled. DOT 5 should not be used for racing.Featured VideosPower Stop Z26 Brake Kit01StopTech & Ford F-150 Project02Brembo Company03StopTech Factory Tour04DBA T3 Rotors05KSport Brakes06StopTech Sport Rotors07DBA Performance Pads08Power Stop Z23 Brake Kit09GT-S Brake Kit M4 & M8 Calipers10Rotors Manufacturing11Brembo at SEMA 201312Corvette Upgrade13Centric & StopTech Brake Pads14Power Stop Z36 Brake Kit15GT Brake Kit BM4 & BM8 Calipers16Baer at SEMA 201417Brake Pads Installation Tips18Bondurant Partnership19Z16 Brake Pads20Rotor Installation Tips21Caliper Covers22Guides & Articles Performance Brakes, Pads & RotorsMarch 03, 2017How To Select And Install Performance Brake RotorsPerformance braking is a topic that has widespread interest for our clients.

Disc brakes replaced drum brakes on the front axle of all cars and trucks decades ago and they’re used front and rear on many new vehicles. Compared to drums, disc brakes run cooler and are more resistant to fade, self-adjusting without needing any complex mechanism, and less prone to pulling and grabbing. If you have an older car with drums at all 4-wheels or a late model vehicle with rear drums and want the reliable, predictable and fade-free stopping power of disc brakes, we have the disc brake conversion kits to make it happen.

For all their ferocity under the hood, drums at all 4 wheels made classic muscle cars weaklings in the brake department. Their neck snapping acceleration is legendary, but getting them hauled down from speed in enough time could be just as hair raising. Unequal shoe-to-drum clearance caused by dodgy self-adjusters could result in pull and an unexpected lane change in a panic stop. And repeated use, such as would be experienced driving on curvy roads and mountainous terrain, would result in brake fade and even worse performance.


Although disc brakes at the front are a vast improvement over 4-wheel drum brakes, you can do better. Front discs/rear drums were original equipment on millions of cars and trucks, and many are still produced with this brake arrangement today. But rear drums can suffer the same fading from aggressive driving or hauling heavy loads or towing, resulting in extended stopping distances. Rear drum brake self-adjusters are just as problematic, and you can end up with a low pedal when they fail or don’t work properly. And drum brakes are much more time consuming and tedious to service. In addition to brake shoes, they often require brake hardware replacement due to the extreme heat buildup that occurs inside the brake drum.


Our disc brake conversion kits are the remedy for ineffective and troublesome drum brakes. Disc brakes naturally run cooler because their friction surface is exposed to the air, unlike the enclosed friction surface on drum brakes. Cooling is further improved on vented rotors that have cooling fins cast in between the friction surfaces. This ability to dissipate heat virtually eliminates the high brake temperatures that can cause brake fade. Disc brakes are also inherently self-adjusting and because the clearance between brake pads and rotors is consistent, you get better pedal feel and more predictable braking. With its exposed components, a disc brake system is also much easier to inspect and service than a drum brake system.


We offer kits to replace the front drum brakes on most popular classic and muscle cars as well as 4-wheel conversion kits, and kits that convert the rear drum brakes to discs on many late model cars, trucks and SUVs. Each kit is designed for the specific application and a bolt-on installation, without the need for any fabrication. Rear conversions retain parking brake functionality via caliper activated or internal expanding shoe parking brakes. And if your budget only allows a front disc brake conversion right now, we offer rear only conversion kits for 4-wheel drum brake vehicles, so you can complete the conversion to 4-wheel disc brakes in the future.


With our selection of kits, you can do more than just convert to disc brakes, you can also upgrade your brake system to beyond OE level performance. Choose from basic kits that include spindles, backing plates and caliper brackets, allowing you to build your own conversion kit, to wheel kits that, in addition to the above, include rotors, calipers, hoses and bearings, to complete kits that add a master cylinder and booster. These components will be a marked improvement over drum brakes, but if you want more we have kits that feature multi-piston calipers, drilled and slotted rotors, and braided steel lines, with rotor sizes that will fit inside standard wheels to sizes that require an increase in wheel diameter.

Hydraulic pressure that’s wasted expanding rubber brake hoses instead of doing the more important work of applying caliper pistons and brake pads will result in longer stopping distances. This condition gets even worse when original equipment fabric reinforced rubber hoses get soft and swell with age.
Our performance brake hoses are constructed from PTFE (Teflon®) tubing covered by woven stainless steel braid. They’ve been tested at pressures far greater than the average master cylinder can exert, so you can be assured that all the hydraulic pressure your brake system develops will go to apply the caliper pistons and nothing else. Braided steel hoses are also much tougher than their rubber counterparts, and better able to resist impacts and abrasions, so they’re perfect for severe duty conditions like off-roading. And braided steel hoses have the high-tech, high-performance look that will set off your machine.
It’s easy to get this performance, durability, and appearance upgrade no matter what you drive. We have application specific kits for most cars, truck, and SUVs. These hoses are the proper length and have the right fittings to connect right into your system, without the need for any fabrication. But if you’re building a custom or race car with other than stock brake and suspension components, we also offer universal and competition hoses in a range of lengths, with straight, banjo, and 90 degree steel fittings. Or if you want to construct your own hoses, we have bulk hose ready to cut to size and hose ends for assembly.
Another common reason for upgrading from original brake hoses is when they’re not long enough to work with suspension modifications. This is especially common on lifted trucks. You can order individual hoses in longer lengths, but we’ve made it much easier by offering application specific hoses and kits designed to work with particular lift heights. These hoses come ready to connect into your OE brake system, but with the longer length you need to accommodate increased suspension travel. In addition to the above, we also have a large selection of clamps, brackets, hardware, and proportioning valves to complete the job.Related Categories (217,185)Brake KitsHigh Performance & Racing Kits(10,600)Brake PadsBrake Pads, Pad Sets, Pad Shims(55,227)Brake RotorsBrake Discs & Rotors, Rotor Shims(653)Brake CalipersDisc Brake Calipers & Repair Kits(690)Master CylinderMaster Cylinder Caps & Kits(276)Brake BoostersPower Boosters, Hydrovac Units(186)Hand BrakesHand Brake Kits, Calipers(1,664)Disc Brake Conversion KitsDrum-to-Disc Brake Conversion Kits(36)Line Lock & Roll ControlLaunch Control, Installation Kits(13,220)Drum Brake ShoesBrake Shoes, Shoe Rebuild Kits(13,220)Brake DrumsBrake Drums, Drum Rebuild Kits(13,220)Brake Wheel CylindersDrum Brake Wheel Cylinders(6,261)ABS System PartsSensors, Control Modules, Relays(7,320)Brake System SensorsBrake Pad, Fluid Pressure Sensors(264)Backing Plates & ShieldsDust Shields & Backing Plates(16,994)Brake HardwareDisc & Drum Brake Hardware(147)Brake Fluids & LubricantsSafe & Efficient BrakingBrowse by VehicleAcura Performance Brake Lines & HosesAlfa Romeo Performance Brake Lines & HosesAmerican Motors Performance Brake Lines & HosesAston Martin Performance Brake Lines & HosesAudi Performance Brake Lines & HosesAustin Healey Performance Brake Lines & HosesBentley Performance Brake Lines & HosesBMW Performance Brake Lines & HosesBuick Performance Brake Lines & HosesCadillac Performance Brake Lines & HosesChecker Performance Brake Lines & HosesChevy Performance Brake Lines & HosesChrysler Performance Brake Lines & HosesDaewoo Performance Brake Lines & HosesDodge Performance Brake Lines & HosesEagle Performance Brake Lines & HosesEdsel Performance Brake Lines & HosesFerrari Performance Brake Lines & HosesFiat Performance Brake Lines & HosesFord Performance Brake Lines & HosesFreightliner Performance Brake Lines & HosesGEO Performance Brake Lines & HosesGMC Performance Brake Lines & HosesHino Performance Brake Lines & HosesHonda Performance Brake Lines & HosesHudson Performance Brake Lines & HosesHummer Performance Brake Lines & HosesHyundai Performance Brake Lines & HosesInfiniti Performance Brake Lines & HosesInternational Performance Brake Lines & HosesIsuzu Performance Brake Lines & HosesJaguar Performance Brake Lines & HosesJeep Performance Brake Lines & HosesJensen Performance Brake Lines & HosesKia Performance Brake Lines & HosesLand Rover Performance Brake Lines & HosesLexus Performance Brake Lines & HosesLincoln Performance Brake Lines & HosesLotus Performance Brake Lines & HosesMaserati Performance Brake Lines & HosesMazda Performance Brake Lines & HosesMercedes Performance Brake Lines & HosesMercury Performance Brake Lines & HosesMG Performance Brake Lines & HosesMini Performance Brake Lines & HosesMitsubishi Performance Brake Lines & HosesMitsubishi Fuso Performance Brake Lines & HosesMorgan Performance Brake Lines & HosesNissan Performance Brake Lines & HosesOldsmobile Performance Brake Lines & HosesOpel Performance Brake Lines & HosesPeugeot Performance Brake Lines & HosesPlymouth Performance Brake Lines & HosesPontiac Performance Brake Lines & HosesPorsche Performance Brake Lines & HosesRam Performance Brake Lines & HosesRenault Performance Brake Lines & HosesSaab Performance Brake Lines & HosesSaturn Performance Brake Lines & HosesScion Performance Brake Lines & HosesSmart Car Performance Brake Lines & HosesSterling Performance Brake Lines & HosesStudebaker Performance Brake Lines & HosesSubaru Performance Brake Lines & HosesSuzuki Performance Brake Lines & HosesTesla Performance Brake Lines & HosesToyota Performance Brake Lines & HosesTriumph Performance Brake Lines & HosesUD Performance Brake Lines & HosesVolkswagen Performance Brake Lines & HosesVolvo Performance Brake Lines & HosesWorkhorse Performance Brake Lines & HosesBrake Lines ReviewsAverage rating:	   4.5 - 31 reviews  /  Read All Brake Lines Reviews4.8 of 5SturdyStopTech® 950.61018 - Stainless Steel Front Brake Line KitGood lines fairly easy install just take off the tires and throw em on freat pedal feel solid and gives more reaponse if something else is going on, with the brakes.JPosted by Joseph (Soquel, CA) / June 20, 20172014 Ford FiestaWas this review helpful for you?

Good brakes are just as important as a powerful engine. Performance brakes provide shorter stopping distances, so the driver can spend more time on the gas for lower elapsed times, and performance brakes won’t fade, so the brakes work just as well at the end of the race as they did at the beginning.Categories (217,185)Brake KitsHigh Performance & Racing Kits(10,600)Brake PadsBrake Pads, Pad Sets, Pad Shims(55,227)Brake RotorsBrake Discs & Rotors, Rotor Shims(653)Brake CalipersDisc Brake Calipers & Repair Kits(186)Hand BrakesHand Brake Kits, Calipers(1,664)Disc Brake Conversion KitsDrum-to-Disc Brake Conversion Kits(3,035)Brake LinesLines & Hoses, Connecting Parts(276)Brake BoostersPower Boosters, Hydrovac Units(36)Line Lock & Roll ControlLaunch Control, Installation Kits(690)Master CylinderMaster Cylinder Caps & Kits(147)Brake Fluids & LubricantsSafe & Efficient Braking(8,535)Caliper CoversCustom Painted, Custom Logos(1,634)Wheel SpacersSpacers, Adapters & Kits(573)Brake PedalsBrake Pedals & Mechanisms(1,023)Brake ServiceCaliper Tools, Bleeders, HonesFeatured BrandsBremboEBC BrakesPowerStopStopTechWilwoodBaerHawkChrome BrakesDBAAkebonoProject MuKSportCentricRight Stuff DetailingARK PerformanceZimmermannSSBCATEMcGaughy'sBuddy ClubRaybestosACDelcoHelixMGPPro CompTeraFlexAlloy USAEarl's Performance PlumbingRubicon ExpressRock KrawlerWhether you’re building a race car or just want better braking performance on your street car, we have the brake kits and individual components you need.

Holes and slots also expel water, for optimal pad contact in the rain, and they vent gasses from the brake pads to reduce brake fade and increase pad life. We offer rotors in standard and larger than stock sizes in one-piece design and two-piece with lightweight aluminum center construction. Most have curved and directional internal vanes to maximize airflow for cooling. Our brake pads come in a myriad of organic, ceramic, and metallic compounds, so you can get the friction material that’s ideally suited to your needs.We offer both direct replacement calipers, and for the ultimate in performance, fixed calipers with multiple opposed pistons on each side of the brake disc. Both are made from lightweight aluminum. Fixed calipers transfer pressure to the brake pads more efficiently than the typical OE floating calipers, and multiple pistons apply more even pressure to the pads. Performance calipers often have larger pistons, which can provide more clamping pressure. Many calipers with 6 or more pistons have bore sizes that increase in size from front to rear, to keep the brake pad flat against the rotor and prevent pad taper.One of the easiest upgrades you can make to your brake system is replacing the stock rubber brake hoses with stainless steel. Stainless steel brake hoses have a Teflon inner hose with a braided stainless steel covering. This construction prevents expansion when the hose is pressurized, eliminating the mushy pedal feel that you can experience with ordinary rubber hoses, especially when the brake fluid temperature is elevated under performance driving conditions. The stainless steel also provides better protection against debris and abrasion, and provides a much better appearance as well. 
When building a race car and using calipers with different piston bores, the master cylinder bore diameter may also need to be changed to maintain proper pedal travel. Space is often at a premium on racing vehicles and the master cylinder may have to be smaller in size or mounted in a different location. We offer a large selection of master cylinders so you can get the one that’s best for your application, including tandem master cylinders, compact remote flange mount master cylinders, high volume master cylinders, and master cylinders designed for remote reservoirs.Disc brakes are the gold standard of braking, but if your vehicle is afflicted with drum brakes our drum-to-disc brake conversion kits are the performance remedy. Their ineffective drum brakes were the weakness of classic muscle cars, but with our conversion kits you can upgrade to disc brakes and enjoy stopping power that matches the go power. We offer everything from basic kits with front spindles, backing plates and caliper brackets that allow you to build your own system, to complete front and 4-wheel kits that include the above plus calipers, rotors, bearings, hoses, master cylinder and booster. We also have rear disc brake conversion kits to upgrade many late model pickups to 4-wheel disc brakes.
Brake fluid is one of the most important components of a high performance brake system. Ordinary DOT 3 fluid does not have a high enough boiling point for performance use and even lesser grades of DOT 4 fluid can be too hygroscopic and attract moisture, which lowers the boiling point. The high performance fluid we offer has been tested to 626°F, it has low moisture affinity, and resists aeration and compressibility to maintain firm pedal feel. We also offer DOT 5 silicone fluid for classic and show cars, which won’t harm paint if spilled. DOT 5 should not be used for racing.Featured VideosPower Stop Z26 Brake Kit01StopTech & Ford F-150 Project02Brembo Company03StopTech Factory Tour04DBA T3 Rotors05KSport Brakes06StopTech Sport Rotors07DBA Performance Pads08Power Stop Z23 Brake Kit09GT-S Brake Kit M4 & M8 Calipers10Rotors Manufacturing11Brembo at SEMA 201312Corvette Upgrade13Centric & StopTech Brake Pads14Power Stop Z36 Brake Kit15GT Brake Kit BM4 & BM8 Calipers16Baer at SEMA 201417Brake Pads Installation Tips18Bondurant Partnership19Z16 Brake Pads20Rotor Installation Tips21Caliper Covers22Guides & Articles Performance Brakes, Pads & RotorsMarch 03, 2017How To Select And Install Performance Brake RotorsPerformance braking is a topic that has widespread interest for our clients.

07/04/2017 - Kelly - Edge A/S
1st 1000 miles. Handle well and grip the road in wet weather.  Surprisingly love the sidewall look. Lightweight tire for a 17" size. Meaty tread should do well in the snow this winter.





06/23/2017 - Yokohama - Tornante
I have had these on my Buick Lucerne.  I drive very hard and these tires handle well especially in rain and provide a soft ride.  I just bought another set after going back to recompare all brands.  I couldn't find a better tire for the money.  





06/18/2017 - Pirelli - Scorpion STR
I love these tires.  They look great and perform great!





06/16/2017 - Goodyear - Fortera HL
Very happy with tire ride, comfort and lack of noise level





06/16/2017 - Goodyear - Assurance Fuel Max
This is my second set of these tires, I really like them. They have great traction, gets me through Pennsylvania winters and rain storms. Not noisy, seem to be wearing even. Comfortable ride. Had one set on a civic and now on my elantra. Got them to order them because these were what I wanted to go with again.





06/15/2017 - Economy - All Season
These tires ride so smooth and are a great value.





06/14/2017 - Yokohama - Tornante
I switched from Avid Ascends to these on a Toyota Sienna after sliding out and spinning anytime the road was damp.  These are fantastic tires for a great price.





06/05/2017 - Yokohama - Tornante
The Tornante has quiet ride, it’s great in the rain, and very good in the snow. These tires are on my Honda Pilot with 4 wheel drive. These tires inspire confidence when riding in less than satisfactory conditions. Little or no tread ware in the 8 months that I have owned them, highly recommended! 





05/20/2017 - BLACKLION - VORACIO HT BC86
Excellent  all weather tire for a great price.





05/18/2017 - Economy - Performance
Great tires, fast installation. Definitely buying again!





05/18/2017 - Economy - All Season
Love my tires, I feel so safe on the road. I got the entire set for a great price. I have an old car, so I was not looking to spend too much on tires. These were perfect!





04/20/2017 - Economy - All Season
An inexpensive, yet very good quality tire!

Company history[edit]
Early history[edit]
The company was founded by Charles J. August in 1957, originally as a franchise of another company, Midas Muffler.[3]
In the mid-1960s, "Chuck" August decided that his muffler shops should offer an expanded list of services. This was not in line with the other organization's wishes. In 1966, he discontinued his affiliation with Midas Muffler.[3] August launched a new muffler service company under the name Monro Muffler with his brother, Burton S. August, and Sheldon Lane. August named the new company after Monroe County, New York, but without the "e" at the end of the name.[2] August added brake services several years later and renamed the company, Monro Muffler Brake, Inc.[2]
Monro began a deliberate course of prudent expansion, arriving at 20 stores by 1977.[3] They had a warehouse on West Henrietta Road. By the end of 1979, they had about 43 stores in New York. From this warehouse, drivers would load the trucks and deliver to all the 43 stores throughout New York. Afterwards, a more aggressive expansion program was instituted when the company began to make a number of large acquisitions. By the mid-1980s, there were 59 stores which generated $21 million in sales annually.[2] Most of those locations were located in upstate New York.[2]
Expansion[edit]




Headquarters in Rochester, New York


In 1984, the company's founder, Charles J. August sold his controlling interest in Monro Muffler and Brake to a New York City-based investors group headed by Donald Glickman and Peter J. Solomon.[2][3] August remained on the company's board of directors until 2002.[3]
In 1991, Monro Muffler made its initial public offering.[3] Monro's stock began trading on NASDAQ under the symbol "MNRO".
Under the leadership of Robert G. Gross, who joined the company in 1998 as president and CEO and currently serves as executive chairman, Monro aggressively expanded outside of its traditional base in upstate New York.[3] In September 1998, the company successfully purchased all 205 Speedy Muffler King locations within the United States from Speedy Muffler King, Inc. of Toronto, Canada. In 2004, Monro purchased the 25 stores and 10 kiosks of Mr. Tire, a Baltimore, Maryland chain which trademarked “On the Rim and Out the Door” pricing. Later that year, Monro bought five Rice Tire locations and rebranded them as Mr. Tire Auto Service Centers. Monro now operates 132 Mr. Tire outlets.
In 2006, Monro obtained 75 ProCare shops from bankruptcy, converting 44 to Monro Muffler Brake & Service centers and 31 to Mr. Tire outlets. In fiscal 2010, the company purchased the 26 Autotire stores in Missouri and Illinois, its first venture into the mid-West, and the 41 Tire Warehouse Central stores in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Vermont and New Hampshire. Fiscal 2011 began with the acquisition of Import Export Tire Co., five retail tire and auto repair stores in the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania metro region, and Courthouse Tire, three tire and undercar care facilities in the Fredericksburg, Virginia area who's sales substantially declined after the acquisition.
In fiscal 2012, the company acquired eight local auto service and retail groups, including Tire Barn Warehouse, 31 stores in Indiana, Illinois and Tennessee, and Ken Towery's Tire & AutoCare, 27 stores in Kentucky and Indiana, two chains that Monro continues to manage under the local brand names. This is also true of Curry's Auto Service In Virginia and Maryland, a 10-store acquisition in fiscal 2013. That year, the company also purchased four S&S Firestone stores in Kentucky and six Carl King Tire Stores in Delaware and Maryland.
Monro entered three new states with major acquisitions in 2014: Michigan - Lentz USA/Kan Rock Tire, 19 stores; Florida - The Tire Choice & Total Car Care, 35 stores; Gold Coast Tire & Auto Centers, 9 stores; and Martino Tire, 8 stores; and, Georgia - Wood & Fullerton, 9 stores. The company operates its Florida stores under the Tire Choice brand.
In fiscal 2015, the company purchased the Car-X trade name and franchise rights to 146 locations in Illinois, Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota, and Texas. Since 2000, Monro has made more than 30 acquisitions totaling more than 500 stores and producing revenue of 650 million.
Under Monro's current CEO John Van Heel, the company continues to pursue a growth strategy of increased market share through incremental store sales, low-cost acquisitions, and strategic new store openings.
Monro serviced 5.5 million vehicles in 2015 and posted record sales of $894.4 million, record net income of $61.7 million, and earnings of $1.94 per share.[1] The company operates under several regional brands, most acquired in the past 15 years, including: Monro Muffler Brake & Service, Mr. Tire Auto Service Centers, Tread Quarters Discount Tire Auto Service Centers, Autotire Car Care Centers, Ken Towery's Tire & AutoCare, Curry's Auto Service, The Tire Choice & Total Car Care, Tire Warehouse Tires for Less, and Tire Barn Warehouse.

In fiscal 2012, the company acquired eight local auto service and retail groups, including Tire Barn Warehouse, 31 stores in Indiana, Illinois and Tennessee, and Ken Towery's Tire & AutoCare, 27 stores in Kentucky and Indiana, two chains that Monro continues to manage under the local brand names. This is also true of Curry's Auto Service In Virginia and Maryland, a 10-store acquisition in fiscal 2013. That year, the company also purchased four S&S Firestone stores in Kentucky and six Carl King Tire Stores in Delaware and Maryland.
Monro entered three new states with major acquisitions in 2014: Michigan - Lentz USA/Kan Rock Tire, 19 stores; Florida - The Tire Choice & Total Car Care, 35 stores; Gold Coast Tire & Auto Centers, 9 stores; and Martino Tire, 8 stores; and, Georgia - Wood & Fullerton, 9 stores. The company operates its Florida stores under the Tire Choice brand.
In fiscal 2015, the company purchased the Car-X trade name and franchise rights to 146 locations in Illinois, Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota, and Texas. Since 2000, Monro has made more than 30 acquisitions totaling more than 500 stores and producing revenue of 650 million.
Under Monro's current CEO John Van Heel, the company continues to pursue a growth strategy of increased market share through incremental store sales, low-cost acquisitions, and strategic new store openings.
Monro serviced 5.5 million vehicles in 2015 and posted record sales of $894.4 million, record net income of $61.7 million, and earnings of $1.94 per share.[1] The company operates under several regional brands, most acquired in the past 15 years, including: Monro Muffler Brake & Service, Mr. Tire Auto Service Centers, Tread Quarters Discount Tire Auto Service Centers, Autotire Car Care Centers, Ken Towery's Tire & AutoCare, Curry's Auto Service, The Tire Choice & Total Car Care, Tire Warehouse Tires for Less, and Tire Barn Warehouse.

Company history[edit]
Early history[edit]
The company was founded by Charles J. August in 1957, originally as a franchise of another company, Midas Muffler.[3]
In the mid-1960s, "Chuck" August decided that his muffler shops should offer an expanded list of services. This was not in line with the other organization's wishes. In 1966, he discontinued his affiliation with Midas Muffler.[3] August launched a new muffler service company under the name Monro Muffler with his brother, Burton S. August, and Sheldon Lane. August named the new company after Monroe County, New York, but without the "e" at the end of the name.[2] August added brake services several years later and renamed the company, Monro Muffler Brake, Inc.[2]
Monro began a deliberate course of prudent expansion, arriving at 20 stores by 1977.[3] They had a warehouse on West Henrietta Road. By the end of 1979, they had about 43 stores in New York. From this warehouse, drivers would load the trucks and deliver to all the 43 stores throughout New York. Afterwards, a more aggressive expansion program was instituted when the company began to make a number of large acquisitions. By the mid-1980s, there were 59 stores which generated $21 million in sales annually.[2] Most of those locations were located in upstate New York.[2]
Expansion[edit]




Headquarters in Rochester, New York


In 1984, the company's founder, Charles J. August sold his controlling interest in Monro Muffler and Brake to a New York City-based investors group headed by Donald Glickman and Peter J. Solomon.[2][3] August remained on the company's board of directors until 2002.[3]
In 1991, Monro Muffler made its initial public offering.[3] Monro's stock began trading on NASDAQ under the symbol "MNRO".
Under the leadership of Robert G. Gross, who joined the company in 1998 as president and CEO and currently serves as executive chairman, Monro aggressively expanded outside of its traditional base in upstate New York.[3] In September 1998, the company successfully purchased all 205 Speedy Muffler King locations within the United States from Speedy Muffler King, Inc. of Toronto, Canada. In 2004, Monro purchased the 25 stores and 10 kiosks of Mr. Tire, a Baltimore, Maryland chain which trademarked “On the Rim and Out the Door” pricing. Later that year, Monro bought five Rice Tire locations and rebranded them as Mr. Tire Auto Service Centers. Monro now operates 132 Mr. Tire outlets.
In 2006, Monro obtained 75 ProCare shops from bankruptcy, converting 44 to Monro Muffler Brake & Service centers and 31 to Mr. Tire outlets. In fiscal 2010, the company purchased the 26 Autotire stores in Missouri and Illinois, its first venture into the mid-West, and the 41 Tire Warehouse Central stores in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Vermont and New Hampshire. Fiscal 2011 began with the acquisition of Import Export Tire Co., five retail tire and auto repair stores in the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania metro region, and Courthouse Tire, three tire and undercar care facilities in the Fredericksburg, Virginia area who's sales substantially declined after the acquisition.
In fiscal 2012, the company acquired eight local auto service and retail groups, including Tire Barn Warehouse, 31 stores in Indiana, Illinois and Tennessee, and Ken Towery's Tire & AutoCare, 27 stores in Kentucky and Indiana, two chains that Monro continues to manage under the local brand names. This is also true of Curry's Auto Service In Virginia and Maryland, a 10-store acquisition in fiscal 2013. That year, the company also purchased four S&S Firestone stores in Kentucky and six Carl King Tire Stores in Delaware and Maryland.
Monro entered three new states with major acquisitions in 2014: Michigan - Lentz USA/Kan Rock Tire, 19 stores; Florida - The Tire Choice & Total Car Care, 35 stores; Gold Coast Tire & Auto Centers, 9 stores; and Martino Tire, 8 stores; and, Georgia - Wood & Fullerton, 9 stores. The company operates its Florida stores under the Tire Choice brand.
In fiscal 2015, the company purchased the Car-X trade name and franchise rights to 146 locations in Illinois, Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota, and Texas. Since 2000, Monro has made more than 30 acquisitions totaling more than 500 stores and producing revenue of 650 million.
Under Monro's current CEO John Van Heel, the company continues to pursue a growth strategy of increased market share through incremental store sales, low-cost acquisitions, and strategic new store openings.
Monro serviced 5.5 million vehicles in 2015 and posted record sales of $894.4 million, record net income of $61.7 million, and earnings of $1.94 per share.[1] The company operates under several regional brands, most acquired in the past 15 years, including: Monro Muffler Brake & Service, Mr. Tire Auto Service Centers, Tread Quarters Discount Tire Auto Service Centers, Autotire Car Care Centers, Ken Towery's Tire & AutoCare, Curry's Auto Service, The Tire Choice & Total Car Care, Tire Warehouse Tires for Less, and Tire Barn Warehouse.
