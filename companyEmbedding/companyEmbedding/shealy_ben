Technologies That Make Your Job Easier
The  increasing complexity of today’s process automation systems and components requires professionals trained in the controls that govern those systems. At Shealy Electrical Wholesalers, our Automation Specialists are experts in finding solutions to your unique problem.
The Automation Department works in tandem with our sales staff and in-house specialists in switchgear, information technology and product customization to handle all aspects  of the automation project, from specification to start-up.
Making Technology Work
Shealy Electrical’s team of automation specialists works closely with you to understand your specific applications in order to create an effective solution. In addition, we have alliances with specialty subcontractors who work with us on specific assignments requiring highly sophisticated  programming or equipment assembly.
Power Monitoring Systems That Work
As energy costs have soared, Shealy Electrical customers are focusing more than ever on energy management in order to drive down operating costs without impacting process integrity or product/service quality. In response, Shealy Electrical’s automation specialists are providing  assistance in implementing or enhancing power monitoring systems that control demand loads and readjust usage patterns to achieve greater energy efficiency and lower costs.
Today, power monitoring systems allow you to identify, monitor and control power loads in real-time, down to a single machine process or building system. And, through  integration with various process controls, these systems enable you to pinpoint specific locations of inefficientpower use or potential mechanical problems.
Drawing upon the expertise of some of the most respected manufacturers in the business as well as their own experience, our specialists can develop integrated communication links between components, allowing real-time information to be compiled and distributed to any operating department  or accounting reporting system. We can also configure power monitoring software to read circuit monitors, facilitate  logging and harmonic analysis and drive a variety of  custom applications designed to control energy consumption.  Once the hardware and software are installed, we stay with you through the critical start-up to ensure that the systems work as well in the field as they do on paper.

A WHEE/TWR Level 1 Practitioner Certificate will be presented to participants who complete both days’ training. Participation in day 1 alone is acceptable but will not qualify for a certificate. treatment;4.WHEE routinely teaches the installation of positive cognitions and feelings to replace whatever has been released; and5. WHEE teaches awareness and healing of body, emotions, mind, relationships (with other people and environment) and spirit – all of which can contribute to greater understanding, as well as faster and deeper clearing of symptoms related to the trauma. 
The uses of EP in the context of 2-chair dialogue with the body symptoms will also be explored in this workshop. With these approaches, body symptoms become invitations and doorways into wholistic transformation and deep healings. Trauma often ‘speaks’ through physical symptoms such as pain, weakness, hypertension, gastrointestinal symptoms, obesity, etc. CAM methods, as commonly used, can reduce or eliminate symptoms but may miss important underlying trauma issues.This workshop will enable you to identify and interpret trauma messages, and to clear and transform them into deeply healing experiences.

A WHEE/TWR Level 1 Practitioner Certificate will be presented to participants who complete both days’ training. Participation in day 1 alone is acceptable but will not qualify for a certificate.
