Separate Accounts

Last Updated 7/11/17
A “separate account” is a fund held by a life insurance  company that   is maintained separately from the insurer's general assets.  Separate   accounts were originally established in response to federal securities    laws for investment-linked variable annuities.   Although it took many years, the  application of separate accounts has   dramatically expanded beyond this simple  product design. Product   development has resulted with an array of “hybrid”  products—products   that overlay traditional insurance company guarantees (e.g.,  mortality,   morbidity, etc.) being allocated to the separate account investment    portfolio.
The use of separate accounts by insurers has evolved rapidly  over the   past 20 years. In response to recommendations to clarify information    pertaining to separate account products, and related separate account   assets,  detailed information is available in the statutory financial   statements:

Distinct filings for       separate products that are   “insulated” or “not insulated” from the general       account creditors.   When completing the insulated separate account filing,       the   reporting entity is only to include those assets that are legally         insulated by state law or statute, in which the state law provides legal         protection to the separate account contract holder from the   general       account liabilities. 
Detailed information on       the characteristics of   separate account assets, specifically categorizing       separate   account assets in accordance with the following characteristics: 
          
Identification of        separate account assets   legally insulated and those which are not legally        insulated.   Identification is also required for all separate account        assets   not reported at fair value, and the measurement basis used for          those separate account assets. 
Amount of separate        account assets that   represent seed money, other fees and expenses due to        the general   account and additional required surplus amounts. (Additional          required surplus is defined as additional or permanent surplus that is          required to be retained in the separate account in accordance with   state        law or regulations.) Information is reported on any   current year        transfers to the separate account for seed money, as   well as the duration        in which seed money, other fees and   expenses, and additional required        surplus amounts due to the   general account have been held in the separate        account. 
Identification of        separate account assets in   which the investment directive is not        determined by the contract   holder. Situations in which the investment        directive is not   determined by the contract holder also require        disclosure on   whether the investments, if included in the general        account,   would have resulted with the reporting entity exceeding any          general account investment limitations. 
Identification of        separate account assets in   which less than 100% of investment proceeds        are attributed to the   contract holder. This also includes identification        of the   separate account investment income attributed to the reporting          entity during the reporting period, and whether the income was          transferred to the general account or reinvested within the separate          account. 
Identification of all        products reported as a   separate account product under statutory        accounting principles,   and whether the product was classified differently        under U.S.   GAAP. For products with different classifications between          statutory accounting and U.S. GAAP, identification of the   characteristics        that resulted with a different classification   under U.S. GAAP.


Information on separate account products with general    accounting guarantees, including the amount of guarantees paid by the   general  account for the current reporting year, and for the previous   four reporting  years. This information also details the risk charges   paid from the separate  account to the general account related to these   guarantees, and whether the  risk charges are reviewed and opined upon.

Separate Account

What is a 'Separate Account'
A separate account is a privately managed investment account opened through a brokerage or financial advisor that uses pooled money to buy individual assets. 2. In the context of variable annuities, these are payments made to an insurance company for the purpose of investing in securities. These securities are kept separate from the insurer's general investments. 

BREAKING DOWN 'Separate Account'
1. This differs from a mutual fund because the investor directly owns the securities instead of owning a share in a pool of securities. Most separate accounts require a minimum investment of $100,000 or more.

             AMENDMENT NO. 1 TO DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT

The DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT ("Agreement") by and between COMMONWEALTH ANNUITY AND
LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY ("Insurer"), for itself and on behalf of each of its     
Separate Accounts, and SECURITY DISTRIBUTORS, INC. ("SDI"), dated November 21,
2006, is hereby amended as follows:                                             

WHEREAS, pursuant to the Agreement, SDI serves as principal underwriter of the  
Contracts issued by Insurer and listed on Schedule 2 of the Agreement; and      

WHEREAS, Insurer wishes to have its affiliate, Epoch Securities, Inc. ("Epoch"),
a broker-dealer registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission, become  
principal underwriter for certain of the Contracts.                             

1. The parties agree that from and after the effective date of this Amendment   
No. 1, SDI shall no longer be the principal underwriter for the Contracts       
("Removed Insurance Contracts") set forth in Schedule 3, attached hereto.       

2. Insurer represents and warrants that, as of the effective date of this       
Amendment No. 1, it has entered into a distribution agreement with Epoch with   
respect to the Removed Insurance Contracts set forth in Schedule 3.             

3. Schedule 1 and Schedule 2 of the Agreement are hereby deleted in their       
entirety and replaced with the Schedule 1 and Schedule 2, respectively, attached
hereto.                                                                         

4. All other terms and provisions of the Agreement not amended herein shall     
remain in full force and effect.                                                

5. This Amendment No. 1 is effective as of January 22, 2008.
