Neovasc Inc. | Neovasc Tiara - Neovasc Inc.





































































Neovasc Tiara


Tiara is a novel transcatheter device designed to treat mitral regurgitation (MR), a condition that is often severe and can lead to heart failure and death.


Neovasc is developing the Tiara for the treatment of severe MR, a condition that affects approximately four million patients in the U.S. alone. Currently, conventional surgical treatments are only appropriate for about 20% of these patients, leaving the majority of patients untreated.
The Tiara device is delivered through the apex of the heart to replace the mitral valve while preserving the integrity of the surrounding structures of the heart.


This is an investigational device only at this time and is not for sale in any geography.







Tiara has been designed specifically to address each of the challenges listed below and meet the need for transcatheter replacement of the mitral valve, rather than being adapted from an aortic valve. Tiara implantation is achieved through a transapical approach and does not require any hemodynamic support.





We invite you to register for Neovasc news alerts to be apprised of Tiara updates as we move through the development program.







Challenges to treatment of the mitral valve include:
Complex geometry of the mitral apparatus
Changes of the mitral apparatus throughout the cardiac cycle
Maintaining continuity with the sub valvular structures
Native D shape of the mitral valve


Proximity to the aortic valve and potential for Left Ventricular Outflow Tract (LVOT) obstruction
Large size of the mitral valve - larger crossing profile
High closing pressures
Left ventricular remodelling

Clinical Reports: COSIRA Clinical Study


The COSIRA (COronary SInus Reducer for Treatment of Refractory Angina) trial: a prospective, multicenter, sham-controlled, randomized, double-blinded study assessing the safety and efficacy of the Reducer in 104 patients in Europe and Canada.


Trial Highlights: The COSIRA data demonstrated that patients treated with the Reducer achieved a statistically significant improvement in the Canadian Cardiovascular Society (“CCS”) angina grading scale scores (two classes or better) compared to those patients in the sham control arm, (p-value = 0.024). Patients treated with the Reducer were 2.3 times more likely to see an improvement of two classes or better in CCS score than the sham control arm. The analysis also demonstrated that patients treated with the Reducer showed a statistically significant improvement of one or more CCS classes compared to the sham control patients (p-value = 0.003). The study also demonstrated a 96.2% technical success rate and a 100% procedural success rate for Reducer implantation.
The final results from the COSIRA study were published in the New England Journal of Medicine. To obtain copies from the publisher click here.

Neovasc Inc. Key Developments

Neovasc Inc. Announces German Court Ruling
Jun 16 17
Neovasc Inc. reported that the District Court in Munich, Germany has partially found in favour of Edwards Lifesciences Corporation, in its case against Neovasc. In this case, CardiAQ had claimed ownership rights to one of Neovasc's European patent applications for its Tiara™ mitral valve replacement technology. The German court found CardiAQ had contributed in part to the invention of the Tiara(TM) and awarded to CardiAQ co-entitlement rights to the disputed Tiara(TM) European patent application. There are no monetary awards associated with this matter. Neovasc intends to appeal this decision. In a related matter, Neovasc is currently appealing the 2016 decision from the U.S District Court for the District of Massachusetts which among other things granted co-inventorship rights to CardiAQ on one of Neovasc's granted U.S. patent applications. This appeal is now before the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington D.C. An expedited appeal schedule has been set with all the briefings from both parties now submitted. The Company expects oral argument on its appeal in August 2017 and a ruling is expected to follow, prior to the end of 2017. Pending the outcome of the U.S. Court of Appeals, Neovasc, in consultation with its European and North American legal advisors, will vigorously defend its position that the case in Germany is without merit and will explore all options regarding the appellate process.

Neovasc Inc. Announces Unaudited Consolidated Earnings Results for the First Quarter Ended March 31, 2017
May 10 17
Neovasc Inc. announced unaudited consolidated earnings results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017. The company's revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2017 were $1,481,360 compared to revenues of $2,006,742 for the same period in 2016, a decrease of 26%. Operating loss was $7,816,672 compared with $9,513,941 a year ago. Loss before tax was $7,788,373 compared with $10,832,964 a year ago. Loss for the period was $7,844,987 compared with $10,881,138 a year ago. Loss and comprehensive loss for the period was $7,927,304 compared with $7,591,702 a year ago. Basic and diluted loss per share was $0.10 compared with $0.16 a year ago. Net cash applied to operating activities was $6,308,755 compared with $10,903,712 a year ago. Purchase of property, plant and equipment was $275,226 compared with $305,585 a year ago. The $1,697,269 decrease in the operating loss incurred for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 can be substantially explained by a $2,578,692 decrease in general and administrative expenses (of which $3,164,430 was a decrease in litigation expense and $462,676 was an increase in stock-based compensation charges) offset by a $970,736 in crease in product development and clinical trial expenses.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity.

Equity TypeORD


Neovasc Inc. (Neovasc) is a specialty medical device company. The Company develops, manufactures and markets products for the cardiovascular marketplace. The Company's segment is the development, manufacture and marketing of medical devices. Its products include the Tiara technology in development for the transcatheter treatment of mitral valve disease, the Neovasc Reducer for the treatment of refractory angina, and tissue products. The Tiara is in preclinical/early clinical stage development to provide a minimally invasive transcatheter device for patients experiencing mitral regurgitation (MR) as a result of mitral heart valve disease. The Reducer is an hourglass-shaped, balloon-expandable, stainless steel, bare metal device, which is implanted in the coronary sinus, creating a restriction in venous outflow from the myocardium (the muscular layer of the heart wall). Neovasc produces Peripatch, a biological tissue product that is manufactured from pericardium.

Comment Guidelines
 

        Comment Guidelines        


We encourage you to use comments to engage with users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other. However, in order to maintain the high level of discourse we’ve all come to value and expect, please keep the following criteria in mind: 

Enrich the conversation
Stay focused and on track. Only post material that’s relevant to the topic being discussed.
Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically.
 Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases.
NOTE: Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed
Avoid profanity, slander or personal attacks directed at an author or another user.
Don’t Monopolize the Conversation. We appreciate passion and conviction, but we also believe strongly in giving everyone a chance to air their thoughts. Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse.
Only English comments will be allowed.

Perpetrators of spam or abuse will be deleted from the site and prohibited from future registration at Investing.com’s discretion. 
I have read Investing.com's comments guidelines and agree to the terms described.

I Agree

Neovasc Inc. (Neovasc) is a specialty medical device company. The Company develops, manufactures and markets products for the cardiovascular marketplace. The Company's segment is the development, manufacture and marketing of medical devices. Its products include the Tiara technology in development for the transcatheter treatment of mitral valve disease, the Neovasc Reducer for the treatment of refractory angina, and tissue products. The Tiara is in preclinical/early clinical stage development to provide a minimally invasive transcatheter device for patients experiencing mitral regurgitation (MR) as a result of mitral heart valve disease. The Reducer is an hourglass-shaped, balloon-expandable, stainless steel, bare metal device, which is implanted in the coronary sinus, creating a restriction in venous outflow from the myocardium (the muscular layer of the heart wall). Neovasc produces Peripatch, a biological tissue product that is manufactured from pericardium.

Comment Guidelines
 

        Comment Guidelines        


We encourage you to use comments to engage with users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other. However, in order to maintain the high level of discourse we’ve all come to value and expect, please keep the following criteria in mind: 

Enrich the conversation
Stay focused and on track. Only post material that’s relevant to the topic being discussed.
Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically.
 Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases.
NOTE: Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed
Avoid profanity, slander or personal attacks directed at an author or another user.
Don’t Monopolize the Conversation. We appreciate passion and conviction, but we also believe strongly in giving everyone a chance to air their thoughts. Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse.
Only English comments will be allowed.

Perpetrators of spam or abuse will be deleted from the site and prohibited from future registration at Investing.com’s discretion. 
I have read Investing.com's comments guidelines and agree to the terms described.

I Agree
