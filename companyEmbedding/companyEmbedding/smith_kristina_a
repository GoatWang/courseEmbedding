Kristina A Smith's Experience
Title: Project Manager
               Company: Wallbuilders LLC
Job Details
               WallBuilders is an organization dedicated to presenting America's forgotten history and heroes, with an emphasis on the moral, religious, and constitutional foundation on which America was built. In the Old Testament book of Nehemiah, the nation of Israel rallied together in a grassroots movement to help rebuild the walls of Jerusalem and thus restore stability, safety, and a promising future to that great city. "Rebuilding the walls" represents allegorically the call for citizen involvement in rebuilding our nation's foundations. WallBuilders' goal is to exert a direct and positive influence in government, education, and the family by (1) educating the nation concerning the Godly foundation of our country; (2) providing information to federal, state, and local officials as they develop public policies which reflect Biblical values; and (3) encouraging Christians to be involved in the civic arena. WallBuilders has educated, equipped, and inspired millions of Americans to take action. Millions of WallBuilders books, tapes, CD's, and video programs have been distributed throughout the Nation. Millions more Americans have been reached through live presentations and radio and television appearances.
