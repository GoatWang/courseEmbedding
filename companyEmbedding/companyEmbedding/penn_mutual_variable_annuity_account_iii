Participation and Protection: With No Annual Fees




When planning for retirement, you can’t risk everything and you can’t protect everything.
But there is a way to have some of both.










A Shield Annuity from Brighthouse Financial can help you use a portion of your assets to take advantage of market
            growth with a level of downside protection that other options may not provide. Shield is designed to provide
            some protection in an unpredictable endeavor — investing.





Protect your retirement assets
A Brighthouse Shield Annuity is designed to provide a level of protection that, when markets inevitably turn volatile,
            ensures your losses are limited.



Participate in growth opportunities
With a Shield Annuity, balance is built-in. This means that even with the protection you enjoy, you can still take
            advantage of growth opportunities in the market up to a certain percentage.



Pay no annual fees
Unlike many financial products, you pay no annual fees with a Shield Annuity.

                                            Your Retirement Big Picture: Where Do Annuities Fit?

1 Guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.
2 Shield annuities do not invest directly in any index.
3 Product guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company and are solely the responsibility of the issuing insurance company. Annuities and life insurance are issued by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company, Charlotte, NC 28277 and in New York, only by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY, New York, NY 10017 and not by MetLife.
If you're buying an annuity to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. That's because tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the annuity. References throughout this material to tax advantage, such as tax deferral and tax-free transfers, are subject to this consideration. In addition, non-qualified annuity contracts owned by corporations do not receive tax deferral on earnings. 

Prospectuses for variable annuities issued by a Brighthouse Financial insurance company, and for the investment portfolios offered thereunder, are available from Brighthouse Financial. The contract prospectus contains information about the contract's features, risks, charges and expenses. The investment objectives, risks and policies of the investment options, as well as other information about the investment options, are described in their respective prospectuses. Please read the prospectuses and consider this information carefully before investing. There is no guarantee that any of the variable investment options in a variable annuity product will meet their stated goals or objectives. The account value is subject to market fluctuations and investment risk so that, when withdrawn, it may be worth more or less than its original value even when an optional protection benefit rider is elected. Product availability and features may vary by state. Please refer to the contract prospectus for more complete details regarding the living and death benefits.

Annuities are long-term investments designed for retirement purposes. Brighthouse Financial annuities have limitations, exclusions, charges, termination provisions and terms for keeping them in force. All contract guarantees, including optional living and death benefit riders and annuity payout rates, are backed by the claims-paying ability and financial strength of issuing insurance company. They are not backed by the broker/dealer from which an annuity is purchased, by the insurance agency where an annuity is purchased, or any affiliates to those entities, and none makes any representations or guarantees regarding the claims-paying ability and financial strength of the issuing insurance company. Similarity, the issuing insurance company and the underwriter do not back the financial strength of the broker/dealer or its affiliates. Please contact your financial professional for complete details. 

Withdrawals of taxable amounts are subject to ordinary income tax and if made before age 59½, may be subject to a 10% federal income tax penalty. Some broker/dealers and financial professionals may refer to the 10% federal income tax penalty as an "additional tax" or "additional income tax" or use the terms interchangeably when discussing withdrawals taken prior to age 59½. Distributions of taxable amounts from a non-qualified annuity may also be subject to the 3.8% Unearned Income Medicare Contribution Tax on Net Investment Income if your modified adjusted gross income exceeds the applicable threshold amount. Withdrawals will reduce the living and death benefits and account value. Withdrawals may be subject to withdrawal charges. 

Any discussion of taxes is for general informational purposes only, does not purport to be complete or cover every situation, and should not be construed as legal, tax, or accounting advice. You should confer with your qualified legal, tax, and accounting advisors as appropriate.

Brighthouse Financial, an operating segment of MetLife, Inc. (NYSE: MET), announced on March 6, 2017 that it is now offering its suite of life insurance and annuity products under the Brighthouse Financial brand. 
*Data as of March 31, 2017. Total assets includes certain adjustments for transactions associated with the separation from MetLife, Inc.

A.M. Best’s Financial Strength Rating is an independent opinion of an insurer’s financial strength and ability to meet its ongoing insurance policy and contract obligations. A Financial Strength Rating is not assigned to specific insurance policies or contracts and does not address any other risk, including, but not limited to, an insurer’s claims-payment policies or procedures; the ability of the insurer to dispute or deny claims payment on grounds of misrepresentation or fraud; or any specific liability contractually borne by the policy or contract holder. A Financial Strength Rating is not a recommendation to purchase, hold, or terminate any insurance policy, contract or any other financial obligation issued by an insurer, nor does it address the suitability of any particular policy or contract, for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.ambest.com.
Fitch’s Insurer Financial Strength Rating provides an assessment of the financial strength of an insurance organization. The Insurer Financial Strength Rating is assigned to the insurance company’s policyholder obligations, including assumed reinsurance obligations and contract holder obligations, such as guaranteed investment contracts. Ratings explanations can be found at www.fitchratings.com.
Moody’s Insurance Financial Strength Rating is an opinion of the ability of an insurance company to pay punctually senior policyholder claims and obligations and also reflect the expected financial loss suffered in the event of default. Specific obligations are considered unrated unless they are individually rated because the standing of a particular insurance obligation would depend on an assessment of its relative standing under those laws governing both the obligation and the insurance company. Ratings explanations can be found at www.moodys.com.
S&P Global Insurer Financial Strength Rating is a forward-looking opinion about the financial security characteristics of an insurance organization with respect to its ability to pay under its insurance policies and contracts in accordance with their terms. This opinion is not specific to any particular policy or contract, nor does it address the suitability of a particular policy or contract for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.standardandpoors.com.

Start Preamble
        
        
        
        July 2, 2008. 
        
          AGENCY:

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee from the SEC's Public Reference Branch, 100 F Street, NE., Room 1580, Washington, DC 20549 (tel. (202) 551-8090). 
Applicants' Representations 
1. Penn Mutual is a mutual life insurance company organized in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and originally chartered in 1847. Penn Mutual is a diversified financial services company providing life insurance, annuities, disability income insurance, long-term care insurance, structured settlements, retirement and other products to individual and institutional customers. 
2. Penn Mutual established Variable Annuity Account III on April 13, 1982. Variable Annuity Account III is registered under the 1940 Act as a unit investment trust and is used to fund variable annuity contracts issued by Penn Mutual. Ten variable annuity contracts funded by Variable Annuity Account III are affected by the application. 
3. Penn Mutual established Variable Life Account I on January 27, 1987. Variable Life Account I is registered under the 1940 Act as a unit investment trust and is used to fund variable life insurance contracts issued by Penn Mutual. Eight variable life insurance contracts funded by Variable Life Account I are affected by the application. 
4. PIA is a Delaware stock life insurance company. It is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Penn Mutual. PIA established Variable Annuity Account I on July 13, 1994. Variable Annuity Account I is registered under the 1940 Act as a unit investment trust and is used to fund variable annuity contracts issued by PIA. One variable annuity contract funded by Variable Annuity Account I is affected by the application. 
5. Penn Series is registered under the 1940 Act as an open-end management investment company that offers shares of diversified portfolios (each, a “Fund,” and collectively, the “Funds”) for variable annuity and variable life insurance contracts (each, a “Contract,” and collectively, the “Contracts”) issued by Penn Mutual and its subsidiary, PIA. Each of Penn Series” twenty-nine separate Funds is a no-load mutual fund. Shares of each Fund may be purchased only by insurance companies for the purpose of funding variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies and by qualified pension plans. Penn Series was established as a Maryland corporation pursuant to Articles of Incorporation dated April 21, 1982. Independence Capital Management, Inc. (“ICMI”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Penn Mutual, is a registered investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, and provides investment management services to each of the Funds. ICMI performs the day-to-day investment management services for nine of the Funds while the other twenty have sub-advisers. Penn Series and ICMI have “manager of managers” exemptive relief which permits one or more of the sub-advisers to be replaced without a vote of contract owners (the “Contract Owners”).[1] 
           Penn Mutual provides administrative and corporate services to Penn Series pursuant to an Administrative and Corporate Services Agreement and receives a fee from Penn Series for those services. 
6. Purchase payments under the Contracts may be allocated to one or more sub-accounts of the Separate Accounts (the “Sub-Accounts”). Income, gains and losses, whether or not realized, from assets allocated to the Separate Accounts are, as provided in the Contracts, credited to or charged against the Separate Accounts without regard to other income, gains or losses of Penn Mutual or PIA, as applicable. The assets maintained in the Separate Accounts will not be charged with any liabilities arising out of any other business conducted by Penn Mutual or PIA, as applicable. Nevertheless, all obligations arising under the Contracts, including the commitment to make annuity payments or death benefit payments, are general corporate obligations of Penn Mutual or PIA. Accordingly, all of the assets of Penn Mutual and PIA are available to meet their respective obligations under the Contracts. 
7. Each of the Contracts permits allocations of accumulation value to available Sub-Accounts that invest in specific investment portfolios of underlying registered investment companies (the “Mutual Funds”). The Section 26 Applicants note that after the Substitutions, all of the Mutual Funds available under the Contracts will be Funds of Penn Series. Among the currently available Mutual Funds are portfolios of Neuberger Berman Advisers Management Trust, Fidelity Investments' Variable Insurance Products Fund, Fidelity Investments' Variable Insurance Products Fund V, Van Kampen's The Universal Institutional Funds, Inc., and Penn Series. All of these companies are registered under the 1940 Act as open-end management investment companies. 
8. Each of the Contracts permits transfers of accumulation value from one Sub-Account to another Sub-Account at any time subject to certain restrictions. No sales charge applies to such a transfer of accumulation value among Sub-Accounts. Pursuant to the approval of the Commission and the insurance department of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, each of the Contracts reserves the right, upon notice to Contract Owners, to substitute shares of another mutual fund for shares of a Mutual Fund held by a Sub-Account. 
9. The Section 26 Applicants propose the Substitutions to increase the level of fund management responsiveness compared to the current structure, which includes three unaffiliated investment company complexes. Currently, the Separate Accounts invest Start Printed Page 39343in unaffiliated investment companies and changes due to investment performance, style drift, or management practice issues require substantial systems, filing, and printing resources, which slows the process to make changes, if necessary. Assuming Contract Owner approval, as discussed below, and because Penn Series and ICMI have “manager of managers” exemptive relief, the Section 26 Applicants assert that ICMI, as investment adviser, will be able to act more quickly and efficiently to protect Contract Owners' interests if the investment strategy, management team or performance of one or more of the sub-advisers does not meet expectations. The Replaced Funds (as defined herein) do not have such relief. In this regard, the Section 26 Applicants agree not to change the corresponding Replacement Fund's sub-adviser (with the exception of the Balanced Fund, which does not have a sub-adviser) without first obtaining Contract Owner approval at a meeting whose record date is after the Substitution is effective, of either (a) the sub-adviser change or (b) the ability of Penn Series and ICMI to rely on the manager-of-managers relief associated with the Replacement Fund.
10. The Replaced Funds involved in the Substitutions include five separate portfolios representing three investment company complexes. Currently there are 21 Mutual Funds offered under each Contract, and after the Substitutions, there will be 29 Mutual Funds offered under each Contract, all of which will be portfolios of Penn Series.[2] 
           The investment objective and policies of each Replacement Fund will be the same as or substantially similar to the investment objective and policies of the corresponding Replaced Fund. Another benefit of the Substitutions is that relieving the Separate Accounts of the administrative burdens of interfacing with three unaffiliated investment company complexes is expected to simplify compliance, accounting and auditing and, generally, to allow Penn Mutual to administer the Contracts more efficiently. 
11. The Substitutions will consist of the proposed substitutions of shares of the following Removed Portfolios with shares of the corresponding Replacement Portfolios: 
(1) Shares of the Fidelity Investments' Variable Insurance Products Fund Equity-Income Portfolio will be replaced with shares of the Penn Series Large Core Value Fund, which has the substantially similar investment objective of total return by investing at least 80% of its net assets in securities of large capitalization companies. 
(2) Shares of the Fidelity Investments' Variable Insurance Products Fund Growth Portfolio will be replaced with shares of the Penn Series Large Core Growth Fund, which has a substantially similar investment objective of capital appreciation by investing in common and preferred stocks of large capitalization U.S. companies. 
(3) Shares of the Fidelity Investments' Variable Insurance Products Fund V Asset Manager Portfolio will be replaced with shares of the Penn Series Balanced Fund, which has the substantially similar investment objective of seeking long term growth and current income by utilizing a “fund of funds” strategy. 
(4) Shares of the Neuberger Berman Advisers Management Trust Balanced Portfolio will be replaced with shares of the Penn Series Balanced Fund, which has the substantially similar investment objective of seeking long term growth and current income by utilizing a “fund of funds” strategy. 
(5) Shares of Van Kampen's The Universal Institutional Funds, Inc. Emerging Markets Equity Portfolio will be replaced with shares of the Penn Series Emerging Markets Equity Fund, which has the same investment objective of capital appreciation by investing primarily in equity securities of issuers in emerging market countries.

Allocates the fund's assets among stocks, bonds, and short-term and money market instruments. Maintains a neutral mix over time of 50% of assets in stocks, 40% of assets in bonds, and 10% of assets in short-term and money market instruments. Adjusts allocation among asset classes gradually within the following ranges: stock class (30%-70%), bond class (20%-60%), and short-term/money market class (0%-50%). Invests in domestic and foreign issuers. Analyzes an issuer using fundamental and/or quantitative factors and evaluating each security's current price relative to estimated long-term value to select investments.Seeks long-term growth and current income using a “fund-of-funds” strategy. The Fund invests in a combination of other Penn Series Funds (each, an “underlying fund” and, together, the “underlying funds”) in accordance with its target asset allocation. These underlying funds invest their assets directly in equity, fixed income, money market and other securities in accordance with their own investment objectives and policies. The underlying funds are managed using both indexed and active management strategies. The Fund intends to invest primarily in a combination of underlying funds; however, the Fund may invest directly in equity and fixed income securities and cash equivalents, including money market securities. Under normal circumstances, the Fund will invest 50%-70% of its assets in stock and other equity underlying funds, 30%-50% of its assets in bond and other fixed income funds, and 0%-20% of its assets in money market funds. The Fund's allocation strategy is designed to provide a mix of the growth opportunities of stock investing with the income opportunities of bonds and other fixed income securities. The Fund's underlying equity fund allocation will primarily track the performance of the large capitalization company portion of the U.S. stock market. The Fund's underlying fixed income fund allocation will be invested primarily in a broad range of investment grade fixed income securities (although up to 10% of the underlying fund may be invested in non-investment grade securities), and is intended to provide results consistent with the broad U.S. fixed income market.Principal Risks• Stock Market Volatility  • Interest Rate Changes

13. The Section 26 Applicants represent that the Substitutions will take place at the Replaced Funds' relative net asset values determined on the date of the Substitutions in accordance with Section 22 of the 1940 Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder with no change in the total value of amounts held under a Contract for a Contract Owner in all Sub-Accounts of the Separate Account (the “Account Value”) or death benefit or in the dollar value of his or her investment in any of the Sub-Accounts. Accordingly, there will be no financial impact on any Contract Owner. The Substitutions will generally be effected by having each of the Sub-Accounts that invests in the Replaced Funds redeem its shares at the net asset value calculated on the date of the Substitutions and purchase shares of the respective Replacement Funds at the net asset value calculated on the same date. 
14. Alternatively, a Replaced Fund may redeem the interest “in-kind,” for example, if it determines that a cash redemption might adversely affect its shareholders. In that case, the Substitutions will be effected by the Sub-Account contributing all the securities it receives from the Replaced Fund for an amount of Replacement Fund shares equal to the fair market value of the securities contributed. All in-kind redemptions from a Replaced Fund of which any of the Section 26 Applicants is an affiliated person will be effected in accordance with the conditions set forth in the Commission's no-action letter issued to Signature Financial Group, Inc. (available December 28, 1999). In-kind purchases of shares of a Replacement Fund will be conducted as described in Section VI of the application. 
15. The Section 26 Applicants state that the Substitutions will be described in a supplement to the prospectuses for the Contracts (“Supplements”) filed with the Commission and mailed to Contract Owners. The Supplements will provide Contract Owners with notice of the Substitutions and describe the reasons for engaging in the Substitutions. The Supplements will also inform Contract Owners with assets allocated to a Sub-Account investing in the Replaced Funds that no additional amount may be invested in the Replaced Start Printed Page 39348Funds on or after the date of the Substitutions. In addition, the Supplements will inform affected Contract Owners that they will have the opportunity to reallocate Account Value once (as described below): 

Prior to the Substitutions, from each Sub-Account investing in a Replaced Fund, and 
for 30 days after the Substitutions, from each Sub-Account investing in a Replacement Fund to Sub-Accounts investing in other Mutual Funds available under the respective Contracts, 

without diminishing the number of free transfers that may be made in a given contract year and without the imposition of any transfer charge or limitations, other than any applicable limitations in place to deter potentially harmful excessive trading or limitations on the number of transfers to or from the fixed accounts available with the variable annuity contracts. To the extent a Contract Owner has Account Value allocated to more than one Sub-Account investing in a Replaced Fund, the Contract Owner will be permitted one reallocation from each Sub-Account. If a Contract Owner reallocates on the same day from all affected Sub-Accounts to which the Contract Owner has Account Value allocated, they will have exhausted the number of permitted reallocations. 
16. Within five days after a Substitution, Penn Mutual and PIA will send their affected Contract Owners written confirmation that a Substitution has occurred. The prospectuses for the Contracts, as revised by the Supplements, will reflect the Substitutions. Each Contract Owner will be provided with a prospectus for the Replacement Funds before the Substitutions. 
17. Penn Mutual and PIA assert that they will pay all expenses and transaction costs of the Substitutions, including all legal, accounting and brokerage expenses relating to the Substitutions. No costs will be borne by Contract Owners. Affected Contract Owners will not incur any fees or charges as a result of the Substitutions, nor will their rights or the obligations of the Section 26 Applicants under the Contracts be altered in any way. The Substitutions will not cause the fees and charges under the Contracts currently being paid by Contract Owners to be greater after the Substitutions than before the Substitutions. The Substitutions will have no adverse tax consequences on Contract Owners and will in no way alter the tax benefits to Contract Owners. Further, the Substitutions will in no way alter any of the life insurance or annuity benefits available to Contract Owners under the Contracts. 
18. The Section 26 Applicants believe that their request satisfies the standards for relief pursuant to Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act, as set forth below, because the affected Contract Owners will have: 
(1) Account Value allocated to a Sub-Account invested in a Replacement Fund with an investment objective and policies that are the same or substantially similar to the investment objective and policies of the Replaced Fund; and 
(2) Replacement Funds whose current total annual expenses are equal to or lower than those of the Replaced Funds for their 2007 fiscal year. In addition, the Section 26 Applicants represent that with respect to Contract Owners on the date of the proposed Substitutions, Penn Mutual and PIA, as applicable, will reimburse, on the last business day of each fiscal quarter during the two years following the date of the proposed Substitutions, the Sub-Accounts investing in the applicable Replacement Fund such that the sum of the Replacements Fund's net operating expense ratio (taking into account any expense waivers or reimbursements) and Sub-Account expense ratio (asset-based fees and charges deducted on a daily basis from Sub-Account assets and reflected in the calculation of Sub-Account unit value) for such period will not exceed, on an annualized basis, the sum of the corresponding Replaced Fund's net operating expense ratio (taking into account any expense waivers or reimbursements) and Sub-Account expense ratio for fiscal year 2007. 
Applicants' Legal Analysis 
15. Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act makes it unlawful for any depositor or trustee of a registered unit investment trust holding the security of a single issuer to substitute another security for such security unless the Commission approves the substitution. The Commission will approve such a substitution if the evidence establishes that it is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act. 
2. The Section 26 Applicants assert that the purposes, terms and conditions of the Substitutions are consistent with the principles and purposes of Section 26(c) and do not entail any of the abuses that Section 26(c) is designed to prevent. The Section 26 Applicants have reserved the right to make such a substitution under the Contracts and this reserved right is disclosed in each Contract's prospectus. 
3. The Section 26 Applicants argue that substitutions have been common where the substituted fund has investment objectives and policies that are similar to those of the eliminated fund, and current expenses that are similar to or lower than those of the eliminated fund. The Section 26 Applicants note that in all cases, the investment objectives and policies of the Replacement Funds are sufficiently similar to those of the corresponding Replaced Funds that affected Contract Owners will have reasonable continuity in investment expectations. Accordingly, the Section 26 Applicants conclude that the Replacement Funds are appropriate investment vehicles for those affected Contract Owners who have Account Value allocated to the Replaced Funds. 
4. The Section 26 Applicants argue that because of the foregoing representations and conditions, the Substitutions will not result in the type of costly forced redemption that Section 26(c) was intended to guard against and are consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the 1940 Act. 
5. Section 17(a)(1) of the 1940 Act, in relevant part, prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company, or any affiliated person of such person, acting as principal, from knowingly selling any security or other property to that company. Section 17(a)(2) of the 1940 Act generally prohibits the persons described above, acting as principal, from knowingly purchasing any security or other property from the registered company. 
6. Section 17(b) of the 1940 Act provides that the Commission may, upon application, grant an order exempting any transaction from the prohibitions of Section 17(a) if the evidence establishes that: (1) The terms of the proposed transaction, including the consideration to be paid or received, are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned; (2) the proposed transaction is consistent with the policy of each registered investment company concerned, as recited in its registration statement and records filed under the 1940 Act; and (3) the proposed transaction is consistent with the general purposes of the 1940 Act. 
7. Accordingly, the Section 17 Applicants are seeking relief, to the extent necessary, from Section 17(a) for the in-kind purchases and sales of Replacement Fund Shares. 
8. The Section 17 Applicants submit that the terms of the proposed in-kind purchases of shares of the Replacement Funds by the Separate Accounts, Start Printed Page 39349including the consideration to be paid and received, as described in this Application, are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned. The Section 17 Applicants also submit that the proposed in-kind purchases by the Separate Accounts are consistent with the policies of Penn Mutual and PIA and the individual Replacement Funds. Finally, the Section 17 Applicants submit that the proposed Substitutions are consistent with the general purposes of the 1940 Act. 
9. To the extent that the Separate Accounts' in-kind purchases of Replacement Fund shares are deemed to involve principal transactions between entities which are affiliates of affiliates, the Section 17 Applicants maintain that the terms of the proposed in-kind purchase transactions, including the consideration to be paid and received by each Replacement Fund involved, are reasonable, fair and do not involve overreaching. In addition, although not applicable, the Section 17 Applicants represent that the in-kind transactions will conform with all of the conditions enumerated in Rule 17a-7, except that the consideration paid for the securities being purchased or sold may not be entirely cash. 
10. The proposed transactions will take place at relative net asset value in conformity with the requirements of Section 22(c) of the 1940 Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder with no change in the amount of any Contract Owner's Account Value or death benefit or in the dollar value of his or her investment in any Sub-Account. Contract Owners will not suffer any adverse tax consequences as a result of the Substitutions. The fees and charges under the Contracts will not increase because of the Substitutions. 
11. Even though they may not rely on Rule 17a-7, the Section 17 Applicants believe that the Rule's conditions outline the type of safeguards that result in transactions that are fair and reasonable to registered investment company participants and preclude overreaching. Nevertheless, the circumstances surrounding the proposed Substitutions will be such as to offer the same degree of protection to each Replacement Fund from overreaching that Rule 17a-7 provides to them generally in connection with their purchase and sale of securities under that Rule in the ordinary course of their business. In particular, Penn Mutual and PIA (or any of their affiliates) cannot effect the proposed transactions at a price that is disadvantageous to any of the Replacement Funds. Moreover, although the transactions may not be entirely for cash, the Section 17 Applicants assert that each will be effected based upon (1) the independent market price of the portfolio securities valued as specified in paragraph (b) of Rule 17a-7, and (2) the net asset value per share of each Replacement Fund involved valued in accordance with the procedures disclosed in its registration statement and as required by Rule 22c-1 under the 1940 Act. No brokerage commission, fee, or other remuneration will be paid to any party in connection with the proposed transactions. 
12. The Section 17 Applicants also argue that the sale of shares of Replacement Funds for investment securities, as contemplated by the proposed in-kind transactions, is consistent with the investment policy and restrictions of the Replacement Funds because (1) the shares are sold at their net asset value, and (2) the portfolio securities are of the type and quality that the Replacement Funds would each have acquired with the proceeds from share sales had the shares been sold for cash. To assure that the second of these conditions is met, the adviser or sub-adviser, as applicable of a Replacement Fund will undertake to examine the portfolio securities being offered to each Replacement Fund and accept only those securities as consideration for shares that it would have acquired for each such fund in a cash transaction. 
13. The Section 17 Applicants also assert that the proposed in-kind transactions are consistent with the general purposes of the 1940 Act as stated in the Findings and Declaration of Policy in Section 1 of the 1940 Act and do not present any of the conditions or abuses that the 1940 Act was designed to prevent. 
Conclusion: 
For the reasons set forth in the application, the Applicants each respectfully request that the Commission issue an order of approval pursuant to Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act and an order of exemption pursuant to Section 17(b) of the 1940 Act. 
For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority.

THE PENN MUTUAL LIFE INSURANCE
COMPANY
Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania 19172 Telephone (800) 523-0650
The Penn Mutual Life Insurance Company and its
subsidiary, The Penn Insurance and Annuity Company (collectively, �Penn Mutual�),
after a review of their variable insurance product lines, and in light of
current industry conditions and market trends, have determined to take steps to
enhance the investment options available to their Contract Owners.� Penn Mutual seeks to improve these investment
options by substituting four newly created portfolios (the �Replacement Funds�)
for five separate portfolios representing three unaffiliated investment company
complexes (the �Replaced Funds�).� This
proposed transaction is referred to as the Substitutions.� Penn Mutual has undertaken the Substitutions
because it believes they are in the best interests of Contract Owners.� Penn Mutual believes the new structure will
result in greater growth in the Replacement Funds than would have occurred in
the Replaced Funds, potentially resulting in economies of scale for Contract
Owners and increased portfolio management flexibility.
Penn Series Funds, Inc. (�Penn Series�), which
offers sixteen funds as investment options under Penn Mutual�s products, is
organizing the Replacement Funds for Penn Mutual�s products.� Penn Mutual serves as administrative and
corporate services agent for Penn Series.�
Independence Capital Management, Inc., an affiliate of Penn Mutual,
serves as investment adviser to Penn Series.�
The Replacement Funds will have investment objectives and policies
similar to the five Replaced Funds currently available to Contract Owners.
Subject to required action by the U. S. Securities
and Exchange Commission (the �SEC�), Penn Mutual intends to substitute the
Replacement Funds for the Replaced Funds.�
Penn Mutual anticipates that immediately following the Substitutions,
the expense ratios of the Replacement Funds will not be higher than those of
the Replaced Funds and that the expense ratios of certain of the Replacement
Funds may be lower than those of the corresponding Replaced Funds.� The proposed Substitutions, including the
names of the investment managers, are set forth in the following table.

�
Assuming
the requested SEC approval is granted, the Substitutions will be effected on a
date thereafter (the �Substitution Date�).�
After the Substitution Date, Contract Owners who have assets allocated
to the Replaced Funds will no longer be able to select a Replaced Fund(s) as an
investment option.� For Contract Owners
who have assets allocated to one or more of the Replaced Funds and have not
transferred out of the Replaced Funds by the Substitution Date, Penn Mutual
will automatically invest any monies in the Sub-Account in the relevant
Replacement Fund.� After the Substitution
Date, if you have not voluntarily transferred out of the Replaced Funds, you
will be sent a written confirmation statement and notice informing you that the
substitution into the relevant Replacement Fund has been carried out.
Without
diminishing the number of free transfers that may be made in a given contract
year and without the imposition of any transfer charge or limitation, other
than any applicable limitations in place to deter potentially harmful excessive
trading or disintermediation involving fixed accounts available with applicable
Contracts, Contract Owners will have the opportunity to reallocate their
account values once:
������������������ prior to the Substitutions, from each
Sub-Account investing in a Replaced Portfolio, and
������������������ for 30 days after the Substitutions,
from each Sub-Account investing in a Replacement Fund to Sub-Accounts investing
in other funds available under their respective Contracts.
Updated
information regarding the status of Penn Mutual�s application to the SEC for
approval of the proposed Substitutions will be provided to Contract Owners in
due course.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
The following is a summary of the Application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the Commission's Public Reference Branch, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549-0102 (tel. (202) 942-8090)).
Applicants' Representations
1. Penn Mutual is a mutual life insurance company organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1847. It provides life insurance, annuity and investment products. The principal offices of Penn Mutual are located at 600 Dresher Road, Horsham, Pennsylvania 19044. Penn Mutual is authorized to conduct life insurance and annuity business in all states of the United States and in the District of Columbia.
2. Variable Account III is a separate account of Penn Mutual, and serves as a funding entity for variable annuity contracts issued by Penn Mutual. Investments held in Variable Account III are segregated from all other assets of Penn Mutual for the purpose of funding variable annuity contracts. Variable Account III was established under the laws of Pennsylvania in 1982 and is registered with the Commission under the 1940 Act as a unit investment trust (File No. 811-03457).
3. Penn Mutual has filed a registration statement on Form N-4 under the 1940 Act and the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, to register interests in Variable Account III created pursuant to the Contracts File No. 333-39804).
4. Penn Insurance is a stock life insurance company organized under the laws of the State of Delaware, and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Penn Mutual. The principal offices of Penn Insurance are located at 600 Dresher Road, Horsham, Pennsylvania 19044. Penn Insurance is authorized to conduct life insurance and annuity business in most states of the United States and in the District of Columbia.
5. Hornor, Townsend & Kent, Inc. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Penn Mutual and serves as principal underwriter of the Contracts and other variable annuity contracts issued by Penn Mutual and Penn Insurance. HTK is registered with the Commission as a broker-dealer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and is a member of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.
6. The Contracts provide, among other features, for the accumulation of assets and the payment of an annuity over time, on both a variable basis and a fixed basis. The Contracts provide for payment of a death benefit to a beneficiary if the owner of the contract or the annuitant named in the contract dies during the accumulation phase of the contract. The Contracts are designed to give the owner flexibility in planning for retirement and in meeting other financial goals. Benefits of the Contracts include the manner in which investment earnings are taxed, the availability of multiple investment options, and the provision for annuity and death benefit guarantees. The Contracts provide various annuity benefits and payout options, as well as transfer privileges among investment options.
7. Penn Mutual imposes charges against the value of the Contracts allocated to subaccounts of Variable Account III. For Contracts with a Variable Account Value of $100,000 or less, an annual administration charge is made that is the lesser of $40 or 2% of the Variable Account Value. Accumulation units are used to pay this charge. A daily administration charge is made against the net asset value of the subaccounts that will not exceed an effective annual rate of 0.15%. A daily mortality and expense risk charge is made against the net asset value of the subaccounts that will not exceed an effective annual rate of 1.25%. The mortality and expense risk charge compensates Penn Mutual for the mortality-related guarantees it makes under the Contracts (i.e.,  the death benefit guarantee and the guarantee that the annuity factors will never be decreased if mortality experience is substantially different than that assumed in the Contracts), and for the risk that administration charges will be insufficient to cover administration expenses over the life of the Contracts issued by Penn Mutual. The mortality and expense risk charge is applied during both the accumulation phase and the annuity phase of the Contracts.
8. If a Contract Owner dies during the accumulation phase of the Contract, Penn Mutual will pay the designated beneficiary the value of the Contract. If the annuitant named in the Contract dies during the accumulation phase, Penn Mutual will pay the designated beneficiary the sum of the Contract's variable account death benefit and fixed account death benefit. The variable account death benefit is the greater of: (i) the value of the Contract invested in subaccounts of Variable Account III; or (ii) the amount of purchase payments made by the purchaser which were allocated to subaccounts and the amount of transfers made to subaccounts, less the amount of all withdrawals and transfers from the subaccounts. The Contract Owner may elect to purchase a guaranteed Start Printed Page 62405minimum rising floor death benefit as a rider to the Contract.
9. Full or partial withdrawals may be made at any time during the accumulation phase of the Contract. The amount available for withdrawal is based on the value of the Contract next determined after Penn Mutual receives the request for withdrawal.
10. No sales load is deducted from purchase payments before allocating them to subaccounts of Variable Account III. A sales charge may, however, be deducted from withdrawals under certain circumstances. If the Contract Owner makes a withdrawal and a purchase payment was made in any of the eight contract years prior to the date of the withdrawal, a sales charge may be deducted, subject to certain exceptions noted below. Amounts withdrawn are attributed in sequence to prior purchase payments starting with the first purchase payment. The table below shows the contingent deferred sales charge that may be deducted from withdrawals. The charge is made only against amounts equal to purchase payments made by the Contract Owner and is not made against any gains attributable to such purchase payments or against amounts attributable to any purchase payment credits made to the Contracts by Penn Mutual.
Number of contract years since purchase paymentsContingent  deferred sales charge (% of purchase 
                payment)0-3847566573839 and later0
The Contract Owner may make certain withdrawals at any time without any sales charge being imposed. At the end of the first contract year and once in each contract year thereafter, the Contract Owner may withdraw up to 15% of total purchase payments (as of the date of the withdrawal request) without incurring a sales charge. The Contract Owner may elect to receive this free withdrawal in a lump sum or on a systematic basis as provided in the Contracts. Withdrawals of up to $500,000 may also be made for medical reasons and for disability reasons without incurring a sales charge, as provided in the Contracts and described in the Prospectus. A withdrawal that is not subject to a deferred sales charge is referred to as a “Free Withdrawal.”
11. The Contracts contain a “free-look” provision as required under state law. Under the free-look provision, the purchaser may return the Contract within a certain number of days after purchase and receive the value of the Contract on the date it was returned plus any premium taxes deducted from the purchase payment or, in some states, the purchase payment that was made to Penn Mutual. The free-look period generally is ten days, but may be for a longer period under the laws of some states and under different factual circumstances.
12. The Contracts have a credit enhancement feature. Each time a purchaser makes a purchase payment under the Contract, Penn Mutual will credit an additional amount to the Contract from its general account assets (“Purchase Payment Enhancement”). Purchase Payment Enhancements will be allocated to subaccounts of the Variable Account III and to the fixed accounts in the same proportion as purchase payments are allocated under the Contract. Penn Mutual will determine the amount of the Purchase Payment Enhancement by multiplying the purchase payment by the applicable payment percentage set forth in the table below.
Total purchase payments less total withdrawals made under the contractPurchase  payment enhancement percentageLess than $100,0003$100,000 to $500,0004$500,000 to $2,000,0005
In addition, if the initial purchase payment made under the Contract is $2,000,000 or more, Penn Mutual will credit a Purchase Payment Enhancement to the Contract  in an amount equal to 6% of the initial purchase payment. If more than one purchase payment is made during the first year of the Contract, the Contract may receive an additional Purchase Payment Enhancement at the time of each additional purchase payment, based upon a Purchase Payment Enhancement percentage rate applicable to all purchase payments made during the year. Such additional Purchase Payment Enhancement will be determined as follows: When an additional purchase payment is made, Penn Mutual will determine the difference between: (i) The sum of all prior purchase payments made during the year times the purchase payment percentage applied to the current purchase payment; and (ii) the total Purchase Payment Enhancement previously credited to the Contract during the year. The difference, if any, will be credited to the Contract as an additional Purchase Payment Enhancement.
13. The Contract provides that if it is returned to Penn Mutual pursuant to the free-look provision, the Contract Owner will not receive a Purchase Payment Enhancement and will not receive any investment gain or be charged any expense that would have been attributable to such Purchase Payment Enhancement.
14. The Contract also provides that if the Contract Owner makes a withdrawal from the Contract within twelve months of the crediting of a Purchase Payment Enhancement, and if the withdrawal is subject to a deferred sales charge under the terms of the Contract, the Purchase Payment Enhancement will be recaptured by Penn Mutual and will not be paid to the Contract Owner.
15. Applicants seek exemption pursuant to Section 6(c) from Sections 2(a)(32), 22(c), and 27(i)(2)(A) of the Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder to the extent deemed necessary to permit Penn Mutual to issue the Contracts and to permit Penn Mutual and Penn Insurance to issue Future Contracts that provide for the recapture of certain Purchase Payment Enhancements when the Contract Owner makes a withdrawal from the Contract that is subject to a deferred sales charge within one year of the date a purchase payment and the related Purchase Payment Enhancement were credited to the Contract.
Applicants' Legal Analysis
1. Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act authorizes the Commission to exempt any person, security or transaction, or any class of persons, securities or transactions from the provisions of the Act and the rules promulgated thereunder if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act.
2. Applicants request that the Commission, pursuant to Section 6(c) of the Act, grant the exemptions requested below with respect to the Contracts and any Future Contracts. Applicants believe that the requested exemptions are appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act.
3. Subsection (i) of Selection 27 of the Act provides that Section 27 does not apply to any registered separate account funding variable insurance contracts, or to the sponsoring insurance company Start Printed Page 62406and principal underwriter of such account, except as provided in paragraph (2) of the subsection. Paragraph (2) provides that it shall be unlawful for such a separate account or sponsoring insurance company to sell a contract funded by the registered separate account unless “such contract is a redeemable security.”
4. Section 2(a)(32) of the Act defines “redeemable security” as any security, other than short-term paper, under the terms of which the holder, upon presentation to the issuer, is entitled to receive approximately his proportionate share of the issuer's current net assets, or the cash equivalent thereof.
5. Applicants submit that the recapture by Penn Mutual of a Purchase Payment Enhancement when a withdrawal is made from the Contract within one year of the crediting by Penn Mutual of a Purchase Payment Enhancement would not deprive the owner of his or her proportionate share of the assets of Variable Account III. The Contract Prospectus informs Contract Owners that any Purchase Payment Enhancement credited to the Contract within one year of the date of a full or partial withdrawal from the Contract that is subject to a deferred sales charge will be deducted from the value of the Contract. Applicants state that the Contract and the Prospectus make clear that any Purchase Payment Enhancement credited to the Contract in connection with a purchase payment made by the Contract Owners is conditioned on the purchase payment remaining in the Contract for a period of at least one year (unless the purchase payment may be withdrawn without payment of a deferred sales charge). Applicants assert that the Contract does not provide a vested right to a Purchase Payment Enhancement when the owner makes a withdrawal within one year of the credit unless the withdrawal is a Free Withdrawal. Because the Purchase Payment Enhancement is conditional and not vested, Applicants maintain that the recapture of the Purchase Payment Enhancement is simply the retrieval by Penn Mutual of its own assets.
6. Applicants state that the Contracts provide for the conditional crediting of Purchase Payment Enhancements during a one-year period to provide Penn Mutual with some measure of protection against purchasers making purchase payments with the intent of gaining a Purchase Payment Enhancement and then withdrawing purchase payments within a relatively short period of time. They state that the Contract is designed as a long-term investment vehicle and that it is intended to provide the owner with the opportunity for long term growth of assets and with income and assets for retirement. Applicants state that the Contracts are also intended to provide Penn Mutual, the issuer, with the opportunity to recover over the long term the cost it incurs in issuing and administering the Contracts. Applicants maintain that the conditional crediting of Purchase Payment Enhancements during a one-year period following a purchase payment is consistent with and a necessary part of the design of the Contracts. Further, the exemptions requested are limited in important respects. Recapture of a Purchase Payment Enhancement will be made only if a withdrawal is made within one year of the crediting of the Purchase Payment Enhancements. In addition, there will be no recapture if the withdrawal is not subject to a deferred sales charge.
7. Applicants submit that under the terms of the Contracts, as described in the Prospectus, the purchaser will receive his or her proportional share of Variable Account III in accordance with the purpose and intent of Sections 27(i)(2)(A) and 2(a)(32) of the Act.
8. Section 22(c) of the Act authorizes the Commission to make rules and regulations applicable to registered investment companies and to principal underwriters of, and dealers in, the redeemable securities of any registered investment company, to accomplish the same purposes as contemplated by Section 22(a). Rule 22c-1 under the Act prohibits a registered investment company issuing any redeemable security, a person designated in such issuer's prospectus as authorized to consummate transactions in any such security, and a principal underwriter of, or dealer in, such security, from selling, redeeming, or repurchasing any such security except at a price based on the current net asset value of such security which is next computed after receipt of a tender of such security for redemption or of an order to purchase or sell such security. Applicants submit that the recapture of the Purchase Payment Enhancement is not contrary to Section 22(c) and rule 22c-1.
9. Applicants state that the recapture of the Purchase Payment Enhancement described in the Application does not involve either of the harms that Rule 22c-1 was intended to address, namely: (i) The dilution of the value of outstanding redeemable securities of registered investment companies through their sale at a price below net asset value or their redemption or repurchase at a price above it, and (ii) other unfair results, including speculative trading practices. They state that these harms were the result of backward pricing, or the practice of basing the price of a mutual fund share on the net asset value per share determined as of the close of the market on the previous day. Applicants contend that the proposed recapture of the Purchase Payment Enhancement poses no such threat of dilution. They state that to effect a recapture of a Purchase Payment Enhancement, Penn Mutual will redeem interests in subaccounts of Variable Account III at a price determined on the basis of the current net asset value of Variable Account III. The amount recaptured will equal the amount of the Purchase Payment Enhancement that Penn Mutual paid out of its general account assets. Applicants state that although an owner will be entitled to retain any investment gain resulting from the Purchase Payment Enhancement, the owner will retain the gain based on current net asset value. Applicants submit that no dilution will occur upon the recapture of the Purchase Payment Enhancement.
10. Applicants assert that the second harm that Rule 22c-1 was designed to address, namely, speculative trading practices calculated to take advantage of backward pricing, will not occur as a result of the recapture of the Purchase Payment Enhancement. They state that there is no possibility that the recapture of such Purchase Payment Enhancements will lead to speculative trading in interests created under the Contract.
11. Applicants submit that because neither of the harms that Rule 22c-1 was meant to address is found in the recapture of the Purchase Payment Enhancement, Section 22(c) of the Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder should not be applied to the recapture of Purchase Payment Enhancements described in the Application.
12. Applicants represent that any Future Contracts will be substantially similar in all material respects to the Contracts. They submit that an order granting exemptive relief to Future Contracts would promote competitiveness in the variable annuity market by eliminating the need to file redundant exemptive applications, thereby reducing administrative expenses and maximizing the efficient use of Applicants' resources.
Conclusion
Applicants request an order pursuant to Section 6(c) of the Act for exemptions from Sections 2(a)(32), 22(c), and 27(i)(2)(A) of the Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder to the extent deemed Start Printed Page 62407necessary to permit Penn Mutual to issue the Contracts and to permit Penn Mutual and Penn Insurance to issue Future Contracts which allow them to recapture Purchase Payment Enhancements as described herein. For the reasons stated in this Application, Applicants submit that the requested exemptions meet the standards set out in Section 6(c), namely, that the exemptions are necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
The following is a summary of the application. The complete application is available for a fee from the SEC's Public Reference Branch, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549-0102 (202-942-8090).
Applicants' Representations
1. Penn Mutual Life is a mutual life insurance company organized under the laws of Pennsylvania in 1847. It provides life insurance, annuity, and investment products. PIA, a wholly owned subsidiary of Penn Mutual Life, is a Delaware stock insurance company established in 1994.
2. Variable Annuity Account I, sponsored by PIA, is registered under the 1940 Act as a unit investment trust. Variable Annuity Account I serves as a funding vehicle for variable annuity contracts issued by PIA. Variable Annuity Account III, sponsored by Penn Mutual Life, is a unit investment trust registered under the 1940 Act. Variable Annuity Account III serves as a funding vehicle for variable annuity contracts issued by Penn Mutual Life. Variable Life Account I, sponsored by Penn Mutual Life, is a unit investment trust registered under the 1940 Act. Variable Life Account III serves as a funding vehicle for variable life insurance contracts issued by Penn Mutual Life.
3. Variable Annuity Account I and Variable Annuity Account III serves as the funding vehicle for variable annuity contracts (“VA Contracts”) issued by Penn Mutual Life and PIA. Variable Life Account I serves as the funding vehicle for variable universal life contracts (“VUL Contracts”) issued by Penn Mutual Life. Each of the VA Contracts and VUL Contracts funded by the Separate Accounts (collectively, “Variable Products”) is registered with the Commission under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and is offered exclusively by means of a prospectus which describes the applicable terms and conditions of each such contract. The Separate Accounts are each divided into subaccounts (each a “Subaccount”) and each Subaccount invests exclusively in shares of funds of registered management investment companies (“Existing Funds”) currently available to the holders of the contracts (“Contractholders”.
4. The Existing funds consists of 18 separate investment options, which contain certain investment portfolios issued by Penn Series, Neuberger Berman Advisers Management Trust (“Neuberger & Berman Portfolios”), Variable Insurance Products Fund and Variable Insurance Products Fund II (“Fidelity Portfolios”), American Century Variable Portfolios Inc. (“American Century Portfolio”) and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Universal Funds, Inc. (“Morgan Stanley Portfolio”). Each of the Existing Funds is registered as a management investment company under the 1940 Act. Not all of the Existing Funds are involved in the Substitutions. The application contemplates that the American Century Portfolio, two of the three Neuberger & Berman Portfolios and one of the four Fidelity Portfolios will be replaced by substantially similar funds.
5. Penn Series is registered under the 1940 Act as an open-end investment management series. Currently, Penn Series has nine investment portfolios (“Current Penn Funds”). Shares of the Current Penn Funds are offered only to Penn Mutual Life and PIA (Penn Mutual Life and PIA hereinafter referred to collectively as “Penn Mutual”) for the Variable Products.
6. ICMI, a wholly owned subsidiary of Penn Mutual Life, is a registered investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. ICMI provides investment management services to each of the Current Penn Funds.
7. Penn Series is organizing four New Funds. Each of the New Funds will have the same or substantially the same investment objectives and policies of one of the Replaced Funds involved in the Substitutions. Overall investment management services will be provided to each of the newly organized New Funds by ICMI pursuant to an investment advisory agreement between ICMI and Penn Series (“ICMI Advisory Agreement”). Under the ICMI Advisory Agreement, ICMI will be responsible for the management of the business and affairs of each of the New Funds, subject to the supervision of the Board of Directors of Penn Series. ICMI will also Start Printed Page 20220be authorized to exercise full investment discretion and make all determinations with respect to the investment of the assets of the respective New Funds, but may, at its own cost and expense, retain sub-advisers (“Sub-Advisers”) to provide day-to-day portfolio management to each of the New Funds. For its services under the ICMI Advisory Agreement, ICMI will receive a fee from each of the New Funds. ICMI, in turn, will pay the fees and expenses of any Sub-Adivser retained by ICMI or any of the New Funds. It is currently anticipated that ICMI will employ Sub-Advisers for three of the New Funds and directly manage the assets of the fourth New Fund.
8. Penn Series and ICMI have applied for exemptive relief from Section 15(a) of the 1940 Act (“Manager of Managers Order”). The Manager of Managers Order would permit ICMI, as the investment adviser for the existing series of Penn Series to replace any Sub-Adviser or to employ a new Sub-Adviser, without submitting such actions for the approval of shareholders of the affected series. Following the Substitutions, Applicants anticipate that each of the New Funds will be entitled to rely on the Manager of Managers Order. As a condition to the application, however, Applicants state that they will take no action in reliance on the Manager of Managers Order with respect to any one of the New Funds unless and until the operation of that Fund in the manner contemplated by the Manager of Managers Order is approved, following the Substitutions, by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of that Fund within the meaning of the 1940 Act.
9. The purpose of the Substitutions is to provide Contractholders with improved investment options through enhanced investment performance and reduced expense ratios of investment options available under the Variable Products. The Substitutions are the first step in establishing a manager of managers structure that will provide Applicants with increased ability to affect the administration and management of the investment options offered through Variable Products. As the investment manager of each of the New Funds, ICMI will be in a position to oversee the operations of the New Funds, including the performance and portfolio management. Applicants represent that the manager of managers structure will give Applicants the means to more directly monitor the overall manner in which investment options available through the Variable Products are managed and administered.
10. Applicants seek relief for four Substitutions. The following table summarizes the proposed Substitutions. The investment objectives of Contractholders with interests in any Subaccount of the Separate Account (“Affected Contractholder”) will not be materially affected by the Substitutions.
Start Printed Page 20221

11. Applicants represent that the investment objectives of each New Fund will be the same as, or substantially similar to, the investment objectives of the corresponding fund that the New Fund will replace. The investment strategies and policies of the Penn Series Limited Maturity Bond Fund and the Penn Series Index 500 Fund will be substantially the same or substantially similar to the investment strategies and policies of the Neuberger Berman Limited Maturity Bond Portfolio and the Fidelity Investments' Index 500 Portfolio. The investment strategies and policies of the Penn Series Mid Cap Value Fund and the Penn Series Mid Cap Growth Fund may differ from the investment strategies and policies of Neuberger Berman Partners Fund and the American Century Capital Appreciation Portfolio respectively. However, the investment strategies and policies of these New Funds will be sufficiently similar to their corresponding Replaced Funds so that the Affected Contractholders may continue to seek to achieve their investment objectives in the substituted funds.
12. In Substitution No. 1, ICMI will serve as investment adviser and Neuberger Berman Investment Management Inc. (“Neuberger Berman”) will continue day-to-day portfolio management as Sub-Adviser to the New Fund. In Substitutions Nos. 2, 3, and 4, the New Fund will, following the substitutions, be advised by investment advisory organizations different from the organizations that currently manage the Replaced Funds. In Substitution No. 2, ICMI will serve as the investment adviser and investment manager of the New Fund. Applicants believe that given the below average investment performance for the Neuberger Berman Limited Maturity Bond Portfolio, ICMI will achieve improved investment results for Contractholders. In Substitution No. 3, ICMI will serve as the investment adviser and Wells Capital Management Inc. will serve as Sub-Adviser to the Penn Series Index 500 Fund. As in the case of the Fidelity Investment's Index 500 Portfolio, investments of Penn Series Index 500 Fund are expected to approximate the relative composition of the securities in the S&P 500. In Substitution No. 4, the day-to-day decisions for Penn Series Mid Cap Growth Fund will be the responsibility of Turner Investment Partners, Inc. (“TIP”) as Sub-Adviser. Applicants believe that TIP is in a position to achieve improved investment results for Contractholders who currently have contract values allocated to the corresponding Replaced Fund.
13. Immediately following the Substitutions, the expense ratios of the Start Printed Page 20222New Funds will not exceed the expense ratios of the Replaced Funds. The following table shows the total assets in each of the Replaced Funds at December 31, 1999 that are attributable to the Variable Products, as well as other non-registered insurance products, and compares the advisory fees and the expense ratios of the Replaced Funds for the six months ended December 31, 1999, with the pro forma advisory fees and expense ratios of the New Funds for the same periods. (Pro forma expense ratios of the New Funds are based on assets in the Replaced Funds attributable to the Variable Products and other non-registered insurance products, and estimates of expenses associated with those assets had they been invested in the New Funds during the periods).

14. Applicants expect to effect the Substitutions on or about May 1, 2000 in coordination with the distribution of annual prospectuses to Contractholders. As of the effective date of the Substitutions (“Effective Date”), shares of the Replaced Funds held by each of the Subaccounts of Applicant Separate Accounts will be presented to the Replaced Funds for redemption. The proceeds of such redemptions, which may be effected through cash or “in-kind” transactions, will then be used to purchase the appropriate number of shares of the corresponding New Funds. The Substitutions will take place at relative net asset values, with no change in the contract value of any Affected Contractholder, and all redemptions of shares of the Replaced Funds and purchases of shares of the corresponding New Funds will be effected in accordance with Rule 22c-1 under the 1940 Act.
15. Penn Mutual will bear the costs of the Substitutions, including any legal and/or accounting fees relating to them. Affected Contractholders will not incur any additional fees or charges as a result of the Substitutions; no current fees or charges applicable under any of the Variable Products will be increased as a result of the Substitutions; the rights of Start Printed Page 20223Affected Contractholder under any of the Variable Products, and the obligations of Penn Mutual under the Variable Products will not diminish in any way.
16. Applicants state that as soon as practicable after filing the Application, a supplement to each of the prospectuses relating to the Variable Products will be filed with the Commission. These supplements (“Product Supplements”) will reflect all material information relating to the Substitutions and the New Funds, including the identity of the Replaced Funds, a description of the New Funds and their respective investment objectives and policies, the Sub-Adviser for each of the New Funds, fees and expenses associated with the New Funds, and the impact that the Substitution will have on fees and expenses.
17. Following the date on which the notice of the Application is published in the Federal Register, but before the Effective Date, Penn Mutual will send to Affected Contractholders a notice (“Pre-Substitution Notice”), which will include the Product Supplements. The Pre-Substitution Notice will inform Affected Contractholders of: (a) The Effective Date of the Substitutions; (b) the right of each Affected Contractholder, under the VUL and VA Contracts, to transfer contract values among the various Subaccounts; and (c) the fact that any such transfer that involves a transfer from any of the Replaced Funds will not be subject to any administrative charge and will not count as one of the “free transfers” to which Affected Contractholders may otherwise be entitled.
18. Within five days after the Effective Date, Affected Contractholders will be sent written confirmation (“Confirmation Notice”) of the substitution transactions. The Confirmation Notice will: (a) Confirm that the Substitutions were carried out; (b) reiterate that each Affected Contractholder may make one transfer of all of the contract value or cash value under their Variable Products that is invested in any one of the Subaccounts that were affected by the Substitutions to any other Subaccount available under their Variable Products without such transfer being subject to any administrative charge, or being counted as one of the “free transfers” (or one of the limited number of transfers) to which Affected Contractholders may be entitled under their Variable Products; and (c) state that Penn Mutual will not exercise any rights reserved by it under the Variable Products to impose additional restrictions on transfers until at least 30 days after the Effective Date. The Confirmation Notice will be accompanied by a then-current prospectus for the relevant Variable Product, reflecting the inclusion of the New Funds, as well as an amended prospectus for the New Funds.
19. The in-kind redemption proceeds will consist of the same securities that are currently held by the Replaced Funds. Redemptions in-kind will be done in a manner consistent with the investment objectives, policies and diversification requirements of the respective New Funds. Further, Applicants represent that the in-kind redemptions for each of the New Funds will be reviewed by the Sub-Adviser responsible for making day-to-day investment decisions for that Portfolio to assure that the investment objective, investment policies and diversification requirements set forth in the registration statement relating to the relevant New Fund are satisfied. In addition, the in-kind asset transfers will be valued in the manner that is consistent with the valuation procedures of both the Replaced Fund and the relevant New Fund. Applications state that any inconsistencies in valuation procedures between the Replaced Fund and the relevant New Fund will be reconciled so that the redeeming and purchasing values are the same. In addition, and consistent with Rule 17a-7 under the 1940 Act, no brokerage commissions, fees or other remuneration will be paid in connection with the in-kind transactions.
20. The Variable Products expressly reserve to Penn Mutual the right, subject to compliance with applicable law, to substitute shares of one open-end investment company for shares of another open-end investment company held by a Separate Account.
Applicant's Legal Analysis
1. Section 26(b) of the 1940 Act provides that it shall be unlawful for any depositor or trustee of a registered unit investment trust holding the security of a single issuer to substitute another security for such security unless the Commission approves such substitution. Section 26(b) further provides that the Commission shall issue an order approving such substitution if the evidence establishes that it is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policies and provisions of the 1940 Act.
2. Applicants request an order pursuant to Section 26(b) of the 1940 Act approving the substitutions and related transactions. Applicants assert that the purposes, terms, and conditions of the Substitutions are consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the 1940 Act. Applicants further assert that the Substitutions will not result in the type of forced redemption that Section 26(b) was designed to guard against.
3. Applicants maintain that the substitutions do not represent the type of transaction that Section 26(b) was designed to prevent for the following reasons: (a) the Substitutions are designed to give Penn Mutual more control over investment products it offers to the investing and insurance purchasing public; (b) Contractholders involved in Substitution Nos. 1, 3 and 4 will have the benefit of ICMI's oversight of the Sub-Advisers; and (c) the procedures that Applicants will follow in the Substitutions will give Affected Contractholders ample notice of the Substitutions and any potential impact. Affected Contractholders will have the opportunity to transfer their investments from one of the Replaced Funds in anticipation of the Substitutions, or from the New Funds following the Substitution. In either case, Applicants represent that no administrative fee or transfer charge will be assessed. In light of the fact that only four of the 18 investment options currently available to Affected Contractholders will be involved in the Substitutions, Applicants believe that this ability to “opt out” of any Substitution affords each Affected Contractholder an effective choice of investments.
4. Section 17(a)(1) of the 1940 Act prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company, or any affiliate of such affiliated person, from selling any security or other property to such registered investment company. Section 17(a)(2) of the 1940 Act prohibits any affiliated person from purchasing any security or other property from such registered investment company.
5. Applicants request an order pursuant to Section 17(b) of the 1940 Act exempting the in-kind redemptions and purchases from the provisions of Section 17(a). Section 17(b) of the 1940 Act provides that the Commission may grant an order exempting a proposed transaction from Section 17(a) if evidence establishes that: (a) The terms of the proposed transaction, including the consideration to be paid or received, are fair and reasonable and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned; (b) the proposed transaction is consistent with the policy of each registered investment company concerned; and (c) the proposed Start Printed Page 20224transaction is consistent with the general purposes of the 1940 Act. 
6. Applicants represent that, if effected in accordance with the procedures described in the Application and summarized herein, the Substitutions are consistent with the general purposes of the 1940 Act and do not present any of the conditions or abuses that the 1940 Act was designed to prevent. Applicants state that the consideration to be paid by each New Fund, and received by each of the Replaced Funds, will be fair and reasonable and will not involve overreaching because the Substitutions will not result in the dilution of the interests of any Affected Contractholders and will not effect any change in economic interest, contract value or the dollar value of any Variable Products held by an Affected Contractholder. The in-kind redemptions and purchases will be done at values consistent with the policies of both the Replaced Funds and the New Funds and will satisfy the procedural safeguards of Rule 17a-7. Both ICMI and the Sub-Adviser of a New Fund will review all the asset transfers to assure that the assets meet the objectives of a New Fund and that they are valued under the appropriate valuation procedures of the Replaced Fund and such New Fund. The in-kind redemption proceeds will consist of the same securities that are currently held by the Replaced Funds. Applicants represent that the transactions are consistent with the policies of each investment company involved and the general purposes of the 1940 Act, and comply with the requirements of Section 17(b).
7. Applicants state that the facts and circumstances in the application are sufficient to assure that the Substitutions will be carried out in a manner that is consistent with Sections 17(b) and 26(b) of the 1940 Act and that the terms and conditions to which Applicants will be subject hereby are consistent with orders the Commission has issued in the past under similar circumstances.
Applicants' Terms
The significant terms of the substitutions described in the application include:
1. The New Funds have objectives and policies that are substantially the same or substantially similar to the objectives and policies of the Replaced Funds so that the objectives of the Affected Contractholders can continue to be met.
2. The expense ratios of the New Funds will, immediately following the Substitution, not exceed the expense ratios of the Replaced Funds. In the event that the expense ratio of a New Fund exceeds that of its corresponding Replaced Fund, Penn Mutual will waive its fees and/or reimburse expenses such that its expense ratio does not exceed that of its corresponding Replaced Fund's expense ratio. Penn Mutual will continue any such fee waivers and/or reimbursements, as necessary, until April 30, 2001, except that in the case of Substitution No. 2 (of the Penn Series Limited Maturity Bond Fund for the Neuberger Berman Limited Maturity Bond Portfolio), Penn Mutual will continue any such fee waiver and/or expense reimbursements, as necessary, until April 30, 2003.
3. Affected Contractholders may, under the terms of the Variable Products, transfer assets from any Subaccount of Applicant Separate Accounts to any other Subaccount available under the Variable Product. Any such transfer that involves a transfer from any of the Replaced Funds, from the date of the notice that the Replaced Funds will be substituted through a date at least 30 days following the Effective Date, will not be subject to any administrative charge, and will not count as one of any “free transfers” to which Affected Contractholder may otherwise be entitled. Affected Contractholders may also withdraw amounts under any contract held, or terminate their interest in any such contract, in accordance with the terms and conditions of any such contract, including but not limited to payment of any applicable surrender charge.
4. The Substitutions will be effected at the net asset value of the respective shares in conformity with Section 22(c) of the 1940 Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder, without the imposition of any transfer or similar charge by Applicants.
5. The Substitutions will take place at relative net asset value without change in the amount or value of any Variable Products held by Affected Contractholders. Affected Contractholders will not incur any fees or charges as a result of the Substitutions, nor will their rights or the obligations of Penn Mutual under such Variable Products be altered in any way. All expenses incurred in connection with the Substitutions, including legal, accounting and other fees and expenses, will be borne by Applicants, other than Separate Accounts.
6. Redemptions in kind will be handled in a manner consistent with the investment objectives, policies and diversification requirements of the New Fund. Consistent with Rule 17a-7(d) under the 1940 Act, no brokerage commissions, fees (except customary transfer fees) or other remuneration will be paid by the Replaced Funds or New Funds or Affected Contractholders in connection with the in-kind transactions. In addition, the in-kind asset transfers will be valued in the manner that is consistent with the valuation procedures of both the Replaced Fund and the relevant New Funds.
7. The Substitutions will not be counted as transfers in determining any limit on the total number of transfers that Affected Contractholders are permitted to make under the Variable Products.
8. The Substitutions will not alter in any way the annuity, life insurance, or other benefits afforded under the Variable Products held by any Affected Contractholders.
9. Each of the New Funds may rely upon a Commission order expected to be issued to certain affiliates of Penn Series. Applicants will take no action in reliance on the Manager of Managers Order with respect to any one of the New Funds unless and until the operation of that portfolio in the manner contemplated by the Manager of Managers Order is approved by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of that portfolio within the meaning of the 1940 Act by vote obtained following the Substitution.
Applicants' Conditions
Applicants state that they will not complete the Substitutions and related transactions described in this Application (other than the mailing of the Pre-Substitution Notices) unless all of the following conditions are met:
1. The Commission shall have issued an order (a) approving the Substitutions under Section 26(b) of the 1940 Act, and (b) exempting the in-kind redemptions from the provisions of Section 17(a) of the 1940 Act as necessary to carry out the transactions described in this Application.
2. Each Affected Contractholder will have been sent a Pre-Substitution Notice, which will include the Prospectus Supplements and will inform Affected Contractholders of: (a) The Effective Date of the Substitutions; (b) the right of each Affected Contractholder, under the Variable Products, to transfer contract values among the various Subaccounts; and (c) the fact that any such transfer that involves a transfer from any of the Replaced Funds will not be subject to any administrative charge and will not count as one of any “free transfers” to Start Printed Page 20225which Affected Contractholders may otherwise be entitled.
3. Each Affected Contractholder will receive, within five days following the Effective Date of Substitutions, written notice (“Confirmation Notice”). The Confirmation Notice will: (a) Confirm that the Substitutions were carried out; (b) reiterate that each Affected Contractholder may make one transfer to all of the contract value or cash value under their Variable Product that is invested in any one of the Subaccounts that were affected by the Substitutions to any other Subaccount available under their Variable Product without such transfer being subject to any administrative charge, or being counted as one of any “free transfers” (or one of the limited number of transfers) to which Affected Contractholders may be entitled under their Variable Product; and (c) state that Penn Mutual will not exercise any rights reserved by it under the Variable Products to impose additional restrictions on transfers until at least 30 days after the Effective Date. The Confirmation Notice will be accompanied by a then-current prospectus for the relevant Variable Product, reflecting the inclusion of the New Funds, as well as an amended prospectus for the New Funds.
4. Penn Mutual shall have satisfied itself, that: (a) The Variable Products allow the substitution of investments in the manner contemplated by the Substitutions and related transactions described herein; (b) the transactions can be consummated as described in this Application under the applicable insurance laws; and (c) that any regulatory requirements in each jurisdiction where the Variable Products are qualified for sale, have been complied with to the extent necessary to complete the transactions.
Conclusion
Applicants assert that, for the reasons summarized above, the requested order approving the substitutions and related transactions involving in-kind transactions should be granted.

Participation and Protection: With No Annual Fees




When planning for retirement, you can’t risk everything and you can’t protect everything.
But there is a way to have some of both.










A Shield Annuity from Brighthouse Financial can help you use a portion of your assets to take advantage of market
            growth with a level of downside protection that other options may not provide. Shield is designed to provide
            some protection in an unpredictable endeavor — investing.





Protect your retirement assets
A Brighthouse Shield Annuity is designed to provide a level of protection that, when markets inevitably turn volatile,
            ensures your losses are limited.



Participate in growth opportunities
With a Shield Annuity, balance is built-in. This means that even with the protection you enjoy, you can still take
            advantage of growth opportunities in the market up to a certain percentage.



Pay no annual fees
Unlike many financial products, you pay no annual fees with a Shield Annuity.

Building a brighter future begins with knowing what you’ll have in retirement. Annuities can help you grow and protect what you’ve saved.

1 Guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.
2 Shield annuities do not invest directly in any index.
3 Product guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company and are solely the responsibility of the issuing insurance company. Annuities and life insurance are issued by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company, Charlotte, NC 28277 and in New York, only by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY, New York, NY 10017 and not by MetLife.
If you're buying an annuity to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. That's because tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the annuity. References throughout this material to tax advantage, such as tax deferral and tax-free transfers, are subject to this consideration. In addition, non-qualified annuity contracts owned by corporations do not receive tax deferral on earnings. 

Prospectuses for variable annuities issued by a Brighthouse Financial insurance company, and for the investment portfolios offered thereunder, are available from Brighthouse Financial. The contract prospectus contains information about the contract's features, risks, charges and expenses. The investment objectives, risks and policies of the investment options, as well as other information about the investment options, are described in their respective prospectuses. Please read the prospectuses and consider this information carefully before investing. There is no guarantee that any of the variable investment options in a variable annuity product will meet their stated goals or objectives. The account value is subject to market fluctuations and investment risk so that, when withdrawn, it may be worth more or less than its original value even when an optional protection benefit rider is elected. Product availability and features may vary by state. Please refer to the contract prospectus for more complete details regarding the living and death benefits.

Annuities are long-term investments designed for retirement purposes. Brighthouse Financial annuities have limitations, exclusions, charges, termination provisions and terms for keeping them in force. All contract guarantees, including optional living and death benefit riders and annuity payout rates, are backed by the claims-paying ability and financial strength of issuing insurance company. They are not backed by the broker/dealer from which an annuity is purchased, by the insurance agency where an annuity is purchased, or any affiliates to those entities, and none makes any representations or guarantees regarding the claims-paying ability and financial strength of the issuing insurance company. Similarity, the issuing insurance company and the underwriter do not back the financial strength of the broker/dealer or its affiliates. Please contact your financial professional for complete details. 

Withdrawals of taxable amounts are subject to ordinary income tax and if made before age 59½, may be subject to a 10% federal income tax penalty. Some broker/dealers and financial professionals may refer to the 10% federal income tax penalty as an "additional tax" or "additional income tax" or use the terms interchangeably when discussing withdrawals taken prior to age 59½. Distributions of taxable amounts from a non-qualified annuity may also be subject to the 3.8% Unearned Income Medicare Contribution Tax on Net Investment Income if your modified adjusted gross income exceeds the applicable threshold amount. Withdrawals will reduce the living and death benefits and account value. Withdrawals may be subject to withdrawal charges. 

Any discussion of taxes is for general informational purposes only, does not purport to be complete or cover every situation, and should not be construed as legal, tax, or accounting advice. You should confer with your qualified legal, tax, and accounting advisors as appropriate.

Brighthouse Financial, an operating segment of MetLife, Inc. (NYSE: MET), announced on March 6, 2017 that it is now offering its suite of life insurance and annuity products under the Brighthouse Financial brand. 
*Data as of March 31, 2017. Total assets includes certain adjustments for transactions associated with the separation from MetLife, Inc.

Ratings as of May 2017. Operating entities collectively rated include Brighthouse Life Insurance Company (BLIC), NELICO, and Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY (BLNY); note, Moody’s and Fitch do not rate BLNY.
A.M. Best’s Financial Strength Rating is an independent opinion of an insurer’s financial strength and ability to meet its ongoing insurance policy and contract obligations. A Financial Strength Rating is not assigned to specific insurance policies or contracts and does not address any other risk, including, but not limited to, an insurer’s claims-payment policies or procedures; the ability of the insurer to dispute or deny claims payment on grounds of misrepresentation or fraud; or any specific liability contractually borne by the policy or contract holder. A Financial Strength Rating is not a recommendation to purchase, hold, or terminate any insurance policy, contract or any other financial obligation issued by an insurer, nor does it address the suitability of any particular policy or contract, for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.ambest.com.
Fitch’s Insurer Financial Strength Rating provides an assessment of the financial strength of an insurance organization. The Insurer Financial Strength Rating is assigned to the insurance company’s policyholder obligations, including assumed reinsurance obligations and contract holder obligations, such as guaranteed investment contracts. Ratings explanations can be found at www.fitchratings.com.
Moody’s Insurance Financial Strength Rating is an opinion of the ability of an insurance company to pay punctually senior policyholder claims and obligations and also reflect the expected financial loss suffered in the event of default. Specific obligations are considered unrated unless they are individually rated because the standing of a particular insurance obligation would depend on an assessment of its relative standing under those laws governing both the obligation and the insurance company. Ratings explanations can be found at www.moodys.com.
S&P Global Insurer Financial Strength Rating is a forward-looking opinion about the financial security characteristics of an insurance organization with respect to its ability to pay under its insurance policies and contracts in accordance with their terms. This opinion is not specific to any particular policy or contract, nor does it address the suitability of a particular policy or contract for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.standardandpoors.com.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.

How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
