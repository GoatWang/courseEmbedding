MILL SPRING, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Mark Bellissimo, managing partner of Tryon Equestrian Partners (TEP), 
      confirmed today that the Tryon 
      International Equestrian Center (TIEC) in Mill Spring, N.C. is 
      working with United States Equestrian Federation (USEF) to ensure that 
      the 2018 FEI World Equestrian Games (WEG) remain in North America, and 
      USEF has communicated its support of the initiative to the FEI for the 
      2018 WEG.
    


      The WEG, which is administered by the Fédération 
      Equestre Internationale (FEI), the worldwide governing body of 
      equestrian sport, occurs every four years in the middle of the Olympic 
      cycle and is the major international championship event for Jumping, 
      Dressage and Para-Equestrian Dressage, Eventing, Driving, Endurance, 
      Vaulting and Reining. The Bromont venue, located in Canada, which had 
      been awarded the 2018 games, announced last week that they were 
      withdrawing from their hosting arrangement with the FEI.
    

      The USEF has communicated via letter to the FEI their strong support of 
      the bid to host the 2018 Games in North Carolina. William Moroney, Chief 
      Executive Officer of USEF, commented, “While it is unfortunate the games 
      will not be able to take place at Bromont, the USEF believes it is 
      critical that the WEG remain in North America as intended so that the 
      globalization of the sport can continue.” USEF President Chrystine 
      Tauber added, “Mark Bellissimo and Tryon Equestrian Partners have a 
      brand new venue, deep experience and sufficient resources to make this 
      happen. They have the USEF’s full endorsement.”
    

      Bellissimo commented, “We are uniquely and immediately positioned to 
      hold all eight disciplines within a central venue. Further, our 
      integrated approach to existing on-site lodging, restaurants, permanent 
      VIP hospitality venues, and abundance of on-site and local area family 
      activities would be attractive for vendors, sponsors, competitors, horse 
      owners, and spectators. In addition, there are 60,000 hotel beds within 
      60 miles of the venue. We are confident that these elements would create 
      a very successful games and re-energize the WEG product.”
    

      Both N.C. and S.C. state and local governments have expressed support of 
      the bid. The last WEG in North America was held in Lexington, Ky. in 
      2010. The games had an economic impact of $201.5 million over the 
      event’s 14 days.
    

      TEP has invested more than $125 million dollars over the last two years 
      developing the 1,500-acre TIEC. On the commercial side, Bellissimo 
      believes its portfolio of 130 sponsors is one of the strongest in the 
      industry.

Mark Bellissimo and Tryon Equestrian Partners Announce Pursuit of 2018 FEI World Equestrian Games at Tryon International Equestrian Center
by Tryon International Equestrian Center | Aug 2, 2016, 1:33 PM EST


Saturday Nights Lights events at the main International Arena 
at TIEC have attracted a large following.
Mill Spring, N.C. - Mark Bellissimo, managing partner of Tryon Equestrian Partners, confirmed today that the Tryon International Equestrian Center (TIEC) in Mill Spring, N.C. is working with United States Equestrian Federation (USEF) to ensure that the 2018 FEI World Equestrian Games (WEG) remain in North America and USEF has communicated its support of the initiative to the FEI for the 2018 WEG.

The WEG, which is administered by the Fédération Equestre International (FEI), the worldwide governing body of equestrian sport, occurs every four years in the middle of the Olympic cycle and is the major international championship event for Jumping, Dressage and Para-Equestrian Dressage, Eventing, Driving, Endurance, Vaulting and Reining.  The Bromont venue, located in Canada, which had been awarded the 2018 games, announced last week that they were withdrawing from their hosting arrangement with the FEI. 
 
The United States Equestrian Federation has communicated via letter to the FEI their strong support of the bid to host the 2018 Games in North Carolina.  William Moroney, Chief Executive Officer of USEF commented, "While it is unfortunate the games will not be able to take place at Bromont, the USEF believes it is critical that the WEG remain in North America as intended so that the globalization of the sport can continue." USEF President, Chrystine Tauber added "Mark Bellissimo and Tryon Equestrian Partners have a brand new venue, deep experience and sufficient resources to make this happen. They have the USEF's full endorsement."

Both N.C. and S.C. state and local governments have expressed support of the bid. The last WEG in North America was held in Lexington, Kentucky in 2010. The games had an economic impact of $201.5 million over the event's 14 days according to a financial study commissioned by the state.

The Blue Ridge Mountains provide a great backdrop for the 12 competition rings"North Carolina's infrastructure and natural beauty make our state a natural fit to host the 2018 World Equestrian Games," said Governor McCrory. "We will support efforts to host the Games in our state which will provide not only a positive experience to all those attending, but a significant boost to North Carolina's rapidly growing economy."

S.C. Governor Haley echoed support for the WEG. "We have a long and rich history in equestrian competition, and welcome the opportunity to showcase our state's world-renowned hospitality and tourism assets to the attendees and participants of this prestigious event," said Governor Haley. 

Tryon Equestrian Partners (TEP) has invested over $125 million dollars over the last two years developing 1,500 acres in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains to create what they believe to be the premier equestrian lifestyle destination and resort in the world.  The Tryon International Equestrian Center is the centerpiece of that effort. This venue includes 1,200 permanent stalls, 12 competition arenas, a lighted international arena that seats 6,000 (expandable to 12,000) with multiple VIP areas, a large covered/indoor arena that seats 5,000, as well a world-class cross country course which will support both Eventing and Driving.  TIEC is nestled within North Carolina horse country which is accessible to hundreds of miles of equestrian trails to support Endurance.   Click here to view Tryon Venue Slideshow - http://bit.ly/2a8YmKp.

Tryon International Equestrian Center (TIEC) is strategically located between Charlotte, NC, Asheville NC, and Greenville/Spartanburg SC.  Asheville and Greenville GSP airports are within 35 minutes from the venue and Charlotte-Douglas International Airport is approximately one hour from the venue.

Mark Bellissimo, TEP managing partner, commented, "Our partnership built the Tryon International Equestrian Center (TIEC) to support all levels and disciplines of equestrian sport including international competitions and championships.  Our partnership's passion for equestrian sport is based on our belief that we can grow the sport in the Americas, and that this country needs a comprehensive high-profile, high-quality destination to showcase all equestrian disciplines to an expanding spectator base."     

Bellissimo presides over an organization, with over 150 full-time staff and 1,000 part-time staff, that operates more FEI competitions than any other organizer in the world with 38 weeks of CDI and CSI events through four venues (Wellington, Tryon, Colorado, and Central Park) that includes 6 CSI 5*, 1 CSIO 4*, 1 CDIO 4*, 4 CDI W's, 1 CDI 5*, 2 CPEDI, as well as the multi-discipline North American Junior Young Rider Championships (NAJYRC).  The collective organizations own and operate three of the largest facilities and some of the most prominent events in the world: The Palm Beach International Equestrian Center in Wellington, Fla., which hosts the Winter Equestrian Festival and the Global Dressage Festival, which in their peak week will have more than 3,500 horses competing within the 12-week winter circuit;  The Colorado Horse Park which just hosted the NAJYRC; and the Tryon International Equestrian Center venue which hosts 10 FEI weeks. The TIEC venue will be hosting the American Eventing Championships in September 2016 which will have over 600 entries.

On the commercial side, Bellissimo believes its portfolio of 130 sponsors is one of the strongest in the industry. Many sponsors have already expressed encouragement and interest in the WEG event since Bromont's withdrawal as host of the 2018 games. In addition to Bellissimo, the organizing committee would include Michael Stone, President of Equestrian Sport Productions and former Secretary General of the FEI, who has been involved in the WEG process for all events since the inaugural games in 1990 (with the exception of the 2014 Normandy WEG games); Sharon Decker, Chief Operating Officer of Tryon International Equestrian Center and former Secretary of Commerce for the State of North Carolina would lead the efforts on behalf of the TIEC facility, and Jim Wolf, former USEF Chef de Mission, whose 20-year tenure with USEF provided various experiences and responsibilities in U.S. WEG and Olympic team efforts.

Bellissimo further commented, "The WEG is a very challenging and complicated event.  With the exception of Aachen, Germany, most venues are forced to spend many years and tens of millions of dollars investing and developing the venue infrastructure, developing the personnel, attracting sponsors, and managing logistics for the WEG. This takes a financial and operational toll by consuming scarce resources on the venue construction and team building efforts for a one-time event. We have a fully functional equestrian venue, the management team and operational staff, and the sponsor pipeline in place, so the bulk of our energy will be on operational execution and showcasing the event and the sport to the world." 

Bellissimo added, "We are uniquely and immediately positioned to hold all eight disciplines within a central venue.  Further, our integrated approach to existing on-site lodging, restaurants, permanent VIP hospitality venues, and abundance of on-site and local area family activities would be attractive for vendors, sponsors, competitors, horse owners, and spectators.  In addition, there are 60,000 hotel beds within 60 miles of the venue. We are confident that these elements would create a very successful games and re-energize the WEG product."

Potential to be the largest sporting event in North Carolina history with over $400 million dollars of projected economic impact and 500,000 spectators over the 14-day September 2018 event. Press conference to be held Friday, Nov. 4 at 10 a.m. at Charlotte Chamber of Commerce to unveil details regarding economic impact on North and South Carolina
 
For Immediate Release
Mill Spring, NC – November 3, 2016 – Mark Bellissimo, managing Partner of Tryon Equestrian Partners (TEP), announced today that the Tryon International Equestrian Center (TIEC) in Mill Spring, Polk County, North Carolina has been selected as the host venue for the FEI World Equestrian Games™ 2018 (FEI WEG). The Games, which are administered by the Fédération Equestre Internationale (FEI), the worldwide governing body of equestrian sport, is the major international championship event for the eight core equestrian disciplines of show jumping, dressage and para-equestrian dressage, eventing, driving, endurance, vaulting and reining.The FEI WEG is held every four years, halfway between the Summer Olympic Games cycle and will occur from September 10 through 23, 2018.
Bellissimo commented, “We are honored to be selected by the FEI to be the steward of the FEI World Equestrian Games 2018. Next to the Olympic Games, the FEI WEG is the most important event on the world equestrian calendar. We are confident that our partnership and our operating team will create a memorable experience for all involved with the ultimate goal of significantly elevating horse sport in the U.S. beyond the 27 million people who ride a horse at least once a year.”
“We are very pleased to announce Tryon as the host of the FEI World Equestrian Games 2018,” FEI President Ingmar de Vos said. “The Tryon team submitted a really impressive bid and we have every confidence in the organising committee. It’s a truly spectacular venue and almost all the necessary infrastructure for our eight disciplines is already in place. We are looking forward to a fantastic celebration of top level sport as all the disciplines come together to crown their world champions at the Games in two years’ time.”
“We are thrilled with this news and thank the FEI Bureau for having faith in us and entrusting us with the honor of hosting this prestigious event,” Bellissimo said. “It’s a really great fit for the Carolinas’ equestrian heritage and we look forward to working closely with the FEI and with the USEF to produce a tremendous FEI World Equestrian Games in 2018.”
Equestrian enthusiasts from over 70 countries trek to WEG host cities every four years to cheer on athletes from their native countries, much like the Olympic Games. The Normandy FEI WEG had a local economic impact of $400 million, or 368 million euros, and an attendance of over 500,000 spectators during the 14-day event.
“We are excited about the impact this event will have on the economic health of the Blue Ridge Foothills region of the Carolinas,” said Sharon Decker, COO of Tryon Equestrian Partners, Carolinas’ Operations.
The event has been held in an impressive list of major cities: Stockholm, Sweden (1990), The Hague, Netherlands (1994), Rome, Italy (1998), Jerez de la Frontera, Spain (2002), Aachen, Germany (2006), Lexington, Kentucky (2010), and Normandy, France (2014).
“We are delighted to welcome the FEI World Equestrian Games back to the United States and are delighted that the event will remain in North America,” said USEF President, Chrystine Tauber.
“We would like to express our gratitude to Tryon Equestrian Partners for stepping up to host this event with such short notice. Tryon Equestrian Partners has proven their ability to execute complex, high-level events and we are confident in their ability to produce an event of this magnitude. As one of the true pinnacles of equestrian sport, hosting the World Equestrian Games provides a fantastic opportunity to elevate the sport in the United States.”
In 2014, Tryon Equestrian Partners (TEP) broke ground on the 1,600-acre Tryon Resort, which expands into both Mill Spring and Tryon, NC, and includes the Tryon International Equestrian Center. TEP has invested over $125 million dollars over the last two years creating the Tryon Resort, which aspires to be the world’s premiere equestrian lifestyle destination. The design of the venue contemplated hosting the WEG, so a vast majority of the equestrian infrastructure is in place. Recent events accelerated the opportunity and the schedule.
Today, TIEC is rapidly gaining a reputation as one of the world’s premier equestrian venues complete with 12 riding arenas, over 1,160 permanent stalls, a variety of onsite lodging, restaurants, shops, and a year-round competition and events calendar. TIEC has already hosted several national equestrian competitions including the 2016 American Eventing Championships and the 2016 U.S. Pony Club Championships East. To see a recent video overview of the Tryon International Equestrian Center, please click on the following link: http://bit.ly/2ffVehA
Mark Bellissimo, managing partner of Tryon Equestrian Partners, is also the managing partner and largest shareholder of Equestrian Sport Productions, an organization with more than 150 full-time staff and 1,000 part-time staff, that is the largest show organizer in the US and operates more FEI competitions than any other event organizer in the world with 38 weeks of CDI and CSI events through four venues in the following states; Florida, North Carolina, Colorado, and Central Park, New York. The Bellissimo Family is also the owner and publisher of The Chronicle of the Horse, the US most respected and widely distributed horse sport magazine and online media property (www.coth.com). The Chronicle of the Horse’s online media attracts over 8.3 million unique visitors annually. Together Bellissimo and his partners have invested nearly $500 million in equestrian related assets and properties in Florida, North Carolina, and Colorado which includes the recent $72 million dollar purchase of the International Polo Club in Palm Beach in the spring of 2016.
TIEC is already a welcomed economic engine for the region, having created hundreds of jobs, and is employing thousands in construction efforts over the last two years. WEG’s estimated $400 million impact will extend up to and beyond Charlotte, Asheville, Hickory in North Carolina and Greenville and Spartanburg in South Carolina. TEP estimates it will invest an additional $100 million dollars over the next two years during phase two of the development which is primarily focused on resort amenities including lodging and hospitality elements.
“Our partnership built the Tryon International Equestrian Center (TIEC) to support all levels and disciplines of equestrian sport including international competitions and championships,” added Bellissimo. “Our partnership’s passion for equestrian sport is based on our belief that we can grow the sport in the Americas, and that this country needs a comprehensive high-profile, high-quality destination to showcase all equestrian disciplines to an expanding spectator base and to increase access to horse sport for all socio-economic groups.”

United States Equestrian Federation (USEF) strongly endorses Tryon bid to FEI. North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory and South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley both support initiative. 

For Immediate Release
Mill Spring, NC – August 2, 2016 – Mark Bellissimo, managing partner of Tryon Equestrian Partners, confirmed today that the Tryon International Equestrian Center (TIEC) in Mill Spring, N.C. is working with United States Equestrian Federation (USEF) to ensure that the 2018 FEI World Equestrian Games (WEG) remain in North America and USEF has communicated its support of the initiative to the FEI for the 2018 WEG.
The WEG, which is administered by the Fédération Equestre International (FEI), the worldwide governing body of equestrian sport, occurs every four years in the middle of the Olympic cycle and is the major international championship event for Jumping, Dressage and Para-Equestrian Dressage, Eventing, Driving, Endurance, Vaulting and Reining.  The Bromont venue, located in Canada, which had been awarded the 2018 games, announced last week that they were withdrawing from their hosting arrangement with the FEI.
The United States Equestrian Federation has communicated via letter to the FEI their strong support of the bid to host the 2018 Games in North Carolina.  William Moroney, Chief Executive Officer of USEF commented, “While it is unfortunate the games will not be able to take place at Bromont, the USEF believes it is critical that the WEG remain in North America as intended so that the globalization of the sport can continue.” USEF President, Chrystine Tauber added “Mark Bellissimo and Tryon Equestrian Partners have a brand new venue, deep experience and sufficient resources to make this happen. They have the USEF’s full endorsement.”

Both N.C. and S.C. state and local governments have expressed support of the bid. The last WEG in North America was held in Lexington, Kentucky in 2010. The games had an economic impact of $201.5 million over the event’s 14 days according to a financial study commissioned by the state.
“North Carolina’s infrastructure and natural beauty make our state a natural fit to host the 2018 World Equestrian Games,” said Governor McCrory. “We will support efforts to host the Games in our state which will provide not only a positive experience to all those attending, but a significant boost to North Carolina’s rapidly growing economy.”
S.C. Governor Haley echoed support for the WEG. “We have a long and rich history in equestrian competition, and welcome the opportunity to showcase our state’s world-renowned hospitality and tourism assets to the attendees and participants of this prestigious event,” said Governor Haley.
Tryon Equestrian Partners (TEP) has invested over $125 million dollars over the last two years developing 1,500 acres in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains to create what they believe to be the premier equestrian lifestyle destination and resort in the world.  The Tryon International Equestrian Center is the centerpiece of that effort. This venue includes 1,200 permanent stalls, 12 competition arenas, a lighted international arena that seats 6,000 (expandable to 12,000) with multiple VIP areas, a large covered/indoor arena that seats 5,000, as well a world-class cross country course which will support both Eventing and Driving.  TIEC is nestled within North Carolina horse country which is accessible to hundreds of miles of equestrian trails to support Endurance.   Click here to view Tryon Venue Slideshow – http://bit.ly/2a8YmKp
Tryon International Equestrian Center (TIEC) is strategically located between Charlotte, NC, Asheville NC, and Greenville/Spartanburg SC.  Asheville and Greenville GSP airports are within 35 minutes from the venue and Charlotte-Douglas International Airport is approximately one hour from the venue.










The Blue Ridge Mountains provide a great backdrop for the 12 competition rings.





Mark Bellissimo, TEP managing partner, commented, “Our partnership built the Tryon International Equestrian Center (TIEC) to support all levels and disciplines of equestrian sport including international competitions and championships.  Our partnership’s passion for equestrian sport is based on our belief that we can grow the sport in the Americas, and that this country needs a comprehensive high-profile, high-quality destination to showcase all equestrian disciplines to an expanding spectator base.”
Bellissimo presides over an organization, with over 150 full-time staff and 1,000 part-time staff, that operates more FEI competitions than any other organizer in the world with 38 weeks of CDI and CSI events through four venues (Wellington, Tryon, Colorado, and Central Park) that includes 6 CSI 5*, 1 CSIO 4*, 1 CDIO 4*, 4 CDI W’s, 1 CDI 5*, 2 CPEDI, as well as the multi-discipline North American Junior Young Rider Championships (NAJYRC).  The collective organizations own and operate three of the largest facilities and some of the most prominent events in the world: The Palm Beach International Equestrian Center in Wellington, Fla., which hosts the Winter Equestrian Festival and the Global Dressage Festival, which in their peak week will have more than 3,500 horses competing within the 12-week winter circuit;  The Colorado Horse Park which just hosted the NAJYRC; and the Tryon International Equestrian Center venue which hosts 10 FEI weeks. The TIEC venue will be hosting the American Eventing Championships in September 2016 which will have over 600 entries.
On the commercial side, Bellissimo believes its portfolio of 130 sponsors is one of the strongest in the industry. Many sponsors have already expressed encouragement and interest in the WEG event since Bromont’s withdrawal as host of the 2018 games. In addition to Bellissimo, the organizing committee would include Michael Stone, President of Equestrian Sport Productions and former Secretary General of the FEI, who has been involved in the WEG process for all events since the inaugural games in 1990 (with the exception of the 2014 Normandy WEG games); Sharon Decker, Chief Operating Officer of Tryon International Equestrian Center and former Secretary of Commerce for the State of North Carolina would lead the efforts on behalf of the TIEC facility, and Jim Wolf, former USEF Chef de Mission, whose 20-year tenure with USEF provided various experiences and responsibilities in U.S. WEG and Olympic team efforts.
Bellissimo further commented, “The WEG is a very challenging and complicated event.  With the exception of Aachen, Germany, most venues are forced to spend many years and tens of millions of dollars investing and developing the venue infrastructure, developing the personnel, attracting sponsors, and managing logistics for the WEG. This takes a financial and operational toll by consuming scarce resources on the venue construction and team building efforts for a one-time event. We have a fully functional equestrian venue, the management team and operational staff, and the sponsor pipeline in place, so the bulk of our energy will be on operational execution and showcasing the event and the sport to the world.”
Bellissimo added, “We are uniquely and immediately positioned to hold all eight disciplines within a central venue.  Further, our integrated approach to existing on-site lodging, restaurants, permanent VIP hospitality venues, and abundance of on-site and local area family activities would be attractive for vendors, sponsors, competitors, horse owners, and spectators.  In addition, there are 60,000 hotel beds within 60 miles of the venue. We are confident that these elements would create a very successful games and re-energize the WEG product.”

PRESS RELEASE
MILL SPRING, N.C. (AUGUST 2, 2016): Mark Bellissimo, managing partner of Tryon Equestrian Partners, confirmed today that the Tryon International Equestrian Center (TIEC) in Mill Spring, N.C. is working with United States Equestrian Federation (USEF) to ensure that the 2018 FEI World Equestrian Games (WEG) remain in North America and USEF has communicated its support of the initiative to the FEI for the 2018 WEG.

Bellissimo presides over an organization, with over 150 full-time staff and 1,000 part-time staff, that operates more FEI competitions than any other organizer in the world with 38 weeks of CDI and CSI events through four venues (Wellington, Tryon, Colorado, and Central Park) that includes 6 CSI 5*, 1 CSIO 4*, 1 CDIO 4*, 4 CDI W’s, 1 CDI 5*, 2 CPEDI, as well as the multi-discipline North American Junior Young Rider Championships (NAJYRC).  The collective organizations own and operate three of the largest facilities and some of the most prominent events in the world: The Palm Beach International Equestrian Center in Wellington, Fla., which hosts the Winter Equestrian Festival and the Global Dressage Festival, which in their peak week will have more than 3,500 horses competing within the 12-week winter circuit;  The Colorado Horse Park which just hosted the NAJYRC; and the Tryon International Equestrian Center venue which hosts 10 FEI weeks. The TIEC venue will be hosting the American Eventing Championships in September 2016 which will have over 600 entries.
On the commercial side, Bellissimo believes its portfolio of 130 sponsors is one of the strongest in the industry. Many sponsors have already expressed encouragement and interest in the WEG event since Bromont’s withdrawal as host of the 2018 games. In addition to Bellissimo, the organizing committee would include Michael Stone, President of Equestrian Sport Productions and former Secretary General of the FEI, who has been involved in the WEG process for all events since the inaugural games in 1990 (with the exception of the 2014 Normandy WEG games); Sharon Decker, Chief Operating Officer of Tryon International Equestrian Center and former Secretary of Commerce for the State of North Carolina would lead the efforts on behalf of the TIEC facility, and Jim Wolf, former USEF Chef de Mission, whose 20-year tenure with USEF provided various experiences and responsibilities in U.S. WEG and Olympic team efforts.
Bellissimo further commented, “The WEG is a very challenging and complicated event.  With the exception of Aachen, Germany, most venues are forced to spend many years and tens of millions of dollars investing and developing the venue infrastructure, developing the personnel, attracting sponsors, and managing logistics for the WEG. This takes a financial and operational toll by consuming scarce resources on the venue construction and team building efforts for a one-time event. We have a fully functional equestrian venue, the management team and operational staff, and the sponsor pipeline in place, so the bulk of our energy will be on operational execution and showcasing the event and the sport to the world.”
Bellissimo added, “We are uniquely and immediately positioned to hold all eight disciplines within a central venue.  Further, our integrated approach to existing on-site lodging, restaurants, permanent VIP hospitality venues, and abundance of on-site and local area family activities would be attractive for vendors, sponsors, competitors, horse owners, and spectators.  In addition, there are 60,000 hotel beds within 60 miles of the venue. We are confident that these elements would create a very successful games and re-energize the WEG product.”
The Blue Ridge Mountains provide a great backdrop for the 12 competition rings.
