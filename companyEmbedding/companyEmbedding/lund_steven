Pete Stott



















































Before serving as chairman of the board of directors for Nu Skin Enterprises, Steven J. Lund was president and chief executive officer. He held that position from 1998 to 2003, advancing from his post as president and CEO of Nu Skin Asia Pacific (NSAP).Lund started with the company at its inception in 1984 as executive vice president.Before joining Nu Skin Enterprises, Lund worked as an attorney with a private law firm specializing in litigation and products liability law. He holds a Juris Doctorate degree from Brigham Young University's J. Reuben Clark Law School. He also is a member of the Utah, Arizona and American Bar Associations and has served on the board of directors for the Direct Selling Association.QUESTION: In the context of your current position as a local business leader, how did you get where you are today? ANSWER: I suppose that success never happens by accident. It never happens in a vacuum. True success is the product of a lot of great people pulling together to do what they can to improve the lives of others, and financial success can be a byproduct of this effort.QUESTION: What are the two or three – or more – characteristics required for a successful business leader? ANSWER: At Nu Skin we have developed what we call the “success formula,” centered on five fundamental principles of success: Dream, Set Goals, Believe, Take Action and Lead. These principles are universal. Successful business leaders tend to personally focus on these principles, and are able to lead others to do the same.  QUESTION: Explain how your business fosters entrepreneurship or new ideas that help you succeed. ANSWER: Nu Skin is a Utah entrepreneurial story that grew from a small start to a multi-billion dollar enterprise during our 30-year history. Our entrepreneurial spirit runs deep in our company. Our business channel is somewhat unique in the fact that it provides an opportunity for people to start their own businesses and generate supplemental or full-time income without significant start-up capital generally required to start a business. People from all walks of life have found success with Nu Skin by tapping into their own entrepreneurial spirit and leveraging the products and backing of a global industry leader.QUESTION: From a Utah Valley viewpoint, what do you see as the next “big thing” that will influence your industry? Some ideas may include improved connectivity such as Google Fiber, more training and educational opportunities, improved transportation infrastructure, a more diverse workforce. ANSWER: Ours is a people business, so the growing emphasis on better education and training in our community provides much upside for companies like ours. I'm excited about the ever-improving training and educational opportunities at the local universities, including UVU where I am a trustee.  As we make a difference in the classroom, we will see the benefit in our workforce. And at the end of the day, people really are the next big thing to influence any industry.QUESTION: Related to your specific business or enterprise, what changes can you talk about that Utah Valley residents should be excited to learn? ANSWER: A lot is happening in downtown Provo. We recently opened our new Innovation Center and will be finishing the rest of our expansion project later this year. Residents are welcome to come down and tour the building and its 2.5 acres of green space. With Google Fiber, the Convention Center, the increased traffic the LDS Temple will bring, and other construction projects, downtown Provo is changing and we are excited to be a part of it.
