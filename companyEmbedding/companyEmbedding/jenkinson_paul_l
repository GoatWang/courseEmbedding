Kite Pharma Expands Leadership Team, Appoints Paul L. Jenkinson as 
      Chief Financial Officer




Led Worldwide Commercial and Corporate Financial Planning Functions 
      at Allergan






May 16, 2016 04:05 PM Eastern Daylight Time



SANTA MONICA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Kite Pharma, Inc. (Nasdaq: KITE) today announced the appointment of Paul 
      L. Jenkinson as Chief Financial Officer, reporting to Arie Belldegrun, 
      M.D., FACS, Kite’s Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer.
    


      Mr. Jenkinson succeeds Cynthia M. Butitta, who continues in her role as 
      Kite’s Chief Operating Officer. Mr. Jenkinson and Ms. Butitta are 
      working closely on the transition and other ongoing business activities.
    

      “Paul brings extensive experience in international financial management 
      and operations to Kite as we prepare for the potential launch of our 
      lead candidate KTE-C19 next year,” said Dr. Belldegrun. “As Kite 
      continues to grow, our evolving leadership structure reflects the 
      expanding focus and specialized needs of our organization. Paul’s 
      expertise in the development, launch, and commercialization of products 
      in multiple markets, including in the U.S., Europe, Asia, and other 
      regions, directly supports our goal of delivering engineered cell 
      therapies to cancer patients in need. We’re thrilled to have him join 
      our team.”
    

      Mr. Jenkinson joins Kite Pharma after nearly a decade at Allergan, where 
      he served most recently as Vice President, Global Commercial and 
      Corporate Finance. In this role, he was responsible for the 
      corporation’s financial planning and analysis activities, working with 
      commercial operations, manufacturing operations, research and 
      development, and general and administration functions in multiple 
      international markets. His responsibilities also included global 
      commercial finance with a focus on performance and system-wide revenue 
      and cost management initiatives. Previously, Mr. Jenkinson served in 
      finance positions of increasing responsibility at Black & Decker 
      Corporation (presently Stanley Black & Decker), attaining the position 
      of Vice President, Corporate Officer, at the Kwikset, Baldwin and Weiser 
      Lock Companies. He began his career in finance positions at Deloitte New 
      Zealand and later at a predecessor company of Fonterra. Mr. Jenkinson 
      holds a Bachelor of Commerce degree in Accounting & Finance and 
      Marketing from the University of Otago, New Zealand, and is an active 
      member of Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand.
    

      “I’m excited to join such a talented and driven team, and I share their 
      commitment to delivering engineered cell therapies with the potential to 
      transform the landscape of cancer therapy,” said Mr. Jenkinson. “Kite 
      has an impressive track record of solid execution and sound financial 
      management, and I look forward to building on this success.”
