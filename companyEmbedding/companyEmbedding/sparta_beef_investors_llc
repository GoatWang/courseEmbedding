Livestock Producers

If you are a livestock producer or hobby farmer and are interested in having animals harvested for yourselves or for your other customers please feel free to contact us. We harvest every week, work well with others and can arrange to meet your needs and requirements.
Harvesting
You will need to make an appointment for the harvesting of your animals. Normally we harvest on Tuesdays so if scheduled, we would request that you transport your animal(s) here to Wisconsin River Meats on the Monday before for drop off and identification preferably before 4:00 p.m. of that Monday.
Customers
You and your customers are important to us. Our staff can help assist with cutting orders and the allocation of your animal(s). We cut everything "restaurant cut" and to the best of our abilities including packaging with heavy freezer paper and boxing up of all the orders so you or your customers do not have to worry about coolers or boxes. We will take care of everything. Scheduling times vary especially in the late fall season. We will always accommodate to the best of our abilities.
