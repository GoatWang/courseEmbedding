Title: Associate
               Company: The Renewal Group LLC
Job Details
               We helped an HVAC services company to significantly expand their market by adding a manufacturing and engineering component to the product line mix. We assisted a metal products fabrication client to effectively market diagnostic equipment carts for the medical industry, resulting in a significant increase in profitable revenues in a growing segment of the market. We helped a national plumbing manufacturer develop new strategies to successfully expand into new distribution channels ahead of the curve of their competitors, allowing them to redeploy their resources in market segments with long-term revenue potential. Leadership TransitionWe led a prominent minerals processing company through a re-positioning effort that resulted in pursuing a strategy for being "operationally excellent," adding profit in what is considered to be a commodity industry. This also provided the owner with opportunity to transition the leadership of the company to a new and talented management team. We played a key leadership role for an owner, improving the profitability and market position of their company. We were successful in positioning the company for sale and did so at an attractive multiple above industry comparables. We assisted a manufacturer in the heavy equipment industry to transition family leadership to "outside management" leading to product development strategies, which doubled annual revenues within two years. We assisted an aerospace client to expand their development of commercial space travel technology. A creative effort in helping an entrepreneurial company gain credibility in a "field of giants." Business Practices ImprovementWe assisted an industry leader in the electric controls market to refine their sales and marketing strategies and develop a new sales approach for landing substantially larger customers. We created financial reporting tools for a metal fabricating client allowing the organization to forecast its cash flow needs. The result was improved communication between our client and various lending institutions. This improvement led to the proper amount of funding and corresponding controls for a significant expansion within the client's business. Our focus is and will continue to be improving our client owner's organizational, financial and personal well-being. While we are proud of the fact that 100% of our clients have come from referrals, our real satisfaction comes from their willingness to tell others about their positive experience with us.

                                            Madison-John P. McDermott, M.D. died of cancer on June 22, 2011 at Hospice. He was born in Gratiot, Wisconsin on Dec.18, 1918 to Dr. Leo and Mae (Macken) McDermott. John was the eldest of five children, Kathleen, Robert, Geraldine (Fred Dreher) of Madison and Gerald. He is preceded in death by his parents and youngest brother, Gerald. John graduated from Madison Edgewood in 1936. He then attended the University of Wisconsin graduating with a degree in Biology in 1940. On September 26, 1942 he married his high school sweetheart, Irene Geier at Holy Redeemer Church. He then attended Northwestern Medical School and graduated in 1944. Following a rotating internship at Cook County Hospital, John served in the Navy and was stationed in Japan at the close of World War II. He returned stateside and completed a general surgery residency at Hines VA Hospital in Chicago. John and Irene returned to Madison, where he began his practice in General Surgery at St. Mary's Hospital and Madison General. John and Irene were blessed with seven children, Deanna (Jeff Soik) of Lodi, Mari (Dale Werner) of Watertown, John of Madison, Mark (Lena) of Detroit Michigan, Leo (Cheryl) of Endwell, New York, Joseph (Pat) of Chantilly, Virginia and Michael of Madison. He is preceded in death by his loving wife Irene (2000), Joseph his son (April 2010) and Leo his son (May 2011). John was a devoted husband, a loving father and a kind and compassionate physician. His passions included his children, grandchildren and playing golf at Odana Hills Golf Course.  A Mass of Christian Burial will be held at Blessed Sacrament, 2115 Rowley Ave., Madison on Monday June 27, 2011 at 10:30am with burial to follow.

Both meetings left me with a feeling of regret that I didn't have enough time to get to know him, as he left such an impression as an intelligent, thoughtful, and interesting man.  In retrospect however, I guess I did get to know him in a way through his son Leo, who shared the same traits which I now realize were his father's legacy to him.  Rest in peace Dr. McDermott, and say hello to Leo for me.
