                The Top 5 All-Cap Growth Mutual Funds for 2016            


    By Andriy Blokhin | December 28, 2015 — 2:59 PM EST    






Share















































Growth stocks still retain their allure among investors despite episodes of heightened volatility in 2015, and many mutual funds offer all-cap growth exposure at a reasonable expense. These types of stocks tend to exhibit higher growth rates of earnings per share and sales due to market share expansion as a result of offering new or disruptive products. Sometimes there is no need for a new product, but only a skill of serving existing products better than competitors on the part of a growth company.
Growth companies typically have a mid-cap or small-cap profile. These companies are typically associated with greater investment risk, as they are smaller and have a high degree of operating leverage. Moreover, growth rates can be very quickly adjusted down due to macroeconomic fears and operational challenges.
A significant decline in oil and gas prices resulted in overall bond and equity sell-off in the industrial sector toward the end of 2015. Yet, there is little evidence this sell-off will spread to other sectors since the U.S. economy typically benefits from low oil and gas prices. Also, the U.S. Federal Reserve raised the interest rate in 2015 for the first time in over a decade by a quarter of a percent. While many analysts contend the future interest rate increases will be very modest, it is unlikely they will have a significantly negative effect on growth stocks going into 2016. Instead, investors should focus on fundamentals of growth companies and keep a close look on macroeconomic factors, such as consumer spending and overall U.S. economic growth.
American Century All Cap Growth Fund Investor Class
Assets Under Management (AUM): $1.1 billion
2010-2015 Average Annual Net Asset Value (NAV) Return: 12.24%
Net Expense Ratio: 1%
The American Century All Cap Growth Fund Investor Class invests in companies of any market capitalization that show increasing earnings growth and positive momentum. The fund has very high allocation to information technology stocks that account for about 30% of its assets. Consumer discretionary companies have 22% allocation, while health care stocks account for 19% of the fund's assets. The fund has somewhat concentrated holdings with certain companies accounting for over 7% of the total assets. The top-five holdings account for over 21% of the fund's portfolio. Although the portfolio composition fluctuates, 80% of the fund's holdings were large-cap stocks in 2015, while the remainder was concentrated in mid-cap equities. The fund has received a four-star overall rating from Morningstar. It charges no load fees and requires individuals to contribute at least $2,500.
Value Line Premier Growth Fund
AUM: $333 million
2010-2015 Average Annual NAV Return: 12.73%
Net Expense Ratio: 1.23%
The Value Line Premier Growth Fund seeks long-term capital appreciation by investing in stocks with different capitalization that exhibit favorable growth prospects. The fund combines fundamental and price momentum approaches to select holdings for its portfolio. Compared to other peers, the fund invests a large portion of its assets in industrial equities with about 31% allocation, while health care stocks have the second-largest weight with about 16% allocation.
Most of the fund's holdings are concentrated in mid-cap stocks that account for 48% of its portfolio, while large-cap equities have about 44% allocation. The fund's holdings are well-diversified with no single equity accounting for more than 2%. The fund's top 10 holdings have 17.5% allocation. Morningstar awarded the Value Line Premier Growth Fund with a four-star overall rating. It has no load fees and requires a $1,000 minimum contribution from investors.
Hennessy Focus Fund
AUM: $2.2 billion
2010-2015 Average Annual NAV Return: 15.01%
Net Expense Ratio: 1.41%
The Hennessy Focus Fund invests in high-quality, growth-oriented stocks with favorable fundamental characteristics, such as competitive characteristics, management and quality of earnings. Unlike other mutual funds, the Hennessy Focus Fund typically holds a concentrated portfolio with about 20 to 30 stocks with the intent to own these equities for at least five years. Financials-sector stocks have the highest allocation of 44%, while consumer discretionary equities account for about 27% of the fund's assets. The fund's top 10 holdings have over 64% allocation, as some of its equity holdings account for 11% of the fund's portfolio, such as O'Reilly Automotive Inc.
The Hennessy Focus Fund has an exceptionally low turnover ratio of 3% due to its long-term commitment to its holdings. It has earned a five-star overall rating from Morningstar for its exceptional risk-adjusted performance. The fund comes with no load fees and requires a $2,500 minimum investment.
JPMorgan Growth Advantage A Fund
AUM: $6.3 billion
2010-2015 Average Annual NAV Return: 16.05%
Net Expense Ratio: 1.24%
The JPMorgan Growth Advantage A Fund invests in common stocks across all market capitalizations with high earnings growth potential. The fund seeks prospective holdings with large or growing addressable markets, sustainable competitive advantage and solid management. While the fund has large mid-cap equity holdings, it is not constrained by a particular market cap when making its investment decisions. It has an overweight position in information technology equities with over 34% allocation, while consumer discretionary stocks have about 18% allocation. The fund's holdings are very widely dispersed with no single stock accounting for more than 1% of its portfolio. It has a high concentration in large-cap stocks with about 60% allocation. Mid-cap stocks account for 35%, and small-cap equities account for 5% of the fund's assets.
The JPMorgan Growth Advantage A Fund has earned a four-star overall rating from Morningstar. To promote a long-term profile of its investors, the fund charges a load fee of 5.25%, which can be waived under certain circumstances. It has a $1,000 minimum investment requirement.
Aquila Three Peaks Opportunity Growth Fund Class A
AUM: $469 million
2010-2015 Average Annual NAV Return: 15.39%
Net Expense Ratio: 1.55%
The Aquila Three Peaks Opportunity Growth Fund Class A invests in stocks of all capitalizations with strong potential for capital appreciation. The fund has a particular overweight position in consumer cyclical stocks with about 42% allocation, while information technology equities have 18% allocation. No single holding of the fund accounts for more than 5% of its portfolio.
Despite its somewhat high expense ratio, the Aquila Three Peaks Opportunity Growth Fund Class A has demonstrated very strong returns over the last five and 10 years. It has received a four-star overall rating from Morningstar. The fund comes with a 4.25% load fee and requires a$1,000 minimum investment.
Bottom Line
While it remains uncertain how the investment community will react to slowing global growth in 2016 and the effect of an interest rate increase by the U.S. Federal Reserve, investors who are willing to commit their funds to growth stocks can benefit over a long-term horizon.

                Top 4 Communications Mutual Funds            


    By Melissa Horton | October 8, 2015 — 8:12 AM EDT    






Share















































The telecommunications industry consists of a wide range of companies that participate in providing a variety of communication over a distance. Communications companies include those that engage in offering consumers and businesses telephone services, television, radio, wireless networks and computer networks, as well as companies that produce hardware and software to make telecommunication services more efficient or accessible. The communications industry is robust and continually expanding due to advances in technology, which provides investors an opportunity to participate in a growth-oriented equity market when purchasing telecommunication funds.
Companies that operate in the communications sector have the potential to generate impressive returns for investors, especially those involved in creating, maintaining or distributing new communications technology. However, the industry carries with it a degree of risk, which leads to a high level of volatility when compared to the broader market. As is the case with the majority of growth-focused securities, communications stocks expose investors to market risk, liquidity risk and regulatory risk, all of which can lead to severe declines in value over time. New entrants to the telecommunications market are less of a threat to established companies in the sector due to government-imposed barriers to entry, but strong competition remains among the largest players within the industry. Investors can best utilize leverage in the sector's growth potential by including other equity and debt holdings diversified among non-correlated sectors in domestic and international markets. Mutual funds provide a less risky method to participate in the communications sector, as each fund has multiple equity positions meant to reduce overall risk exposure for investors.
T. Rowe Price Media and Telecommunications Fund
The T. Rowe Price Media and Telecommunications Fund was established in October 2013, and it is currently managed by Paul D. Greene II through T. Rowe Price Investments. The mutual fund seeks to provide investors with long-term capital growth by investing the fund's assets in common stock of media, telecommunications and technology companies. The majority of the fund's $3.41 billion managed assets is used to purchase companies that fall into the large- or mid-cap range that engage in activities related to the Internet, publishing, movies, cable and satellite television, telephones, cellular services, and technology equipment. The fund's managers invest in foreign and domestic issuers as part of the investment mix.
As of September 2015, the T. Rowe Price Media and Telecommunications Fund has generated a 10-year annualized return of 14.55%. The fund's expense ratio is 0.8%, which is lower than the telecommunications mutual fund category average expense ratio of 1.32%. Investors are not charged an upfront or deferred load on the purchase or redemption of shares, but a minimum initial investment of $2,500 is required for non-qualified accounts. Top holdings within the mutual fund include Amazon at 6.74%, American Tower Corporation at 5.34%, Liberty Global at 5.29%, Crown Castle International Corporation at 5.2% and the Priceline Group at 5.15%.
Putnam Global Telecommunication Fund
The Putnam Global Telecommunication Fund launched in December 2008 and has been managed by Vivek Gandhi since that time. The mutual fund seeks to provide investors capital appreciation over the long term by investing the majority of investor assets in common stock of large- and mid-cap companies around the world. Companies included in the fund are those directly involved in activities related to development, manufacturing or sale of communication services or communication equipment. Fund managers select a blend of both growth and value stocks. They can invest in derivatives, such as futures, options, foreign currency transactions, warrants and swap contracts for the purpose of hedging at the fund manager's discretion.
The mutual fund has generated a five-year annualized return of 15.65% for investors, with an expense ratio of 1.29%. Investors are required to pay an upfront sales charge of 5.75% for any purchase of shares, although a deferred sales charge is not imposed. No minimum initial investment is required. Top holdings within the Putnam Global Telecommunication Fund include Vodafone Group at 12%, AT&T at 10.57%, Softbank Corporation at 6.03%, Telecom Italia at 5.88% and KDDI Corporation at 4.92%.
Fidelity Select Wireless Portfolio
Fidelity Select Wireless Portfolio was established in 2000 and is currently managed by Kyle Weaver with Fidelity Investments. The mutual fund seeks to provide capital appreciation by investing a minimum of 80% of fund assets in securities of companies primarily engaged in wireless communication services or products. The fund's investment mix includes foreign and domestic issuers, and the fund's managers utilize fundamental analysis to screen each security for overall financial strength and industry position. As of September 2015, the mutual fund manages $234.57 million assets.
The Fidelity Select Wireless Portfolio has generated a 10-year annualized return of 7.62%, with an expense ratio of 0.85%. The mutual fund is no-load, but a minimum initial investment of $2,500 is required for both qualified and non-qualified accounts. Top holdings with the mutual fund include Apple, Inc. at 24.12%, American Tower Corporation at 7.74%, Qualcomm, Inc. at 6.43%, AT&T, Inc. at 5.24% and Vodafone Group at 5.13%.
Rydex Telecommunications Fund
The Rydex Telecommunications Fund began in September 2004 and has been managed by Michael P. Byrum since its establishment. Byrum and his team of portfolio managers seek to provide investors capital appreciation within the fund by investing a minimum of 80% of fund assets in equity securities of telecommunications companies headquartered within the United States. The fund may also invest in certain derivatives, including futures contracts, options on securities and stock indexes, as the fund manager's discretion. The majority of holdings within the mutual fund fall within the mid- and small-cap categories. As of September 2015, the mutual fund manages $11.88 million in investor assets.
The Rydex Telecommunications Fund has generated a 10-year annualized return of 1.14%, with relatively high expense ratio of 1.6%. An upfront sales charge of 4.75% is required of investors making new share purchases, although it does not assess a deferred sales charge. A minimum initial investment of $2.500 is required for non-qualified accounts. Top holdings within the mutual fund include Verizon Communications at 8.63%, AT&T at 8.4%, Cisco Systems, Inc. at 7.39%, Qualcomm,, Inc. at 6.32% and T-Mobile at 3.56%.

Our Story
EquityZen began with the goal of solving our personal attempts to diversify our holdings. EquityZen eases the pain facing private company employees (and founders, investors, and former employees) that find themselves heavily concentrated in their own company's equity.












































Investments in private placements holding pre-IPO companies are speculative, illiquid, and carry a high degree of risk, including loss of principal.
Investments made on the EquityZen platform are made through pooled investment vehicles, which acquire shares of private technology companies, and are not direct investments in these companies.





We were tired of hearing a recurring story: employees held a majority of their net worth in company stock that was both illiquid and hard to value. Concurrently, investors sought exposure to post-seed, but pre-IPO startups and had nowhere to go for attractive valuations.
As passionate entrepreneurs and experienced investors facing this issue ourselves, we sought to marry two complementary parties. EquityZen was born in 2013. We provide a secure marketplace that matches shareholder offerings with investor demand, through a product that neither adds to shareholder count nor dilutes current investors. (Learn more here.)
Our long term goals are to:

reduce the risk of joining a growing private firm, and
keep employees and employers focused by addressing liquidity and risk concerns.

Let's get you started. Tell us what you're looking for here.

Summary







 


Overall Rating

5 out of 5 Stars

Morningstar has awarded this fund 5 stars based on its risk-adjusted performance compared to the 1277 funds within its Morningstar Category.



How is it determined?


The Overall Morningstar RatingTM for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics, which are based on risk-adjusted returns, as of the date stated.





3 Yrs





                         Out of
1,277
 funds
                     	




What does it mean?


A fund's Morningstar Rating is a quantitative assessment of a fund's past performance that accounts for both risk and return, with funds earning between 1 and 5 stars. As always, this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process. A high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision.











 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


High


This fund scored High because it delivered returns that were in the top 10% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category over a 3-year period.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category: top 10% - High next 22.5% - Above Average middle 35% - Average next 22.5% - Below Average bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Expenses


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Below Average


This fund's expenses are rated as Below Average because they fall between the 20th and 40th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category





How is it calculated?


This Morningstar data point compares the fund's net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its Morningstar Category grouping.





What does it mean?


Excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance. While you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios, a fund's expense structure may be one factor to consider.











 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Fund Overview




Objective



Seeks capital appreciation.




Strategy



Normally investing primarily in common stocks. Investing in companies that FMR believes have above-average growth potential (stocks of these companies are often called "growth" stocks). Investing in domestic and foreign issuers. Using fundamental analysis of factors such as each issuer's financial condition and industry position, as well as market and economic conditions, to select investments.


Risk



Stock markets, especially foreign markets, are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Foreign securities are subject to interest rate, currency exchange rate, economic, and political risks. "Growth" stocks can perform differently from the market as a whole and other types of stocks and can be more volatile than other types of stocks.

Risk


LOW
AVG
HIGH


High

This fund scores High because Morningstar has rated its risk above the 80th percentile when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.




How is it calculated?


Risk is calculated using the Sharpe ratio, which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to U.S. Treasury bonds, relative to the fund's overall volatility. For this measure, Morningstar has compared the Sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in it's Morningstar Category.




What does it mean?


A higher Sharpe implies better risk-adjusted returns. Therefore, if a fund has a Sharpe ratio higher than its category average, it's returns relative to it's risk were better than other similar funds. If its Sharpe ratio is lower, that's usually a sign that the risk-adjusted returns were lower than other similar funds.










 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


High


This fund scored High because it delivered returns that were in the top 10% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category over a 3-year period.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category: top 10% - High next 22.5% - Above Average middle 35% - Average next 22.5% - Below Average bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Risk



Stock markets, especially foreign markets, are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Foreign securities are subject to interest rate, currency exchange rate, economic, and political risks. "Growth" stocks can perform differently from the market as a whole and other types of stocks and can be more volatile than other types of stocks.

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. (Exchange-traded funds and open-end mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes.) It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of  funds in each fund category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

© 2016 Morningstar, Inc. All rights reserved. The Morningstar information contained herein: (1) is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its content providers; (2) may not be copied or redistributed; and (3) is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Fidelity does not review the Morningstar data and, for fund performance, you should check the fund's current prospectus or other product materials for the most up-to-date information concerning applicable loads, fees and expenses.

The "Mutual Funds" area at the top of each page allows access to mutual fund holdings with individual and joint Fidelity non-retirement accounts. Individual stock positions, ETFs and 529 funds are not available through this view. For the full list of your holdings visit Portfolio Summary.Mutual Funds are priced as of the previous business day's market close when the market is open. Mutual fund positions are priced as of the official market close (typically 4p.m.) and prices are generally available between 5 p.m. and 6p.m.

The performance data featured represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.  Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate; therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.  Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.











1. No Transaction Fee Fidelity funds are available without paying a trading fee to Fidelity or a sales load to the fund. However, the fund may charge a short-term trading or redemption fee to protect the interests of long-term shareholders of the fund. Shares are subject to the fund's management and operating expenses. See Expenses & Fees for more information.
2. Total returns are historical and include change in share value and reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, if any. Cumulative total returns are reported as of the period indicated.  Life of fund figures are reported as of the commencement date to the period indicated and are cumulative if the fund is less than one year old. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sales charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower.
3. The Morningstar Category Average is the average return for the peer group based on the returns of each individual fund within the group, for the period shown. This average assumes reinvestment of dividends.
4. This chart illustrates the performance of a hypothetical $10,000 investment made in this investment product (and a benchmark or category average, if shown) from the beginning date shown or on the inception date of the product (whichever is later).  The inception date used for products with underlying funds, or multiple shares classes, or are offered as a separate account, strategy or sub account, may be the inception date of the underlying fund, the earliest share class of the product, or the date composite performance for the product was first made available. The product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Benchmark returns include reinvestment of capital gains and dividends, if any, but do not reflect any fees or expenses. It is not possible to invest in an index. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This chart is not intended to imply any future performance of the investment product.
5. Any holdings, asset allocation, diversification breakdowns or other composition data shown are as of the date indicated and are subject to change at any time.  They may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments.  The Top Ten Holdings and Top 5 Issuers do not include money market instruments or futures contracts, if any.  Depository receipts are normally combined with the underlying security.  Some breakdowns may be intentionally limited to a particular asset class or other subset of the fund's entire portfolio, particularly in multi-asset class funds where the attributes of the equity and fixed income portions are different.Under the asset allocation section, international (or foreign) assets may be reported differently depending on how an investment option reports its holdings. Some do not report international (or foreign) holdings here, but instead report them in a "Regional Diversification" section. Some report them in this section in addition to the equity, bond and other allocation shown. Others report international (or foreign) holding as a subset of the equity and bond allocations shown. If the allocation without the foreign component equals (or rounds to) 100%, then international (or foreign) is a subset of the equity and bond percentage shown.
6. Percent Rank in Category is the fund's total-return percentile rank relative to all funds that have the same Morningstar Category.  The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. The top-performing fund in a category will always receive a rank of 1. % Rank in Category is based on total returns which include reinvested dividends and capital gains, if any, and exclude sales charges.
7. The percent of net assets invested in both domestic and foreign Equities (common stocks, preferred stocks, rights and warrants, convertible preferred stocks and stock index futures and options), Bond (all debt instruments, including investment grade, non-investment grade, non-rated securities and convertible bonds), and Cash & Net Other Assets (cash, repurchase agreements, receivables and payables).
8. "Tax-Advantaged Domiciles" represent countries whose tax policies may be favorable for company incorporation.
9. Net Other Assets can include fund receivables, fund payables, and offsets to other derivative positions, as well as certain assets that do not fall into any of the Portfolio Composition categories. Depending on the extent to which the fund invests in derivatives and the number of positions that are held for future settlement, Net Other Assets can be a negative number.
10. StyleMap® depictions of mutual fund characteristics are produced using data and calculations provided by Morningstar, Inc. StyleMapsSM estimate characteristics of a fund's equity holdings over two dimensions: market capitalization and valuation. The percentage of fund assets represented by these holdings is indicated beside each StyleMap. Current StyleMap characteristics are calculated each time Morningstar receives updated portfolio holdings from a fund and are denoted with a dot. Historical StyleMap characteristics are calculated for the shorter of either the past 3 years or the life of the fund, and are represented by the shading of the box(es) previously occupied by the dot. StyleMap characteristics represent an approximate profile of the fund's equity holdings (e.g., domestic stocks, foreign stocks, and American Depositary Receipts), are based on historical data, and are not predictive of the fund's future investments. Although the data are gathered from reliable sources, accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed.
11. Expense Cap is a limit that the fund company has placed on the level of the expenses borne by the fund until 1/31/2021 and indicates the maximum level of expenses (with certain exceptions) that the fund would be paying until that time.  After the expiration date, the expense cap may be terminated or revised, which may lower the fund's yield and return.


Generally, data on Fidelity mutual funds is provided by FMR, LLC, Morningstar ratings and data on non-Fidelity mutual funds is provided by Morningstar, Inc. and data on non-mutual fund products is provided by the product's investment manager, trustee or issuer or the plan sponsor whose plan is offering the product to  participants.  Although Fidelity believes the data gathered from these third-party sources is reliable, it does not review such information and cannot warrant it to be accurate, complete or timely.  Fidelity is not responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this third-party information.

Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the fund or annuity and its investment options. Contact Fidelity for a free prospectus and, if available, summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.

Your privacy is important
At EquityZen INC (the "Company"), your privacy is very important to us. The purpose of this privacy policy (this "Policy") is to provide you with a description of the types of information we collect about you when you visit the EquityZen web site located at equityzen.com, and associated sub-domains (the "Site"), and how we use that information. By visiting or using the Site you agree to the provisions of our Terms of Use and this Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Policy, please do not use or access the Site or use the Services (defined below). This Policy only applies to information collected while you are on the Site. For more information on how the Site may redirect you to other web sites, please see the "Links and Redirection to Third Party Sites" section below.
Information We Collect
We collect and store information that you voluntarily provide to us as well as data related to your Site visit.
In some areas of the Site, we request or may request that you provide personally identifiable information, including your name, address, email address, telephone number, username, and other information from which your identity is or may be discernible. We collect personally identifiable information from our users at several different points on the Site. We will also allow you the opportunity to provide information identifying yourself as an investor or borrower and, if you are a borrower, the amount you will be seeking, your desired target rate, the intended use of funds and loan duration. Such information is collected for the purpose of contacting you with information regarding prospective investment or borrowing opportunities (as applicable) based on your specified interests (the "Services"). It is solely up to you whether you furnish such information. If you do provide such information, you are thereby consenting to the use of that information in accordance with the policies and practices described in this Policy. This information may be stored on our servers, and on the servers of third party service providers.
In addition, during your visit we automatically collect certain aggregate information and analytical data related to your Site visit (see "Use of Cookies" below). Aggregate information is non-personally identifiable or anonymous information about you, including the date and time of your visit, the IP address of your computer or mobile device, your computer or mobile device browser information, the Internet address that you visited prior to and after reaching the Site, the name of the domain and host you used to access the Internet, the type of mobile device you use, your mobile device's unique device ID and the features of our Site which you accessed. This data is in no way associated with your personally identifiable information.
How We Use Information
We use collected information to make available and to improve our high standard of reliable services. We use such information to:

respond to inquiries or service requests and monitor such responses;
provide information about and market our Services;
resolve problems; and
manage the Site and assess its usage and usage of the Services.

Disclosure of Information
We do not sell or rent personally identifiable information to third parties who are not affiliates of the Company. Information that you provide will not be shared with any other user of the Site without your consent. We may disclose personally identifiable information to appropriate affiliates of the Company, including strategic alliance affiliates and third party service providers, to respond to a request for service or to provide information about available products or services. We are not limited in our use of non-personal information that does not permit direct association with any specific individual, or non-identifiable aggregate information about our users (such as the number of users of our Services, the geographic distribution of our users, the amount of information located and/or removed, etc.).
We disclose information that we, in good faith, believe is appropriate to cooperate in investigations of fraud or other illegal activity, or to conduct investigations of violations of our Terms of Use. For example, this means that if we conduct a fraud investigation and conclude that one side has engaged in deceptive practices, we can give that person or entity's contact information to victims who request it.
We disclose information in response to a subpoena, warrant, court order, levy, attachment, order of a court-appointed receiver or other comparable legal process, including subpoenas from private parties in a civil action. If the subpoena seeks information about an identified user or limited group of users, we'll make reasonable business efforts to contact the user(s) before providing information to the party that requests it. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to contact the user(s) in all cases, whether because of a time limit, court order, inability to effectively contact a user, or for any other reason.
We may disclose information to your agent or legal representative (such as the holder of a power of attorney that you grant, or a guardian appointed for you).
We share information with companies that provide public relations and marketing services for us. Such information will only be shared by us to customize, measure and improve our products, Services and advertising; it will not be shared with third parties for their marketing purposes. These third parties are obligated to protect your information and are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose.
As with any other business, it is possible that in the future we could merge with or be acquired by another company. If such an acquisition occurs, the successor company would have access to the information maintained by us, including customer account information, but would continue to be bound by this Policy unless and until it is amended.
We share your information with our parent, subsidiaries and joint ventures to help coordinate the Services we provide to you, enforce our terms and conditions, and promote trust and safety.
We may share aggregate (non-personally identifiable) information with certain third parties such as advertisers, national industry organizations, and prospective affiliates. In addition, we reserve the right to disclose aggregate information and personally identifiable information to third parties as required or permitted by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights.

Your privacy is important
At EquityZen INC (the "Company"), your privacy is very important to us. The purpose of this privacy policy (this "Policy") is to provide you with a description of the types of information we collect about you when you visit the EquityZen web site located at equityzen.com, and associated sub-domains (the "Site"), and how we use that information. By visiting or using the Site you agree to the provisions of our Terms of Use and this Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Policy, please do not use or access the Site or use the Services (defined below). This Policy only applies to information collected while you are on the Site. For more information on how the Site may redirect you to other web sites, please see the "Links and Redirection to Third Party Sites" section below.
Information We Collect
We collect and store information that you voluntarily provide to us as well as data related to your Site visit.
In some areas of the Site, we request or may request that you provide personally identifiable information, including your name, address, email address, telephone number, username, and other information from which your identity is or may be discernible. We collect personally identifiable information from our users at several different points on the Site. We will also allow you the opportunity to provide information identifying yourself as an investor or borrower and, if you are a borrower, the amount you will be seeking, your desired target rate, the intended use of funds and loan duration. Such information is collected for the purpose of contacting you with information regarding prospective investment or borrowing opportunities (as applicable) based on your specified interests (the "Services"). It is solely up to you whether you furnish such information. If you do provide such information, you are thereby consenting to the use of that information in accordance with the policies and practices described in this Policy. This information may be stored on our servers, and on the servers of third party service providers.
In addition, during your visit we automatically collect certain aggregate information and analytical data related to your Site visit (see "Use of Cookies" below). Aggregate information is non-personally identifiable or anonymous information about you, including the date and time of your visit, the IP address of your computer or mobile device, your computer or mobile device browser information, the Internet address that you visited prior to and after reaching the Site, the name of the domain and host you used to access the Internet, the type of mobile device you use, your mobile device's unique device ID and the features of our Site which you accessed. This data is in no way associated with your personally identifiable information.
How We Use Information
We use collected information to make available and to improve our high standard of reliable services. We use such information to:

respond to inquiries or service requests and monitor such responses;
provide information about and market our Services;
resolve problems; and
manage the Site and assess its usage and usage of the Services.

Disclosure of Information
We do not sell or rent personally identifiable information to third parties who are not affiliates of the Company. Information that you provide will not be shared with any other user of the Site without your consent. We may disclose personally identifiable information to appropriate affiliates of the Company, including strategic alliance affiliates and third party service providers, to respond to a request for service or to provide information about available products or services. We are not limited in our use of non-personal information that does not permit direct association with any specific individual, or non-identifiable aggregate information about our users (such as the number of users of our Services, the geographic distribution of our users, the amount of information located and/or removed, etc.).
We disclose information that we, in good faith, believe is appropriate to cooperate in investigations of fraud or other illegal activity, or to conduct investigations of violations of our Terms of Use. For example, this means that if we conduct a fraud investigation and conclude that one side has engaged in deceptive practices, we can give that person or entity's contact information to victims who request it.
We disclose information in response to a subpoena, warrant, court order, levy, attachment, order of a court-appointed receiver or other comparable legal process, including subpoenas from private parties in a civil action. If the subpoena seeks information about an identified user or limited group of users, we'll make reasonable business efforts to contact the user(s) before providing information to the party that requests it. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to contact the user(s) in all cases, whether because of a time limit, court order, inability to effectively contact a user, or for any other reason.
We may disclose information to your agent or legal representative (such as the holder of a power of attorney that you grant, or a guardian appointed for you).
We share information with companies that provide public relations and marketing services for us. Such information will only be shared by us to customize, measure and improve our products, Services and advertising; it will not be shared with third parties for their marketing purposes. These third parties are obligated to protect your information and are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose.
As with any other business, it is possible that in the future we could merge with or be acquired by another company. If such an acquisition occurs, the successor company would have access to the information maintained by us, including customer account information, but would continue to be bound by this Policy unless and until it is amended.
We share your information with our parent, subsidiaries and joint ventures to help coordinate the Services we provide to you, enforce our terms and conditions, and promote trust and safety.
We may share aggregate (non-personally identifiable) information with certain third parties such as advertisers, national industry organizations, and prospective affiliates. In addition, we reserve the right to disclose aggregate information and personally identifiable information to third parties as required or permitted by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights.

                            EquityZen gets shares of companies that others don't. They have interesting ways of getting exposure to shares of companies I really couldn't find anywhere else.
                        

Savneet Singh
Co-Founder, Gold Bullion International^




                            It was great doing business with you guys. You are much better than your competitors who I was dealing with! 10 million times!

Shareholder In Multi-billion-dollar Company^




                            Through EquityZen, I got cash for my private stock, at both a better price and larger volume than the company itself offered through SecondMarket. The whole process was very straightforward and efficient.

                            EquityZen is helping us buy a house and is making it much easier to get it done. We are grateful for your service.

            Investment opportunities posted on this website are “private placements” of securities that are not publicly traded, are subject to holding period requirements, and are intended for investors who do not need a liquid investment.
            Private placement investments are NOT bank deposits (and thus NOT insured by the FDIC or by any other federal governmental agency), are NOT guaranteed by EquityZen Securities, and MAY lose value.
            Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor any federal or state securities commission or regulatory authority has recommended or approved any investment or the accuracy or completeness of any of the information or materials provided by or through the website.
            Investors must be able to afford the loss of their entire investment.

            Offers to sell, or the solicitations of offers to buy, any security can only be made through official offering documents that contain important information about risks, fees and expenses.
            Investing in private companies may be considered highly speculative and involves a high degree of risk, including the risk of substantial loss of investment.

Anytech (Asian-Americans in NY Tech)
Working in the start up world, we are all presented with equity and options. How can we as employees take advantage of the options that are presented and how should we as founders design the package for our extended team? We will provide an overview on startup options/ equity and delve into specific cases and look at liquidity options (including EquityZen & secondary marketplaces).  This is a confusing topic that applies to almost all startup employees so we will also take questions from the audience during the event as well. Feel free to post them in the wall of the event for a head start.

                                I thought I'd let you know that I find EquityZen to generally be the best of the secondary platforms.

The purpose of this privacy policy (this "Policy") is to provide you with a description of the types of information we collect about you when you visit the EquityZen web site located at equityzen.com, and associated sub-domains (the "Site"), and how we use that information. By visiting or using the Site you agree to the provisions of our Terms of Use and this Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Policy, please do not use or access the Site or use the Services (defined below). This Policy only applies to information collected while you are on the Site. For more information on how the Site may redirect you to other web sites, please see the "Links and Redirection to Third Party Sites" section below.
Information We Collect
We collect and store information that you voluntarily provide to us as well as data related to your Site visit.
In some areas of the Site, we request or may request that you provide personally identifiable information, including your name, address, email address, telephone number, username, and other information from which your identity is or may be discernible. We collect personally identifiable information from our users at several different points on the Site. We will also allow you the opportunity to provide information identifying yourself as an investor or borrower and, if you are a borrower, the amount you will be seeking, your desired target rate, the intended use of funds and loan duration. Such information is collected for the purpose of contacting you with information regarding prospective investment or borrowing opportunities (as applicable) based on your specified interests (the "Services"). It is solely up to you whether you furnish such information. If you do provide such information, you are thereby consenting to the use of that information in accordance with the policies and practices described in this Policy. This information may be stored on our servers, and on the servers of third party service providers.
In addition, during your visit we automatically collect certain aggregate information and analytical data related to your Site visit (see "Use of Cookies" below). Aggregate information is non-personally identifiable or anonymous information about you, including the date and time of your visit, the IP address of your computer or mobile device, your computer or mobile device browser information, the Internet address that you visited prior to and after reaching the Site, the name of the domain and host you used to access the Internet, the type of mobile device you use, your mobile device's unique device ID and the features of our Site which you accessed. This data is in no way associated with your personally identifiable information.
How We Use Information
We use collected information to make available and to improve our high standard of reliable services. We use such information to:

Disclosure of Information
We do not sell or rent personally identifiable information to third parties who are not affiliates of the Company. Information that you provide will not be shared with any other user of the Site without your consent. We may disclose personally identifiable information to appropriate affiliates of the Company, including strategic alliance affiliates and third party service providers, to respond to a request for service or to provide information about available products or services. We are not limited in our use of non-personal information that does not permit direct association with any specific individual, or non-identifiable aggregate information about our users (such as the number of users of our Services, the geographic distribution of our users, the amount of information located and/or removed, etc.).
We disclose information that we, in good faith, believe is appropriate to cooperate in investigations of fraud or other illegal activity, or to conduct investigations of violations of our Terms of Use. For example, this means that if we conduct a fraud investigation and conclude that one side has engaged in deceptive practices, we can give that person or entity's contact information to victims who request it.
We disclose information in response to a subpoena, warrant, court order, levy, attachment, order of a court-appointed receiver or other comparable legal process, including subpoenas from private parties in a civil action. If the subpoena seeks information about an identified user or limited group of users, we'll make reasonable business efforts to contact the user(s) before providing information to the party that requests it. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to contact the user(s) in all cases, whether because of a time limit, court order, inability to effectively contact a user, or for any other reason.
We may disclose information to your agent or legal representative (such as the holder of a power of attorney that you grant, or a guardian appointed for you).
We share information with companies that provide public relations and marketing services for us. Such information will only be shared by us to customize, measure and improve our products, Services and advertising; it will not be shared with third parties for their marketing purposes. These third parties are obligated to protect your information and are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose.
As with any other business, it is possible that in the future we could merge with or be acquired by another company. If such an acquisition occurs, the successor company would have access to the information maintained by us, including customer account information, but would continue to be bound by this Policy unless and until it is amended.
We share your information with our parent, subsidiaries and joint ventures to help coordinate the Services we provide to you, enforce our terms and conditions, and promote trust and safety.
We may share aggregate (non-personally identifiable) information with certain third parties such as advertisers, national industry organizations, and prospective affiliates. In addition, we reserve the right to disclose aggregate information and personally identifiable information to third parties as required or permitted by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights.

The purpose of this privacy policy (this "Policy") is to provide you with a description of the types of information we collect about you when you visit the EquityZen web site located at equityzen.com, and associated sub-domains (the "Site"), and how we use that information. By visiting or using the Site you agree to the provisions of our Terms of Use and this Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Policy, please do not use or access the Site or use the Services (defined below). This Policy only applies to information collected while you are on the Site. For more information on how the Site may redirect you to other web sites, please see the "Links and Redirection to Third Party Sites" section below.
Information We Collect
We collect and store information that you voluntarily provide to us as well as data related to your Site visit.
In some areas of the Site, we request or may request that you provide personally identifiable information, including your name, address, email address, telephone number, username, and other information from which your identity is or may be discernible. We collect personally identifiable information from our users at several different points on the Site. We will also allow you the opportunity to provide information identifying yourself as an investor or borrower and, if you are a borrower, the amount you will be seeking, your desired target rate, the intended use of funds and loan duration. Such information is collected for the purpose of contacting you with information regarding prospective investment or borrowing opportunities (as applicable) based on your specified interests (the "Services"). It is solely up to you whether you furnish such information. If you do provide such information, you are thereby consenting to the use of that information in accordance with the policies and practices described in this Policy. This information may be stored on our servers, and on the servers of third party service providers.
In addition, during your visit we automatically collect certain aggregate information and analytical data related to your Site visit (see "Use of Cookies" below). Aggregate information is non-personally identifiable or anonymous information about you, including the date and time of your visit, the IP address of your computer or mobile device, your computer or mobile device browser information, the Internet address that you visited prior to and after reaching the Site, the name of the domain and host you used to access the Internet, the type of mobile device you use, your mobile device's unique device ID and the features of our Site which you accessed. This data is in no way associated with your personally identifiable information.
How We Use Information
We use collected information to make available and to improve our high standard of reliable services. We use such information to:

respond to inquiries or service requests and monitor such responses;
provide information about and market our Services;
resolve problems; and
manage the Site and assess its usage and usage of the Services.

Disclosure of Information
We do not sell or rent personally identifiable information to third parties who are not affiliates of the Company. Information that you provide will not be shared with any other user of the Site without your consent. We may disclose personally identifiable information to appropriate affiliates of the Company, including strategic alliance affiliates and third party service providers, to respond to a request for service or to provide information about available products or services. We are not limited in our use of non-personal information that does not permit direct association with any specific individual, or non-identifiable aggregate information about our users (such as the number of users of our Services, the geographic distribution of our users, the amount of information located and/or removed, etc.).
We disclose information that we, in good faith, believe is appropriate to cooperate in investigations of fraud or other illegal activity, or to conduct investigations of violations of our Terms of Use. For example, this means that if we conduct a fraud investigation and conclude that one side has engaged in deceptive practices, we can give that person or entity's contact information to victims who request it.
We disclose information in response to a subpoena, warrant, court order, levy, attachment, order of a court-appointed receiver or other comparable legal process, including subpoenas from private parties in a civil action. If the subpoena seeks information about an identified user or limited group of users, we'll make reasonable business efforts to contact the user(s) before providing information to the party that requests it. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to contact the user(s) in all cases, whether because of a time limit, court order, inability to effectively contact a user, or for any other reason.
We may disclose information to your agent or legal representative (such as the holder of a power of attorney that you grant, or a guardian appointed for you).
We share information with companies that provide public relations and marketing services for us. Such information will only be shared by us to customize, measure and improve our products, Services and advertising; it will not be shared with third parties for their marketing purposes. These third parties are obligated to protect your information and are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose.
As with any other business, it is possible that in the future we could merge with or be acquired by another company. If such an acquisition occurs, the successor company would have access to the information maintained by us, including customer account information, but would continue to be bound by this Policy unless and until it is amended.
We share your information with our parent, subsidiaries and joint ventures to help coordinate the Services we provide to you, enforce our terms and conditions, and promote trust and safety.
We may share aggregate (non-personally identifiable) information with certain third parties such as advertisers, national industry organizations, and prospective affiliates. In addition, we reserve the right to disclose aggregate information and personally identifiable information to third parties as required or permitted by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights.
Unsubscribe Options
If you choose to take advantage of the Services by signing up as either an investor or borrower, you will receive periodic emails regarding opportunities which, based on the information you provide, may be of interest. If you no longer wish to receive our communications, you may unsubscribe by following the instructions included in each communication.

Redfin: Path to IPO

Charlie Joyce
        |
        July 20, 2017



   Redfin, the Seattle-based real estate brokerage aiming to reshape the industry, recently priced its upcoming IPO between $12 - $14 per share. At this valuation, Redfin would become the latest tech unicorn on the public market. As the company heads towards its public listing, one big question lingers for investors: Should Redfin be valued as a real estate brokerage or as a tech company?

Shriram Bhashyam
        |
        July 06, 2017






   Starting July 10, 2017, all companies seeking an IPO, whether or not they qualify as emerging growth companies (“EGCs”), will be permitted to file their draft IPO registration statements confidentially. This is an important development, as it may lead to more IPOs and is a signal of tone shift at the SEC towards capital formation.

Tech IPO “Down Rounds”: EquityZen Runs the Numbers with Jeremy Abelson and Irving Investors

Phil Haslett
        |
        May 25, 2017



   The
   
    recent Cloudera IPO
   
   has re-ignited a discussion about down rounds. How could a private company
   
    possibly
   
   be valued at $30.92 per share in 2014, and then go public at $15? What could lead to such a corporate phenomenon? Do the valuation techniques of VC firms and Wall Street
   
    really
   
   differ by such a margin?
   


















         Cloudera's valuation was chopped in half between 2014 and 2017
        







   It turns out, down rounds are increasing in regularity, based on data analyzed by EquityZen and
   
    Irving Investors
   
   , a tech-focused hedge fund managed by Jeremy Abelson. But first…

Not So Obvious: Here's What To Know Between NSO and ISO Stock Options

Nat Disston
        |
        May 18, 2017







  The world of startup stock options can be pretty opaque. To outsiders, its seems all one does is join a small company, and, if it works,
  
   everyone becomes millionaires
  
  . For new employees, they often don’t know what
  
   they don’t know
  
  and are faced with piles of new
  
   documents
  
  and
  
   more questions
  
  once they join their budding business. Core to our mission is to help educate employees, companies, and their founders about their
  
   stock options
  
  and what they can do
  
   with their resulting shares

        April 13, 2017

   On January 4, 2017, President-Elect Donald Trump nominated Jay Clayton, a private sector Wall Street lawyer, to serve as the next Chairman of the SEC. While the confirmation hearings will tell us a lot about Mr. Clayton’s background, qualifications, and leanings, I can’t wait that long and preview here what the SEC’s agenda may look like in his tenure.

How to Hedge Against Private Company Valuations

Atish Davda

        January 05, 2017







    "How can I
hedge against private company valuations?"
    





    "Can I short
pre-IPO shares?"
    





    "How do I lock my
shares’ current price?"
    







   I often get variations of these questions. The answer is "no" – but, I usually point out other ways to enhance the private market portfolio. I thought EquityZen’s client base might find them interesting, so below are some ideas. If you have ideas on the matter, please send them my way via a comment or email.

We may disclose personally identifiable information to appropriate affiliates of the Company, including strategic alliance affiliates and third party service providers, to respond to a request for service or to provide information about available products or services.

We disclose information that we, in good faith, believe is appropriate to cooperate in investigations of fraud or other illegal activity, or to conduct investigations of violations of our Terms of Use.

We disclose information in response to a subpoena, warrant, court order, levy, attachment, order of a court-appointed receiver or other comparable legal process, including subpoenas from private parties in a civil action.

We cannot guarantee that we will be able to contact the user(s) in all cases, whether because of a time limit, court order, inability to effectively contact a user, or for any other reason.
We may disclose information to your agent or legal representative (such as the holder of a power of attorney that you grant, or a guardian appointed for you).
We share information with companies that provide public relations and marketing services for us. Such information will only be shared by us to customize, measure and improve our products, Services and advertising; it will not be shared with third parties for their marketing purposes. These third parties are obligated to protect your information and are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose.
As with any other business, it is possible that in the future we could merge with or be acquired by another company. If such an acquisition occurs, the successor company would have access to the information maintained by us, including customer account information, but would continue to be bound by this Policy unless and until it is amended.
We share your information with our parent, subsidiaries and joint ventures to help coordinate the Services we provide to you, enforce our terms and conditions, and promote trust and safety.
We may share aggregate (non-personally identifiable) information with certain third parties such as advertisers, national industry organizations, and prospective affiliates. In addition, we reserve the right to disclose aggregate information and personally identifiable information to third parties as required or permitted by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights.

State Street U.S. Extended Market Index Non-Lending Series Fund Class C (since 1/3/2011)























Fund Overview




Objective



The State Street U.S. Extended Market Index Fund (the "Fund") seeks an investment return that approximates as closely as practicable, before expenses, the performance of the Dow Jones U.S. Completion Total Stock Market Index SM (the "Index") over the long term.




Strategy



"The Fund is managed using a ""passive"" or ""indexing"" investment approach, by which SSGA attempts to match, before expenses, the performance of the Index. SSGA will typically attempt to invest in the equity securities comprising the Index, in approximately the same proportions as they are represented in the Index. Equity securities may include common stocks, preferred stocks, depository receipts, or other securities convertible into common stock. The Fund may purchase securities in their initial public offerings (""IPOs""). In some cases, it may not be possible or practicable to purchase all of the securities comprising the Index, or to hold them in the same weightings as they represent in the Index. In those circumstances, SSGA may employ a sampling or optimization technique to construct the portfolio in question. From time to time securities are added to or removed from the Index. SSGA may sell securities that are represented in the Index, or purchase securities that are not yet represented in the Index, prior to or after their removal or addition to the Index. The Fund may at times purchase or sell index futures contracts, or options on those futures, or engage in other transactions involving the use of derivatives, in lieu of investment directly in the securities making up the Index or to enhance the Fund's replication of the Index return. The Fund's return may not match the return of the Index."


Risk



Value and growth stocks can perform differently from other types of stocks. Growth stocks can be more volatile. Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time. The securities of smaller, less well-known companies can be more volatile than those of larger companies. Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, economic or other developments. These risks may be magnified in foreign markets. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.



Short Term Redemption Fee
None



Who May Want To Invest

Someone who is seeking the potential for long-term share-price appreciation and, secondarily, dividend income.
Someone who is seeking both growth- and value-style investments and who is willing to accept the generally greater volatility of investments in smaller companies.

Additional Disclosures

The investment option is a collective investment trust. The trustee is State Street Global Advisors Ltd Funds. It is managed by State Street Global Advisors. This description is only intended to provide a brief overview of the fund.
The Dow Jones U.S. Completion Total Stock Market Index is an unmanaged index that represents all U.S. equity issues with readily available prices, excluding components of the S&P 500.
This investment option is not a mutual fund.

© 2016 Morningstar, Inc. All rights reserved. The Morningstar information contained herein: (1) is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its content providers; (2) may not be copied or redistributed; and (3) is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Fidelity does not review the Morningstar data and, for fund performance, you should check the fund's current prospectus or other product materials for the most up-to-date information concerning applicable loads, fees and expenses.

The performance data featured represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.  Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate; therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.  Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.











1. Total returns are historical and include change in share value and reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, if any. Cumulative total returns are reported as of the period indicated.  Life of fund figures are reported as of the commencement date to the period indicated and are cumulative if the fund is less than one year old. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sales charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower.
2. Daily return information, including YTD (Daily) returns are calculated by Fidelity, using NAV and distribution information provided by third party providers, including, but not limited to: Investment Managers, Morningstar LLC, Plan Fiduciaries, Third party Trustees, Issuers and other outside entities.  The daily returns calculated by Fidelity may vary slightly from the non-daily returns calculated by the third party providers for similar time periods.  The official returns offered by the third party providers shall constitute the final returns for the investment option.
3. The Morningstar Category Average is the average return for the peer group based on the returns of each individual fund within the group, for the period shown. This average assumes reinvestment of dividends.
4. This chart illustrates the performance of a hypothetical $10,000 investment made in this investment product (and a benchmark or category average, if shown) from the beginning date shown or on the inception date of the product (whichever is later). Some products do not have monthly performance data available back to inception date. The inception date used for products with underlying funds, or multiple shares classes, or are offered as a separate account, strategy or sub account, may be the inception date of the underlying fund, the earliest share class of the product, or the date composite performance for the product was first made available. The product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Benchmark returns include reinvestment of capital gains and dividends, if any, but do not reflect any fees or expenses. It is not possible to invest in an index. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This chart is not intended to imply any future performance of the investment product.
5. Any holdings, asset allocation, diversification breakdowns or other composition data shown are as of the date indicated and are subject to change at any time.  They may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments.  Some breakdowns may be intentionally limited to a particular class or other subset of the fund's entire portfolio, particularly in asset allocation and hybrid funds, where for example, the attributes of the equity and fixed income portions are different.  Due to time-lags in reporting, the as-of date may be the date the data was reported rather than the date the fund held the assets.  For funds that invest in other funds, the underlying funds may report their holdings on different schedules, so the aggregated information presented may include results from a combination of reporting periods.
6. Percent Rank in Category is the fund's total-return percentile rank relative to all funds that have the same Morningstar Category.  The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. The top-performing fund in a category will always receive a rank of 1. % Rank in Category is based on total returns which include reinvested dividends and capital gains, if any, and exclude sales charges.
7. StyleMap® depictions of mutual fund characteristics are produced using data and calculations provided by Morningstar, Inc. StyleMapsSM estimate characteristics of a fund's equity holdings over two dimensions: market capitalization and valuation. The percentage of fund assets represented by these holdings is indicated beside each StyleMap. Current StyleMap characteristics are calculated each time Morningstar receives updated portfolio holdings from a fund and are denoted with a dot. Historical StyleMap characteristics are calculated for the shorter of either the past 3 years or the life of the fund, and are represented by the shading of the box(es) previously occupied by the dot. StyleMap characteristics represent an approximate profile of the fund's equity holdings (e.g., domestic stocks, foreign stocks, and American Depositary Receipts), are based on historical data, and are not predictive of the fund's future investments. Although the data are gathered from reliable sources, accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed.

                                Head of Family Office
                            




                                    EquityZen is perfectly positioned to bring liquidity to an inherently illiquid investment class, a significant pain point for key employees and LP's alike.
                                

                                    After my initial contact with the founders at EquityZen, I was intrigued. Once I met the team in person, I was engaged with the demeanor, integrity and complimentary skill sets of the team. And now, having spent a lot more time with them, all of my initial impressions have been confirmed. This team is solid, brilliant and ready to expand.

                                    I think EZ will start to become more embedded within the process private companies follow to manage their private stock (not only secondary transactions) and eventually re-define how this process is carried out all together (Eventually spilling to other private markets). A lot to be done here and EZ is on its way to leading the charge.

                                Projector Ventures
                            




                                    EquityZen caught my attention when I was investigating marketplaces for investing in start-ups. I liked the company's product and approach to providing liquidity for private equity. EquityZen has a chance to become a major trading platform in a big market with attractive business economics. The founders are smart, open-minded and focused on execution – moving fast to capture the market opportunity and build a world-class team.

                                Recovering Investment Banker
                            




                                    EquityZen is unlocking one of the greatest untapped opportunities in the capital markets - the private company secondary equity market. Employees are desperate for cash, companies are desperate for control, and investors are in desperate need of access and stock liquidity. EquityZen solves this problem for all stakeholders through their innovative combination of technology and financial acumen. I invested in EquityZen because the founders have the vision and DNA to create a private stock market platform on a massive scale.
                                








                                Nat Disston
                            

                                Director of Marketplace
                            




                                    I get to come into work everyday to build and grow a market that never existed before. We're creating meaningful value for our clients, pushing the boundaries of FinTech, and working with some of the coolest companies around. That said, it's this team that makes EquityZen awesome.
                                








                                Atish Davda
                            

                                Founder and CEO
                            




                                    Our A-class team is the main reason EquityZen is the fastest growing business in the industry. Everyone can be the CEO and have great latitude over their area of expertise, and we are all in it to learn a lot and to build a 100-year legacy.
                                











Our promise to you:You will learn more, faster than you can imagine.

Your privacy is important
At EquityZen INC (the "Company"), your privacy is very important to us. The purpose of this privacy policy (this "Policy") is to provide you with a description of the types of information we collect about you when you visit the EquityZen web site located at equityzen.com, and associated sub-domains (the "Site"), and how we use that information. By visiting or using the Site you agree to the provisions of our Terms of Use and this Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Policy, please do not use or access the Site or use the Services (defined below). This Policy only applies to information collected while you are on the Site. For more information on how the Site may redirect you to other web sites, please see the "Links and Redirection to Third Party Sites" section below.
Information We Collect
We collect and store information that you voluntarily provide to us as well as data related to your Site visit.
In some areas of the Site, we request or may request that you provide personally identifiable information, including your name, address, email address, telephone number, username, and other information from which your identity is or may be discernible. We collect personally identifiable information from our users at several different points on the Site. We will also allow you the opportunity to provide information identifying yourself as an investor or borrower and, if you are a borrower, the amount you will be seeking, your desired target rate, the intended use of funds and loan duration. Such information is collected for the purpose of contacting you with information regarding prospective investment or borrowing opportunities (as applicable) based on your specified interests (the "Services"). It is solely up to you whether you furnish such information. If you do provide such information, you are thereby consenting to the use of that information in accordance with the policies and practices described in this Policy. This information may be stored on our servers, and on the servers of third party service providers.
In addition, during your visit we automatically collect certain aggregate information and analytical data related to your Site visit (see "Use of Cookies" below). Aggregate information is non-personally identifiable or anonymous information about you, including the date and time of your visit, the IP address of your computer or mobile device, your computer or mobile device browser information, the Internet address that you visited prior to and after reaching the Site, the name of the domain and host you used to access the Internet, the type of mobile device you use, your mobile device's unique device ID and the features of our Site which you accessed. This data is in no way associated with your personally identifiable information.
How We Use Information

Disclosure of Information
We do not sell or rent personally identifiable information to third parties who are not affiliates of the Company.

We may disclose personally identifiable information to appropriate affiliates of the Company, including strategic alliance affiliates and third party service providers, to respond to a request for service or to provide information about available products or services.

We disclose information that we, in good faith, believe is appropriate to cooperate in investigations of fraud or other illegal activity, or to conduct investigations of violations of our Terms of Use. For example, this means that if we conduct a fraud investigation and conclude that one side has engaged in deceptive practices, we can give that person or entity's contact information to victims who request it.
We disclose information in response to a subpoena, warrant, court order, levy, attachment, order of a court-appointed receiver or other comparable legal process, including subpoenas from private parties in a civil action. If the subpoena seeks information about an identified user or limited group of users, we'll make reasonable business efforts to contact the user(s) before providing information to the party that requests it. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to contact the user(s) in all cases, whether because of a time limit, court order, inability to effectively contact a user, or for any other reason.
We may disclose information to your agent or legal representative (such as the holder of a power of attorney that you grant, or a guardian appointed for you).
We share information with companies that provide public relations and marketing services for us. Such information will only be shared by us to customize, measure and improve our products, Services and advertising; it will not be shared with third parties for their marketing purposes. These third parties are obligated to protect your information and are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose.
As with any other business, it is possible that in the future we could merge with or be acquired by another company. If such an acquisition occurs, the successor company would have access to the information maintained by us, including customer account information, but would continue to be bound by this Policy unless and until it is amended.
We share your information with our parent, subsidiaries and joint ventures to help coordinate the Services we provide to you, enforce our terms and conditions, and promote trust and safety.
We may share aggregate (non-personally identifiable) information with certain third parties such as advertisers, national industry organizations, and prospective affiliates. In addition, we reserve the right to disclose aggregate information and personally identifiable information to third parties as required or permitted by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights.

This must be accomplished in a manner that keeps the focus on company growth, the number one priority for all stakeholders. Investors that previously couldn't access late-stage private companies due to investment minimums, can now invest in private growth companies.








EquityZen connects shareholders of private companies with investors seeking alternative investments. We deliver value to shareholders, companies, and investors alike at the highest level of excellence.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Summary







 


Overall Rating

5 out of 5 Stars

Morningstar has awarded this fund 5 stars based on its risk-adjusted performance compared to the 1277 funds within its Morningstar Category.



How is it determined?


The Overall Morningstar RatingTM for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics, which are based on risk-adjusted returns, as of the date stated.

What does it mean?


A fund's Morningstar Rating is a quantitative assessment of a fund's past performance that accounts for both risk and return, with funds earning between 1 and 5 stars. As always, this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process. A high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision.











 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Above Average


This fund scores Above Average because it delivered returns that were in the top 22.5% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category: top 10% - High next 22.5% - Above Average middle 35% - Average next 22.5% - Below Average bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Expenses


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Below Average


This fund's expenses are rated as Below Average because they fall between the 20th and 40th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category







How is it calculated?


This Morningstar data point compares the fund's net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its Morningstar Category grouping.





What does it mean?


Excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance. While you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios, a fund's expense structure may be one factor to consider.











 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.




How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Fund Overview




Objective



Seeks growth of capital over the long term.




Strategy



Normally investing at least 80% of assets in blue chip companies (companies whose stock is included in the S&P 500 or the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and companies with market capitalizations of at least $1 billion if not included in either index). Investing in companies that FMR believes have above-average growth potential (stocks of these companies are often called "growth" stocks). Normally investing primarily in common stocks of well-known and established companies.


Risk



The value of equity securities fluctuates in response to issuer, political, market, and economic developments. In the short term, equity prices can fluctuate dramatically in response to these developments. Different parts of the market and different types of equity securities can react differently to these developments. For example, 'growth' stocks can react differently from 'value' stocks. Foreign securities, foreign currencies, and securities issued by U.S. entities with substantial foreign operations can involve additional risks. You may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.



Short Term Redemption Fee
None



Who May Want To Invest

Someone who is seeking the potential for long-term share-price appreciation.
Someone who is willing to accept the generally greater price volatility associated with growth-oriented stocks.

Risk


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Above Average

This fund scores Above Average because Morningstar has rated its risk between the 60th and 80th percentiles when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.




How is it calculated?


Risk is calculated using the Sharpe ratio, which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to U.S. Treasury bonds, relative to the fund's overall volatility. For this measure, Morningstar has compared the Sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in it's Morningstar Category.




What does it mean?


A higher Sharpe implies better risk-adjusted returns. Therefore, if a fund has a Sharpe ratio higher than its category average, it's returns relative to it's risk were better than other similar funds. If its Sharpe ratio is lower, that's usually a sign that the risk-adjusted returns were lower than other similar funds.

While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. (Exchange-traded funds and open-end mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes.) It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of  funds in each fund category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

© 2016 Morningstar, Inc. All rights reserved. The Morningstar information contained herein: (1) is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its content providers; (2) may not be copied or redistributed; and (3) is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Fidelity does not review the Morningstar data and, for fund performance, you should check the fund's current prospectus or other product materials for the most up-to-date information concerning applicable loads, fees and expenses.

The performance data featured represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.  Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate; therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.  Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.











1. Total returns are historical and include change in share value and reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, if any. Cumulative total returns are reported as of the period indicated.  Life of fund figures are reported as of the commencement date to the period indicated and are cumulative if the fund is less than one year old. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sales charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower.
2. The Morningstar Category Average is the average return for the peer group based on the returns of each individual fund within the group, for the period shown. This average assumes reinvestment of dividends.
3. This chart illustrates the performance of a hypothetical $10,000 investment made in this investment product (and a benchmark or category average, if shown) from the beginning date shown or on the inception date of the product (whichever is later).  The inception date used for products with underlying funds, or multiple shares classes, or are offered as a separate account, strategy or sub account, may be the inception date of the underlying fund, the earliest share class of the product, or the date composite performance for the product was first made available. The product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Benchmark returns include reinvestment of capital gains and dividends, if any, but do not reflect any fees or expenses. It is not possible to invest in an index. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This chart is not intended to imply any future performance of the investment product.
4. Any holdings, asset allocation, diversification breakdowns or other composition data shown are as of the date indicated and are subject to change at any time.  They may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments.  The Top Ten Holdings and Top 5 Issuers do not include money market instruments or futures contracts, if any.  Depository receipts are normally combined with the underlying security.  Some breakdowns may be intentionally limited to a particular asset class or other subset of the fund's entire portfolio, particularly in multi-asset class funds where the attributes of the equity and fixed income portions are different.Under the asset allocation section, international (or foreign) assets may be reported differently depending on how an investment option reports its holdings. Some do not report international (or foreign) holdings here, but instead report them in a "Regional Diversification" section. Some report them in this section in addition to the equity, bond and other allocation shown. Others report international (or foreign) holding as a subset of the equity and bond allocations shown. If the allocation without the foreign component equals (or rounds to) 100%, then international (or foreign) is a subset of the equity and bond percentage shown.
5. Percent Rank in Category is the fund's total-return percentile rank relative to all funds that have the same Morningstar Category.  The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. The top-performing fund in a category will always receive a rank of 1. % Rank in Category is based on total returns which include reinvested dividends and capital gains, if any, and exclude sales charges.
6. The percent of net assets invested in both domestic and foreign Equities (common stocks, preferred stocks, rights and warrants, convertible preferred stocks and stock index futures and options), Bond (all debt instruments, including investment grade, non-investment grade, non-rated securities and convertible bonds), and Cash & Net Other Assets (cash, repurchase agreements, receivables and payables).
7. "Tax-Advantaged Domiciles" represent countries whose tax policies may be favorable for company incorporation.
8. Net Other Assets can include fund receivables, fund payables, and offsets to other derivative positions, as well as certain assets that do not fall into any of the Portfolio Composition categories. Depending on the extent to which the fund invests in derivatives and the number of positions that are held for future settlement, Net Other Assets can be a negative number.
9. StyleMap® depictions of mutual fund characteristics are produced using data and calculations provided by Morningstar, Inc. StyleMapsSM estimate characteristics of a fund's equity holdings over two dimensions: market capitalization and valuation. The percentage of fund assets represented by these holdings is indicated beside each StyleMap. Current StyleMap characteristics are calculated each time Morningstar receives updated portfolio holdings from a fund and are denoted with a dot. Historical StyleMap characteristics are calculated for the shorter of either the past 3 years or the life of the fund, and are represented by the shading of the box(es) previously occupied by the dot. StyleMap characteristics represent an approximate profile of the fund's equity holdings (e.g., domestic stocks, foreign stocks, and American Depositary Receipts), are based on historical data, and are not predictive of the fund's future investments. Although the data are gathered from reliable sources, accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed.


Generally, the issuer of a mutual fund is the fund or trust which issues the shares; the issuer of collective investment trusts is the underlying trust or investment vehicle which issues the units; the issuer of a stock fund is the company which issues the shares; the issuer of options such as separate accounts and strategies is the plan which makes them available; the issuer of a fixed return option is the insurance company or other company which offers the investment; the issuer of an annuity contract is the insurance company and/or the insurance company separate account.

Generally, data on Fidelity mutual funds is provided by FMR, LLC, Morningstar ratings and data on non-Fidelity mutual funds is provided by Morningstar, Inc. and data on non-mutual fund products is provided by the product's investment manager, trustee or issuer or the plan sponsor whose plan is offering the product to  participants.  Although Fidelity believes the data gathered from these third-party sources is reliable, it does not review such information and cannot warrant it to be accurate, complete or timely.  Fidelity is not responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this third-party information.

Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the fund or annuity and its investment options. Contact Fidelity for a free prospectus and, if available, summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.
