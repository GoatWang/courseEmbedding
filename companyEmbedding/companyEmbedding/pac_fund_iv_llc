Acquiring and Managing Discounted Real Estate Notes
																								 Since 2012

“We simply take Non-Performing Loans and
																	 turn them into secured and profitable Assets.”








PAC Fund IV, LLC 506(c) Offering Platform
INTRODUCTION TO THE COMPANY

Four people with a common goal - to create wealth with secured assets - founded Paper Assets Capital, LLC (PAC). The idea was to establish a premier firm to specialize in the acquisition of distressed mortgage debt, owned by banks, and secured by real estate. This industry is commonly referred to as note investing, and they have created quite a successful niche in this market. The managing partners, and founders, believed in the industry so much that they staked the first investment. Their vision was on target, and today, PAC has managed over $6.3 million in assets.


The Business Model works with Assets Nationwide as shown below:







SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
PAC provides life-changing financial resolutions for families and creates positive stabilization for communities. Having bought distressed notes, they strive to create workable solutions with homeowners who find themselves in a financial predicament, but wish to stay in their homes. After assessing their current situation, they can help them get ‘back on track’ with several work out solutions and exit strategies.

PAC Fund IV, LLC was formed with the purpose of providing
its investors with a fixed rate of return through cash flowing notes.











PAC Fund IV, LLC 506(c) Offering Platform
SUMMARY OF OPERATIONS

PAC Fund IV, LLC (the “Company” or the “Fund”) was developed to purchase residential real estate notes at a discount from wholesalers, servicers and direct originators. Its focus is to identify and acquire secured notes which are undervalued properties located in favorable neighborhoods. 
The Company’s model is to work the notes through three stages: administration, risk management and borrower management.  The Fund seeks to realize revenue via an appropriate exit strategy. The typical strategies include: debt restructuring, sale of notes to a third party or obtain and sale of the property.
As a result of their proprietary due diligence process and purchasing notes at below market prices, the Company is able to spread its risk over a greater pool of quality assets.

Accredited Verification Requirements


Regulation D Rule 506(c) Investor Verification Standards and Protocols
In purchasing securities through a 506(c) Offering, the Company is obligated to verify any participating investor’s status as an accredited investor in accordance with Rule 501 of Regulation D.  There are three primary methods the Company may employ to comply with the verification standards.  Note – most issuers use third party verification (broker-dealer letter, attorney letter, CPA letter, or a third party speciality services like verifyinvestor.com) to obtain proper and suitable verification.  It is possible for the investor to provide bank statements and/or IRS tax forms – however most clients do not want the responsibility of reviewing those types of records and forms.
Investors in the offering will need to provide the Company with verification that meets the standards and form using one or multiple methods as listed below:
Income: The Company may verify an individual’s status as an accredited investor on the basis of income by reviewing copies of any IRS form that reports net income, such as Forms W-2 or 1099 (which are typically filed by an employer or other third party payor), or Forms 1040 filed by the prospective purchaser (with non-relevant information permitted to be redacted). Under this method, the Company must review IRS forms for the two most recent years and obtain a written representation from the prospective purchaser that he or she has a reasonable expectation of attaining the necessary income level for the current year. Where accredited investor status is based on joint income with the person’s spouse, the IRS forms and representation must be provided with respect to both the purchaser and the spouse.
Net Worth: Under this method, the Company will need to review bank or brokerage statements or third-party appraisal reports to verify the purchaser’s assets and a credit report to verify liabilities, in each case dated within the prior three months, and will need to obtain a written representation from the prospective purchaser that all liabilities have been disclosed. Where accredited investor status is based on joint net worth with the person’s spouse, the asset and liability documentation and representation must be provided with respect to both the purchaser and the spouse.
Reliance on Determination by Specified Third Parties to Provide Verification: The Company may satisfy the verification requirement if it obtains a written confirmation from a registered broker-dealer (who the investor has had an account with longer than 6 months), an SEC-registered investment adviser, a licensed attorney, or a certified public accountant that within the prior three months such person or entity has taken reasonable steps to verify that the purchaser is an accredited investor and has determined that the purchaser is an accredited investor.  Third party services, such as verifyinvestor.com (managed by an attorney) are also qualified third party providers of verifications.
Proper verification must be submitted with the subscription for securities in order for the Company to verify the investor’s suitability for investment and accept the subscription.


Accredited Investor Qualifications:
Any natural person whose individual net worth, or joint net worth with that person's spouse, exceeds $1,000,000.

(i) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(5)(ii) of this section, for purposes of calculating net worth under this paragraph (a)(5):
        
(A) The person's primary residence shall not be included as an asset;
(B) Indebtedness that is secured by the person's primary residence, up to the estimated fair market value of the primary residence at the time of the sale of securities, shall not be included as a liability (except that if the amount of such indebtedness outstanding at the time of sale of securities exceeds the amount outstanding 60 days before such time, other than as a result of the acquisition of the primary residence, the amount of such excess shall be included as a liability); and
(C) Indebtedness that is secured by the person's primary residence in excess of the estimated fair market value of the primary residence at the time of the sale of securities shall be included as a liability;


(ii) Any natural person who had an individual income in excess of $200,000 in each of the two most recent years or joint income with that person's spouse in excess of $300,000 in each of those years and has a reasonable expectation of reaching the same income level in the current year;

UPDATED May 7, 2012                    
Who’s Financing the ‘Super PACs’


A look at the major donors to “super PACs” during the 2012 campaign cycle. Unlike candidates, who can raise a maximum of $2,500 per person for each election, super PACs are independent from candidates and can raise unlimited amounts from individuals, corporations and labor unions, and spend unlimited amounts to support or oppose a candidate. The Times is updating this list as groups file their regular fund-raising reports with the Federal Election Commission.

Pacific Life refers to Pacific Life Insurance Company and its affiliates, including Pacific Life & Annuity Company.  Insurance products are issued by Pacific Life Insurance Company in all states except New York and in New York by Pacific Life & Annuity Company.  Product availability and features may vary by state.  Each insurance company is solely responsible for the financial obligations accruing under the products it issues.  Insurance products and their guarantees, including optional benefits and any crediting rates, are backed by the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company, but they do not protect the value of the variable investment options.  Look to the strength of the life insurance company with regard to such guarantees as these guarantees are not backed by the broker-dealer, insurance agency or their affiliates from which products are purchased. Neither these entities nor their representatives make any representation or assurance regarding the claims-paying ability of the life insurance company. Variable insurance products and shares of Pacific Select Fund are distributed by Pacific Select Distributors, LLC (member FINRA  & SIPC), a subsidiary of Pacific Life Insurance Company, and an affiliate of Pacific Life & Annuity Company, and are available through licensed third-party broker-dealers.
