(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OR PLAN OF OPERATION.  The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes, and other financial information included in this Form 10-Q.  Our Management's Discussion and Analysis contains not only statements that are historical facts, but also statements that are forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are, by their very nature, uncertain and risky. These risks and uncertainties include international, national, and local general economic and market conditions; our ability to sustain, manage, or forecast growth; our ability to successfully make and integrate acquisitions; new product development and introduction; existing government regulations and changes in, or the failure to comply with, government regulations; adverse publicity; competition; the loss of significant customers or suppliers; fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results; change in business strategy or development plans; business disruptions; the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; the ability to protect technology; the risk of foreign currency exchange rate; and other risks that might be detailed from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Although the forward-looking statements in this Report reflect the good faith judgment of our management, such statements can only be based on facts and factors currently known by them. Consequently, and because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, the actual results and outcomes may differ materially from the results and outcomes discussed in the forward-looking statements. You are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us in this report as we attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and prospects.  Overview  The address of our principal executive office is located at 1440 NW 1st Court, Boca Raton, FL 33432. Our telephone number is (561) 757-3585. Our company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on December 5, 2003 under the name Computer Maid, Inc. Our company was inactive until February 2006, when we changed our name to Rose Explorations Inc. and became engaged in the exploration of mining properties.  On March 4, 2008, our company completed a merger with our wholly-owned subsidiary, SilverStar Resources, Inc., which was incorporated solely to effect the name change of our company to SilverStar Resources, Inc.  On March 4, 2008, we affected a 3 for 1 forward stock split of our authorized, issued and outstanding common stock. As a result, our authorized capital increased from 75,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001 to 225,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001.  On April 13, 2011, we incorporated a wholly owned subsidiary, Silverstar Mining (Canada) Inc., under the federal laws of Canada. The subsidiary's main purpose is to hold title to mineral property rights situated in Canada as the laws of that country require that only local entities can hold title to mineral property rights situated within its borders.  Effective September 26, 2011, we affected a reverse split our common stock on a 1,000 for 1 basis. As a result of the foregoing, we reduced the number of authorized shares of our common stock from 225,000,000 to 225,000.  On February 29, 2012, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to our company's Articles of Incorporation with the Nevada Secretary of State increasing the number of authorized shares from 225,000 to 225,000,000 shares of common stock $0.001 par value.  On July 22, 2013 we entered into settlement agreements with four debt holders of our company pursuant to which we restructured outstanding demand loans payable in the aggregate amount of $175,028 (inclusive of accrued interest) as convertible debentures.  Table of Contents  On February 15, 2013, we closed a Share Exchange Agreement pursuant to which we intended to acquire a wholly owned subsidiary, Arriba Resources Inc. However, effective November 13, 2013 our Board of Directors approved the cancellation and reversal of the Share Exchange Agreement due to a failure of consideration on the part of the seller. As a result of the cancellation and reversal of the Share Exchange Agreement, 2,139,926 shares of our common stock and warrants to acquire 2,078,477 shares of our common stock which were previously authorized (but not issued from treasury) have been cancelled with immediate effect. Consequently, the change of control announced in our current report on Form 8-K filed on May 21, 2013 has been reversed.  As a result of the cancellation and reversal of the Share Exchange Agreement with Arriba, the consolidated financial statements of our Company for the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2013 (filed with the SEC on August 14, 2013) and June 30, 2013 (filed with the SEC on May 20, 2013) may no longer be relied upon owing to their inclusion of the financial information of Arriba. We informed our independent accountants of the cancellation and reversal of the Share Exchange Agreement and intend to file amendments to our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31 and June 30, 2013 to reflect our financial condition without consolidation of the financial information of Arriba. The financial statements contained in this current report accurately reflect the deconsolidation of the financial information of Arriba.  On January 23, 2015 the board of directors with the consent of a majority of its shareholders approved amended articles of incorporation to include a change of name to Silverstar Resources, Inc. and a reverse split of its common stock resulting in shareholders receiving one share for every five shares (5 to 1) they hold as of record of that date. In addition, the amendment set the authorized shares of common stock at 220,000,000 and preferred stock at 5,000,000 shares both at a par value of $0.001.  On March 10, 2015 the Company formed 1030029 Ltd, an Alberta numbered company as a wholly owned subsidiary to meet the requirements of holding working interest of Alberta producing oil and gas properties  On June 23, 2016, the Company's Board of Directors approved of a change of name from Silverstar Resources, Inc. to Creative Waste Solutions Inc.  Results of Operations  The following summary of our results of operations should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2017, which are included herein.  Sales  Sales for the three months and six months ended March 31, 2017 were $225,273 and $454,812 as compared to $0 and $0 for the same periods in 2016. The increase in sales is due to the acquisitions of Creative and Integrated and assets of Easy Disposal.  Cost of Goods Sold  Cost of goods sold for the three months and six months ended March 31, 2017 were $160,756 and $368,938, as compared to $0 for the same periods in 2016. The increase in cost of goods sold is due to the increase in sales.  Operating Expenses  Operating expenses for the three months and six months ended March 31, 2017 were $113,6901, and $212,144 as compared to $0 in operating expenses for the three and six months ended March 31, 2016. This represents an increase of $113,6901 for three months ended December 31, 2016 and $212,144 for the six months ended . The increase for the three months and six months is a result of the additional operating costs associated with the acquisitions of Creative, Integrated and Easy, and corresponding increases in filing fees, insurance, legal and accounting, and office expense.  Table of Contents  Net Income (Loss)  Our net income for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 was $37,314 and $2,799,707, respectively. For the six months ended March 31, 2017 our loss was $37,314 and for March 31, 2016, $183,998 compared to a net income of $2,667,142 for the six months ended March 31, 2016. The net income for the three and six months ended March 31, 2016 is primarily attributable to decreases in the value of the derivative liability resulting in gains of $2,822,259 and $2,707,329, respectively. Additionally, for the three and six months ended March 31, 2016, the Company has losses from discontinued operations of $15,406 and $26,076, respectively. For the three and six months ended March 31, 2017, the Company incurred losses from operations of $49,084 and $126,270, respectively, primarily because gross profit for the three and six months ended March 31, 2017 of $64,517 and $85,874, respectively, were not sufficient to cover general and administrative expenses of $113,601 and $212,144, respectively.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  At March 31, 2017 we had cash of $4,039 as compared to $ $5,124 in cash at September 30, 2016. Our accounts receivable at March 31, 2017 were $24,226 compared to $30,891 at September 30, 2016. Our accounts payable and accrued expenses at March 31, 2017 were $207,853 compared to $163,645 on September 30, 2016. On March 31, 2017 and September 30, 2016 we had convertible debentures and notes payable due to related parties of $241,896 outstanding. We had $79,296 in advances to related parties at March 31, 2017 as compared to $76,546 as of September 30, 2016. Our derivative liability was $1,533,187 as of March 31, 2017 and $1,507,277 of September 30, 2016. Our total liabilities were $2,551,351 on March 31, 2017 as compared to $2,477,853 on September 30, 2016. We have a working capital deficit of $2,523,086 as of March 31, 2017 as compared to our working capital deficit of $2,441,838 as of September 30, 2016.  Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion on our financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2016. Unless we secure equity or debt financing, of which there can be no assurance, or identify an acquisition candidate, we will not be able to continue any operations.  Working Capital  Our total current assets as of March 31, 2017 was $28,265 as compared to total current assets of $36,015 as of September 30, 2016 . The decrease in current assets was attributable to a decrease in cash of $1,085 and a decrease in accounts receivable of $6,665.  Our total current liabilities as of March 31, 2017 were $2,551,351 as compared to total current liabilities of $2,477,853 as of September 30, 2016. The increase in current liabilities was primarily attributed to an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $44,208 and an increase in our derivative liability of $26,540.  Cash Flows  Operating Activities  Cash used in operating activities was $3,835 for the six months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $17,576 for the six months ended March 31, 2016. The decrease in cash used in operating activities was primarily due to the discontinuance of oil and gas operations in 2016 which consumed $26,076 of cash during the six months ended March 31, 2016.  Investing Activities  Cash used in investing activities was $0 for the six months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $0 for the six months ended March 31, 2016.  Financing Activities  Cash provided by financing activities for the six months ended March 31, 2017 was $2,750 compared to $17,500 for the six months ended March 31, 2016. The decrease was due to a decline in borrowing in the 2017 period.  Table of Contents  Income & Operation Taxes  We are subject to income taxes in the U.S.  We paid no income taxes in USA for the six months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 due to the net operation losses incurred by the Company and net operating tax loss carryforwards in the USA that are available to the Company.  Cash Requirements  We will require additional funds to fund our budgeted expenses over the next 12 months. These funds may be raised through equity financing, debt financing, or other sources, which may result in further dilution in the equity ownership of our shares. There is still no assurance that we will be able to maintain operations at a level sufficient for investors to obtain returns on their investments in our common stock. Further, we may continue to be unprofitable. We need to raise additional funds in the immediate future in order to proceed with our budgeted expenses.  Specifically, we estimate our operating expenses and working capital requirements for the next 12 months to be as follows:  Professional and Legal Expense of $25,000  Auditing, Accounting and general administrative of $125,000  Working Capital requirements of $25,000  We intend to meet our cash requirements for the next 12 months through a combination of debt financing and equity financing by way of private placements. We currently do not have any arrangements in place to complete any private placement financings and there is no assurance that we will be successful in completing any such financings on terms that will be acceptable to us.  Going Concern  The financial statements accompanying this report have been prepared on a going concern basis, which implies that our company will continue to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. Our company has not generated revenues since inception and has never paid any dividends and is unlikely to pay dividends or generate earnings in the immediate or foreseeable future. The continuation of our company as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from our shareholders, the ability of our company to obtain necessary equity financing to achieve our operating objectives, and the attainment of profitable operations. As at March 31, 2017, our company has accumulated losses of $4,764,705. We do not have sufficient working capital to enable us to carry out our stated plan of operation for the next twelve months.  Due to the uncertainty of our ability to meet our current operating expenses and the capital expenses noted above in their report on the financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2016, De Leon & Company, P.A.., our independent auditors included an explanatory paragraph regarding concerns about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements contain additional note disclosures describing the circumstances that lead to this disclosure by our independent auditors.  The continuation of our business is dependent upon us raising additional financial support. The issuance of additional equity securities by us could result in a significant dilution in the equity interests of our current stockholders. Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans would be available, will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments.  Future Financings  We will require additional financing of $250,000, excluding funds for acquisitions, in order to enable us to proceed with our plan of operations, including approximately $200,000 over the next 12 months to pay for our ongoing expenses. These expenses include legal, accounting and audit fees as well as general and administrative expenses. These cash requirements are in excess of our current cash and working capital resources. Accordingly, we will require additional financing in order to continue operations and to repay our liabilities. There is no assurance that any party will advance additional funds to us in order to enable us to sustain our plan of operations or to repay our liabilities.  Table of Contents  We anticipate continuing to rely on equity sales of our common stock in order to continue to fund our business operations. Issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to our existing stockholders. There is no assurance that we will achieve any additional sales of our equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund our planned business activities.  We presently do not have any arrangements for additional financing for the expansion of our exploration operations, and no potential lines of credit or sources of financing are currently available for the purpose of proceeding with our plan of operations.  If we are unable to raise the funds that we require to execute our plan of operation, we intend to scale back our operations commensurately with the funds available to us.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  We currently have no off-balance sheet arrangements.  May 25, 2017  (c) 1995-2017 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved
