Timberline Announces Positive Metallurgical Test Results From Its Talapoosa Gold Project
  Jan 31, 2017  View in PDF – Coeur d’Alene, Idaho – January 31, 2017 – Timberline Resources Corporation (OTCQB: TLRS; TSX-V: TBR) (“Timberline” or the “Company”) announced today positive preliminary results from on-going metallurgical testing being performed on mineralized material at its Talapoosa gold project in Lyon County, Nevada.  The testing is designed to confirm the predicted gold and silver recoveries and assess leaching efficiency in the processing of the mineralized material as identified in the Company’s Preliminary Economic Assessment (“PEA”) issued in May 2015.  In addition, the testing supports the work of previous operators and will guide planning for additional testing planned in advance of engineering design. The positive Talapoosa PEA that was completed and released on April 27, 2015 by WSP Canada envisioned the project as an open-pit, gold-silver, heap-leach operation (“Preliminary Economic Assessment on the Talapoosa Project, Nevada, effective April 27, 2015).   PEA results included: Estimated average annual production of 55,000 oz of gold and 679,000 oz of silver for 11 years LOM all-in sustaining costs of $599/oz gold (net of silver by-product at $16/oz silver price) After-tax NPV5% of $136 million and 39% IRR at $1,150/oz gold price and $16/oz silver price Low initial capital requirement of $51 million.
