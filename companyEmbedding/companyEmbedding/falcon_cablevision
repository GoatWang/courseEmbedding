Calling Features

Anonymous Call Blocker
Anonymous Call Blocker blocks incoming calls from callers who block their Caller ID information. Those callers can dial *82 to unblock Caller ID.
 
Block Unwanted Callers
Provides the subscriber the ability to maintain a list of 32 numbers from which the subscriber does not want to accept incoming calls.
 
Busy Redial
When you get a busy signal, dial *66 to use Busy Redial, and Optimum Voice will call you back when the line you're calling is free.
 
Call Forwarding
Call Forwarding automatically redirects your incoming calls to a forwarding number so you never miss an important phone call. With Call Forwarding, the incoming call will ring on whatever phone number you choose, like a cell phone or a work number, instead of your Optimum Voice line.
 
Call Forwarding on Busy or No Answer
When the phone line is busy or the line is unanswered all incoming calls will be redirected to the number specified by the subscriber.


Call Forwarding Time-of-Day
Provides the subscriber a scheduling capability to forward calls to another number, during specified time intervals.


Call Forwarding to Back Up Phone
Forwards calls to a specified number when the connection to the cable modem is lost.


Caller ID
Caller ID displays the name and telephone number of the incoming caller, provided they are not blocking that information. This feature requires a Caller ID-compatible telephone or display device.


Caller ID Blocking (*67)
Caller ID Blocking lets you hide your name and number when making a call and is available on a per-call basis. First, dial *67. You should hear a stutter tone indicating that Caller ID Blocking is active. After you hear the stutter tone, proceed to dial the number of the party you are calling.


Caller ID on Optimum TV
Optimum TV customers with Optimum Voice and Optimum Online, also get Caller ID on Optimum TV, which displays caller ID information on your TV, so you can screen your calls while you’re watching your favorite shows and movies.


Call Return (*69)
Call Return (*69) identifies the last incoming caller to your line. Call Return (*69) will also automatically redial the last incoming telephone number for calls received from other Optimum Voice lines and from certain calls within your calling area.


Call Waiting
Call Waiting alerts you of incoming calls when you are on the phone and allows you to switch back and forth between calls. When you are on the phone, a tone will alert you of an incoming call. To pick up an incoming Call Waiting call, or to return to your first call, press the hook switch or flash key of your phone.
 
Call Waiting with Caller ID
Call Waiting with Caller ID provides Caller ID information for all call waiting calls.

Enhanced 911
Enhanced 911 service, sometimes referred to as E911, provides emergency services with the name, phone number and home address associated with your account when 911 is dialed. Therefore, if the caller is unable to speak, emergency services can still be dispatched to your home. Optimum Voice's E911 calls are connected into the same call centers as traditional phone companies, meaning 911 calls will be answered by local emergency dispatchers 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.


Enhanced Voicemail
Enhanced Voicemail provides all the features of an answering machine combined with the power of the Web. Like standard voicemail, you can listen to messages, create personal greetings and access your mailbox from any location. However, enhanced voicemail also allows you to
•    Use the Web to check your voicemail.
•    Receive voicemail messages through email.
•    Receive notification of voicemail message by text alerts on your phone

With Find Me, calls to your Optimum Voice line will simultaneously ring up to three additional phone lines, like a cell phones or work numbers. The incoming call can be answered by any of the phone lines, and the call will be connected to whichever phone answers first


Free 411
Unlimited free 411 Directory Assistance calls.          


HD calling
Optimum is the first landline telephone service provider in the U.S. to launch High Definition calling. HD calling is the next generation of voice technology that gives you less background noise, sharper sound quality and increased clarity in your phone conversations. To experience HD calling, customers and call recipients must subscribe to Optimum Voice and use HD-capable handsets.


Private Outbound Calling
Private Outbound Calling hides your name and number on all calls you make. The person you are calling will only see "Private" or a similar message on their caller ID screen. Anonymous calls can also be made on a per-call basis by dialing (*67) before each anonymous call you wish to make.


Three-Way Calling
Three-Way Calling allows you to add a third party to your conversation.


VIP Ringing
With VIP Ringing, you can designate up to 32 telephone numbers to ring with a second, distinct ring tone.
