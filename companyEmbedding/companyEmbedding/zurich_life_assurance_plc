When it comes to pensions, we believe in choice and flexibility so it's important to find a pension that matches your lifestyle and expectations for the future. There are a number of options available to you. You can opt for a Personal Pension Plan, a PRSA (Personal Retirement Savings Account) or Self-Directed Pension and many more.
Find out more about all the plans we have to offer.







Company pension plans


If you're running a business, we offer a choice of pension schemes for your staff. These are a tax efficient way for you to help ensure your employees are financially secure in retirement. Employees can benefit from our Company Pension Plan, a Company PRSA Plan, a Fusion Pension Plan - and many more.
Find out more about our company pensions by visiting our Corporate solutions section.







Preparing for retirement


Your pension means different things depending on whether you're starting to save for your pension, planning your retirement or have recently retired. The best way to ensure the lifestyle you want in retirement is to take ownership of it now so that hopefully by the time you retire you'll have built up a substantial pension pot.
Use the ARF or Annuity tool to see which option might be more suitable for you at retirement.

Where can I get advice?



Selecting the right product for you may seem confusing, but you can get advice from a financial adviser near you. A financial adviser can take you through all of the products available on the market - not just those offered by Zurich Life - and help you select the one that suits you. Our handy financial advisor tool will help you find an advisor in your area.







How can I find out the current value of my policy?



We can provide you with secure online access to the details of your policy. Among the details you can view is a daily updated value of the policy. Apply now for access.
We will also provide you with a yearly report telling you how your investment is performing together with a report on the funds in which you have invested.
The prices of all our funds are updated regularly on our website and you can calculate the growth of these funds between two dates of your choice.







Can I switch the funds in which my policy is invested?



You can move your unit holdings among the different investment unit funds available. This gives you extra flexibility to change the return-risk profile of your investment as your needs change.
The first four switches you make in each policy year are free of charge. A charge will be made for each subsequent switch. This charge is currently €20 and was last set on 1st January 2002; it is guaranteed not to increase by more than the increase in the Consumer Price Index since the charge was last set.
If you choose to switch out of the SuperCAPP fund, a market level adjustment may be applied. There are also limits on the amount that may be switched into the SuperCAPP fund, in order to protect the interests of all SuperCAPP fund investors. These limits vary from time to time. Details of current limits are available from us on request.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
