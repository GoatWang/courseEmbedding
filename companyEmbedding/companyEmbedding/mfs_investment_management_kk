Investment Management
Insights, Strategies and Solutions
Our experienced professionals have expertise in a broad spectrum of traditional, alternative and non-financial assets.  We can work with you to develop and manage a portfolio tailored to your needs.






Portfolio Consulting
A collaborative dialogue with your portfolio manager
Your portfolio manager is a key member of your U.S. Trust relationship team and serves as your personal "chief investment officer." He or she will work with you to create an Investment Policy Statement, which serves as a blueprint for your portfolio by documenting your:

Objectives
Risk tolerance
Cash flow needs
 Tax situation
Wealth aspirations

Your portfolio manager's ongoing role is to incorporate our best strategic and tactical thinking, most relevant research analysis, current market insights and appropriate investment solutions into your portfolio. He or she will regularly monitor your portfolio to make sure it conforms to your Investment Policy Statement, which will be updated whenever there are significant changes in your life or goals.
Asset management
A more complete approach to asset allocation1
We analyze a wide range of asset classes, including hedge and private equity funds2 and global investment opportunities, as potential components of an asset allocation. In addition, we believe that true diversification requires managing for cash flows across and within asset classes in various market environments — not simply allocating according to a grid.
Your asset allocation will be based on the long-term expectations established for each asset class by our most senior investment professionals. Over the shorter term, however, your portfolio manager can adjust your portfolio tactically in response to emerging opportunities and risks, and reflecting U.S. Trust insights about trends and themes relevant to you.
How you own your assets — personally or in trusts; in taxable or tax-exempt solutions — can have a material impact on the overall performance of your portfolio. At U.S. Trust we focus on this wealth structuring aspect of your portfolio in conjunction with managing the assets themselves.
Alternative Investments
SOPHISTICATED SOLUTIONS TO MEET YOUR NEEDS2
Alternative investments at U.S. Trust focus on non-traditional assets such as:

Hedge funds
Private equity
Real estate and tangible assets

Because performance is often differentiated from equity and fixed income markets, alternative investments may be an ideal complement to traditional investments. 
Through our access to the industry's premier managers, we are able to offer solutions that provide options for all client segments. And we support you every step of the way with knowledge built on our experience in alternatives, including industry-leading research, rigorous due diligence, and cutting-edge portfolio construction.
Drawing from the experience, resources and expertise of the firm, you and your portfolio manager can explore alternative investments that can help you pursue what matters most to you.
Specialty asset management
Expertise in nonfinancial assets3
Specialty asset management at U.S. Trust focuses on nonfinancial assets such as:

Farm and ranch land
Timberland
Oil and gas properties
Private businesses
Real estate

Our Specialty Asset Management team can work with your portfolio manager and wealth strategist, as appropriate, to integrate these real assets into your overall plan and portfolio.
We can help you realize your objectives with assets you already own, or help you acquire specific assets to take advantage of their capital growth and diversification potential — whether you own these assets outright or they are held in trust.
Our team of specialists can provide complete turnkey services including identifying and purchasing real property and providing ongoing management.
Capital markets
Sophisticated market-linked solutions4
Through our access to the resources of Merrill Lynch, one of the world's leading capital markets participants, we can tailor approaches to risks and opportunities in the foreign exchange, interest rate, commodity and equity markets. Derivative-based transactions target the risks you seek to hedge, and are designed to dovetail with your overall portfolio and wealth management strategies.

1 Asset allocation and diversification do not ensure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.
2 Alternative Investments such as derivatives, hedge funds, private equity funds, and funds of funds can result in higher return potential but also higher loss potential. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely affect your investments. Before you invest in alternative investments, you should consider your overall financial situation, how much money you have to invest, your need for liquidity, and your tolerance for risk. Alternative investments are speculative and involve a high degree of risk.
3 Nonfinancial assets, such as closely-held businesses, real estate, oil, gas and mineral properties, and timber, farm and ranch land, are complex in nature and involve risks including total loss of value.  Special risk considerations include natural events (for example, earthquakes or fires), complex tax considerations, and lack of liquidity.  Nonfinancial assets are not suitable for all investors.  Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager, and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax, or estate planning strategy.
4 Brokerage services are provided by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, a registered broker-dealer, Member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation.
Certain U.S. Trust associates are registered representatives with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated ("MLPF&S") and may assist you with investment products and services provided through MLPF&S and other nonbank investment affiliates. MLPF&S is a registered broker-dealer, member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation ("BofA Corp."). U.S. Trust operates through Bank of America, N.A., and other subsidiaries of BofA Corp.

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

Advertising Practices

Please remember there's always the potential of losing money when you invest in securities. 
			
			Before you invest in a Section 529 plan, request the plan's official statement from your Financial Solutions Advisor and read it carefully. The official statement contains more complete information, including investment objectives, charges, expenses and risks of investing in the 529 plan, which you should consider carefully before investing. You should also consider whether your home state or your beneficiary's home state offers any state tax or other benefits that are only available for investments in such state's 529 plan. Section 529 plans are not guaranteed by any state or federal agency.

1 To be eligible for favorable tax treatment afforded to any earnings portion of withdrawals from Section 529 accounts, such withdrawals must be used for "qualified higher education expenses," as defined in the Internal Revenue Code. Any earnings withdrawn that are not used for such expenses are subject to federal income tax and may be subject to a 10% additional federal tax, as well as applicable state and local income taxes. 
			
2 Section 529 plans are established by various states and are offered to residents of all states. Depending on the laws of the customer's home state, favorable tax treatment for investing in a Section 529 plan may be limited to investments made in a Section 529 plan offered by the customer's home state. Neither Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated nor any of its subsidiaries are tax or legal advisors. We suggest you consult your personal tax or legal advisor before making tax or legal-related investment decisions.

Frequently Asked Questions 




What is an IRA?


							An Individual Retirement Account (IRA) may provide either a tax-deferred or tax-free way for you to save for retirement.  There are many different types of IRAs but Roth, Traditional and Rollover IRAs are the most common.
						






How does an IRA work?


							IRAs rely on long-term, tax-deferred compounding to provide your retirement savings the opportunity to grow more quickly than in a taxable account.  When you earn interest, receive a dividend or sell an investment (such as a mutual fund) for a gain, you don't pay taxes that year on the earnings.  Instead, all taxes are deferred until you withdraw those earnings in retirement.
						






Why is an IRA important now?


							In retirement you may need as much as 100% of your current after-tax income (take-home pay) minus any amount you are saving for retirement each year.  This makes it all the more important to start saving sooner rather than later, and an IRA can help you get started.
						






What are the ways I can invest in an IRA?


							You can choose from investment products such as mutual funds, stocks, bonds and ETFs, as well as bank products like CDs and money market savings.
						






What are the contribution deadlines?

You can make contributions to an IRA for a given tax year until the tax return filing deadline of the following year.






How do I convert to a Roth IRA?

A Roth IRA Conversion could help grow your retirement assets federally income tax-free. To help you convert to a Merrill Edge Roth IRA, call us at 888.637.3343 for one-on-one assistance and we'll guide you every step of the way. We're here 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.






What are my options for converting a 401(k) to an IRA?

You have several choices when it comes to your old 401(k). Typically known as a rollover IRA, you can opt to transfer your money into an IRA. Another option is keeping the current 401(k) with your old employer or transfer it to a new employer plan.

Frequently Asked Questions 




SEP IRA



Do I have to contribute annually?
                                No. A SEP IRA gives you the flexibility to decide each year whether to contribute and at what rate. That could mean contributing more during profitable years and less or nothing at all during less profitable years.
                            
Is it difficult to administer a SEP IRA?
                                SEP IRAs have little to no paperwork and administration and don't require filing with the IRS. Plus, a Small Business Financial Solutions Advisor can help you get started.
                            
Is there investment research I can review? 
                                Yes. As a Merrill Edge client, you get access to BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research (rated #1 by Institutional InvestorFootnote 2)-as well as research from other industry leaders-to gain investing knowledge and market
                                insights that can help inform your investment strategy.
                            




SIMPLE IRA



Is there a mandatory employer match? 
                                Yes. With a SIMPLE IRA, you must contribute either 2% of compensation for each eligible employee, regardless of participation, or a dollar-for-dollar match of employee salary deferral contributions, capped at 3% of compensation (which may be reduced to as low as 1% in any two years during a 5-year period).
                            
What if my business grows beyond 100 employees?
                                You may need to consider establishing a small business 401(k) plan when your business grows to more than 100 employees. A Small Business Financial Solutions Advisor can help you consider your options. Please note: If you decide to establish a 401(k) plan, you would stop contributions to the SIMPLE IRA plan and then start the 401(k). Participants that have been in the SIMPLE IRA plan for over two years may roll their SIMPLE IRA assets over to the new 401(k) if it allows for rollovers. Before making any decisions, you should speak with your tax and legal advisor about your situation and the requirements for terminating a plan and establishing a new one.
                            
Is it difficult to administer a SIMPLE IRA? 
                                We have many ways to make managing your retirement plan easier. Our Merrill Lynch E-Contribs for Small Business Retirement Accounts™ provides small business owners with a convenient web-based solution for making contributions to retirement plan accounts, while the Automated Investment Program provides a systematic way to invest in mutual funds on a schedule based on your needs.
                                
                                SIMPLE IRA contributions will be made through your payroll company and you will be required to send an annual notice to your employees. You do not file IRS Form 5500 as you would with a 401(k) plan.

1 You have choices for what to do with your employer sponsored retirement plan.

Each choice may offer different investment options and services, fees and expenses, withdrawal options, required minimum distributions, tax treatment and provide different protection from creditors and legal judgments. These are complex choices and should be considered with care.

Webcast


Market Insights Q3 2017 Markets seem to be telling us conflicting stories. On one hand, stocks have continued to climb on seemingly unabated investor optimism this year. On the other, bond yields have reversed course and fallen, indicating investor pessimism over future growth and inflation. Which story is right? Forward indicators suggest we may see a mini down cycle soon, which suggests caution.
Jon Hubbard from the MFS Investment Solutions team will moderate a discussion with MFS Chief Investment Strategist James Swanson and MFS Chief Economist Erik Weisman as they discuss how to decipher the conflicting narratives being told by the current market landscape.
10:30 a.m. ET | 3:30 p.m. BST | 4:30 p.m. CEST

Our Investment Beliefs Drive Everything We Do.



Client Alignment: Focused on Outcomes
We stay true to our investment beliefs and a process that is sustainable, repeatable and aligned with the needs of our clients.
 
We can best serve client interests through skilled active management — knowing what we own through robust research, owning companies responsibly by engaging with their management teams and holding positions long enough to let our investment thesis play out.
We believe markets are inefficient and can be exploited to create long-term value through rigorous research, conviction and discipline.
Being investor-led means we make decisions based on how well investments support client outcomes rather than on asset gathering. We invest and run our business the same way — with a long-term view and single-minded focus on doing what is right for clients.
It's not about being the biggest manager. It's about acting in the best interest of clients. We close strategies before they get too large in order to help protect long-term performance for our client assets.


Expand







Continuity: Time Is an Asset
We think, act and invest with a long-term perspective because that is the best way to create value for clients over time.
 
Lengthening the time horizon allows us to tap the more dispersed returns available over longer horizons, while developing conviction and staying disciplined over full market cycles allows our good ideas to potentially become sustainable investments.
Linking investment-team incentives with long-term performance helps create long-term value and aligns with client objectives.
Integrating environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) into our research helps us make long-term investments in companies with potentially lasting competitive advantages.
Strategically planning for the development and succession of key investment professionals preserves the integrity of our investment process and the potential to sustain our active skill over time. 


Expand







Collective Intelligence: Insight to Advantage
By building our organization and culture around collaboration and teamwork, we make the best decisions for clients.
 
There is a big difference between information and insight. We turn insight into an analysis advantage through our global research platform, with analysts able to uncover opportunities worldwide
We create an analysis advantage through collaborative thinking and uncompromised information sharing across geographies, asset classes, sectors and industries.
Favoring the strongest idea over the strongest individual, we use active debate to bring the most thoroughly vetted opportunities to clients. 
Collaboration drives more effective decision making, so we link it directly to investment team compensation by conducting 360-degree peer reviews and rewarding team members for working well together. 


Expand







Risk Management: Seeing All Angles
Risk factors into every investment decision we make, because limiting losses in volatile markets is just as critical as maximizing returns on the upside.
 
We have a risk-aware culture in which every member of our investment team is responsible for assessing risk. Embedded in our investment process, risk management is always on, and we conduct rigorous reviews regularly at the portfolio, security and firm levels.
In market downturns and during periods of market volatility, our active skill helps us take on intentional, rather than unintentional risk — and it helps us find good entry points to invest for long-term value.
With a goal to deliver the greatest return within the risk guidelines of each client portfolio, we focus on solid fundamentals and select investments that can potentially hold their value through changing markets.

Markets Group Institutional Investor Forums

The global investment landscape has been altered almost beyond recognition by the long-term decline in interest rates in most of the developed world, punctuated more recently by negative rates in many countries. While economic activity has rebounded, we have yet to escape the modest global growth envelope we have been operating in since the end of the global financial crisis. In this uncertain environment, what are the key risks and opportunities for institutional asset owners within global fixed income markets? MFS shared insights at two of the upcoming Forums.

Market Insights Q3 2017

Markets seem to be telling us conflicting stories. On one hand, stocks have continued to climb on seemingly unabated investor optimism this year. On the other, bond yields have reversed course and fallen, indicating investor pessimism over future growth and inflation. Which story is right? Forward indicators suggest we may see a mini down cycle soon, which suggests caution.
Jon Hubbard from the MFS Investment Solutions team will moderate a discussion with MFS Chief Investment Strategist James Swanson and MFS Chief Economist Erik Weisman as they discuss how to decipher the conflicting narratives being told by the current market landscape.
10:30 a.m. ET | 3:30 p.m. BST | 4:30 p.m. CEST














Minett, ON



Risk Management Conference

The investment landscape has been altered in Canada and globally by the long-term decline in interest rates, punctuated more recently by negative rates in Japan, most of the Eurozone, Switzerland, Demark, and Sweden. Yet, investors still look to fixed income markets as a source of diversification, risk mitigation and return within their overall asset allocation.  MFS’ Chief investment officer of global fixed income, William Adams, will explore the key risks and opportunities for institutional asset owners within Canadian and global fixed income markets in this uncertain environment.

MFS Investment Management (MFS) is an American-based global investment manager, formerly known as Massachusetts Financial Services. Founded in 1924, MFS is one of the oldest asset management companies in the world and has been credited with pioneering the mutual fund.[1] The very first mutual fund, the Massachusetts Investors Trust fund, is still in operation today. MFS had USD$448.7 billion in assets under management as of April 30, 2017.[2]

History[edit]
The company was founded in 1924 by L. Sherman Adams, Charles H. Learoyd and Ashton L. Carr.[3] The company's oldest fund is the Massachusetts Investors Trust, a mutual fund created with $50,000 at the company's inception and reported to be "the world's first open-end investment fund".[3] The company used "brokerage channels" to market its shares to the public and later expanded to $14 million in assets over the next five years.[3] During the stock market crash of 1929 the fund survived an 83% loss and went on to create a second fund in 1934. By 1959, the Massachusetts Investors Trust fund had become the largest mutual fund in the United States.
In 1969, MIT was reorganized as Massachusetts Financial Services (MFS) to reflect the firm's broadened scope of products and services.
In 1976, MFS offered one of the nation’s first national municipal bond funds (Managed Municipal Bond Trust) and in 1981, MFS launched the country’s first globally diversified fixed-income fund (Massachusetts Financial International Trust-Bond Portfolio). In 1986, MFS offered the first closed-end, high-yield municipal bond fund to be traded on the New York Stock Exchange.
In 1982, the company was acquired by Sun Life Financial of Canada.
In 1998, MFS Chairman and Chief Executive, A. Keith Brodkin died, causing a major shift in top management. MFS's assets under management grew from $55 billion to $90 billion between 1997 and 1998, and was reported to be the fastest growing company amongst the twenty largest that funds sold through brokers.[4]
During the early 2000s, MFS and five other mutual fund companies in the Boston area were investigated by Massachusetts and New Hampshire regulators. That same year, the Securities and Exchange Commission alleged that MFS made "false and misleading" statements in its fund prospectus about its policy on market trading and market timing. MFS paid $350 million to settle state and federal fraud charges. MFS appointed Robert Pozen as non-executive chairman from 2004 to 2010. [5] MFS then implemented a set of company reforms to inform investors about fees, keep fund boards independent and create deterrents to market timing. These changes were intended to address the concerns of regulators and lawmakers and were praised by fund industry analysts and consumer advocates. These reforms ended the "soft-dollar" arrangements which allowed the swapping of brokerage commissions for market research and data.
From 2010 to today, assets under management grew from $253 billion to more than $413 billion.[citation needed]

	Fund Overview
	

Objective 


						Seeks a high level of total return consistent with an aggressive level of risk relative to the other MFS Asset Allocation Funds.
					


Key Differentiators 


A strategically allocated, broadly diversified portfolio of MFS funds in a single investment
Utilizes a strategic risk-based approach to portfolio construction that efficiently diversifies across and within asset classes while simultaneously being actively-managed within the underlying MFS funds
Disciplined portfolio management is achieved through multi-level risk management, ensuring style consistency. Systematic rules-based rebalancing helps to maintain target risk profiles. Risk-return profiles have historically remained consistent with design.

Important Performance Information





Performance results reflect any applicable expense subsidies and waivers in effect during the periods shown. Without such subsidies and waivers the fund's performance results would be less favorable. All results are historical and assume the reinvestment of dividends and capital gains.
		





Sales Charges
		





Class A shares ("A") results include the maximum sales charge.
		





Important Risk Considerations




The fund may not achieve its objective and/or you could lose money on your investment in the fund.
		





Stock markets and investments in individual stocks  are volatile and can decline significantly in response to issuer, market, economic, industry, political, regulatory, geopolitical, and other conditions.
		





Investments in foreign markets can involve greater risk and volatility than U.S. investments because of adverse market, currency, economic, industry, political, regulatory, geopolitical, or other conditions.
		





Investments in small-cap companies can be more volatile than investments in larger companies.   
		





MFS’ strategy of investing in underlying funds exposes the fund to the risks of the underlying funds.  Each underlying fund pursues its own objective and strategies and may not achieve its objective.
		





Please see the prospectus for further information on these and other risk considerations.

Morningstar Disclosure



The Morningstar Rating for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.
		



Morningstar rankings may vary among share classes and are based on historical total returns, which are not indicative of future results.




Class A share star ratings do not include any front-end sales load and are intended for those investors who have access to such purchase terms (e.g., plan participants of a defined contribution plan.) Therefore, Morningstar strongly encourages investors to contact their investment professional to determine whether they are eligible to purchase the A share without paying the front load.

Investment Management
Insights, Strategies and Solutions
Our experienced professionals have expertise in a broad spectrum of traditional, alternative and non-financial assets.  We can work with you to develop and manage a portfolio tailored to your needs.






Portfolio Consulting
A collaborative dialogue with your portfolio manager
Your portfolio manager is a key member of your U.S. Trust relationship team and serves as your personal "chief investment officer." He or she will work with you to create an Investment Policy Statement, which serves as a blueprint for your portfolio by documenting your:

Objectives
Risk tolerance
Cash flow needs
 Tax situation
Wealth aspirations

Your portfolio manager's ongoing role is to incorporate our best strategic and tactical thinking, most relevant research analysis, current market insights and appropriate investment solutions into your portfolio. He or she will regularly monitor your portfolio to make sure it conforms to your Investment Policy Statement, which will be updated whenever there are significant changes in your life or goals.
Asset management
A more complete approach to asset allocation1
We analyze a wide range of asset classes, including hedge and private equity funds2 and global investment opportunities, as potential components of an asset allocation. In addition, we believe that true diversification requires managing for cash flows across and within asset classes in various market environments — not simply allocating according to a grid.
Your asset allocation will be based on the long-term expectations established for each asset class by our most senior investment professionals. Over the shorter term, however, your portfolio manager can adjust your portfolio tactically in response to emerging opportunities and risks, and reflecting U.S. Trust insights about trends and themes relevant to you.
How you own your assets — personally or in trusts; in taxable or tax-exempt solutions — can have a material impact on the overall performance of your portfolio. At U.S. Trust we focus on this wealth structuring aspect of your portfolio in conjunction with managing the assets themselves.
Alternative Investments
SOPHISTICATED SOLUTIONS TO MEET YOUR NEEDS2
Alternative investments at U.S. Trust focus on non-traditional assets such as:

Hedge funds
Private equity
Real estate and tangible assets

Because performance is often differentiated from equity and fixed income markets, alternative investments may be an ideal complement to traditional investments. 
Through our access to the industry's premier managers, we are able to offer solutions that provide options for all client segments. And we support you every step of the way with knowledge built on our experience in alternatives, including industry-leading research, rigorous due diligence, and cutting-edge portfolio construction.
Drawing from the experience, resources and expertise of the firm, you and your portfolio manager can explore alternative investments that can help you pursue what matters most to you.
Specialty asset management
Expertise in nonfinancial assets3
Specialty asset management at U.S. Trust focuses on nonfinancial assets such as:

Farm and ranch land
Timberland
Oil and gas properties
Private businesses
Real estate

Our Specialty Asset Management team can work with your portfolio manager and wealth strategist, as appropriate, to integrate these real assets into your overall plan and portfolio.
We can help you realize your objectives with assets you already own, or help you acquire specific assets to take advantage of their capital growth and diversification potential — whether you own these assets outright or they are held in trust.
Our team of specialists can provide complete turnkey services including identifying and purchasing real property and providing ongoing management.
Capital markets
Sophisticated market-linked solutions4
Through our access to the resources of Merrill Lynch, one of the world's leading capital markets participants, we can tailor approaches to risks and opportunities in the foreign exchange, interest rate, commodity and equity markets. Derivative-based transactions target the risks you seek to hedge, and are designed to dovetail with your overall portfolio and wealth management strategies.

1 Asset allocation and diversification do not ensure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.
2 Alternative Investments such as derivatives, hedge funds, private equity funds, and funds of funds can result in higher return potential but also higher loss potential. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely affect your investments. Before you invest in alternative investments, you should consider your overall financial situation, how much money you have to invest, your need for liquidity, and your tolerance for risk. Alternative investments are speculative and involve a high degree of risk.
3 Nonfinancial assets, such as closely-held businesses, real estate, oil, gas and mineral properties, and timber, farm and ranch land, are complex in nature and involve risks including total loss of value.  Special risk considerations include natural events (for example, earthquakes or fires), complex tax considerations, and lack of liquidity.  Nonfinancial assets are not suitable for all investors.  Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager, and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax, or estate planning strategy.
4 Brokerage services are provided by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, a registered broker-dealer, Member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation.
Certain U.S. Trust associates are registered representatives with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated ("MLPF&S") and may assist you with investment products and services provided through MLPF&S and other nonbank investment affiliates. MLPF&S is a registered broker-dealer, member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation ("BofA Corp."). U.S. Trust operates through Bank of America, N.A., and other subsidiaries of BofA Corp.

Wealth Structuring
Preservation and Transfer
Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.






Wealth Planning
Integrating your personal and financial affairs
By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.
Learn more about Philanthropy at U.S. Trust
Custody Services
Benefiting from the experience of dedicated custody specialists
U.S. Trust is the custodian of choice for many sophisticated investors with extensive and complex holdings. Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.

Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax or estate planning strategy.

Please remember there's always the potential of losing money when you invest in securities. 
			
			Before you invest in a Section 529 plan, request the plan's official statement from your Financial Solutions Advisor and read it carefully. The official statement contains more complete information, including investment objectives, charges, expenses and risks of investing in the 529 plan, which you should consider carefully before investing. You should also consider whether your home state or your beneficiary's home state offers any state tax or other benefits that are only available for investments in such state's 529 plan. Section 529 plans are not guaranteed by any state or federal agency.

1 To be eligible for favorable tax treatment afforded to any earnings portion of withdrawals from Section 529 accounts, such withdrawals must be used for "qualified higher education expenses," as defined in the Internal Revenue Code. Any earnings withdrawn that are not used for such expenses are subject to federal income tax and may be subject to a 10% additional federal tax, as well as applicable state and local income taxes. 
			
2 Section 529 plans are established by various states and are offered to residents of all states. Depending on the laws of the customer's home state, favorable tax treatment for investing in a Section 529 plan may be limited to investments made in a Section 529 plan offered by the customer's home state. Neither Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated nor any of its subsidiaries are tax or legal advisors. We suggest you consult your personal tax or legal advisor before making tax or legal-related investment decisions.

Frequently Asked Questions 




What is an IRA?


							An Individual Retirement Account (IRA) may provide either a tax-deferred or tax-free way for you to save for retirement.  There are many different types of IRAs but Roth, Traditional and Rollover IRAs are the most common.
						






How does an IRA work?


							IRAs rely on long-term, tax-deferred compounding to provide your retirement savings the opportunity to grow more quickly than in a taxable account.  When you earn interest, receive a dividend or sell an investment (such as a mutual fund) for a gain, you don't pay taxes that year on the earnings.  Instead, all taxes are deferred until you withdraw those earnings in retirement.
						






Why is an IRA important now?


							In retirement you may need as much as 100% of your current after-tax income (take-home pay) minus any amount you are saving for retirement each year.  This makes it all the more important to start saving sooner rather than later, and an IRA can help you get started.
						






What are the ways I can invest in an IRA?


							You can choose from investment products such as mutual funds, stocks, bonds and ETFs, as well as bank products like CDs and money market savings.
						






What are the contribution deadlines?

You can make contributions to an IRA for a given tax year until the tax return filing deadline of the following year.






How do I convert to a Roth IRA?

A Roth IRA Conversion could help grow your retirement assets federally income tax-free. To help you convert to a Merrill Edge Roth IRA, call us at 888.637.3343 for one-on-one assistance and we'll guide you every step of the way. We're here 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.






What are my options for converting a 401(k) to an IRA?

You have several choices when it comes to your old 401(k). Typically known as a rollover IRA, you can opt to transfer your money into an IRA. Another option is keeping the current 401(k) with your old employer or transfer it to a new employer plan.

Frequently Asked Questions 




SEP IRA



Do I have to contribute annually?
                                No. A SEP IRA gives you the flexibility to decide each year whether to contribute and at what rate. That could mean contributing more during profitable years and less or nothing at all during less profitable years.
                            
Is it difficult to administer a SEP IRA?
                                SEP IRAs have little to no paperwork and administration and don't require filing with the IRS. Plus, a Small Business Financial Solutions Advisor can help you get started.
                            
Is there investment research I can review? 
                                Yes. As a Merrill Edge client, you get access to BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research (rated #1 by Institutional InvestorFootnote 2)-as well as research from other industry leaders-to gain investing knowledge and market
                                insights that can help inform your investment strategy.
                            




SIMPLE IRA



Is there a mandatory employer match? 
                                Yes. With a SIMPLE IRA, you must contribute either 2% of compensation for each eligible employee, regardless of participation, or a dollar-for-dollar match of employee salary deferral contributions, capped at 3% of compensation (which may be reduced to as low as 1% in any two years during a 5-year period).
                            
What if my business grows beyond 100 employees?
                                You may need to consider establishing a small business 401(k) plan when your business grows to more than 100 employees. A Small Business Financial Solutions Advisor can help you consider your options. Please note: If you decide to establish a 401(k) plan, you would stop contributions to the SIMPLE IRA plan and then start the 401(k). Participants that have been in the SIMPLE IRA plan for over two years may roll their SIMPLE IRA assets over to the new 401(k) if it allows for rollovers. Before making any decisions, you should speak with your tax and legal advisor about your situation and the requirements for terminating a plan and establishing a new one.
                            
Is it difficult to administer a SIMPLE IRA? 
                                We have many ways to make managing your retirement plan easier. Our Merrill Lynch E-Contribs for Small Business Retirement Accounts™ provides small business owners with a convenient web-based solution for making contributions to retirement plan accounts, while the Automated Investment Program provides a systematic way to invest in mutual funds on a schedule based on your needs.
                                
                                SIMPLE IRA contributions will be made through your payroll company and you will be required to send an annual notice to your employees. You do not file IRS Form 5500 as you would with a 401(k) plan.

Webcast


Market Insights Q3 2017 Markets seem to be telling us conflicting stories. On one hand, stocks have continued to climb on seemingly unabated investor optimism this year. On the other, bond yields have reversed course and fallen, indicating investor pessimism over future growth and inflation. Which story is right? Forward indicators suggest we may see a mini down cycle soon, which suggests caution.
Jon Hubbard from the MFS Investment Solutions team will moderate a discussion with MFS Chief Investment Strategist James Swanson and MFS Chief Economist Erik Weisman as they discuss how to decipher the conflicting narratives being told by the current market landscape.

MFS Investment Management (MFS) is an American-based global investment manager, formerly known as Massachusetts Financial Services. Founded in 1924, MFS is one of the oldest asset management companies in the world and has been credited with pioneering the mutual fund.[1] The very first mutual fund, the Massachusetts Investors Trust fund, is still in operation today. MFS had USD$448.7 billion in assets under management as of April 30, 2017.[2]

History[edit]
The company was founded in 1924 by L. Sherman Adams, Charles H. Learoyd and Ashton L. Carr.[3] The company's oldest fund is the Massachusetts Investors Trust, a mutual fund created with $50,000 at the company's inception and reported to be "the world's first open-end investment fund".[3] The company used "brokerage channels" to market its shares to the public and later expanded to $14 million in assets over the next five years.[3] During the stock market crash of 1929 the fund survived an 83% loss and went on to create a second fund in 1934. By 1959, the Massachusetts Investors Trust fund had become the largest mutual fund in the United States.
In 1969, MIT was reorganized as Massachusetts Financial Services (MFS) to reflect the firm's broadened scope of products and services.
In 1976, MFS offered one of the nation’s first national municipal bond funds (Managed Municipal Bond Trust) and in 1981, MFS launched the country’s first globally diversified fixed-income fund (Massachusetts Financial International Trust-Bond Portfolio). In 1986, MFS offered the first closed-end, high-yield municipal bond fund to be traded on the New York Stock Exchange.
In 1982, the company was acquired by Sun Life Financial of Canada.
In 1998, MFS Chairman and Chief Executive, A. Keith Brodkin died, causing a major shift in top management. MFS's assets under management grew from $55 billion to $90 billion between 1997 and 1998, and was reported to be the fastest growing company amongst the twenty largest that funds sold through brokers.[4]
During the early 2000s, MFS and five other mutual fund companies in the Boston area were investigated by Massachusetts and New Hampshire regulators. That same year, the Securities and Exchange Commission alleged that MFS made "false and misleading" statements in its fund prospectus about its policy on market trading and market timing. MFS paid $350 million to settle state and federal fraud charges. MFS appointed Robert Pozen as non-executive chairman from 2004 to 2010. [5] MFS then implemented a set of company reforms to inform investors about fees, keep fund boards independent and create deterrents to market timing. These changes were intended to address the concerns of regulators and lawmakers and were praised by fund industry analysts and consumer advocates. These reforms ended the "soft-dollar" arrangements which allowed the swapping of brokerage commissions for market research and data.
From 2010 to today, assets under management grew from $253 billion to more than $413 billion.[citation needed]

Swanson: It’s a time to think about capital preservation.pic.twitter.com/rvQDDIagSP









Sleepy Inflation Could Limit Interest Rate Scares
With global inflation running below target, interest rates are likely to stay lower for longer. With that in mind, this late in the business cycle, capital preservation becomes increasingly important.

MFS Investment Management (MFS) is an American-based global investment manager, formerly known as Massachusetts Financial Services. Founded in 1924, MFS is one of the oldest asset management companies in the world and has been credited with pioneering the mutual fund.[1] The very first mutual fund, the Massachusetts Investors Trust fund, is still in operation today. MFS had USD$448.7 billion in assets under management as of April 30, 2017.[2]

History[edit]
The company was founded in 1924 by L. Sherman Adams, Charles H. Learoyd and Ashton L. Carr.[3] The company's oldest fund is the Massachusetts Investors Trust, a mutual fund created with $50,000 at the company's inception and reported to be "the world's first open-end investment fund".[3] The company used "brokerage channels" to market its shares to the public and later expanded to $14 million in assets over the next five years.[3] During the stock market crash of 1929 the fund survived an 83% loss and went on to create a second fund in 1934. By 1959, the Massachusetts Investors Trust fund had become the largest mutual fund in the United States.
In 1969, MIT was reorganized as Massachusetts Financial Services (MFS) to reflect the firm's broadened scope of products and services.
In 1976, MFS offered one of the nation’s first national municipal bond funds (Managed Municipal Bond Trust) and in 1981, MFS launched the country’s first globally diversified fixed-income fund (Massachusetts Financial International Trust-Bond Portfolio). In 1986, MFS offered the first closed-end, high-yield municipal bond fund to be traded on the New York Stock Exchange.
In 1982, the company was acquired by Sun Life Financial of Canada.
In 1998, MFS Chairman and Chief Executive, A. Keith Brodkin died, causing a major shift in top management. MFS's assets under management grew from $55 billion to $90 billion between 1997 and 1998, and was reported to be the fastest growing company amongst the twenty largest that funds sold through brokers.[4]
During the early 2000s, MFS and five other mutual fund companies in the Boston area were investigated by Massachusetts and New Hampshire regulators. That same year, the Securities and Exchange Commission alleged that MFS made "false and misleading" statements in its fund prospectus about its policy on market trading and market timing. MFS paid $350 million to settle state and federal fraud charges. MFS appointed Robert Pozen as non-executive chairman from 2004 to 2010. [5] MFS then implemented a set of company reforms to inform investors about fees, keep fund boards independent and create deterrents to market timing. These changes were intended to address the concerns of regulators and lawmakers and were praised by fund industry analysts and consumer advocates. These reforms ended the "soft-dollar" arrangements which allowed the swapping of brokerage commissions for market research and data.
From 2010 to today, assets under management grew from $253 billion to more than $413 billion.[citation needed]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link.
