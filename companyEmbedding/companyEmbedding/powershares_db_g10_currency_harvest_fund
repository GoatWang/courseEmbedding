What a constant stream of oil company spending cuts means for crude prices
              
              Oil companies are sounding a recurring theme: lower exploration and production spending estimates. Will that lead to a rally in oil prices?

How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve 
              
              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

A quarter of S&P 500’s 2017 climb due to five stocks (yes, those five)
              
              Throughout 2017, there’s one acronym that investors have in particular been sinking their teeth into: FAANG.

Amazon earnings fall 77%, shares drop
              
              Amazon.com Inc.  reported much lower earnings than expected Thursday, and shares declined more than 2% in late trading. The e-commerce giant reported net income of $197 million, or 40 cents a share, on sales of $38 billion, a profit decline of 77% from the same quarter a year ago. Analysts on average expected Amazon to report earnings of $1.41 a share on sales of $37.2 billion. The company's spending cut into profit, as fulfillment costs -- the amount Amazon spends to fulfill customers' orders on its e-commerce platform -- rose about 33% from a year ago and spending on technology and content increased by about 43%. Amazon stock traded at all-time highs this week, making Amazon the fourth U.S. company with a market capitalization of $500 billion and briefly giving Chief Executive Jeff Bezos the title of richest man in the world, but shares declined about 2% in immediate after-hours action.

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks 
              
              Still, a chart of the S&P 500 reveals an undercurrent of bullishness, says Lawrence G. McMillan.

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

DBV - Powershares DB G10 Currency Harvest Fund set to launch




Deutsche Bank (DB) and PowerShares today announced the upcoming launch of the PowerShares DB G10 Currency Harvest Fund (DBV), which will list on the American Stock Exchange Monday, September 18, 2006 (AMEX: DBV).DBV will offer investors access to the Deutsche Bank G10 Currency Future Harvest Index™, which is designed to capitalize on the trend that currencies associated with high interest rates, on average, tend to rise in value relative to currencies associated with relatively low interest rates.“Currency markets are very liquid and have exhibited the ability to generate long-term systematic returns,” said Kevin Rich, Chief Executive Officer of DB Commodity Services LLC, the managing owner of DBV. “DBV will offer investors easy access to the returns of the currency markets by following an index previously available only to very sophisticated investors.”“DBV is a sophisticated global currency strategy not previously available in an ETF” said Bruce Bond, Chief Executive Officer of PowerShares Capital Management, LLC. “DBV is an excellent way for investors to obtain currency exposure which automatically adjust its allocations to the worlds largest currencies based on a time tested institutional methodology.”This effort further extends the relationship between DB and PowerShares, offering Deutsche Bank’s leadership in global currency and commodity product structuring with the exchange - traded fund (ETF) product marketing expertise of PowerShares. DBV will enter both long and short exchange traded currency futures positions, and will also generate interest on cash and United States treasury securities held as collateral for the futures contracts it holds.
