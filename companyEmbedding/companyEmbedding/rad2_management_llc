Form 10-K
A 10-K is a comprehensive summary report of a company's performance that must be submitted annually to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Typically, the 10-K contains much more detail than the annual report. It includes information such as company history, organizational structure, equity, holdings, earnings per share, subsidiaries, etc. 

The 10-K must be filed within 60 days (it used to be 90 days) after the end of the fiscal year.
Form 10-K/A
Amended Form 10-K
Form 10-Q
The SEC form 10-Q is a comprehensive report of a company's performance that must be submitted quarterly by all public companies to the Securities and Exchange Commission. In the 10-Q, firms are required to disclose relevant information regarding their financial position. The form must be submitted on time, and the information should be available to all interested parties. 

The 10-Q is due 35 days (it used to be 45 days) after each of the first three fiscal quarters. There is no filing after the fourth quarter because that is when the 10-K is filed.
Form 10-Q/A
Amended Form 10-Q
Form 3
A document that must be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by an insider affiliated with a public company's operation or by any investor owning 10% or more of the company's outstanding shares

This document must be filed with the SEC no later than 10 days after an insider becomes affiliated with a company, and it must be filed for each company in which a person is an insider, regardless of whether or not the insider has an equity position in the company at that time.
Form 3/A
Amended Form 3
Form 4
A Form 4 is a document that must be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) whenever there is a material change in the holdings of company insiders. Insiders required to submit a Form 4 include directors and officers of the company as well as any shareholders owning 10% or more of the company's outstanding stock.

This two-page document covers any buy-and-sell orders on the open market as well as the exercise of company stock options. A Form 4 is mandatory within two business days starting from the end of the day the material transaction occurred. This filing is related to Form 3 and the Form 5, which also cover changes to the company insider holdings.
Form 4/A
Amended Form 4
Form 5
The annual statement of beneficial ownership of securities.
Form 5/A
Amended Form 5
Form 8-K
An 8-K is a report of unscheduled material events or corporate changes at a company that could be of importance to the shareholders or the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

Examples of events reported on an 8-K include acquisition, bankruptcy, resignation of directors, or a change in the fiscal year. Also known as Form 8k.
Form D
A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) required for companies that are selling securities in reliance on a Regulation D exemption or Section 4(6) exemption provisions. 

Form D is a brief notice of a company's executive officers and stock promoters, in lieu of the regular reports required when no exemption under Regulation D exists. 

Form D must be filed no later than 15 days after the first sale of securities.

Form D is also known as the Notice of Sale of Securities and is a requirement under Regulation D, Section 4(6) and/or the Uniform Limited Offering Exemption of the Securities Exchange Act of 1933. 

This act, often referred to as the "truth in securities" law, requires that these registration forms, providing essential facts, are filed to disclose important information upon registration of a company's securities. This helps the SEC achieve the objectives of this act - requiring investors to receive significant information regarding securities offered and prohibiting fraud in the sale of the offered securities.
Form D/A
Amended Form D
Form DEF 14A
A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that must be filed by or on behalf of a registrant when a shareholder vote is required. SEC Form DEF 14A is most commonly used in conjunction with an annual meeting proxy. The form should provide security holders with sufficient information to allow them to make an informed vote at an upcoming security holders' meeting or to authorize a proxy to vote on their behalf. It includes information about the date, time and place of the meeting of security holders; revocability of proxy; dissenter's right of appraisal; persons making the solicitation; direct or indirect interest of certain persons in matters to be acted upon; modification or exchange of securities; financial statements; voting procedures; and other details. 

All other filed by non-management definitive proxy statements - typically an annual meeting proxy.

Form DEF 14A, which is also known as "definitive proxy statement", is required under Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This form is filed with the SEC when a definitive proxy statement is given to shareholders and helps the SEC ensure that shareholders' rights are upheld.
Form S-1
The SEC form S-1 is the initial registration form for new securities required by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for public companies. Any security that meets the criteria must have an S-1 filing before shares can be listed on a national exchange. 

Form S-1 requires companies to provide information on the planned use of capital proceeds, detail the current business model and competition, as well provide a a brief prospectus of the planned security itself, offering price methodology, and any dilution that will occur to other listed securities. The SEC also requires the disclosure of any material business dealings between the company and its directors and outside counsel. 

Form S-1 is also known as the "Registration Statement Under the Securities Exchange Act of 1933". 

Investors can view S-1 filings online to perform due diligence on new offerings prior to their issue. The form is sometimes amended as material information changes or general market conditions cause a delay in the offering. 

The Securities Exchange Act of 1933, often referred to as the "truth in securities" law, requires that these registration forms are filed to disclose important information upon registration of a company's securities. This helps the SEC achieve the objectives of this act, which is requiring investors to receive significant information regarding securities offered, and to prohibit fraud in the sale of the offered securities. 

A less rigid registration form is the S-3, which is for companies that don't have the same ongoing reporting requirements.

Odle Management Group, LLC (OMG) requests that we recommend that it be reimbursed the costs associated with filing and pursuing its bid protest against the Department of Labors (DOL) award of a contract to CHP International under solicitation No. DOLJ10UA00032, for outreach and admissions, and career training services.
We grant OMGs request in part and deny it in part. 











 Decision  Matter of: Odle Management Group, LLC--Costs File: B-404855.2 Date: March 26, 2012 Cynthia Malyszek, Esq., Malyszek & Malyszek, for the protester.Peter J. Dickson, Esq., Department of Labor, for the agency.Scott H. Riback, Esq., and David A. Ashen, Esq., Office of the General Counsel, GAO, participated in the preparation of the decision.DIGEST 1. GAO recommends reimbursement of the costs of filing and pursuing protest challenging the agencys conduct of misleading discussions, where issue was clearly meritorious but agency unduly delayed taking corrective action. 2. Protest costs are not recommended with respect to issues concerning agencys evaluation of proposals and source selection decision where such issues were readily severable from challenge to agencys conduct of misleading discussions, the only issue found to be clearly meritorious at Government Accountability Office outcome prediction alternative dispute resolution conference.DECISION Odle Management Group, LLC (OMG) requests that we recommend that it be reimbursed the costs associated with filing and pursuing its bid protest against the Department of Labors (DOL) award of a contract to CHP International under solicitation No. DOLJ10UA00032, for outreach and admissions, and career training services. [1] We grant OMGs request in part and deny it in part. OMG initially protested the agencys award of a contract to CHP, arguing that the agency misevaluated proposals and made an unreasonable best value source selection decision. OMG also asserted that the agency misled it during discussions. Specifically, the agency advised OMG during discussions that its proposed staffing appeared to be high; in response to the agencys discussion question, OMG lowered its proposed staffing, and the agency ultimately identified OMGs proposed staffing as a weakness. Subsequent to the development of the record, including the filing of an agency report and receipt of comments, our Office conducted an outcome prediction alternative dispute resolution (ADR) conference. In the course of that ADR, the cognizant Government Accountability Office (GAO) attorney advised the agency that GAO likely would sustain OMGs protest on the basis that the agency had misled OMG during discussions. The GAO attorney recommended that the agency reopen discussions, obtain and evaluate revised proposals, and make a new source selection decision. Because our recommendation involved the agency reopening the acquisition, we did not reach the merits of OMGs other issues. In response to the ADR, DOL advised our Office that it intended to take corrective action. In particular, the agency advised that it would reopen discussions with the competitive range offerors, obtain and evaluate revised proposals and make a new source selection decision. Based on the agencys proposed corrective action, we dismissed OMGs protest as academic. B-404855, May 18, 2011. In response to OMGs request for reimbursement, DOL concedes that the protester is entitled to a recommendation that it be reimbursed its protest costs. Agency Report at 2. The agency argues, however, that OMGs recovery should be limited to those costs that were incurred in connection with its allegation relating to misleading discussions. According to the agency, although we found this aspect of the protest to be clearly meritorious (as evidenced by the view expressed during the ADR), we did not find the remainder of OMGs allegations clearly meritorious. The agency further maintains that the facts and legal theories underpinning OMGs misleading discussions argument are distinct from the facts and legal theories underpinning the remainder of its protest, such that the costs incurred in connection with the former allegation are clearly severable from the costs incurred in connection with the latter allegations. We agree with the agency that reimbursement of OMGs protest costs should be confined to the costs incurred in connection with its misleading discussions issue. As noted by the agency, and as reflected in the views of the GAO attorney expressed during the ADR, the only protest issue that we found clearly meritorious was that of misleading discussions. Although as a general rule, we may recommend that a successful protester be reimbursed its incurred costs with respect to all issues pursued and not merely those upon which it prevails, AAR Aircraft Servs.--Costs, B-291670.6, May 12, 2003, 2003 CPD ¶ 100 at 9, in appropriate cases we have limited our recommendation for the award of protest costs where a part of those costs is allocable to an unsuccessful protest issue that is so clearly severable from the successful issues as to essentially constitute a separate protest. BAE Tech. Servs., Inc.--Costs, B-296699.3, Aug. 11, 2006, 2006 CPD ¶ 122 at 3; Interface Flooring Sys., Inc.-Claim for Attorneys Fees, B-225439.5, July 29, 1987, 87-2 CPD ¶ 106 at 2-3. In determining whether protest issues are so clearly severable as to essentially constitute separate protests, we consider, among other things, the extent to which the issues are interrelated or intertwined--i.e., the extent to which successful and unsuccessful arguments share a common core set of facts, are based on related legal theories, or are otherwise not readily severable. See Sodexho Mgmt., Inc.--Costs, B-289605.3, Aug. 6, 2003, 2003 CPD ¶ 136 at 29. Here, OMGs technical evaluation and source selection issues were not clearly intertwined with its misleading discussions issue. Whether the agencys evaluation of proposals and source selection decision were reasonable concern legal theories and underlying facts that are distinct and severable from those relevant to OMGs misleading discussions issue. Focused Mgmt., Inc.--Costs, B-404029.6, Oct. 3, 2011, 2011 CPD ¶ 204 at 4-5. Under these circumstances, we conclude that OMGs reimbursement of protest costs should be limited to those costs incurred in connection with its misleading discussions protest basis. RECOMMENDATION We recommend that OMG be reimbursed the costs associated with filing and pursuing its protest on the issue of misleading discussions, including reasonable attorneys fees. OMG should submit its certified claim, detailing the time spent and costs incurred, directly to the agency within 60 days of its receipt of this decision. Bid Protest Regulations, 4 C.F.R. § 21.8(f)(1) (2011). The request is granted in part and denied in part. Lynn H. GibsonGeneral Counsel[1] In its initial submission, OMG also requested that we recommend that it be reimbursed its proposal preparation costs. The agency responded to OMGs request and, in its subsequent submission to our Office, OMG made no further mention of its request for proposal costs. We consider this aspect of OMGs request abandoned. Recreation Resource Mgmt. of America, Inc., B-406072, Feb. 1, 2012, 2012 CPD ¶ 60 at 6 n.3.
