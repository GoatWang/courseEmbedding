ClearBridge Investments, LLC Key Developments

Clearbridge Investments Launches Two New Exchange-Traded Funds
May 23 17
Legg Mason Inc. launched two new funds on May 23, 2017. To try and get ahead of its passive competition, Legg Mason is offering two new actively managed exchange-traded funds through its subsidiary, Clearbridge Investments. Legg Mason's new funds combine the actively managed nature of mutual funds with the tax benefits of exchange-traded funds. Like mutual funds, the ETFs are overseen by portfolio managers who will have the freedom to invest in certain industries and deviate from the benchmark indices as they see fit. One of the funds is the ClearBridge Large Cap Growth ESG ETF, managed by Peter Bourbeau, Mary Jane McQuillen and Margaret Vitrano. The fund will invest for the long term in large-cap growth companies that have high returns on capital and strong balance sheets with potential for above-average earnings and cash flow growth. The other new fund is the ClearBridge Dividend Strategy ESG ETF, managed by Hersh Cohen, Michael Clarfeld, McQuillen and Peter Vanderlee. The fund will invest in companies with long histories of paying and raising dividends. The portfolio management teams of both funds will also consider environmental, social and governance factors in deciding which companies to invest. The teams will rely on inputs from sector analysts who assign a rating to every company in their coverage area. The scoring process will include an assessment of the corporate governance practices of all of the companies, like board independence and diversity as well as social factors including workforce diversity, hiring practices and community involvement.


Charlotte Walsh Joins ClearBridge Investments' as Director, Institutional Sales

		What I Should Know 
Before Investing




Equity securities are subject to price fluctuation and possible loss of principal. International investments are subject to special risks, including currency fluctuations and social, economic and political uncertainties, which could increase volatility. These risks are magnified in emerging markets. Short selling is a speculative strategy. Unlike the possible loss on a security that is purchased, there is no limit on the amount of loss on an appreciating security that is sold short. Derivatives, such as options and futures, can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses, and have a potentially large impact on Fund performance. The manager’s investment style may become out of favor and/or the manager’s selection process may prove incorrect, which may have a negative impact on the Fund’s performance.

IMPORTANT HOLDINGS INFORMATION: Portfolio holdings are based on total portfolio, and are subject to change at any time. Holdings are provided for informational purposes only and should not be construed as a recommendation to purchase or sell any security. Any negative allocations or allocations in excess of 100% are primarily due to unsettled trade activities.
Derivatives, such as options and futures, which can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses and have a potentially large impact on Fund performance.








IMPORTANT INFORMATION: Past performance is no guarantee of future results. These portfolios are available as investment options under a variable annuity or variable life contract. Shares of the portfolios are offered only to insurance company separate accounts that fund certain variable annuity or life contracts. These portfolios may not be available in all states and may only be offered in certain variable products. Please refer to the prospectuses. Variable annuities are long-term, tax-deferred investment vehicles designed for retirement purposes. Gains from tax-deferred investments are taxable as ordinary income upon withdrawal. Withdrawals made prior to age 59 1/2 are subject to a 10% IRS penalty charge and/or surrender charges. Investments in a variable annuity are subject to market risks, including loss of principal. Guarantees are based on the claims-paying ability of the insurer.
VARIABLE ANNUITIES ARE SOLD BY PROSPECTUS ONLY. AN INVESTOR SHOULD CONSIDER THE INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES, RISKS, CHARGES AND EXPENSES OF THE INSURANCE CONTRACT AND THE UNDERLYING PORTFOLIO CAREFULLY BEFORE INVESTING. THE PROSPECTUSES CONTAIN THIS AND OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE INSURANCE CONTRACT AND THE UNDERLYING PORTFOLIO. FOR A FREE PROSPECTUS ON THE UNDERLYING PORTFOLIO, PLEASE CLICK ON THE PROSPECTUS LINK. AN INVESTOR SHOULD READ THE PROSPECTUSES CAREFULLY BEFORE INVESTING.

An XBRL file is not viewable without a viewer tool. A viewer tool is available on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. You can download an XBRL zip file and view it on the SEC website or use the data for analysis with any comparison tool.

		What I Should Know 
Before Investing




Equity securities are subject to price fluctuation and possible loss of principal. Small- and mid-cap stocks involve greater risks and volatility than large-cap stocks. International investments are subject to special risks, including currency fluctuations and social, economic and political uncertainties, which could increase volatility. These risks are magnified in emerging markets. Short selling is a speculative strategy. Unlike the possible loss on a security that is purchased, there is no limit on the amount of loss on an appreciating security that is sold short.

Characteristics and holdings weightings are based on total portfolio, are subject to change at any time, and are provided for informational purposes only. Not to be construed as a recommendation to purchase or sell any security.

IMPORTANT HOLDINGS INFORMATION: Portfolio holdings are based on total portfolio, and are subject to change at any time. Holdings are provided for informational purposes only and should not be construed as a recommendation to purchase or sell any security. Any negative allocations or allocations in excess of 100% are primarily due to unsettled trade activities.
Derivatives, such as options and futures, which can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses and have a potentially large impact on Fund performance.








IMPORTANT INFORMATION: Past performance is no guarantee of future results. These portfolios are available as investment options under a variable annuity or variable life contract. Shares of the portfolios are offered only to insurance company separate accounts that fund certain variable annuity or life contracts. These portfolios may not be available in all states and may only be offered in certain variable products. Please refer to the prospectuses. Variable annuities are long-term, tax-deferred investment vehicles designed for retirement purposes. Gains from tax-deferred investments are taxable as ordinary income upon withdrawal. Withdrawals made prior to age 59 1/2 are subject to a 10% IRS penalty charge and/or surrender charges. Investments in a variable annuity are subject to market risks, including loss of principal. Guarantees are based on the claims-paying ability of the insurer.
VARIABLE ANNUITIES ARE SOLD BY PROSPECTUS ONLY. AN INVESTOR SHOULD CONSIDER THE INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES, RISKS, CHARGES AND EXPENSES OF THE INSURANCE CONTRACT AND THE UNDERLYING PORTFOLIO CAREFULLY BEFORE INVESTING. THE PROSPECTUSES CONTAIN THIS AND OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE INSURANCE CONTRACT AND THE UNDERLYING PORTFOLIO. FOR A FREE PROSPECTUS ON THE UNDERLYING PORTFOLIO, PLEASE CLICK ON THE PROSPECTUS LINK. AN INVESTOR SHOULD READ THE PROSPECTUSES CAREFULLY BEFORE INVESTING.

 An XBRL file is not a fund's complete prospectus. XBRL is an interactive data format and is provided in addition to a fund's prospectus and annual and semi-annual reports linked to this page. An XBRL file is not viewable without a viewer tool. A viewer tool is available on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. You can download an XBRL zip file and view it on the SEC website or use the data for analysis with any comparison tool.
FINANCIAL ADVISORS: Please note that not all share classes may be available for sale at your firm. Please call the Legg Mason Sales Desk 1-800-822-5544 or your Legg Mason Sales contact for more information.
