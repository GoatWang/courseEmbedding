    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator

The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment is a family entertainment, amusement park and attraction company formerly owned by Blackstone Group, which retains a minority share. It operates and maintains nine zoological theme parks eleven theme parks located throughout the United States. Formerly a subsidiary of Anheuser-Busch since 1989, under which it was known as Busch Entertainment Corporation,[3] SeaWorld Parks is headquartered in Orlando, Florida.[3][4]
According a previous Securities and Exchange Commission filing, annual attendance for calendar year 2012 was 24.4 million, while attendance for the January 1-October 31, 2013 period was 18.9 million. Average revenue per attendee was $62.79, of which 62% consists of admission fees. 55% of revenues were generated from parks in Florida, 20% in California, and 11% in Virginia.[2]
In October 2009, Anheuser-Busch InBev announced plans to sell the division to private-equity firm The Blackstone Group in order to reduce the debt load generated by InBev's 2008 purchase of Anheuser-Busch.[5] The sale was completed on December 1, 2009 and with it came a new company name, SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment.

History[edit]
Anheuser-Busch initially created the subsidiary to run the various Busch Gardens parks. The parks at Tampa, Florida and Williamsburg, Virginia were located adjacent to breweries, and the parks included tours of the facilities and even free samples of the products made there. In 1989, Anheuser-Busch purchased the theme park unit of publisher Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, which included the SeaWorld family of parks. The purchase also included two other parks in Central Florida: Cypress Gardens and Boardwalk and Baseball. Boardwalk and Baseball was promptly closed, while Cypress Gardens was later sold and transformed into Legoland Florida, which opened in October 2011. The parks were managed out of Anheuser-Busch's headquarters in St. Louis, Missouri until 2008, when the company relocated the division to Florida, where five of the company's ten parks were located.[3]
In 2008, Anheuser-Busch was acquired by Brazilian-Belgian brewer InBev. Based on its previous acquisitions, it was widely expected that InBev would later sell off non-core assets in order to pay down the debt created by its purchase of Anheuser-Busch; the theme-park division was considered one of the most likely assets to be sold.[6] In early 2009, InBev began soliciting bids for those assets in advance of an anticipated sale.[7] As part of the plans to shed the division, Busch Entertainment ended the free beer-sampling programs at those parks that had them.[8] Similarly, Busch Entertainment broke from its parent company and terminated a benefit where employees of legal age received two free cases of Anheuser-Busch beer per month, a benefit that continued for the rest of the company.[8][9] At the time, InBev was thought to be considering selling the parks to the highest bidder, or spinning off Busch Entertainment as an independent company.[7] It was suggested at one point that NBC Universal was interested in purchasing Busch Entertainment, and folding it into the Universal Studios Theme Parks chain, but no official bid for the company surfaced.[10] However, other asset sales, such as the sale of Tsingtao Brewery, and an issuance of $3 billion in new long-term debt in May 2009, raised over $11 billion since the start of 2009, temporarily reducing the need to sell Busch Entertainment.[11] Other cited reasons for an apparent reluctance to sell off the company included still-volatile credit markets and receipt of initial bids that were lower than expected.[11]
Acquisition by the Blackstone Group[edit]
In late 2009, the Blackstone Group reportedly entered into negotiations to acquire Busch Entertainment.[12] The Blackstone Group already owned a partnership in Universal Orlando Resort, and a significant interest in Merlin Entertainments, which operates attractions and theme parks such as Madame Tussauds and Legoland.[12] Previous estimates have valued Busch Entertainment at somewhere between USD $2.5-3.0 billion.[12]
On 7 October 2009, the discussions came to fruition as Anheuser-Busch InBev announced plans to sell Busch Entertainment Corporation to the Blackstone Group in a deal worth approximately US$2.7 billion.[13]
As part of the deal, Blackstone will maintain the current management team from Busch Entertainment and operate it as a separate entity.[13] Further, Anheuser-Busch will sign a sponsorship agreement with the company, thus allowing the two Busch Gardens parks to keep their current names and promotions, including the "Here's to the Heroes" military appreciation program.[13] In announcing the deal, Busch Entertainment President Jim Atchison said that Blackstone's acquisition brings "an awful lot of strategic vision for us. We're going to continue to grow the business together."[13]
The acquisition would be done with no loss of jobs at the parks or at the company's Orlando headquarters.[5] New departments will be hired to fill positions that would previously been managed by Anheuser-Busch, such as a legal department and procurement staff.[13] The largest proposed change to the operation of the parks would be the removal of Anheuser-Busch's Clydesdale from those parks that currently have them and the removal of the A&Eagle logos.[13] Anheuser-Busch licenses the "Busch Gardens" name to SeaWorld Entertainment perpetually.[2]
Initial public offering[edit]
On December 27, 2012, SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment announced that it had filed for an initial public offering (IPO) of stock. Part of the proceeds from this sale would go to Blackstone group, which would retain a controlling interest in the company. It began trading April 19, 2013 on the New York Stock Exchange with a ticker symbol of SEAS.[14][15]
Decline in income[edit]
Following CNN's broadcast of the documentary Blackfish, which criticized the company's handling of killer whale exhibits, SeaWorld's profits went into a steep decline and its share values plummeted. SeaWorld said in August 2014 that the film had hurt revenues at its park in San Diego, California.[16] On December 11, 2014, SeaWorld announced that chief executive Jim Atchison would resign, with an interim successor replacing him on January 15, 2015. The company's share price had fallen 44% in 2014.[16][17]
In August 2015, SeaWorld announced an 84% drop in second quarter 2015 net income compared to the year before. Total income was down 3% from 2014-2015. Visitors fell by 100,000, from 6.58 million to 6.48 million.[18][19][20][21]

SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment is a family entertainment, amusement park and attraction company formerly owned by Blackstone Group, which retains a minority share. It operates and maintains nine zoological theme parks eleven theme parks located throughout the United States. Formerly a subsidiary of Anheuser-Busch since 1989, under which it was known as Busch Entertainment Corporation,[3] SeaWorld Parks is headquartered in Orlando, Florida.[3][4]
According a previous Securities and Exchange Commission filing, annual attendance for calendar year 2012 was 24.4 million, while attendance for the January 1-October 31, 2013 period was 18.9 million. Average revenue per attendee was $62.79, of which 62% consists of admission fees. 55% of revenues were generated from parks in Florida, 20% in California, and 11% in Virginia.[2]
In October 2009, Anheuser-Busch InBev announced plans to sell the division to private-equity firm The Blackstone Group in order to reduce the debt load generated by InBev's 2008 purchase of Anheuser-Busch.[5] The sale was completed on December 1, 2009 and with it came a new company name, SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment.

History[edit]
Anheuser-Busch initially created the subsidiary to run the various Busch Gardens parks. The parks at Tampa, Florida and Williamsburg, Virginia were located adjacent to breweries, and the parks included tours of the facilities and even free samples of the products made there. In 1989, Anheuser-Busch purchased the theme park unit of publisher Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, which included the SeaWorld family of parks. The purchase also included two other parks in Central Florida: Cypress Gardens and Boardwalk and Baseball. Boardwalk and Baseball was promptly closed, while Cypress Gardens was later sold and transformed into Legoland Florida, which opened in October 2011. The parks were managed out of Anheuser-Busch's headquarters in St. Louis, Missouri until 2008, when the company relocated the division to Florida, where five of the company's ten parks were located.[3]
In 2008, Anheuser-Busch was acquired by Brazilian-Belgian brewer InBev. Based on its previous acquisitions, it was widely expected that InBev would later sell off non-core assets in order to pay down the debt created by its purchase of Anheuser-Busch; the theme-park division was considered one of the most likely assets to be sold.[6] In early 2009, InBev began soliciting bids for those assets in advance of an anticipated sale.[7] As part of the plans to shed the division, Busch Entertainment ended the free beer-sampling programs at those parks that had them.[8] Similarly, Busch Entertainment broke from its parent company and terminated a benefit where employees of legal age received two free cases of Anheuser-Busch beer per month, a benefit that continued for the rest of the company.[8][9] At the time, InBev was thought to be considering selling the parks to the highest bidder, or spinning off Busch Entertainment as an independent company.[7] It was suggested at one point that NBC Universal was interested in purchasing Busch Entertainment, and folding it into the Universal Studios Theme Parks chain, but no official bid for the company surfaced.[10] However, other asset sales, such as the sale of Tsingtao Brewery, and an issuance of $3 billion in new long-term debt in May 2009, raised over $11 billion since the start of 2009, temporarily reducing the need to sell Busch Entertainment.[11] Other cited reasons for an apparent reluctance to sell off the company included still-volatile credit markets and receipt of initial bids that were lower than expected.[11]
Acquisition by the Blackstone Group[edit]
In late 2009, the Blackstone Group reportedly entered into negotiations to acquire Busch Entertainment.[12] The Blackstone Group already owned a partnership in Universal Orlando Resort, and a significant interest in Merlin Entertainments, which operates attractions and theme parks such as Madame Tussauds and Legoland.[12] Previous estimates have valued Busch Entertainment at somewhere between USD $2.5-3.0 billion.[12]
On 7 October 2009, the discussions came to fruition as Anheuser-Busch InBev announced plans to sell Busch Entertainment Corporation to the Blackstone Group in a deal worth approximately US$2.7 billion.[13]
As part of the deal, Blackstone will maintain the current management team from Busch Entertainment and operate it as a separate entity.[13] Further, Anheuser-Busch will sign a sponsorship agreement with the company, thus allowing the two Busch Gardens parks to keep their current names and promotions, including the "Here's to the Heroes" military appreciation program.[13] In announcing the deal, Busch Entertainment President Jim Atchison said that Blackstone's acquisition brings "an awful lot of strategic vision for us. We're going to continue to grow the business together."[13]
The acquisition would be done with no loss of jobs at the parks or at the company's Orlando headquarters.[5] New departments will be hired to fill positions that would previously been managed by Anheuser-Busch, such as a legal department and procurement staff.[13] The largest proposed change to the operation of the parks would be the removal of Anheuser-Busch's Clydesdale from those parks that currently have them and the removal of the A&Eagle logos.[13] Anheuser-Busch licenses the "Busch Gardens" name to SeaWorld Entertainment perpetually.[2]
Initial public offering[edit]
On December 27, 2012, SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment announced that it had filed for an initial public offering (IPO) of stock. Part of the proceeds from this sale would go to Blackstone group, which would retain a controlling interest in the company. It began trading April 19, 2013 on the New York Stock Exchange with a ticker symbol of SEAS.[14][15]
Decline in income[edit]
Following CNN's broadcast of the documentary Blackfish, which criticized the company's handling of killer whale exhibits, SeaWorld's profits went into a steep decline and its share values plummeted. SeaWorld said in August 2014 that the film had hurt revenues at its park in San Diego, California.[16] On December 11, 2014, SeaWorld announced that chief executive Jim Atchison would resign, with an interim successor replacing him on January 15, 2015. The company's share price had fallen 44% in 2014.[16][17]
In August 2015, SeaWorld announced an 84% drop in second quarter 2015 net income compared to the year before. Total income was down 3% from 2014-2015. Visitors fell by 100,000, from 6.58 million to 6.48 million.[18][19][20][21]
On March 24, 2017, Blackstone Group announced that it will sell its stake to Zhonghong Group.[22]
Current properties[edit]
Beginning November 9, 2007, the parks collectively became known as Worlds of Discovery.[23] Prior to the introduction of the Worlds of Discovery brand, the parks were marketed as "Anheuser-Busch Adventure Parks," emphasizing their animal exhibits and thrill rides. Since the company's sale to Blackstone in 2009, the "Worlds of Discovery" branding is no longer in use.

SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment is a family entertainment, amusement park and attraction company formerly owned by Blackstone Group, which retains a minority share. It operates and maintains nine zoological theme parks eleven theme parks located throughout the United States. Formerly a subsidiary of Anheuser-Busch since 1989, under which it was known as Busch Entertainment Corporation,[3] SeaWorld Parks is headquartered in Orlando, Florida.[3][4]
According a previous Securities and Exchange Commission filing, annual attendance for calendar year 2012 was 24.4 million, while attendance for the January 1-October 31, 2013 period was 18.9 million. Average revenue per attendee was $62.79, of which 62% consists of admission fees. 55% of revenues were generated from parks in Florida, 20% in California, and 11% in Virginia.[2]
In October 2009, Anheuser-Busch InBev announced plans to sell the division to private-equity firm The Blackstone Group in order to reduce the debt load generated by InBev's 2008 purchase of Anheuser-Busch.[5] The sale was completed on December 1, 2009 and with it came a new company name, SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment.

History[edit]
Anheuser-Busch initially created the subsidiary to run the various Busch Gardens parks. The parks at Tampa, Florida and Williamsburg, Virginia were located adjacent to breweries, and the parks included tours of the facilities and even free samples of the products made there. In 1989, Anheuser-Busch purchased the theme park unit of publisher Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, which included the SeaWorld family of parks. The purchase also included two other parks in Central Florida: Cypress Gardens and Boardwalk and Baseball. Boardwalk and Baseball was promptly closed, while Cypress Gardens was later sold and transformed into Legoland Florida, which opened in October 2011. The parks were managed out of Anheuser-Busch's headquarters in St. Louis, Missouri until 2008, when the company relocated the division to Florida, where five of the company's ten parks were located.[3]
In 2008, Anheuser-Busch was acquired by Brazilian-Belgian brewer InBev. Based on its previous acquisitions, it was widely expected that InBev would later sell off non-core assets in order to pay down the debt created by its purchase of Anheuser-Busch; the theme-park division was considered one of the most likely assets to be sold.[6] In early 2009, InBev began soliciting bids for those assets in advance of an anticipated sale.[7] As part of the plans to shed the division, Busch Entertainment ended the free beer-sampling programs at those parks that had them.[8] Similarly, Busch Entertainment broke from its parent company and terminated a benefit where employees of legal age received two free cases of Anheuser-Busch beer per month, a benefit that continued for the rest of the company.[8][9] At the time, InBev was thought to be considering selling the parks to the highest bidder, or spinning off Busch Entertainment as an independent company.[7] It was suggested at one point that NBC Universal was interested in purchasing Busch Entertainment, and folding it into the Universal Studios Theme Parks chain, but no official bid for the company surfaced.[10] However, other asset sales, such as the sale of Tsingtao Brewery, and an issuance of $3 billion in new long-term debt in May 2009, raised over $11 billion since the start of 2009, temporarily reducing the need to sell Busch Entertainment.[11] Other cited reasons for an apparent reluctance to sell off the company included still-volatile credit markets and receipt of initial bids that were lower than expected.[11]
Acquisition by the Blackstone Group[edit]
In late 2009, the Blackstone Group reportedly entered into negotiations to acquire Busch Entertainment.[12] The Blackstone Group already owned a partnership in Universal Orlando Resort, and a significant interest in Merlin Entertainments, which operates attractions and theme parks such as Madame Tussauds and Legoland.[12] Previous estimates have valued Busch Entertainment at somewhere between USD $2.5-3.0 billion.[12]
On 7 October 2009, the discussions came to fruition as Anheuser-Busch InBev announced plans to sell Busch Entertainment Corporation to the Blackstone Group in a deal worth approximately US$2.7 billion.[13]
As part of the deal, Blackstone will maintain the current management team from Busch Entertainment and operate it as a separate entity.[13] Further, Anheuser-Busch will sign a sponsorship agreement with the company, thus allowing the two Busch Gardens parks to keep their current names and promotions, including the "Here's to the Heroes" military appreciation program.[13] In announcing the deal, Busch Entertainment President Jim Atchison said that Blackstone's acquisition brings "an awful lot of strategic vision for us. We're going to continue to grow the business together."[13]
The acquisition would be done with no loss of jobs at the parks or at the company's Orlando headquarters.[5] New departments will be hired to fill positions that would previously been managed by Anheuser-Busch, such as a legal department and procurement staff.[13] The largest proposed change to the operation of the parks would be the removal of Anheuser-Busch's Clydesdale from those parks that currently have them and the removal of the A&Eagle logos.[13] Anheuser-Busch licenses the "Busch Gardens" name to SeaWorld Entertainment perpetually.[2]
Initial public offering[edit]
On December 27, 2012, SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment announced that it had filed for an initial public offering (IPO) of stock. Part of the proceeds from this sale would go to Blackstone group, which would retain a controlling interest in the company. It began trading April 19, 2013 on the New York Stock Exchange with a ticker symbol of SEAS.[14][15]
Decline in income[edit]
Following CNN's broadcast of the documentary Blackfish, which criticized the company's handling of killer whale exhibits, SeaWorld's profits went into a steep decline and its share values plummeted. SeaWorld said in August 2014 that the film had hurt revenues at its park in San Diego, California.[16] On December 11, 2014, SeaWorld announced that chief executive Jim Atchison would resign, with an interim successor replacing him on January 15, 2015. The company's share price had fallen 44% in 2014.[16][17]
In August 2015, SeaWorld announced an 84% drop in second quarter 2015 net income compared to the year before. Total income was down 3% from 2014-2015. Visitors fell by 100,000, from 6.58 million to 6.48 million.[18][19][20][21]
On March 24, 2017, Blackstone Group announced that it will sell its stake to Zhonghong Group.[22]
Current properties[edit]
Beginning November 9, 2007, the parks collectively became known as Worlds of Discovery.[23] Prior to the introduction of the Worlds of Discovery brand, the parks were marketed as "Anheuser-Busch Adventure Parks," emphasizing their animal exhibits and thrill rides. Since the company's sale to Blackstone in 2009, the "Worlds of Discovery" branding is no longer in use.

Dubai properties[edit]
First announced in February 2008, Dubai developer Nakheel planned to license SeaWorld's properties for its own "Worlds of Discovery," with the first parks set to open in 2012.[26] However, the global financial crisis of 2008-09 has prompted both Nakheel and Busch Entertainment to suspend development indefinitely, although both sides expect to move forward when the financial climate improves.[27]

SeaWorld upgraded to neutral at Goldman Sachs 
SeaWorld Entertainment Inc.  was upgraded to neutral from sell at Goldman Sachs Tuesday as the analysts see the company's risk/reward profile as more balanced after the stock has pulled back. SeaWorld still has many challenges, including competition and weak international visitation, but the analysts say SeaWorld's planned attractions for 2017 and 2018 should bring in more visitors, particularly as the pricing is below that of their peers. Additionally, the company has already factored these challenges into its fiscal 2017 guidance and investors are prepared for a second-quarter earnings miss, they say. With shares pulling back in the past three months, the company's valuation looks more reasonable, according to the analysts. Shares of SeaWorld have fallen 12% in the past three months, while the S&P 500  has gained 5%. With the share pullback, there is also greater possibility of an acquisition, particularly with SeaWorld's Busch Gardens. The analysts reiterated their $16 price target. The average FactSet rating on SeaWorld is overweight with a $19.75 price target.

SeaWorld faces federal investigations for ‘Blackfish’ discussions

Jun. 24, 2017 at 7:49 a.m. ET
by Jeremy C. Owens









SeaWorld being investigated for 'Blackfish' documentary statements
SeaWorld Entertainment Inc.  disclosed Friday afternoon that the company has received subpoenas from the Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission in regards to statements made about a critical 2013 documentary called "Blackfish." In an SEC filing, the company said the subpoenas concern "disclosures and public statements made by the Company and certain executives and/or individuals on or before August 2014, including those regarding the impact of the "Blackfish" documentary, and trading in the Company's securities." In an earnings report that month, SeaWorld blamed poor earnings on "adverse publicity" regarding the treatment of its Orcas, the subject of the documentary. SeaWorld said that it had formed a special committee of the board to deal with the inquiries, and engaged counsel to assist them. SeaWorld stock, which has never recovered from the sharp decline suffered in 2014, closed with a 1% decline at $15.65 Friday, then declined more than 2% in late trading.

SeaWorld results miss expectations as attendance drops
SeaWorld Entertainment Inc.  reported a first-quarter loss that narrowed to $61.1 million, or 72 cents a share, from $84.0 million, or $1.00 a share, in the same period a year ago. The FactSet consensus was for a loss per share of 55 cents. Revenue fell 15% to $186.4 million, missing the FactSet consensus of $205.5 million. Attendance fell 15% to 2.81 million guests, below the FactSet consensus of 3.1 million, while the 0.6% decline in revenue per capita declined to $66.41 missed expectations of $67.10. The company results were "largely impacted" by a shift in the timing of spring break holidays, associated with Easter moving into the second quarter. "Given the improving attendance trends we saw in April, and the incredibly robust lineup of new attractions we are launching in the coming weeks, we are well-positioned going into our seasonally important second and third quarters," said Chief Executive Joel Manby. The stock, which was still inactive in premarket trade, has shed 7.3% year to date, while the S&P 500  has gained 7.2%.

SeaWorld upgraded to neutral at Goldman Sachs 
SeaWorld Entertainment Inc.  was upgraded to neutral from sell at Goldman Sachs Tuesday as the analysts see the company's risk/reward profile as more balanced after the stock has pulled back. SeaWorld still has many challenges, including competition and weak international visitation, but the analysts say SeaWorld's planned attractions for 2017 and 2018 should bring in more visitors, particularly as the pricing is below that of their peers. Additionally, the company has already factored these challenges into its fiscal 2017 guidance and investors are prepared for a second-quarter earnings miss, they say. With shares pulling back in the past three months, the company's valuation looks more reasonable, according to the analysts. Shares of SeaWorld have fallen 12% in the past three months, while the S&P 500  has gained 5%. With the share pullback, there is also greater possibility of an acquisition, particularly with SeaWorld's Busch Gardens. The analysts reiterated their $16 price target. The average FactSet rating on SeaWorld is overweight with a $19.75 price target.

SeaWorld faces federal investigations for ‘Blackfish’ discussions

Jun. 24, 2017 at 7:49 a.m. ET
by Jeremy C. Owens









SeaWorld being investigated for 'Blackfish' documentary statements
SeaWorld Entertainment Inc.  disclosed Friday afternoon that the company has received subpoenas from the Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission in regards to statements made about a critical 2013 documentary called "Blackfish." In an SEC filing, the company said the subpoenas concern "disclosures and public statements made by the Company and certain executives and/or individuals on or before August 2014, including those regarding the impact of the "Blackfish" documentary, and trading in the Company's securities." In an earnings report that month, SeaWorld blamed poor earnings on "adverse publicity" regarding the treatment of its Orcas, the subject of the documentary. SeaWorld said that it had formed a special committee of the board to deal with the inquiries, and engaged counsel to assist them. SeaWorld stock, which has never recovered from the sharp decline suffered in 2014, closed with a 1% decline at $15.65 Friday, then declined more than 2% in late trading.

SeaWorld results miss expectations as attendance drops
SeaWorld Entertainment Inc.  reported a first-quarter loss that narrowed to $61.1 million, or 72 cents a share, from $84.0 million, or $1.00 a share, in the same period a year ago. The FactSet consensus was for a loss per share of 55 cents. Revenue fell 15% to $186.4 million, missing the FactSet consensus of $205.5 million. Attendance fell 15% to 2.81 million guests, below the FactSet consensus of 3.1 million, while the 0.6% decline in revenue per capita declined to $66.41 missed expectations of $67.10. The company results were "largely impacted" by a shift in the timing of spring break holidays, associated with Easter moving into the second quarter. "Given the improving attendance trends we saw in April, and the incredibly robust lineup of new attractions we are launching in the coming weeks, we are well-positioned going into our seasonally important second and third quarters," said Chief Executive Joel Manby. The stock, which was still inactive in premarket trade, has shed 7.3% year to date, while the S&P 500  has gained 7.2%.

Seaworld Entertainment, Inc. Revenue and Financial Data

   Swimming with the fishes takes on a whole new meaning at these parks. SeaWorld Entertainment is one of the US's largest theme park operators. The company markets its parks as family-friendly, offering learning opportunities (SeaWorld and Discovery Cove, where visitors can swim with dolphins and other marine life), all-ages entertainment (the
   
    Sesame Street
   
   -themed park Sesame Place), and traditional amusement parks (Busch Gardens). Previously a subsidiary of brewer Anheuser-Busch, the company was sold to Blackstone for about $2.3 billion in late 2009 and became a public company in 2013.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
