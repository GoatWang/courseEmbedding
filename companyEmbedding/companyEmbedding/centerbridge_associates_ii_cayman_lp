Apollo, Blackstone Reportedly Among Potential Bidders For Home Capital
May 2 17
The Blackstone Group L.P. (NYSE:BX), Apollo Global Management, LLC (NYSE:APO) and Centerbridge Partners, L.P. are among potential suitors studying bids for Home Capital Group Inc. (TSX:HCG), people familiar with the matter told Reuters. Brookfield Asset Management Inc. (TSX:BAM.A) and Fairfax Financial Holdings Limited (TSX:FFH) are among other firms interested in buying Home Capital, speaking on condition of anonymity as the discussions are private. The potential bidders are working with investment banks as they consider their options and are likely to wait until a Canadian regulator holds a hearing on May 4, 2017, the people said this week. Home Capital, Brookfield, Blackstone and Centerbridge declined to comment. Potential buyers are evaluating bids for the whole or part of Home Capital, the people said. Some smaller companies are looking at parts of Home Capital. It is not clear yet if Home Capital will sell itself to one buyer or if the assets would be broken up to multiple buyers, the people said. Apollo and Fairfax did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
