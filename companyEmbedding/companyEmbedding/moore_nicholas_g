Abstract


                 Ethics: The Way to Do Business NICHOLAS G. MOORE ome people would characterize ethics as a relatively soft concept. This is 1998. Competition is fierce. The winnings go to those who are the quickest. But we view ethics as a hard-core value. Because the values that are the product of consistent ethical behavior are what hold widely distributed organizations together. And thatâs one of the most compelling reasons for a firm like ours to have an ethics program in place. We are widely distributed. Weâre all over the world. And having resources that people can use every day is very important. You canât legislate moral behavior; youâve got to have principles, values, and standards by which people can make decisions. Companies used to be defined almost exclusively by the products they produced or the services they rendered. Thatâs all changed. Weâre now defined by the way we provide our products and services. Our behavior defines how weâre perceived in the marketplace in ways that products never really could. So ethical behavior is good business. Now that may be contrary to prevailing public perception. Our attitudes are shaped not only Nicholas G. Moore is chairman of PricewaterhouseCoopers and senior
