These include simple, single-sided “dumb” photo ID cards to complex, tamper-resistant, secure, electronic identity documents, such as driver licenses, passports, and national identity cards.
ImageWare’s time tested foundational technologies have been incorporated into IWS CloudID®. CloudID is a highly modular, SOA-based software platform that delivers an unsurpassed ability to rapidly develop and deploy highly secure, yet flexible standards-based identity solutions. It continuously adapts to evolving customer requirements and emerging market demands. It truly delivers on the promise of Future Proof Identity.
Two significant innovations differentiate this next generation identity platform:

CloudID extends the flexible, technology/vendor- independent “plug-in” approach, which ImageWare invented for biometric applications across the entire biometric identification system. Thus, creating a layered, highly modular product suite.
CloudID achieves optimal performance whether delivered as part of traditional on-premise client server computing solutions, or embedded in cloud-based services.

IWS CloudID is easily incorporated into new or existing cloud-enabled environments or integrated as a cloud-ready software into traditional networked client server and data center IT infrastructures. CloudID achieves optimal performance in either configuration and is easily transitioned from non-cloud to cloud environments.
ImageWare’s technology is also applicable in the mobile environment using GoMobile Interactive®. This push application platform enables the creation of a more interactive mobile application experience. Biometric identification technology, combined with authentication, offers increased security when more sensitive data is involved.
The FDA-cleared pillphone® application is an excellent example of the interactive power and biometric authentication technology of this revolutionary mobile application platform at work. This unique mobile health management application offers proactive medication reminders and information exchange to improve treatment adherence, while giving users the confidence that all of their personal medical information is secure.

Multimodal Biometric Database Searching MethodsPatent Number: 9,286,528
Issued: 03/15/2016
Filed: 04/16/2014
Read PatentAbstract
The present invention provides techniques for efficient searching of a multi-modal biometric database.  Nested searching improves search efficiency by using the results of a previous biometric modality search to limit the search population for subsequent biometric searches.  The method can also be used in combinations of non-biometric searches limiting subsequent biometric searches or vice versa.
Systems and Methods for Biometric Data Management Using Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS)Patent Number: 9,268,904
Issued: 02/23/2016
Filed: 10/02/2013
Read PatentAbstract
A structured query language (SQL) relational database management system (SQ RDBMS) may integrate a biometric subsystem to process and manage biometric data separately from the demographic data stored in normalized SQL tables of the SQL RDBMS. The SQL RDBMS may be operatively connected to the biometric subsystem by means of SQL extensions. The SQL RDBMS may execute queries with demographic and/or biometric constraints, wherein the demographic data is retrieved directly from normalized SQL tables on the RDBMS, while the biometric data is retrieved in the form of scores or probabilities from the biometric subsystem. The SQL RDBMS may return a query result set containing demographic data associated with corresponding biometric data, allowing the authentication of biometric clients.
Anonymous Biometric IdentificationPatent Number: 9,262,613
Issued: 02/16/2016
Filed: 10/02/2012
Read PatentAbstract
This disclosure describes methods for identifying an individual in an anonymous biometric authentication system, where an individual’s biometric data is captured by a device, and the resulting probe is compared with the templates in a previously enrolled population. The system comprises a Biographic Identity Management System having a non-anonymous sector in communication with an anonymous sector through a network cloud. The anonymous sector or Anonymous Biometric Identity Management System contains an index of tokens associated, each associated uniquely with a biometric template, which may then be compared with a biometric probe to determine the identity of an individual.
Anonymous Biometric EnrollmentPatent Number: 9,418,214
Issued: 08/16/2016
Filed: 10/02/2012
Read PatentAbstract
In the present invention systems and methods to perform the biometric anonymous enrollment of an individual into an anonymous biometric engine are disclosed. An enrollment authority or client verifies the credentials of an individual and collects the biographic/demographic and biometric information. The biographic demographic information is stored by the enrollment authority and a token is generated for the individual; the biometric information and the token are sent to a biometric engine for storage. The stored information may be used to identify or verify individuals.
Anonymous Biometric VerificationPatent Number: 8,887,259
Issued: 11/11/2014
Filed: 10/02/2012
Read PatentAbstract
The present invention discloses an anonymous biometric verification system and method. In an embodiment of the invention, the system comprises a non-anonymous sector that retrieves biometric data (probes) by using biometric client(s). A unique identifier (“token”) is retrieved from a database that contains biographic and demographic data associated to the token, but without comprising the biographic or demographic data. The biometric data in form of template(s) along with the token are then sent via a cloud network to an anonymous sector. A query router, located at the non-anonymous sector may receive probes with the token and send them to one or more biometric query engine(s), wherein query engine(s) may either work in stripped or mirrored operation mode. Query engine(s) may search for location of template(s) in a templates database linked to a query search engine.
Multimodal Biometric AnalysisPatent Number: 7,362,884

Issued: 04/22/2008
Filed: 03/17/2006
Read PatentAbstract
A biometric system that uses readings from a plurality of biometrics of a user is disclosed. The biometric system includes a first and second biometric readers, a first and second biometric matching engines and a processor. The first biometric reader producing a first measured biometric that is processed by the first biometric matching engine to deliver a first value, which is indicative of a likelihood that the first measured biometric matches a first stored biometric reading. A plurality of first values are gathered prior to the first value. The second biometric reader delivers a second measured biometric for processing by the second biometric matching engine to produce a second value, which is indicative of a likelihood that the second measured biometric matches a second stored biometric reading. A plurality of second values are gathered prior to the second value. The first and second biometric readers measure a different biometric, or the first and second biometric matching engines use a different algorithm. The processor normalizes the first value according to the plurality of first values, normalizes the second value according to the plurality of second values, and determines if the user matches a person using the normalized first and second values.

Filed: 11/16/2004
Read PatentAbstract
The interactive messaging system of the present invention provides for an interactive communication process between users, both senders and recipients. The sender composes a message by filling in a template stored in data services. Once completed, the sender pushes the message to a recipient’s wireless device if the wireless device contains a WAP browser which is capable of receiving pushed messages. Typically the message includes a question along with answers for the recipient to choose from. Each answer corresponds with a pre-assigned response key and the recipient answers the question by selecting one of the pre-assigned response keys. The recipient’s response is available to the sender in the form of an e-mail, WAP Push, on-line access or interactive message that is shown to the sender on an on-line status screen.
