Stability







Over 45 Years of Commitment to Independent Financial Advisors
Since we launched our firm in 1969, we have been unconditionally committed as a firm to strengthening and supporting the advisors we serve. In fact, to ensure that you have the power you need and the right tools to get the job done we do something radical in this industry: we listen to you. Your input helps shape what we do and how we do it. And then if what we do can be improved, we won’t stop until exactly what’s needed is done. It’s a commitment.
The results reflect this approach. More than 2,000 advisors call Royal Alliance home with an average annual GDC in excess of $250,000 and a total of $60 billion in total client assets. With an impressive 97% retention rate and an average tenure of 10.4 years, we find that when advisors find us, they stay and tend to stay for a long time. For nearly five decades, Royal has been the first choice for advisors.

When an advisor selects to affiliate with Royal Alliance, they tend to stay for a long time—on average for well over a decade and often to the end of their career.

Our advisors average over $250,000 in annual production and they like the strength and superior support they can count on at Royal Alliance.



We Put Our Advisors in Control with Better Tools & More Options
Your ability to excel in your practice is tied to having the right tools to get the job done. That’s why Royal Alliance is dedicated to developing sophisticated programs, technologies and guardrails necessary for success. These include a suite of solutions for business planning, streamlined offices, portfolio management, and a wide range of powerful resources integrated into one dynamic resource center.
And we put advisors in control by providing them with flexibility to run their business the way they want. We want you to do business your way. While many broker-dealers offer narrow definitions of what open architecture means to them, we are focused on what it means to you. We understand that you have a vision to take your already successful practice to an even better place. The bottom line is that you know the best way to manage your own business.
drill down deeper


Our liberating “open architecture” approach is designed to maximize your flexibility and support so that it fits the way you want to do business.

Choose from a wide range of affiliation options and we’ll help ensure that you are in your comfort zone: Independent, Branch or RIA models.



Extraordinary Service for Exceptional Advisors & Offices
We never take our commitment to supporting advisors lightly. As a Royal Alliance advisor you can count on advanced technology, business-building support, learning opportunities, coaching and training, and extensive product listings. Our support begins at the moment you choose to join our team and continues throughout your career with us and even beyond. Now the industry standard, our succession and continuity programs help you reap the rewards of a job well done.
We are also confident that the financial professionals we serve enjoy the best of all worlds—big-firm resources with small-firm attention. That’s because we are part of one of the largest truly independent broker-dealer networks in the industry and yet have maintained a personal feel with a genuine open-door policy that encourages advisor input and helps shape the firm’s direction. In every way, Royal Alliance is advisor-centric.

We are vigilant about getting you up to speed as quickly as possible with the least amount of disruption to both your clients and your office.
To begin with, you’ll have the services of a team of transition professionals, including a dedicated transition liaison. These experts will work closely with you to thoroughly plan your transition process according to your unique requirements and needs and then will guide you through it every step of the way.

Step 2: Track Together we will create a customized game plan for your transition, give you a link for forms and registration, and provide you with dedicated assistance.
Step 3: Transition Our transition team will help move your book of business while providing training on key website tools and systems. Based on your GDC level, a liaison will also simultaneously submit your advertising pieces for initial review and input.
Step 4: Takeoff! In the final stage, our transition team reviews any outstanding issues and accounts not yet transferred. You will then be introduced to our service group that will be available for ongoing support and assistance.

Over 45 Years of Commitment to Independent Financial Advisors
Since we launched our firm in 1969, we have been unconditionally committed as a firm to strengthening and supporting the advisors we serve. In fact, to ensure that you have the power you need and the right tools to get the job done we do something radical in this industry: we listen to you. Your input helps shape what we do and how we do it. And then if what we do can be improved, we won’t stop until exactly what’s needed is done. It’s a commitment.
The results reflect this approach. More than 2,000 advisors call Royal Alliance home with an average annual GDC in excess of $250,000 and a total of $60 billion in total client assets. With an impressive 97% retention rate and an average tenure of 10.4 years, we find that when advisors find us, they stay and tend to stay for a long time. For nearly five decades, Royal has been the first choice for advisors.

When an advisor selects to affiliate with Royal Alliance, they tend to stay for a long time—on average for well over a decade and often to the end of their career.

Our advisors average over $250,000 in annual production and they like the strength and superior support they can count on at Royal Alliance.



We Put Our Advisors in Control with Better Tools & More Options
Your ability to excel in your practice is tied to having the right tools to get the job done. That’s why Royal Alliance is dedicated to developing sophisticated programs, technologies and guardrails necessary for success. These include a suite of solutions for business planning, streamlined offices, portfolio management, and a wide range of powerful resources integrated into one dynamic resource center.
And we put advisors in control by providing them with flexibility to run their business the way they want. We want you to do business your way. While many broker-dealers offer narrow definitions of what open architecture means to them, we are focused on what it means to you. We understand that you have a vision to take your already successful practice to an even better place. The bottom line is that you know the best way to manage your own business.
drill down deeper


Our liberating “open architecture” approach is designed to maximize your flexibility and support so that it fits the way you want to do business.

Choose from a wide range of affiliation options and we’ll help ensure that you are in your comfort zone: Independent, Branch or RIA models.



Extraordinary Service for Exceptional Advisors & Offices
We never take our commitment to supporting advisors lightly. As a Royal Alliance advisor you can count on advanced technology, business-building support, learning opportunities, coaching and training, and extensive product listings. Our support begins at the moment you choose to join our team and continues throughout your career with us and even beyond. Now the industry standard, our succession and continuity programs help you reap the rewards of a job well done.
We are also confident that the financial professionals we serve enjoy the best of all worlds—big-firm resources with small-firm attention. That’s because we are part of one of the largest truly independent broker-dealer networks in the industry and yet have maintained a personal feel with a genuine open-door policy that encourages advisor input and helps shape the firm’s direction. In every way, Royal Alliance is advisor-centric.

Over 45 Years of Commitment to Independent Financial Advisors
Since we launched our firm in 1969, we have been unconditionally committed as a firm to strengthening and supporting the advisors we serve. In fact, to ensure that you have the power you need and the right tools to get the job done we do something radical in this industry: we listen to you. Your input helps shape what we do and how we do it. And then if what we do can be improved, we won’t stop until exactly what’s needed is done. It’s a commitment.
The results reflect this approach. More than 2,000 advisors call Royal Alliance home with an average annual GDC in excess of $250,000 and a total of $60 billion in total client assets. With an impressive 97% retention rate and an average tenure of 10.4 years, we find that when advisors find us, they stay and tend to stay for a long time. For nearly five decades, Royal has been the first choice for advisors.
drill down deeper


When an advisor selects to affiliate with Royal Alliance, they tend to stay for a long time—on average for well over a decade and often to the end of their career.

Our advisors average over $250,000 in annual production and they like the strength and superior support they can count on at Royal Alliance.



We Put Our Advisors in Control with Better Tools & More Options
Your ability to excel in your practice is tied to having the right tools to get the job done. That’s why Royal Alliance is dedicated to developing sophisticated programs, technologies and guardrails necessary for success. These include a suite of solutions for business planning, streamlined offices, portfolio management, and a wide range of powerful resources integrated into one dynamic resource center.
And we put advisors in control by providing them with flexibility to run their business the way they want. We want you to do business your way. While many broker-dealers offer narrow definitions of what open architecture means to them, we are focused on what it means to you. We understand that you have a vision to take your already successful practice to an even better place. The bottom line is that you know the best way to manage your own business.
drill down deeper


Our liberating “open architecture” approach is designed to maximize your flexibility and support so that it fits the way you want to do business.

Choose from a wide range of affiliation options and we’ll help ensure that you are in your comfort zone: Independent, Branch or RIA models.



Extraordinary Service for Exceptional Advisors & Offices
We never take our commitment to supporting advisors lightly. As a Royal Alliance advisor you can count on advanced technology, business-building support, learning opportunities, coaching and training, and extensive product listings. Our support begins at the moment you choose to join our team and continues throughout your career with us and even beyond. Now the industry standard, our succession and continuity programs help you reap the rewards of a job well done.
We are also confident that the financial professionals we serve enjoy the best of all worlds—big-firm resources with small-firm attention. That’s because we are part of one of the largest truly independent broker-dealer networks in the industry and yet have maintained a personal feel with a genuine open-door policy that encourages advisor input and helps shape the firm’s direction. In every way, Royal Alliance is advisor-centric.

The Power to Excel
Whether its clearing options or delivering a robust lineup of investment products, insurance services and alternative investments, Royal Alliance puts you in the driver’s seat with the resources you need to satisfy client expectations.






Dual Clearing | Investment Products | Insurance Services | Women Advisors




Dual Clearing
Royal Alliance is committed to supporting our advisors in the way they are most comfortable rather than making them conform to our preferences. To that end we offer dual clearing arrangements through both Pershing and National Financial Services. Our goal is to make any transition as seamless as possible to both our advisors and the clients they serve.
Pershing
Pershing has been a leading global provider of financial business solutions for 75 years, and serves many of the world’s most respected financial organizations. In addition to SIPC protection, accounts held at Pershing have coverage in excess of SIPC limits through Lloyd’s of London. Pershing’s parent company, the Bank of New York Mellon, has $27.6 trillion in assets under custody or administration and $1.6 trillion under management.*
Our relationship with Pershing offers you access to NetX360, Pershing’s revolutionary technology platform providing the tools needed to manage clients’ accounts, deliver first-rate service, and develop new sales and revenue opportunities. NetX360 offers one complete solution to efficiently manage your entire business, whether commission or fee-based.
National Financial Services (NFS)
National Financial Services is a leading provider of clearing and custody solutions to more than 300 broker-dealers throughout the United States. Established in 1983, NFS, a Fidelity Investments company, is one of the largest providers of brokerage services with more than 25 million brokerage accounts representing $3.2 trillion in assets. Its parent company, Fidelity Investments is one of the world’s largest providers of financial services, with custodial assets of $4.6 trillion, including managed assets of $1.9 trillion.*
The strength and reputation associated with Fidelity Investments is one of the many reasons Royal Alliance is pleased to partner with NFS. Our relationship with NFS provides trade execution, clearing, and other related services for your commission and fee-based brokerage accounts and offers access to a dedicated service model, leading investment solutions, and access to Streetscape—a powerful global trading platform.
Pershing, NFS and their affiliates are not affiliated with Royal Alliance or Advisor Group.
* Dates as of (12-31-14)



Royal Alliance is committed to making sure we support our advisors in the ways they are most comfortable rather than making them conform to our preferences.

Women Advisors
Women FORWARD is Advisor Group’s women’s initiative to foster an environment of success for female advisors and to provide a wide-range of guidance to all advisors looking to enhance their relationships with female clients.
Areas of Focus
Growth: Through our mentorship program and academic curriculum, we will support our female advisors in managing and developing their businesses.
Recruiting: In addition to recruiting existing female advisors, we will support women who choose to be financial advisors as a first or second career, and administrative associates who are on a path to becoming advisors.
Female Clients: In recognition of this growing investor segment, we are dedicated to providing all advisors with the tools and resources to actively—and successfully—engage female clients.
Giving Back: Advisor Group is keenly focused on promoting financial literacy. One way we do this is by working with Junior Achievement USA to provide young people with an opportunity to explore, first-hand, the work of financial advisors. We have also established the Advisor Group Women’s Community Leadership Award, through which we are able to honor a female advisor who has demonstrated outstanding commitment to helping women grow personally, professionally, or financially.
W Forum
This annual conference offers education and networking opportunities for all women affiliated within our broker-dealer network. W Forum features intriguing keynote speakers, advisor-led workshops and an extensive partner exhibit for interacting with industry professionals.
Mentorship
The Women FORWARD Mentorship Program is designed to bring together our network’s top-producing male and female advisors looking to provide real world guidance and share their expertise with female advisors. Central to this flagship program’s success is its focus on collaboration, education, and networking.
Resources
We’ve compiled a library of pre-approved Client Engagement Materials for advisors to take advantage of, as they work with women investors. In addition, we’ve assembled informative resources within our Advisor Materials library that delve into the “what, how and why” of successfully working with women investors. These materials can enhance advisors’ interactions with women investors and help them grow their practices.
For more information about the Women FORWARD initiative, please contact Erica Hinton at WomenForward@advisorgroup.com.



Royal Alliance has a commitment to fostering success for female advisors, while providing education and tools for all advisors looking to enhance their relationships with female clients.

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.
                

                    2. Abide by the BBB Code of Advertising. Supply, upon request, substantiation for advertising and selling claims. Correct advertising and selling practices, when recommended by BBB.
                
3. Adhere to applicable BBB industry codes of advertising.
4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means
                







Tell the Truth









            Honestly represent products and services, including clear and adequate disclosures of all material terms.

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by: 
1. Resolving the complaint directly with the complainant and notifying BBB, or

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines:

                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed. BBB may consider a business' willingness to participate in recommended dispute resolution options in determining compliance with these standards.
                

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

Story

Strengths

Support





Our
Stability







Over 45 Years of Commitment to Independent Financial Advisors
Since we launched our firm in 1969, we have been unconditionally committed as a firm to strengthening and supporting the advisors we serve. In fact, to ensure that you have the power you need and the right tools to get the job done we do something radical in this industry: we listen to you. Your input helps shape what we do and how we do it. And then if what we do can be improved, we won’t stop until exactly what’s needed is done. It’s a commitment.
The results reflect this approach. More than 2,000 advisors call Royal Alliance home with an average annual GDC in excess of $250,000 and a total of $60 billion in total client assets. With an impressive 97% retention rate and an average tenure of 10.4 years, we find that when advisors find us, they stay and tend to stay for a long time. For nearly five decades, Royal has been the first choice for advisors.
drill down deeper


When an advisor selects to affiliate with Royal Alliance, they tend to stay for a long time—on average for well over a decade and often to the end of their career.

Our advisors average over $250,000 in annual production and they like the strength and superior support they can count on at Royal Alliance.



We Put Our Advisors in Control with Better Tools & More Options
Your ability to excel in your practice is tied to having the right tools to get the job done. That’s why Royal Alliance is dedicated to developing sophisticated programs, technologies and guardrails necessary for success. These include a suite of solutions for business planning, streamlined offices, portfolio management, and a wide range of powerful resources integrated into one dynamic resource center.
And we put advisors in control by providing them with flexibility to run their business the way they want. We want you to do business your way. While many broker-dealers offer narrow definitions of what open architecture means to them, we are focused on what it means to you. We understand that you have a vision to take your already successful practice to an even better place. The bottom line is that you know the best way to manage your own business.
drill down deeper


Our liberating “open architecture” approach is designed to maximize your flexibility and support so that it fits the way you want to do business.

Choose from a wide range of affiliation options and we’ll help ensure that you are in your comfort zone: Independent, Branch or RIA models.



Extraordinary Service for Exceptional Advisors & Offices
We never take our commitment to supporting advisors lightly. As a Royal Alliance advisor you can count on advanced technology, business-building support, learning opportunities, coaching and training, and extensive product listings. Our support begins at the moment you choose to join our team and continues throughout your career with us and even beyond. Now the industry standard, our succession and continuity programs help you reap the rewards of a job well done.
We are also confident that the financial professionals we serve enjoy the best of all worlds—big-firm resources with small-firm attention. That’s because we are part of one of the largest truly independent broker-dealer networks in the industry and yet have maintained a personal feel with a genuine open-door policy that encourages advisor input and helps shape the firm’s direction. In every way, Royal Alliance is advisor-centric.
