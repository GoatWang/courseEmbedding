 Surgery Partners,Inc. (NASDAQ:SGRY) Files An 8-K Entry into a Material Definitive AgreementItem 2.03 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On June30, 2017, SP Finco, LLC (the “Issuer”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Surgery Partners,Inc. (the “Registrant”), completed the issuance and sale of $370 million in gross proceeds (the “Gross Proceeds”) of the Issuer’s 6.750% senior unsecured notes due 2025 (the “Notes”) in a previously announced private offering exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Notes were issued to an indenture, dated June30, 2017 (the “Indenture”), among the Issuer and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee (the “Trustee”). The Gross Proceeds were deposited in an escrow account (the “Escrow Account”) established at Wilmington Trust, National Association (in such capacity, the “Escrow Agent”) in the name of the Trustee, not in its individual capacity but solely as Trustee, on behalf of the holders of the Notes. In connection with the closing of the Registrant’s previously disclosed acquisition of NSH Holdco,Inc. (the “NSH Acquisition”) and the release of the Gross Proceeds from the Escrow Account, the Issuer will be merged with and into Surgery Center Holdings,Inc. (the “Company”), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Registrant, with the Company surviving such merger and assuming the rights and obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the Indenture by operation of law.
The Notes, which are senior unsecured obligations of the Issuer, will mature on July1, 2025, and will bear interest at the rate of 6.750% per year, payable semi-annually on January1 and July1 of each year, beginning on January1, 2018.
Subject to certain conditions, the Issuer may, at its option, redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes at any time prior to July1, 2020, with the net cash proceeds of certain equity issuances at a price equal to 106.750% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of redemption. In addition, subject to the rights of holders of Notes, at any time prior to July1, 2020, the Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole or in part, at its option, at a redemption price equal to 50% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed, plus the relevant Applicable Premium (as defined in the Indenture), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption. On and after July1, 2020, the Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole or in part, at its option, at the redemption prices set forth below (expressed as a percentage of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed), plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of redemption if redeemed during the 12-month period beginning on July1 of each of the years indicated below:



Year


Percentage


 


 

103.375


%




 

101.688


%




 

100.000


%



In addition, if the NSH Acquisition does not occur on or prior to the applicable date set forth in the Indenture for such purpose or, if earlier, the Issuer notifies the Escrow Agent that the NSH Acquisition will not be closed, then the Issuer will be required to redeem the Notes within three business days (the date of such redemption, the “Special Mandatory Redemption Date”) for a price equal to 50% of the initial issue price of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the Special Mandatory Redemption Date.
The foregoing descriptions of the Indenture governing the Notes and the Notes do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text thereof filed as Exhibit4.1 to this Current Report on Form8-K, which is incorporated herein by reference.
Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
The information set forth above under Item 2.03 of this Current Report on Form8-K is incorporated herein by reference into this Item 2.03.
Item 2.03 Financial Statements and Exhibits.

Surgery Partners, Inc. Announces Pricing of $370 Million Senior Note Offering
Jun 19 17
Surgery Partners, Inc. announced that its wholly owned subsidiary, SP Finco, LLC, to be merged with and into, Surgery Center Holdings, Inc. (“SCH”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Surgery Partners, priced $370,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 6.750% senior unsecured notes due 2025 in a previously announced private offering exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The offering is expected to close into escrow on June 30, 2017, prior to the closing of the NSH Acquisition, subject to certain customary closing conditions. The funds held in the escrow account, which will include the gross proceeds from this offering, will be released from escrow to SCH upon the occurrence of certain events specified in the escrow agreement.

(“NSH”), refinance its existing credit facilities, repay certain debt of NSH, pay fees and expenses associated with this offering and for general corporate purposes. Upon the closing of the NSH Acquisition and the entry into new senior secured credit facilities, among other things, the notes will be guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by certain domestic wholly-owned restricted subsidiaries of SCH that will guarantee SCH’s obligations under the new senior secured credit facilities, including by NSH and certain of NSH’s domestic wholly-owned subsidiaries that will constitute a restricted subsidiary and will guarantee the new senior secured credit facilities.
