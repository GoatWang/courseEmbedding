What are analysts saying about HP stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about HP stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "The recently released PC shipment data by IDC depicts that HP’s restructuring initiatives such as focus on product innovations, pricing, marketing and sales activities, divestment of non-core assets and cutting jobs to lower costs, are paying off. HP, as per the data compiled by IDC, witnessed year-over-year shipment growth for the first quarter in a row after registering fall for several quarters. Per the report, the downtrend in PC shipments became modest in first-quarter compared with the previous quarters. We believe that the improving trend in PC shipments will benefit the business prospects of HP. Also, HP will revive its printing business and grab a bigger share in the inkjet printer market with the shipping of its A3 multifunction printers. Acquisition of Samsung’s printing business will further support the development and manufacturing of printers. However, pricing pressure and competition from peers remains a concern." (7/12/2017)
2. Wells Fargo & Company analysts commented, "We recently hosted investor meetings with HPQ IR and also attended HPQ's print event in Barcelona with presentations by Enrique Lores, Stephen Nigro, and members of their leadership team as well as a tour of HPQ's facilities and products (including new products shipping this year). We thought management's tone was very confident in both delivering supplies growth on a reported basis by FQ3, in constant currency (which we believe is not well understood by the Street), and in driving growth through innovative products (which we feel more confident about having seen its upcoming products). We maintain our view that mix shifts occurring in the businesses should help to drive margin expansion above Street expectations in F18, all else equal." (3/23/2017)
3. Royal Bank Of Canada analysts commented, "All You Need To Know: The focus during discussions centered around 1) Printing dynamics and confidence in returning to flat y/y revenues in supplies; 2) PC market dynamics; 3) Component pricing (DRAM/NAND); 4) Recent Samsung printing acquisition/contribution; 5) FCF and capital allocation. Fundamentally, we believe a confluence of tailwinds could abate y/y revenue declines through FY17 and eventually result in potential y/y revenue growth in 2018. From a FCF yield perspective, HPQ continues to be one of the more attractive names in our coverage with an ~10% yield. Maintain Sector Perform and raising PT to $18 from $17. \" (3/13/2017)
4. Jefferies Group LLC analysts commented, "FQ1 results were solid, with a nice revenue beat and modest EPS beat as well; weak gross margin driven by currency and component supply tighthess prevented incremental leverage on expenses. Notebooks, Printer Hardware and Supplies all performed well. Guidance was OK. We liked the continued improvement in execution but are still looking for another entry point. Q1 Beat. Q1 (Jan) revenue reached $12.68B (+5%Y/Y in CC), beating the Street's $11.83B. Q1 EPS reached $0.38 vs. Consensus of $0.37. Lower-than-expected gross margin of 17.7% vs. the Street's 18.5% prevented significant incremental leverage on expenses despite the revenue upside." (2/23/2017)
5. BMO Capital Markets analysts commented, "HP Inc. reported positive headline results, and guidance that was largely in line with our/consensus view. Revenue impressed, as both segments beat expectations. PCs showed particular strength, as sales were up 10%'the highest growth rate since 2014. We are updating our PC model with a more moderate outlook for unit declines in 2016 and 2017, but remain on the sidelines on HPQ because challenges in both end markets will prevail. Our FY2017 EPS estimate goes to $1.60 from $1.62, while our FY2018 EPS estimate of $1.68 is unchanged' Revenue was $12.7 billion, well above our/consensus estimates of $12.0 billion/$11.8 billion as both segments outperformed in the quarter. EPS of $0.38 beat our/consensus estimates of $0.36/$0.37, and came in at the high end of guidance." (2/23/2017)

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for HP (NYSE:HPQ) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 8 Hold Ratings, 12 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 2.60)Consensus Price Target: $19.78 (3.27% upside)
