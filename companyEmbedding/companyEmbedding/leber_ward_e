After retiring from the Transportation Security Association (TSA) and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in January of 2017, CSN is honored to have access to his continued commitment to help us protect American children.

After retiring from the Transportation Security Association (TSA) and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in January of 2017, CSN is honored to have access to his continued commitment to help us protect American children.

In 2003, TSA along with 22 other legacy organizations transitioned to the newly formed DHS, which consists of more than 220,000 employees and second only in size to the Department of Defense.
