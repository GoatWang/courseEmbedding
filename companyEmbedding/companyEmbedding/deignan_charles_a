Display Additional Crew Information


The Halseth Crew joined the 544th BS at Wendover on 1 February 1943. Identified as "Crew #1" on the assignment order, they became the first "Crew #42" in the squadron.

Before moving to England, Forster was replaced by S/Sgt Donald A Rutan. Co-pilot Fabian was shot down while flying with the John R Way crew on his first mission - he had been bumped from the Halseth Crew because the Squadron CO, Maj Nuttall, had chosen to fly with Halseth (who aborted because they lost the formation in weather). The remaining crew members were lost on 25 July 1943. All members of this crew became POWs, except for Forster, whose disposition is not known.							CLOSE
