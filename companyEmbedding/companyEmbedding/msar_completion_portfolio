 Fact SheetJun 30, 2017







The Fund
A tactically managed absolute return fund with the ability to invest across numerous asset classes. Fund managers are responsible for top-down asset allocation decisions, while relying on experienced Eaton Vance investment teams for security selection an d sub-sector allocation.



The Approach
Using quantitative tools to support valuation analysis, managers build a forward-looking risk and return framework for each asset class that may be included in the Fund. Using these risk/return projections, allocations believed to optimize risk-adjusted  returns are implemented.



The Features
The Fund possesses the ability to tactically allocate primarily among a variety of fixed income and alternative asset classes in search of opportunities during both improving and deteriorating markets. This flexibility allows it to seek absolute returns  that are uncorrelated to stocks and bonds.







 

 OverviewAttractive risk-adjusted returns since manager inception (as measured by Sharpe ratio).1
On 7/1/2009 a new team with years of prior experience was put in place to manage the Fund with a focus on investing in asset classes believed to offer attractive risk-adjusted returns.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Performance is for the stated time period only; due to market vola tility, the Fund’s current performance may be lower or higher than quoted. Returns are historical and are calculated by determining the percentage change in net asset value (NAV) with all distributions reinvested. Returns for other classes of share s offered by the Fund are different. Performance less than or equal to one year is cumulative. Prior to 7/1/09, the Fund had a predetermined fixed allocation approach investing equally among portfolios investing in mortgage-backed securities, senior floa ting-rate loans and high-yield bonds. The Fund has changed its objectives and investment strategies to permit investment in multiple Eaton Vance Portfolios and Funds. Max Sales Charge: 4.75%.

About Risk: 
The Fund employs an "absolute return" investment approach, benchmarking itself to an index of cash instruments and seeking to achieve returns that are largely independent of broad movements in stocks and bonds. While the Fund has a targeted annual perfor mance volatility range, its actual, or realized, volatility for longer or shorter periods may be materially higher or lower than the target range depending on market conditions. An imbalance in supply and demand in the income market may result in valuati on uncertainties and greater volatility, less liquidity, widening credit spreads and a lack of price transparency in the market. Investments in foreign instruments or currencies can involve greater risk and volatility than U.S. investments because of adv erse market, economic, political, regulatory, geopolitical or other conditions. Fund performance is sensitive to stock market volatility. Derivative instruments can be used to take both long and short positions, be highly volatile, result in economic lev erage (which can increase both the risk and return potential of the Fund), and involve risks in addition to the risks of the underlying instrument on which the derivative is based, such as counterparty, correlation and liquidity risk. If a counterparty i s unable to honor its commitments, the value of Fund shares may decline and/or the Fund could experience delays in the return of collateral or other assets held by the counterparty. The effectiveness of the Fund's option strategy is dependent upon a gene ral imbalance of natural buyers over natural sellers of index options. This imbalance could decrease or be eliminated, which could have an adverse effect on the Fund. The secondary market for loans is a private, unregulated inter-dealer or inter-bank res ale market. Purchases and sales of loans are generally subject to contractual restrictions that must be satisfied before a loan can be bought or sold. These restrictions may impede the Fund’s ability to buy or sell loans and may negatively impact t he transaction price. It may take longer than seven days for transactions in loans to settle. It is unclear whether U.S. federal securities law protections are available to an investment in a loan. In certain circumstances, loans may not be deemed to be  securities, and in the event of fraud or misrepresentation by a borrower, lenders may not have the protection of the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws. There can be no assurance that the liquidation of collateral securing  a loan will  satisfy the issuer’s obligation in the event of non-payment or that collateral can be readily liquidated. ETFs are subject to the risks of investing in the underlying securities and the Fund will bear a pro rata portion of the operating expenses of  an ETF in which it invests. Investing in exchange-traded notes (ETNs) exposes the Fund to the performance of the issuer. The Fund's investments may lose their entire value if the issuer fails. Investments in income securities may be affected by changes  in the creditworthiness of the issuer and are subject to the risk of nonpayment of principal and interest. The value of income securities also may decline because of real or perceived concerns about the issuer's ability to make principal and interest pay ments. Investments rated below investment grade (typically referred to as "junk") are generally subject to greater price volatility and illiquidity than higher-rated investments. Securities with longer durations tend to be more sensitive to interest rate  changes than securities with shorter durations. A portfolio with negative duration generally incurs a loss when interest rates and yields fall.
As interest rates rise, the value of certain income investments is likely to decline. The Fund will incur a loss as a result of a short sale if the price of the security sold short increases in value between the date of the short sale and the date on whi ch the Fund purchases the security to replace the borrowed security. No fund is a complete investment program and you may lose money investing in a fund. The Fund may engage in other investment practices that may involve additional risks and you should r eview the Fund prospectus for a complete description.

The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds and exchange-traded funds) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considere d a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding  consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.The Overall Morningstar Rat ing for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns,  60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most  weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. Star ratings do not reflect the effect of any applicable sales load.©2017 Morningstar. All  Rights Reserved.

4. The Morningstar Nontraditional Bond Category includes funds that pursue strategies divergent in one or more ways from conventional practice in the broader bond-fund universe. This includes funds that invest in bonds with an absolute return focus, which s eek to avoid losses and produce returns uncorrelated to the overall bond market, and funds with unconstrained mandates. Typically these strategies tactically manage allocations and often utilize derivatives.
5. SEC 30-day yield is a standardized measure based on the estimated yield to maturity of a fund's investments over a 30-day period and is based on the maximum offer price at the date specified. The SEC 30-day yield is not based on the distributions made by  the fund, which may differ. Distribution Rate at NAV is calculated by dividing the last distribution paid per share (annualized) by NAV. The Fund's monthly distribution may be comprised of ordinary income, net realized capital gains and returns of capit al.
6. A portion of the Fund's returns may be comprised of return of capital or short term capital gains. The Fund will determine the tax characteristics of all Fund distributions after the end of the calendar year and will provide shareholders such information  at that time. Please consult your tax advisor for further information.

Ratings are based on Moody's, S&P or Fitch, as applicable. If securities are rated differently by the ratings agencies, the higher rating is applied. Ratings, which are subject to change, apply to the creditworthiness of the issuers of the underlying sec urities and not to the Fund or its shares. Credit ratings measure the quality of a bond based on the issuer's creditworthiness, with ratings ranging from AAA, being the highest, to D, being the lowest based on S&P's measures. Ratings of BBB or higher by  S&P or Fitch (Baa or higher by Moody's) are considered to be investment-grade quality. Credit ratings are based largely on the ratings agency's analysis at the time of rating. The rating assigned to any particular security is not necessarily a reflection  of the issuer's current financial condition and does not necessarily reflect its assessment of the volatility of a security's market value or of the liquidity of an investment in the security. Holdings designated as "Not Rated" are not rated by the nati onal ratings agencies stated above.

Investing in exchange-traded notes (ETNs) exposes the Fund to the performance of the issuer. The Fund's investments may lose their entire value if the issuer fails. Investments in income securities may be affected by changes  in the creditworthiness of the issuer and are subject to the risk of nonpayment of principal and interest. The value of income securities also may decline because of real or perceived concerns about the issuer's ability to make principal and interest pay ments. Investments rated below investment grade (typically referred to as "junk") are generally subject to greater price volatility and illiquidity than higher-rated investments. Securities with longer durations tend to be more sensitive to interest rate  changes than securities with shorter durations. A portfolio with negative duration generally incurs a loss when interest rates and yields fall.
As interest rates rise, the value of certain income investments is likely to decline. The Fund will incur a loss as a result of a short sale if the price of the security sold short increases in value between the date of the short sale and the date on whi ch the Fund purchases the security to replace the borrowed security. No fund is a complete investment program and you may lose money investing in a fund. The Fund may engage in other investment practices that may involve additional risks and you should r eview the Fund prospectus for a complete description.

Portfolio profile subject to change due to active management. Percentages may not total 100% due to rounding. Fund primarily invests in one or more affiliated investment companies (Portfolios) and may also invest directly. Unless otherwise noted, referen ces to investments are to the aggregate holdings of the Fund, including its pro rata share of each Portfolio or Fund in which it invests.


About Risk: 
The Fund employs an "absolute return" investment approach, benchmarking itself to an index of cash instruments and seeking to achieve returns that are largely independent of broad movements in stocks and bonds. While the Fund has a targeted annual perfor mance volatility range, its actual, or realized, volatility for longer or shorter periods may be materially higher or lower than the target range depending on market conditions. An imbalance in supply and demand in the income market may result in valuati on uncertainties and greater volatility, less liquidity, widening credit spreads and a lack of price transparency in the market. Investments in foreign instruments or currencies can involve greater risk and volatility than U.S. investments because of adv erse market, economic, political, regulatory, geopolitical or other conditions. Fund performance is sensitive to stock market volatility. Derivative instruments can be used to take both long and short positions, be highly volatile, result in economic lev erage (which can increase both the risk and return potential of the Fund), and involve risks in addition to the risks of the underlying instrument on which the derivative is based, such as counterparty, correlation and liquidity risk. If a counterparty i s unable to honor its commitments, the value of Fund shares may decline and/or the Fund could experience delays in the return of collateral or other assets held by the counterparty. The effectiveness of the Fund's option strategy is dependent upon a gene ral imbalance of natural buyers over natural sellers of index options. This imbalance could decrease or be eliminated, which could have an adverse effect on the Fund. The secondary market for loans is a private, unregulated inter-dealer or inter-bank res ale market. Purchases and sales of loans are generally subject to contractual restrictions that must be satisfied before a loan can be bought or sold. These restrictions may impede the Fund’s ability to buy or sell loans and may negatively impact t he transaction price. It may take longer than seven days for transactions in loans to settle. It is unclear whether U.S. federal securities law protections are available to an investment in a loan. In certain circumstances, loans may not be deemed to be  securities, and in the event of fraud or misrepresentation by a borrower, lenders may not have the protection of the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws. There can be no assurance that the liquidation of collateral securing  a loan will  satisfy the issuer’s obligation in the event of non-payment or that collateral can be readily liquidated. ETFs are subject to the risks of investing in the underlying securities and the Fund will bear a pro rata portion of the operating expenses of  an ETF in which it invests. Investing in exchange-traded notes (ETNs) exposes the Fund to the performance of the issuer. The Fund's investments may lose their entire value if the issuer fails.

MSAR Completion Portfolio  April 30, 2013    Notes to Financial
Statements (Unaudited)     
1  Significant Accounting Policies  MSAR Completion
Portfolio (the Portfolio) is a Massachusetts business trust registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act), as a non-diversified, open-end management investment company. The Portfolios investment objective is
total return. The Declaration of Trust permits the Trustees to issue interests in the Portfolio. At April 30, 2013, Eaton Vance Multi-Strategy Absolute Return Fund held a 99.6% interest in the Portfolio. 
The following is a summary of significant accounting policies of the Portfolio. The policies are in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America.  A  Investment Valuation  Debt obligations (including short-term obligations with a remaining
maturity of more than sixty days) are generally valued on the basis of valuations provided by third party pricing services, as derived from such services pricing models. Inputs to the models may include, but are not limited to, reported
trades, executable bid and asked prices, broker/dealer quotations, prices or yields of securities with similar characteristics, benchmark curves or information pertaining to the issuer, as well as industry and economic events. The pricing services
may use a matrix approach, which considers information regarding securities with similar characteristics to determine the valuation for a security. Short-term obligations purchased with a remaining maturity of sixty days or less are generally valued
at amortized cost, which approximates market value. Exchange-traded options (other than FLexible EXchange traded options) are valued at the mean between the bid and asked prices at valuation time as reported by the Options Price Reporting Authority
for U.S. listed options or by the relevant exchange or board of trade for non-U.S. listed options. Over-the-counter options (including options on securities, indices and foreign currencies) and FLexible EXchange traded options traded at the Chicago
Board Options Exchange are valued by a third party pricing service using techniques that consider factors including the value of the underlying instrument, the volatility of the underlying instrument and the period of time until option expiration.
Financial futures contracts are valued at the settlement price established by the board of trade or exchange on which they are traded. Total return swaps are valued by obtaining the value of the underlying index or instruments and reference interest
rate from a third party pricing service. Investments for which valuations or market quotations are not readily available or are deemed unreliable are valued at fair value using methods determined in good faith by or at the direction of the Trustees
of the Portfolio in a manner that fairly reflects the securitys value, or the amount that the Portfolio might reasonably expect to receive for the security upon its current sale in the ordinary course. Each such determination is based on a
consideration of relevant factors, which are likely to vary from one pricing context to another. These factors may include, but are not limited to, the type of security, the existence of any contractual restrictions on the securitys
disposition, the price and extent of public trading in similar securities of the issuer or of comparable companies or entities, quotations or relevant information obtained from broker/dealers or other market participants, information obtained from
the issuer, analysts, and/or the appropriate stock exchange (for exchange-traded securities), an analysis of the companys or entitys financial condition, and an evaluation of the forces that influence the issuer and the market(s) in
which the security is purchased and sold.  The Portfolio may invest in Eaton Vance Cash Reserves Fund, LLC (Cash Reserves Fund), an affiliated investment
company managed by Eaton Vance Management (EVM). The value of the Portfolios investment in Cash Reserves Fund reflects the Portfolios proportionate interest in its net assets. Cash Reserves Fund generally values its investment securities
utilizing the amortized cost valuation technique in accordance with Rule 2a-7 under the 1940 Act. This technique involves initially valuing a portfolio security at its cost and thereafter assuming a constant amortization to maturity of any discount
or premium. If amortized cost is determined not to approximate fair value, Cash Reserves Fund may value its investment securities in the same manner as debt obligations described above.  B  Investment Transactions  Investment transactions for financial statement purposes are accounted for on a trade date basis. Realized gains and losses on investments sold are determined
on the basis of identified cost.  C  Income  Interest income is recorded on the basis of interest accrued, adjusted for
amortization of premium or accretion of discount.  D  Federal Taxes  The Portfolio has elected to be treated as a partnership
for federal tax purposes. No provision is made by the Portfolio for federal or state taxes on any taxable income of the Portfolio because each investor in the Portfolio is ultimately responsible for the payment of any taxes on its share of taxable
income. If one of the Portfolios investors is a regulated investment company that invests all or substantially all of its assets in the Portfolio, the Portfolio normally must satisfy the applicable source of income and diversification
requirements (under the Internal Revenue Code) in order for its investors to satisfy them. The Portfolio will allocate, at least annually among its investors, each investors distributive share of the Portfolios net investment income, net
realized capital gains and any other items of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit.  As of April 30, 2013, the Portfolio had no uncertain tax
positions that would require financial statement recognition, de-recognition, or disclosure. The Portfolio files a U.S. federal income tax return annually after its fiscal year-end, which is subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service for
a period of three years from the date of filing.  E  Expense Reduction  State Street Bank and Trust Company (SSBT) serves as
custodian of the Portfolio. Pursuant to the custodian agreement, SSBT receives a fee reduced by credits, which are determined based on the average daily cash balance the Portfolio maintains with SSBT. All credit balances, if any, used to reduce the
Portfolios custodian fees are reported as a reduction of expenses in the Statement of Operations.  F  Use of
Estimates  The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expense during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

MSAR Completion Portfolio  April 30, 2013    Notes to Financial
Statements (Unaudited)  continued     
G  Indemnifications  Under the Portfolios organizational documents, its officers and Trustees may be indemnified against certain
liabilities and expenses arising out of the performance of their duties to the Portfolio. Under Massachusetts law, if certain conditions prevail, interestholders in the Portfolio could be deemed to have personal liability for the obligations of the
Portfolio. However, the Portfolios Declaration of Trust contains an express disclaimer of liability on the part of Portfolio interestholders and the By-laws provide that the Portfolio shall assume the defense on behalf of any Portfolio
interestholder. Moreover, the By-laws also provide for indemnification out of Portfolio property of any interestholder held personally liable solely by reason of being or having been an interestholder for all loss or expense arising from such
liability. Additionally, in the normal course of business, the Portfolio enters into agreements with service providers that may contain indemnification clauses. The Portfolios maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this would
involve future claims that may be made against the Portfolio that have not yet occurred.  H  Financial Futures Contracts  Upon
entering into a financial futures contract, the Portfolio is required to deposit with the broker, either in cash or securities, an amount equal to a certain percentage of the purchase price (initial margin). Subsequent payments, known as variation
margin, are made or received by the Portfolio each business day, depending on the daily fluctuations in the value of the underlying security, and are recorded as unrealized gains or losses by the Portfolio. Gains (losses) are realized upon the
expiration or closing of the financial futures contracts. Should market conditions change unexpectedly, the Portfolio may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the financial futures contracts and may realize a loss. Futures contracts have minimal
counterparty risk as they are exchange traded and the clearinghouse for the exchange is substituted as the counterparty, guaranteeing counterparty performance.  I  Written Options  Upon the writing of a call or a put option, the premium received by the Portfolio is included in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities as a liability. The amount of the
liability is subsequently marked-to-market to reflect the current market value of the option written, in accordance with the Portfolios policies on investment valuations discussed above. Premiums received from writing options which expire are
treated as realized gains. Premiums received from writing options which are exercised or are closed are added to or offset against the proceeds or amount paid on the transaction to determine the realized gain or loss. When an index option is
exercised, the Portfolio is required to deliver an amount of cash determined by the excess of the strike price of the option over the value of the index (in the case of a put) or the excess of the value of the index over the strike price of the
option (in the case of a call) at contract termination. If a put option on a security is exercised, the premium reduces the cost basis of the securities purchased by the Portfolio. The Portfolio, as a writer of an option, may have no control over
whether the underlying securities or other assets may be sold (call) or purchased (put) and, as a result, bears the market risk of an unfavorable change in the price of the securities or other assets underlying the written option. The Portfolio may
also bear the risk of not being able to enter into a closing transaction if a liquid secondary market does not exist.  J  Purchased
Options  Upon the purchase of a call or put option, the premium paid by the Portfolio is included in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities as an investment. The amount of the investment is subsequently marked-to-market to reflect the
current market value of the option purchased, in accordance with the Portfolios policies on investment valuations discussed above. As the purchaser of an index option, the Portfolio has the right to receive a cash payment equal to any
depreciation in the value of the index below the strike price of the option (in the case of a put) or equal to any appreciation in the value of the index over the strike price of the option (in the case of a call) as of the valuation date of the
option. If an option which the Portfolio had purchased expires on the stipulated expiration date, the Portfolio will realize a loss in the amount of the cost of the option. If the Portfolio enters into a closing sale transaction, the Portfolio will
realize a gain or loss, depending on whether the sales proceeds from the closing sale transaction are greater or less than the cost of the option. If the Portfolio exercises a put option on a security, it will realize a gain or loss from the sale of
the underlying security, and the proceeds from such sale will be decreased by the premium originally paid. If the Portfolio exercises a call option on a security, the cost of the security which the Portfolio purchases upon exercise will be increased
by the premium originally paid. The risk associated with purchasing options is limited to the premium originally paid.  K  Total Return
Swaps  In a total return swap, the buyer receives a periodic return equal to the total return of a specified security, securities or index for a specified period of time. In return, the buyer pays the counterparty a fixed or variable
stream of payments, typically based upon short-term interest rates, possibly plus or minus an agreed upon spread. During the term of the outstanding swap agreement, changes in the underlying value of the swap are recorded as unrealized gains and
losses. Periodic payments received or made are recorded as realized gains or losses. The Portfolio is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the swap counterparty. Risk may also arise from the unanticipated movements in value of
interest rates, securities, or the index.  L  Interim Financial Statements  The interim financial statements relating to
April 30, 2013 and for the six months then ended have not been audited by an independent registered public accounting firm, but in the opinion of the Portfolios management, reflect all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring
adjustments, necessary for the fair presentation of the financial statements.  2  Investment Adviser Fee and Other Transactions with
Affiliates  The investment adviser fee is earned by Boston Management and Research (BMR), a subsidiary of EVM, as compensation for investment advisory
services rendered to the Portfolio. The fee is computed at an annual rate of 0.615% of the Portfolios average daily net assets up to $500 million and at reduced rates on daily net assets of $500 million or more. In addition, BMR also receives
an investment adviser fee in an amount equal to 0.55% of the Portfolios average daily net assets that are subject to a written put spread and/or call spread strategy up to $500 million and at reduced rates when the Portfolios daily net
assets are $500 million or more. The investment adviser fee is payable monthly. For the six months ended April 30, 2013, the investment adviser fee amounted to $602,931 or 0.74% (annualized) of the Portfolios average daily net assets. The
Portfolio invests its cash in Cash Reserves Fund. EVM does not currently receive a fee for advisory services provided to Cash Reserves Fund. Pursuant to a sub-advisory agreement, BMR has delegated the

MSAR Completion Portfolio  April 30, 2013    Notes to Financial
Statements (Unaudited)  continued     

investment management of the Portfolios options strategy to Parametric Risk Advisors LLC (PRA), an indirect affiliate of EVM. BMR pays PRA a portion of its adviser fee for sub-advisory
services provided to the Portfolio.  Trustees and officers of the Portfolio who are members of EVMs or BMRs organizations receive
remuneration for their services to the Portfolio out of the investment adviser fee. Trustees of the Portfolio who are not affiliated with the investment adviser may elect to defer receipt of all or a percentage of their annual fees in accordance
with the terms of the Trustees Deferred Compensation Plan. For the six months ended April 30, 2013, no significant amounts have been deferred. Certain officers and Trustees of the Portfolio are officers of the above organizations. 
3  Purchases and Sales of Investments  Purchases and
sales of investments, other than short-term obligations and including maturities and paydowns, aggregated $48,272,452 and $44,246,606, respectively, for the six months ended April 30, 2013. 
4  Federal Income Tax Basis of Investments  The cost and
unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of investments of the Portfolio at April 30, 2013, as determined on a federal income tax basis, were as follows:

 5  Financial Instruments 
The Portfolio may trade in financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of its investing activities. These financial instruments may
include financial futures contracts, written options and swap contracts and may involve, to a varying degree, elements of risk in excess of the amounts recognized for financial statement purposes. The notional or contractual amounts of these
instruments represent the investment the Portfolio has in particular classes of financial instruments and do not necessarily represent the amounts potentially subject to risk. The measurement of the risks associated with these instruments is
meaningful only when all related and offsetting transactions are considered. A summary of written options at April 30, 2013 is included in the Portfolio of Investments.  A summary of obligations under these financial instruments at April 30, 2013 is as follows:

 At April 30, 2013, the Portfolio had sufficient cash and/or securities to cover commitments under these contracts. 
In the normal course of pursuing its investment objective and its use of derivatives, the Portfolio is subject to the following risks: 
Equity Price Risk: The Portfolio seeks to generate incremental
return by writing a series of call and put option spread transactions on an index of common stocks. If the index appreciates or depreciates sufficiently over the period to offset the net premium received, the Portfolio will incur a net loss. The
amount of potential loss in the event of a sharp market movement is subject to a cap defined by the difference in strike prices between written and purchased call and put options, and the notional value of the positions. During the six months ended
April 30, 2013, the Portfolio also held certain purchased put options and total return swap contracts to hedge against fluctuations in security prices of investments held by Eaton Vance Multi-Strategy Absolute Return Fund, for which the
Portfolio serves as its completion portfolio.  Interest Rate Risk: The Portfolio holds fixed-rate bonds. The value of these bonds may decrease if interest rates rise. To hedge against fluctuations in interest rates and to manage its effective duration, the Portfolio purchases and
sells U.S. Treasury futures contracts.  The Portfolio enters into swap contracts that may contain provisions whereby the counterparty may terminate the
contract under certain conditions, including but not limited to a decline in the Portfolios net assets below a certain level over a certain period of time, which may trigger a payment by the Portfolio for those derivatives in a liability
position. At April 30, 2013, the fair value of derivatives with credit-related contingent features in a net liability position was $290,762.  The
non-exchange traded derivatives in which the Portfolio invests, including swap contracts, are subject to the risk that the counterparty to the contract fails to perform its obligations under the contract. At April 30, 2013, the maximum amount
of loss the Portfolio would incur due to counterparty risk was $108,065, representing the fair value of such derivatives in an asset position. To mitigate this risk, the Portfolio has entered into a master netting agreement with its derivative
counterparty, which allows it and the counterparty to aggregate amounts owed by each of them for derivative transactions under the agreement into a single net amount payable by either the Portfolio or the counterparty. At April 30, 2013, the
maximum amount of loss the Portfolio would incur due to counterparty risk would be reduced by approximately $108,000 due to the master netting agreement. The counterparty may be required to pledge collateral in the form of cash, U.S. Government
securities or highly-rated bonds for the benefit of the Portfolio if the net amount due from the counterparty with respect to a derivative contract exceeds a certain threshold. The amount of collateral posted by the counterparty with respect to such
contracts would also reduce the amount of any loss incurred.

6  Line of Credit  The Portfolio participates with other
portfolios and funds managed by EVM and its affiliates in a $600 million unsecured line of credit agreement with a group of banks. Borrowings are made by the Portfolio solely to facilitate the handling of unusual and/or unanticipated short-term cash
requirements. Interest is charged to the Portfolio based on its borrowings at an amount above either the Eurodollar rate or Federal Funds rate. In addition, a fee computed at an annual rate of 0.08% on the daily unused portion of the line of credit
is allocated among the participating portfolios and funds at the end of each quarter. Because the line of credit is not available exclusively to the Portfolio, it may be unable to borrow some or all of its requested amounts at any particular time.
The Portfolio did not have any significant borrowings or allocated fees during the six months ended April 30, 2013.  7  Fair Value
Measurements  Under generally accepted accounting principles for fair value measurements, a three-tier hierarchy to prioritize the assumptions, referred
to as inputs, is used in valuation techniques to measure fair value. The three-tier hierarchy of inputs is summarized in the three broad levels listed below.   



 
 Level 1  quoted prices in active markets for identical investments 
 



 
 Level 2  other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar investments, interest rates, prepayment speeds, credit risk, etc.)
  



 
 Level 3  significant unobservable inputs (including a funds own assumptions in determining the fair value of investments)
 In cases where the inputs used to measure fair value fall in different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level disclosed is
determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The inputs or methodology used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in those
securities.  At April 30, 2013, the hierarchy of inputs used in valuing the Portfolios investments and open derivative instruments, which are
carried at value, were as follows:

MSAR Completion Portfolio   
Board of Trustees Contract Approval   
  Overview of the Contract Review Process 
The Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act), provides, in substance, that each investment advisory agreement between a fund and its
investment adviser will continue in effect from year to year only if its continuation is approved at least annually by the funds board of trustees, including by a vote of a majority of the trustees who are not interested persons of
the fund (Independent Trustees), cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of considering such approval.  At a meeting of the Boards
of Trustees (each a Board) of the Eaton Vance group of mutual funds (the Eaton Vance Funds) held on April 23, 2013, the Board, including a majority of the Independent Trustees, voted to approve continuation of existing
advisory and sub-advisory agreements for the Eaton Vance Funds for an additional one-year period. In voting its approval, the Board relied upon the affirmative recommendation of the Contract Review Committee of the Board, which is a committee
comprised exclusively of Independent Trustees. Prior to making its recommendation, the Contract Review Committee reviewed information furnished by each adviser to the Eaton Vance Funds (including information specifically requested by the Board) for
a series of meetings of the Contract Review Committee held between February and April 2013, as well as information considered during prior meetings of the committee. Such information included, among other things, the following:

MSAR Completion Portfolio   
Board of Trustees Contract Approval  continued 
    Other Relevant Information   



 
 Information concerning the nature, cost and character of the administrative and other non-investment management services provided by Eaton Vance Management and
its affiliates;   



 
 Information concerning management of the relationship with the custodian, subcustodians and fund accountants by each adviser or the funds administrator;
and   



 
 The terms of each advisory agreement.  In
addition to the information identified above, the Contract Review Committee considered information provided from time to time by each adviser throughout the year at meetings of the Board and its committees. Over the course of the twelve-month period
ended April 30, 2013, with respect to one or more funds, the Board met eight times and the Contract Review Committee, the Audit Committee, the Governance Committee, the Portfolio Management Committee and the Compliance Reports and Regulatory
Matters Committee, each of which is a Committee comprised solely of Independent Trustees, met eight, twenty-one, five, nine and thirteen times respectively. At such meetings, the Trustees participated in investment and performance reviews with the
portfolio managers and other investment professionals of each adviser relating to each fund. The Board and its Committees considered the investment and trading strategies used in pursuing each funds investment objective, including, where
relevant, the use of derivative instruments, as well as processes for monitoring best execution of portfolio transactions and risk management techniques. The Board and its Committees also evaluated issues pertaining to industry and regulatory
developments, compliance procedures, fund governance and other issues with respect to the funds, and received and participated in reports and presentations provided by Eaton Vance Management and other fund advisers with respect to such matters.
 For funds that invest through one or more underlying portfolios, the Board considered similar information about the portfolio(s) when considering the
approval of advisory agreements. In addition, in cases where the funds investment adviser has engaged a sub-adviser, the Board considered similar information about the sub-adviser when considering the approval of any sub-advisory agreement.
 The Contract Review Committee was assisted throughout the contract review process by Goodwin Procter LLP, legal counsel for the Independent
Trustees. The members of the Contract Review Committee relied upon the advice of such counsel and their own business judgment in determining the material factors to be considered in evaluating each advisory and sub-advisory agreement and the weight
to be given to each such factor. The conclusions reached with respect to each advisory and sub-advisory agreement were based on a comprehensive evaluation of all the information provided and not any single factor. Moreover, each member of the
Contract Review Committee may have placed varying emphasis on particular factors in reaching conclusions with respect to each advisory and sub-advisory agreement.  Results of the Process  Based on its consideration of the foregoing, and such other information as it deemed relevant,
including the factors and conclusions described below, the Contract Review Committee concluded that the continuation of the investment advisory agreement of MSAR Completion Portfolio (the Portfolio) with Boston Management and Research
(the Adviser), an affiliate of Eaton Vance Management and the sub-advisory agreement with Parametric Risk Advisors LLC (the Sub-adviser), an affiliate of Eaton Vance Management, including their fee structures, is in the
interests of shareholders and, therefore, the Contract Review Committee recommended to the Board approval of each agreement. The Board accepted the recommendation of the Contract Review Committee as well as the factors considered and conclusions
reached by the Contract Review Committee with respect to the agreements. Accordingly, the Board, including a majority of the Independent Trustees, voted to approve continuation of the investment advisory agreement and the sub-advisory agreement for
the Portfolio.  Nature, Extent and Quality of Services 
In considering whether to approve the investment advisory agreement and the sub-advisory agreement of the Portfolio, the Board evaluated the nature, extent and
quality of services provided to the Portfolio by the Adviser and the Sub-adviser.  The Board considered the Advisers and the Sub-advisers
management capabilities and investment process with respect to the types of investments held by the Portfolio, including the education, experience and number of its investment professionals and other personnel who provide portfolio management,
investment research, and similar services to the Portfolio. With respect to the Adviser, the Board considered the Advisers responsibilities supervising the Sub-adviser and coordinating activities in implementing the Portfolios investment
strategy. With respect to the Sub-adviser, the Board considered its abilities in analyzing factors relevant to investing in options on indices. The Board also took into account the resources dedicated to portfolio management and other services,
including the compensation methods of the Adviser to recruit and retain investment personnel, and the time and attention devoted to the Portfolio by senior management.  The Board reviewed the compliance programs of the Adviser and relevant affiliates thereof, including the Sub-adviser. Among other matters, the Board considered compliance and reporting matters relating to personal
trading by investment personnel, selective disclosure of portfolio holdings, late trading, frequent trading, portfolio valuation, business continuity and the allocation of investment opportunities. The Board also evaluated the responses of the
Adviser and its affiliates to requests in recent years from regulatory authorities such as the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.

MSAR Completion Portfolio   
Board of Trustees Contract Approval  continued 
    The Board considered shareholder and other administrative services provided or managed by Eaton Vance Management and its affiliates, including transfer agency and accounting services. The Board evaluated the
benefits to shareholders of investing in a fund that is a part of a large family of funds, including the ability, in many cases, to exchange an investment among different funds without incurring additional sales charges. 
After consideration of the foregoing factors, among others, the Board concluded that the nature, extent and quality of services provided by the Adviser and
Sub-adviser, taken as a whole, are appropriate and consistent with the terms of the investment advisory agreement and the sub-advisory agreement. 
Portfolio Performance  The Board compared the Portfolios
investment performance to a relevant universe of similarly managed funds identified by an independent data provider and appropriate benchmark indices. The Board reviewed comparative performance data for the one-year period ended September 30,
2012 for the Portfolio. In light of the Portfolios relatively brief operating history, the Board concluded that additional time is required to evaluate Portfolio performance.  Management Fees and Expenses  The Board reviewed contractual investment advisory fee rates payable by the Portfolio
(referred to as management fees). As part of its review, the Board considered the management fees and the Portfolios total expense ratio for the year ended September 30, 2012, as compared to a group of similarly managed funds
selected by an independent data provider. The Board noted that the Portfolio has established a wholly-owned subsidiary to accommodate the Portfolios commodity-related investments. The subsidiary is managed by the Adviser pursuant to a separate
investment advisory agreement that is subject to annual approval by the Board. The subsidiarys fee rates are the same as those charged to the Portfolio, and the Portfolio will not pay any additional management fees with respect to its assets
invested in the subsidiary. The Board also considered factors that had an impact on Portfolio expense ratios, as identified by management in response to inquiries from the Contract Review Committee, as well as actions taken by management in recent
years to reduce expenses at the Eaton Vance fund complex level, including the negotiation of reduced fees for transfer agency and custody services. 
After reviewing the foregoing information, and in light of the nature, extent and quality of the services provided by the Adviser and the Sub-adviser, the Board
concluded that the management fees charged for advisory and related services are reasonable.  Profitability 
The Board reviewed the level of profits realized by the Adviser and relevant affiliates thereof in providing investment advisory and administrative services to the
Portfolio and to all Eaton Vance Funds as a group. The Board considered the level of profits realized without regard to revenue sharing or other payments by the Adviser and its affiliates to third parties in respect of distribution services. The
Board also considered other direct or indirect benefits received by the Adviser and its affiliates, including the Sub-adviser, in connection with their relationships with the Portfolio, including the benefits of research services that may be
available to the Adviser or the Sub-adviser as a result of securities transactions effected for the Portfolio and other investment advisory clients.  The
Board concluded that, in light of the foregoing factors and the nature, extent and quality of the services rendered, the profits realized by the Adviser and its affiliates, including the Sub-adviser, are reasonable. 
Economies of Scale  In reviewing management fees and profitability,
the Board also considered the extent to which the Adviser and its affiliates, on the one hand, and the Portfolio, on the other hand, can expect to realize benefits from economies of scale as the assets of the Portfolio increase. The Board
acknowledged the difficulty in accurately measuring the benefits resulting from the economies of scale with respect to the management of any specific fund or group of funds. The Board reviewed data summarizing the increases and decreases in the
assets of the Portfolio and of all Eaton Vance Funds as a group over various time periods, and evaluated the extent to which the total expense ratio of the Portfolio and the profitability of the Adviser and its affiliates may have been affected by
such increases or decreases. Based upon the foregoing, the Board concluded that the Portfolio currently shares in the benefits from economies of scale. The Board also concluded that, assuming reasonably foreseeable increases in the assets of the
Portfolio, the structure of the advisory fee, which includes breakpoints at several asset levels, will allow the Portfolio to continue to benefit from economies of scale in the future.

	At July 31, 2012, the Portfolio had sufficient cash and/or securities to cover commitments under these contracts.




	In the normal course of pursuing its investment objectives and its use of derivatives, the Portfolio is subject to the following risks:




	Equity Price Risk: The Portfolio seeks to generate incremental return by writing a series of call and put option spread transactions on an
	index of common stocks. If the index appreciates or depreciates sufficiently over the period to offset the net premium received, the Portfolio will incur a net loss. The amount of potential loss in the event of a sharp market movement is subject to
	a cap defined by the difference in strike prices between written and purchased call and put options, and the notional value of the positions. The Portfolio also entered into certain purchased put options and futures contracts to hedge against
	fluctuations in security prices of investments held by Eaton Vance Multi-Strategy Absolute Return Fund for which the Portfolio serves as its completion portfolio.




	Interest Rate Risk: The Portfolio holds fixed-rate bonds. The value of these bonds may decrease if interest rates rise. To hedge against fluctuations in interest rates and to manage its effective
	duration, the Portfolio purchases and sells U.S. Treasury futures contracts and options thereon.




	The fair value of open derivative
	instruments (not considered to be hedging instruments for accounting disclosure purposes) by risk exposure at July 31, 2012 was as follows:

	Under generally accepted accounting principles for fair value measurements, a three-tier hierarchy to
	prioritize the assumptions, referred to as inputs, is used in valuation techniques to measure fair value. The three-tier hierarchy of inputs is summarized in the three broad levels listed below.



	 





	




	 





	Level 1  quoted prices in active markets for identical investments






	 





	




	 





	Level 2  other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar investments, interest rates, prepayment speeds, credit risk,
	etc.)






	 





	




	 





	Level 3  significant unobservable inputs (including a funds own assumptions in determining the fair value of investments)







	In cases where the inputs used to measure fair value fall in different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level
	disclosed is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The inputs or methodology used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing
	in those securities.




	At July 31, 2012, the hierarchy of inputs used in valuing the Portfolios investments and open derivative
	instruments, which are carried at value, were as follows:

	are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrants ability to record, process, summarize, and report financial information; and

MSAR Completion Portfolio  October 31, 2014    Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements     
1  Significant Accounting Policies  MSAR Completion
Portfolio (the Portfolio) is a Massachusetts business trust registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act), as a non-diversified, open-end management investment company. The Portfolios investment objective is
total return. The Declaration of Trust permits the Trustees to issue interests in the Portfolio. At October 31, 2014, Eaton Vance Multi-Strategy Absolute Return Fund held a 98.9% interest in the Portfolio. 
The Portfolio seeks to gain exposure to the commodity markets, in whole or in part, through investments in Eaton Vance MSAR Commodity Subsidiary, Ltd. (the
Subsidiary), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Portfolio organized under the laws of the Cayman Islands with the same objective and investment policies and restrictions as the Portfolio. The Portfolio may invest up to 25% of its total assets in the
Subsidiary. The net assets of the Subsidiary at October 31, 2014 were $2,793,697 or 3.3% of the Portfolios consolidated net assets. The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Subsidiary. Intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  The following is a summary of significant accounting policies of the Portfolio. The
policies are in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). The Portfolio is an investment company and follows accounting and reporting guidance in the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(FASB) Accounting Standards Codification Topic 946.  A  Investment Valuation  The following methodologies are used to determine the market value or fair value of investments.  Debt
Obligations. Debt obligations (including short-term obligations with a remaining maturity of more than sixty days) are generally valued on the basis of valuations provided by third party pricing services, as derived from such services
pricing models. Inputs to the models may include, but are not limited to, reported trades, executable bid and asked prices, broker/dealer quotations, prices or yields of securities with similar characteristics, interest rates, anticipated
prepayments, benchmark curves or information pertaining to the issuer, as well as industry and economic events. The pricing services may use a matrix approach, which considers information regarding securities with similar characteristics to
determine the valuation for a security. Short-term obligations purchased with a remaining maturity of sixty days or less are generally valued at amortized cost, which approximates market value. 
Derivatives. Exchange-traded options (other than FLexible EXchange traded options) are valued at the mean between the bid and asked prices at valuation time
as reported by the Options Price Reporting Authority for U.S. listed options or by the relevant exchange or board of trade for non-U.S. listed options. Over-the-counter options (including options on securities, indices and foreign currencies) and
FLexible EXchange traded options traded at the Chicago Board Options Exchange are valued by a third party pricing service using techniques that consider factors including the value of the underlying instrument, the volatility of the underlying
instrument and the period of time until option expiration. Financial futures contracts are valued at the closing settlement price established by the board of trade or exchange on which they are traded. Swaps are normally valued using valuations
provided by a third party pricing service. Such pricing service valuations are based on the present value of fixed and projected floating rate cash flows over the term of the swap contract. In the case of total return swaps, the pricing service
valuations are based on the value of the underlying index or instrument and reference interest rate. Future cash flows on swaps are discounted to their present value using swap rates provided by electronic data services or by broker/dealers.
 Affiliated Fund. The Portfolio may invest in Eaton Vance Cash Reserves Fund, LLC (Cash Reserves Fund), an affiliated investment company managed
by Eaton Vance Management (EVM). The value of the Portfolios investment in Cash Reserves Fund reflects the Portfolios proportionate interest in its net assets. Cash Reserves Fund generally values its investment securities utilizing the
amortized cost valuation technique in accordance with Rule 2a-7 under the 1940 Act. This technique involves initially valuing a portfolio security at its cost and thereafter assuming a constant amortization to maturity of any discount or premium. If
amortized cost is determined not to approximate fair value, Cash Reserves Fund may value its investment securities in the same manner as debt obligations described above.  Fair Valuation. Investments for which valuations or market quotations are not readily available or are deemed unreliable are valued at fair value using methods determined in good faith by or at the direction
of the Trustees of the Portfolio in a manner that fairly reflects the securitys value, or the amount that the Portfolio might reasonably expect to receive for the security upon its current sale in the ordinary course. Each such determination
is based on a consideration of relevant factors, which are likely to vary from one pricing context to another. These factors may include, but are not limited to, the type of security, the existence of any contractual restrictions on the
securitys disposition, the price and extent of public trading in similar securities of the issuer or of comparable companies or entities, quotations or relevant information obtained from broker/dealers or other market participants, information
obtained from the issuer, analysts, and/or the appropriate stock exchange (for exchange-traded securities), an analysis of the companys or entitys financial condition, and an evaluation of the forces that influence the issuer and the
market(s) in which the security is purchased and sold.  B  Investment Transactions  Investment transactions for financial statement purposes are accounted for on a trade date basis. Realized gains and losses on investments sold are determined on the basis of identified cost.
 C  Income  Interest income is
recorded on the basis of interest accrued, adjusted for amortization of premium or accretion of discount. 
D  Federal Taxes  The Portfolio has elected to
be treated as a partnership for federal tax purposes. No provision is made by the Portfolio for federal or state taxes on any taxable income of the Portfolio because each investor in the Portfolio is ultimately responsible for the payment of any
taxes on its share of taxable income. If one of the Portfolios investors is a regulated investment company that invests all or substantially all of its assets in the Portfolio, the Portfolio normally must satisfy the applicable source of
income and diversification requirements (under the Internal Revenue Code) in order for its investors to satisfy them. The Portfolio will allocate, at least annually among its investors, each investors distributive share of the Portfolios
net investment income, net realized capital gains and any other items of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit.

MSAR Completion Portfolio  October 31, 2014    Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements  continued     
The Subsidiary is treated as a controlled foreign corporation under the Internal Revenue Code and is not expected to be subject to U.S. federal income tax. The
Portfolio is treated as a U.S. shareholder of the Subsidiary. As a result, the Portfolio is required to include in gross income for U.S. federal tax purposes all of the Subsidiarys income, whether or not such income is distributed by the
Subsidiary. If a net loss is realized by the Subsidiary, such loss is not generally available to offset the income earned by the Portfolio.  As of
October 31, 2014, the Portfolio had no uncertain tax positions that would require financial statement recognition, de-recognition, or disclosure. The Portfolio files a U.S. federal income tax return annually after its fiscal year-end, which is
subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service for a period of three years from the date of filing.  E  Expense Reduction  State Street Bank and Trust Company (SSBT) serves as custodian of the Portfolio. Pursuant to the custodian agreement, SSBT
receives a fee reduced by credits, which are determined based on the average daily cash balance the Portfolio maintains with SSBT. All credit balances, if any, used to reduce the Portfolios custodian fees are reported as a reduction of
expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.  F  Use of Estimates  The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at
the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expense during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  G  Indemnifications  Under the Portfolios organizational documents, its officers and
Trustees may be indemnified against certain liabilities and expenses arising out of the performance of their duties to the Portfolio. Under Massachusetts law, if certain conditions prevail, interestholders in the Portfolio could be deemed to have
personal liability for the obligations of the Portfolio. However, the Portfolios Declaration of Trust contains an express disclaimer of liability on the part of Portfolio interestholders and the By-laws provide that the Portfolio shall assume
the defense on behalf of any Portfolio interestholder. Moreover, the By-laws also provide for indemnification out of Portfolio property of any interestholder held personally liable solely by reason of being or having been an interestholder for all
loss or expense arising from such liability. Additionally, in the normal course of business, the Portfolio enters into agreements with service providers that may contain indemnification clauses. The Portfolios maximum exposure under these
arrangements is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made against the Portfolio that have not yet occurred.  H  Financial Futures Contracts  Upon entering into a financial futures contract, the Portfolio is required to deposit with the broker, either in
cash or securities, an amount equal to a certain percentage of the contract amount (initial margin). Subsequent payments, known as variation margin, are made or received by the Portfolio each business day, depending on the daily fluctuations in the
value of the underlying security or currency, and are recorded as unrealized gains or losses by the Portfolio. Gains (losses) are realized upon the expiration or closing of the financial futures contracts. Should market conditions change
unexpectedly, the Portfolio may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the financial futures contracts and may realize a loss. Futures contracts have minimal counterparty risk as they are exchange traded and the clearinghouse for the exchange is
substituted as the counterparty, guaranteeing counterparty performance.  I  Written
Options  Upon the writing of a call or a put option, the premium received by the Portfolio is included in the Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities as a liability. The amount of the
liability is subsequently marked-to-market to reflect the current market value of the option written, in accordance with the Portfolios policies on investment valuations discussed above. Premiums received from writing options which expire are
treated as realized gains. Premiums received from writing options which are exercised or are closed are added to or offset against the proceeds or amount paid on the transaction to determine the realized gain or loss. When an index option is
exercised, the Portfolio is required to deliver an amount of cash determined by the excess of the strike price of the option over the value of the index (in the case of a put) or the excess of the value of the index over the strike price of the
option (in the case of a call) at contract termination. If a put option on a security is exercised, the premium reduces the cost basis of the securities purchased by the Portfolio. The Portfolio, as a writer of an option, may have no control over
whether the underlying securities or other assets may be sold (call) or purchased (put) and, as a result, bears the market risk of an unfavorable change in the price of the securities or other assets underlying the written option. The Portfolio may
also bear the risk of not being able to enter into a closing transaction if a liquid secondary market does not exist.  J  Purchased Options  Upon the purchase of a call or put option, the premium paid by the Portfolio is included in the Consolidated Statement of
Assets and Liabilities as an investment. The amount of the investment is subsequently marked-to-market to reflect the current market value of the option purchased, in accordance with the Portfolios policies on investment valuations discussed
above. As the purchaser of an index option, the Portfolio has the right to receive a cash payment equal to any depreciation in the value of the index below the strike price of the option (in the case of a put) or equal to any appreciation in the
value of the index over the strike price of the option (in the case of a call) as of the valuation date of the option. If an option which the Portfolio had purchased expires on the stipulated expiration date, the Portfolio will realize a loss in the
amount of the cost of the option. If the Portfolio enters into a closing sale transaction, the Portfolio will realize a gain or loss, depending on whether the sales proceeds from the closing sale transaction are greater or less than the cost of the
option. If the Portfolio exercises a put option on a security, it will realize a gain or loss from the sale of the underlying security, and the proceeds from such sale will be decreased by the premium originally paid. If the Portfolio exercises a
call option on a security, the cost of the security which the Portfolio purchases upon exercise will be increased by the premium originally paid. The risk associated with purchasing options is limited to the premium originally paid. 
K  Total Return Swaps  In a total return swap,
the buyer receives a periodic return equal to the total return of a specified security, securities or index for a specified period of time. In return, the buyer pays the counterparty a fixed or variable stream of payments, typically based upon
short-term interest rates, possibly plus or minus an agreed upon spread. During the term of the outstanding swap agreement, changes in the underlying value of the swap are

MSAR Completion Portfolio  October 31, 2014    Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements  continued     

recorded as unrealized gains and losses. Periodic payments received or made are recorded as realized gains or losses. The Portfolio is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the
swap counterparty. Risk may also arise from the unanticipated movements in value of exchange rates, interest rates, securities, or the index. 
2  Investment Adviser Fee and Other Transactions with Affiliates  The investment adviser fee is earned by Boston Management and Research (BMR), a subsidiary of EVM, as compensation for investment advisory services rendered to the Portfolio and the Subsidiary. Pursuant to the
investment advisory agreement between the Portfolio and BMR and the investment advisory agreement between the Subsidiary and BMR, the Portfolio and Subsidiary each pay BMR a fee at an annual rate of 0.615% of its respective average daily net assets
up to $500 million and at reduced rates on daily net assets of $500 million or more. In determining the investment adviser fee for the Portfolio and Subsidiary, the applicable advisory fee rate is based on the average daily net assets of the
Portfolio (inclusive of its interest in the Subsidiary). Such fee rate is then assessed separately on the Portfolios average daily net assets (exclusive of its interest in the Subsidiary) and the Subsidiarys average daily net assets to
determine the amount of the investment advisory fee. In addition, BMR also receives an investment adviser fee in an amount equal to 0.55% of the Portfolios average daily net assets up to $500 million that are subject to a written put spread
and/or call spread strategy and at reduced rates when the Portfolios daily net assets are $500 million or more. The Portfolios daily net assets that are subject to a written put spread and/or call spread strategy may exceed the
Portfolios daily net assets on any day. The investment adviser fee is payable monthly. For the year ended October 31, 2014, the investment adviser fee amounted to $627,189 or 0.72% of the Portfolios consolidated average daily net
assets. The Portfolio invests its cash in Cash Reserves Fund. EVM does not currently receive a fee for advisory services provided to Cash Reserves Fund. Pursuant to a sub-advisory agreement, BMR has delegated the investment management of the
Portfolios options strategy to Parametric Risk Advisors LLC (PRA), an indirect affiliate of EVM. BMR pays PRA a portion of its adviser fee for sub-advisory services provided to the Portfolio. 
Trustees and officers of the Portfolio who are members of EVMs or BMRs organizations receive remuneration for their services to the Portfolio out of the
investment adviser fee. Trustees of the Portfolio who are not affiliated with the investment adviser may elect to defer receipt of all or a percentage of their annual fees in accordance with the terms of the Trustees Deferred Compensation Plan. For
the year ended October 31, 2014, no significant amounts have been deferred. Certain officers and Trustees of the Portfolio are officers of the above organizations.  3  Purchases and Sales of Investments  Purchases and sales of investments, other than short-term obligations
and including maturities and paydowns, aggregated $17,506,437 and $85,699,814, respectively, for the year ended October 31, 2014. 
4  Federal Income Tax Basis of Investments  The cost and
unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of investments of the Portfolio, including the Portfolios investment in the Subsidiary, at October 31, 2014, as determined on a federal income tax basis, were as follows:

) 
 The net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on swap contracts at October 31, 2014 on a federal income tax basis was
$163,329.  5  Financial Instruments  The
Portfolio may trade in financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of its investing activities. These financial instruments may include financial futures contracts, written options and swap contracts and may involve, to a
varying degree, elements of risk in excess of the amounts recognized for financial statement purposes. The notional or contractual amounts of these instruments represent the investment the Portfolio has in particular classes of financial instruments
and do not necessarily represent the amounts potentially subject to risk. The measurement of the risks associated with these instruments is meaningful only when all related and offsetting transactions are considered. A summary of written options at
October 31, 2014 is included in the Consolidated Portfolio of Investments.

MSAR Completion Portfolio  October 31, 2014    Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements  continued     
At October 31, 2014, the Portfolio had sufficient cash and/or securities to cover commitments under these contracts. 
In the normal course of pursuing its investment objective and its use of derivatives, the Portfolio is subject to the following risks: 
Commodity Risk: The Portfolio invests in commodity-linked derivative instruments, including total return swaps based on a commodity index, to enhance total returns
and to gain exposure to the investment returns of commodities markets without investing directly in physical commodities.  Equity Price Risk: The
Portfolio seeks to generate incremental return by writing a series of call and put option spread transactions on an index of common stocks. If the index appreciates or depreciates sufficiently over the period to offset the net premium received, the
Portfolio will incur a net loss. The amount of potential loss in the event of a sharp market movement is subject to a cap defined by the difference in strike prices between written and purchased call and put options, and the notional value of the
positions. During the year ended October 31, 2014, the Portfolio also entered into total return swap contracts to enhance return and to hedge against fluctuations in security prices of investments held by Eaton Vance Multi-Strategy Absolute
Return Fund, for which the Portfolio serves as its completion portfolio.  Foreign Exchange Risk: During the year ended October 31, 2014, the
Portfolio entered into currency futures contracts and total return swaps to enhance total returns. The Portfolio also purchased and sold options on currency futures contracts to hedge against fluctuations in currency exchange rates. 
Interest Rate Risk: The Portfolio holds fixed-rate bonds. The value of these bonds may decrease if interest rates rise. To hedge against fluctuations in interest
rates and to manage its effective duration, the Portfolio enters into U.S. Treasury futures contracts.  The Portfolio enters into swap contracts that may
contain provisions whereby the counterparty may terminate the contract under certain conditions, including but not limited to a decline in the Portfolios net assets below a certain level over a certain period of time, which would trigger a
payment by the Portfolio for those derivatives in a liability position. At October 31, 2014, the fair value of derivatives with credit-related contingent features in a net liability position was $611,596. The aggregate fair value of assets
pledged as collateral by the Portfolio for such liability was $1,659,996 at October 31, 2014.  The over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives in which the
Portfolio invests are subject to the risk that the counterparty to the contract fails to perform its obligations under the contract. To mitigate this risk, the Portfolio (and Subsidiary) has entered into an International Swaps and Derivatives
Association, Inc. Master Agreement (ISDA Master Agreement) or similar agreement with substantially all its derivative counterparties. An ISDA Master Agreement is a bilateral agreement between the Portfolio and a counterparty that governs
certain OTC derivatives and typically contains, among other things, set-off provisions in the event of a default and/or termination event as defined under the relevant ISDA Master Agreement. Under an ISDA Master Agreement, the Portfolio (and
Subsidiary) may, under certain circumstances, offset with the counterparty certain derivative financial instruments payables and/or receivables with collateral held and/or posted and create one single net payment. The provisions of the ISDA
Master Agreement typically permit a single net payment in the event of default including the bankruptcy or insolvency of the counterparty. However, bankruptcy or insolvency laws of a particular jurisdiction may impose restrictions on or prohibitions
against the right of offset in bankruptcy or insolvency. Certain ISDA Master Agreements allow counterparties to OTC derivatives to terminate derivative contracts prior to maturity in the event the Portfolios net assets decline by a stated
percentage or the Portfolio fails to meet the terms of its ISDA Master Agreements, which would cause the counterparty to accelerate payment by the Portfolio of any net liability owed to it.  The collateral requirements for derivatives traded under an ISDA Master Agreement are governed by a Credit Support Annex to the ISDA Master Agreement. Collateral requirements are determined at the close of business
each day and are typically based on changes in market values for each transaction under an ISDA Master Agreement and netted into one amount for such agreement. Generally, the amount of collateral due from or to a counterparty is subject to a minimum
transfer threshold amount before a transfer is required, which may vary by counterparty. Collateral pledged for the benefit of the Portfolio (and Subsidiary) and/or counterparty is held in segregated accounts by the Portfolios custodian and
cannot be sold, re-pledged, assigned or otherwise used while pledged. The portion of such collateral representing cash, if any, is reflected as restricted cash and, in the case of cash pledged by a counterparty for the benefit of the Portfolio, a
corresponding liability on the Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities. Securities pledged by the Portfolio as collateral, if any, are identified as such in the Consolidated Portfolio of Investments. Because the Subsidiary is not registered
under the 1940 Act, it may not be able to negotiate terms with its counterparties that are equivalent to those a registered portfolio may negotiate. As a result, the Subsidiary may have greater exposure to those counterparties than a registered
portfolio.

 *     Amount represents cumulative unrealized appreciation or (depreciation) on futures contracts in
the Futures Contracts table above. Only the current days variation margin on open futures contracts is reported within the Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities as Receivable or Payable for variation margin, as

 During the current reporting period, the Portfolio adopted the new disclosure requirements for offsetting assets and liabilities,
pursuant to which an entity is required to disclose both gross and net information for assets and liabilities related to derivatives, repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, and securities lending and securities borrowing transactions that are
eligible for offset or subject to an enforceable master netting or similar agreement. The Portfolios derivative assets and liabilities at fair value by risk, which are reported gross in the Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities, are
presented in the table above. The following tables present the Portfolios derivative assets and liabilities by counterparty, net of amounts available for offset under a master netting agreement and net of the related collateral received by the
Portfolio (and Subsidiary) for assets and pledged by the Portfolio (and Subsidiary) for liabilities as of October 31, 2014.

outstanding during the year ended October 31, 2014, which are indicative of the volume of these derivative types, were approximately $1,059,000 and 381 contracts, respectively.  6  Line of Credit  The Portfolio participates with other portfolios and funds managed by EVM and its
affiliates in a $750 million unsecured line of credit agreement with a group of banks. Borrowings are made by the Portfolio solely to facilitate the handling of unusual and/or unanticipated short-term cash requirements. Interest is charged to the
Portfolio based on its borrowings at an amount above either the Eurodollar rate or Federal Funds rate. In addition, a fee computed at an annual rate of 0.08% on the daily unused portion of the line of credit is allocated among the participating
portfolios and funds at the end of each quarter. Because the line of credit is not available exclusively to the Portfolio, it may be unable to borrow some or all of its requested amounts at any particular time. The Portfolio did not have any
significant borrowings or allocated fees during the year ended October 31, 2014.

MSAR Completion Portfolio  October 31, 2014    Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements  continued     
7  Fair Value Measurements  Under generally accepted
accounting principles for fair value measurements, a three-tier hierarchy to prioritize the assumptions, referred to as inputs, is used in valuation techniques to measure fair value. The three-tier hierarchy of inputs is summarized in the three
broad levels listed below.   



 
 Level 1  quoted prices in active markets for identical investments 
 



 
 Level 2  other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar investments, interest rates, prepayment speeds, credit risk, etc.)
  



 
 Level 3  significant unobservable inputs (including a funds own assumptions in determining the fair value of investments)
 In cases where the inputs used to measure fair value fall in different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level disclosed is
determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The inputs or methodology used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in those
securities.  At October 31, 2014, the hierarchy of inputs used in valuing the Portfolios investments and open derivative instruments, which
are carried at value, were as follows:

MSAR Completion Portfolio  October 31, 2014    Report of Independent
Registered Public Accounting Firm     
To the Trustees and Investors of MSAR Completion Portfolio:  We have
audited the accompanying consolidated statement of assets and liabilities of MSAR Completion Portfolio and Subsidiary (the Portfolio), including the consolidated portfolio of investments, as of October 31, 2014, and the related
consolidated statement of operations for the year then ended, the consolidated statements of changes in net assets for each of the two years in the period then ended, and the consolidated supplementary data for each of the periods presented. These
financial statements and supplementary data are the responsibility of the Portfolios management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and supplementary data based on our audits. 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements and supplementary data are free of material misstatement. The Portfolio is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control
over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Portfolios internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation of securities owned as of October 31, 2014, by
correspondence with the custodian and brokers; where replies were not received from brokers, we performed other auditing procedures. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements and consolidated supplementary data referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of MSAR Completion Portfolio as of October 31, 2014, and the results of its operations for the year then ended, the changes in net assets for each of the two years in the period then ended, and the supplementary data for each of the
periods presented, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP

durability and quiet, reliable operation make Bindertek�s One Touch 3-ring binders superior to the competition. These sturdy but attractive binders are easy to use, with a fluid one-touch mechanism that opens and closes smoothly. 

Our 3-ring binders use D-rings, so the pages align correctly and close securely without snagging, and also have steel-reinforced edges to withstand years of wear and use.

But for all their practicality, One Touch 3-ring binders have a sense of style. The Classic One-Touch binders feature linen-textured covers, while our elegant Barrister Binders look right at home on any law firm�s bookshelf. Our One-Touch View Binders have a clear non-stick front cover and spine that you can personalize with your own inserts.
