KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II - OFFERING


The following website material is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy shares of KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II; offering is only made by prospectus. This information must be preceded or accompanied by a prospectus in order to understand fully all of the implications and risks of the offering. Neither the Attorney General of the State of New York nor any other state regulators have passed on or endorsed the merits of this offering. Any representation to the contrary is unlawful.
Click on the document link to view prospectus and supplements. For more information contact the KBS Sales Desk: 866-527-4264
To continue please acknowledge that you have received a copy of the prospectus by clicking the button below. 
Please click on Important Risk Factors to learn more about risks you should consider:
Important Risk Factors 



Shares of KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II are not suitable for all investors and an investment in KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II is subject to substantial risks. These risks may include, but are not limited to:

The possibility of losing your entire investment.
No guarantees regarding future performance.
Upon sale or distribution of assets you may receive less than your initial investment.
Fluctuation of the value of the assets owned by KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II.
The absence of a public market for shares of KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II.
A lack of an operating history for KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II.
Limited transferability and lack of liquidity.
Reliance on its advisor to select investments, manage and dispose of assets.
Payment of significant fees to its advisor, its affiliates, and participating broker-dealers.
Lack of diversification in property holdings until significant funds have been raised.
Various economic factors that may include changes in interest rates, laws, operating expenses, insurance costs and tenant turnover. These factors may result in reduced earnings, reduction in value of notes/loans, delinquency of payments and default on loans owned by the REIT.
Continued disruptions in the financial markets and deteriorating economic conditions could adversely affect the value of KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II’s investments.

KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II’s organizational documents do not restrict it from paying distributions from any source and do not restrict the amount of distributions it may pay from any source, including offering proceeds or borrowings. Distributions paid from sources other than current or accumulated earnings and profits may constitute a return of capital. A return of capital would reduce the amount KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II would have for investment, which could reduce an investor’s return on investment and subsequent investors will experience dilution. There are no guarantees that KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II will pay distributions.
KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II will pay substantial fees to and expenses of KBS Capital Advisors, its affiliates and participating broker-dealers, which payments will increase the risk that stockholders will not earn a profit on their investment. KBS Capital Advisors and its affiliates, and KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II’s executive officers, its affiliated directors and other key professionals face conflicts of interest, including significant conflicts created by the advisor’s compensation arrangements with the REIT and other KBS-sponsored programs and KBS-advised investors.
KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II’s advisor and its affiliates receive fees in connection with transactions involving the purchase or origination and management of the REIT’s investments. These fees are based on the cost of the investment, and not based on the quality of the investment or the quality of the services rendered to the REIT. This may influence the advisor to recommend riskier transactions to the REIT.
KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II expects to use debt in connection with its investments, which increases the risk of loss associated with these investments and could hinder its ability to pay distributions to its stockholders or could decrease the value of its stockholders’ investments if income on, or the value of, the property securing the debt declines.
KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II may make adjustments to its target portfolio, based on real estate market conditions and investment opportunities. The REIT may change its targeted investments and investment guidelines at any time without the consent of its stockholders.
KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II expects to make foreign investments and will be susceptible to changes in currency exchange rates, adverse political or economic developments, lack of uniform accounting standards and changes in foreign laws which may adversely affect the investment portfolio of the REIT, thereby affecting the value of the investor’s investment in the REIT. Disruptions in the financial markets and uncertain economic conditions could adversely affect KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II’s ability to implement its business strategy and generate returns for its stockholders.
KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II’s charter does not require it to liquidate its assets and dissolve by a specified date, nor does the charter require it to list its shares for trading by a specified date. No public market currently exists for its shares, and it has no plans to list its shares on a national securities exchange. If a stockholder is able to sell his or her shares, that stockholder would likely have to sell them at a substantial discount from their public offering price.
If KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II does not raise significant proceeds in its public offering, it may not be able to acquire as diverse portfolio of real estate investments and the value of its stockholders’ investment may vary more widely with the performance of specific assets.
Disruptions in the financial markets and uncertain economic conditions could adversely affect KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II’s ability to implement its business strategy and generate returns for its stockholders.
KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II’s share price is set arbitrarily and the price is unrelated to the book or net value of assets owned by the REIT or to its expected operating income. No public market currently exists for shares of the REIT, and the REIT has no plans to list its shares on an exchange. In addition, the shares are subject to restrictions on transferability and re-sale and investors will be required to bear the financial risk of this investment for an indefinite period of time. If investors are able to sell shares, they will likely have to sell them at a substantial loss.
There is no guarantee that KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II will be able to provide liquidity by a certain date, or at all, or that any liquidity event would be successful. Investors may be required to hold their shares indefinitely.
Because KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II has not yet identified any specific investments to acquire, it is considered a blind pool.
KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II intends to elect to be taxed as a REIT beginning with the taxable year ending December 31, 2014. Should KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II not qualify as a REIT, it will be subject to adverse tax consequences. Please refer to the prospectus for more detailed information regarding these consequences.
An investment in KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II’s shares is complex. Investors should read and consider the prospectus, as amended and supplemented, carefully before investing.

	All of our executive officers and some of our directors and other key real estate and debt finance professionals are also officers, directors, managers, key professionals and/or holders of a direct or indirect controlling interest in our advisor, the entity that acted as our dealer manager and/or other KBS-affiliated entities. As a result, they face conflicts of interest, including significant conflicts created by our advisor’s compensation arrangements with us and other KBS-sponsored programs and KBS-advised investors and conflicts in allocating time among us and these other programs and investors. These conflicts could result in unanticipated actions.
















	•






	We pay substantial fees to and expenses of our advisor and its affiliates. These payments increase the risk that our stockholders will not earn a profit on their investment in us and increase the risk of loss to our stockholders.
















	•






	We have used proceeds from financings, when necessary, to fund a portion of our distributions during our operational stage. We currently expect that our distributions will generally be paid from cash flow from operations and funds from operations from current or prior periods. We also expect to fund other distributions from the net proceeds from the sale of real estate and from the receipt of principal payments from, or the sale of, our real estate-related loan receivable. We can give no assurance regarding the timing, amount or source of future distributions.
















	•






	We depend on tenants for the revenue generated by our real estate investments and, accordingly, the revenue generated by our real estate investments is dependent upon the success and economic viability of our tenants. Revenues from our properties could decrease due to a reduction in occupancy (caused by factors including, but not limited to, tenant defaults, tenant insolvency, early termination of tenant leases and non-renewal of existing tenant leases) and/or lower rental rates, making it more difficult for us to meet our debt service obligations and limiting our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders.
















	•






	Our investments in real estate and our mortgage loan may be affected by unfavorable real estate market and general economic conditions, which could decrease the value of those assets and reduce the investment return to our stockholders. Revenues from our properties and the property and other assets directly securing our loan investment could decrease. Such events would make it more difficult for the borrower under our loan investment to meet its payment obligations to us. It could also make it more difficult for us to meet our debt service obligations and limit our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders.
















	•






	Disruptions in the financial markets and uncertain economic conditions could adversely affect our ability to implement our business strategy and generate returns to our stockholders.
















	•






	Certain of our debt obligations have variable interest rates and related payments that vary with the movement of LIBOR or other indexes. Increases in these indexes could increase the amount of our debt payments and limit our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders.
















	•






	Our share redemption program provides only for redemptions sought upon a stockholder’s death, “qualifying disability” or “determination of incompetence” (each as defined in the share redemption program document, and, together with redemptions sought in connection with a stockholder’s death, “Special Redemptions”). The dollar amounts available for such redemptions are determined by the board of directors and may be reviewed and adjusted from time to time. Additionally, redemptions are further subject to limitations described in our share redemption program. We currently do not expect to have funds available for ordinary redemptions in the future.
















	•






	Since we have terminated our dividend reinvestment plan, we may have to use a greater proportion of our cash flow from operations to meet cash requirements for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, capital expenditures, tenant improvement costs and leasing costs related to our real estate properties; reserves required by financings of our real estate properties; the repayment of debt; and Special Redemptions under our share redemption program. This may reduce cash available for distributions.

	During the year ended December 31, 2016, we sold one office/flex property. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we sold one office property and received the repayment of one of our real estate loans receivable, and during the year ended December 31, 2014, we sold 15 real estate properties and received the repayment of three of our real estate loans receivable. As a result of our disposition activity, our general and administrative expenses, which are not directly related to the size of our portfolio, have increased significantly as a percentage of our cash flow from operations and will continue to increase to the extent we sell additional assets.

	Although the Special Committee (defined below) has engaged a financial advisor to assist with the exploration of strategic alternatives for us, we are not obligated to enter into any particular transaction or any transaction at all. Further, although we have begun the process of exploring strategic alternatives and are marketing some of our assets for sale, there is no assurance that this process will result in stockholder liquidity, or provide a return to stockholders that equals or exceeds our estimated value per share. We do not expect to provide additional updates regarding our review of strategic alternatives until such time, if any, that we are prepared to announce a material transaction or to conclude the strategic review.

	PART I










	ITEM 1.    BUSINESS




	Overview




	KBS Real Estate Investment Trust II, Inc. (the “Company”) was formed on July 12, 2007 as a Maryland corporation that elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) beginning with the taxable year ended December 31, 2008 and it intends to continue to operate in such a manner. The Company invested in a diverse portfolio of real estate and real estate-related investments. As used herein, the terms “we,” “our” and “us” refer to the Company and as required by context, KBS Limited Partnership II, a Delaware limited partnership (the “Operating Partnership”), and their subsidiaries. We conduct our business primarily through our Operating Partnership, of which we are the sole general partner. Subject to certain restrictions and limitations, our business is managed by KBS Capital Advisors LLC (“KBS Capital Advisors”), our external advisor, pursuant to an advisory agreement. KBS Capital Advisors conducts our operations and manages our portfolio of real estate and real estate-related investments. Our advisor owns 20,000 shares of our common stock. We have no paid employees.




	On September 27, 2007, we filed a registration statement on Form S-11 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) to offer a maximum of 280,000,000 shares of common stock for sale to the public, of which 200,000,000 shares were registered in our primary offering and 80,000,000 shares were registered under our dividend reinvestment plan. We ceased offering shares of common stock in our primary offering on December 31, 2010. We sold


	182,681,633


	 shares of common stock in the primary offering for gross offering proceeds of


	$1.8 billion


	. We terminated the offering under our dividend reinvestment plan effective May 29, 2014. We sold 30,903,504 shares of common stock under our dividend reinvestment plan for gross offering proceeds of $298.2 million. Also as of


	December 31, 2016


	, we had redeemed


	24,885,185


	 of the shares sold in our offering for


	$240.1 million


	.




	As of


	December 31, 2016


	, we owned


	11


	 real estate properties (consisting of


	10


	 office properties and an office campus consisting of


	eight


	 office buildings) and


	one


	 real estate loan receivable.




	On January 27, 2016, our board of directors formed a special committee (the “Special Committee”) composed of all of our independent directors to explore the availability of strategic alternatives involving us. As part of the process of exploring strategic alternatives, on February 23, 2016, the Special Committee engaged Evercore Group L.L.C. (“Evercore”) to act as our financial advisor and to assist us and the Special Committee with this process. Under the terms of the engagement, Evercore provided various financial advisory services, as requested by the Special Committee as customary for an engagement in connection with exploring strategic alternatives. Although the Special Committee has engaged Evercore to assist us and the Special Committee with the exploration of strategic alternatives for us, we are not obligated to enter into any particular transaction or any transaction at all.




	While the Special Committee continues to explore strategic alternatives for us, the Special Committee has determined that it would be in our best interest and the best interest of our stockholders to market some of our assets for sale. Based on the results of this sales effort, the board of directors may conclude that it would be in our best interest and the best interest of our stockholders to sell one or more of our assets and, depending on the scope of the proposed asset sales, thereafter to adopt a plan of liquidation that would involve the sale of our remaining assets. In the event of such a determination, the proposed plan of liquidation would be presented to our stockholders for approval. Alternatively, based on the results of the initial sales effort, the board of directors may conclude that it would be in our best interest and the best interest of our stockholders for us to engage in a limited number of asset sales and continue to operate as a going concern, but with a portfolio that is smaller than the present portfolio. Although we have begun the process of exploring strategic alternatives and are marketing some of our assets for sale, there is no assurance that this process will result in stockholder liquidity, or provide a return to stockholders that equals or exceeds our estimated value per share.




	Our focus in 2017 is to: continue to strategically sell assets and consider special distributions to stockholders; negotiate lease renewals or new leases that facilitate the sales process and enhance property stability for prospective buyers; complete capital projects, such as renovations or amenity enhancements, to attract quality buyers; and finalize the strategic alternatives assessment and decide on a course of action.

	Objectives and Strategies




	Our primary investment objectives are:













	•






	to provide our stockholders with attractive and stable cash distributions; and
















	•






	to preserve and return our stockholders’ capital contributions.







	We have sought and will seek to achieve these objectives by managing our portfolio of real estate and real estate-related investments, which we acquired using a combination of equity raised in our initial public offering and debt financing. We diversified our portfolio by investment size, investment type, investment risk and geographic region.




	Real Estate Portfolio




	Real Estate Investments




	We made investments in core properties, which are generally lower risk, existing properties with at least 80% occupancy and minimal near-term lease rollover. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, our portfolio of real estate properties was composed of


	ten


	 office properties and an office campus consisting of


	eight


	 office buildings encompassing


	5.1 million


	 rentable square feet.




	All of our properties are located in the United States. We originally intended to hold our core properties for four to seven years. However, economic and market conditions may influence us to hold our investments for different periods of time, and we currently expect our hold period for the majority of our remaining properties may last for a few more years. Our advisor has developed a well-defined exit strategy for each of our investments. Specifically, our advisor assigned a sell date to each asset we acquired prior to its purchase as part of the original business plan for the asset. KBS Capital Advisors continually performs a hold-sell analysis on each asset in order to determine a reasonable time to sell the asset and generate a strong return for our stockholders. Periodic reviews of each asset focus on the remaining available value enhancement opportunities for the asset and the demand for the asset in the marketplace. We may sell an asset before the end of the expected holding period if we believe that market conditions and asset positioning have maximized its value to us or the sale of the asset would otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders.

	Real Estate-Related Investment




	As of


	December 31, 2016


	, we owned one fixed-rate mortgage loan. We originally intended to hold our real estate-related investment until maturity. However, economic and market conditions may influence us to hold it for a different period of time. We may sell our mortgage loan before the end of the expected holding period if we believe that market conditions and asset positioning have maximized its value to us or the sale of the asset would otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders.




	The total cost and book value of our real estate-related investment as of


	December 31, 2016


	 were $14.1 million and


	$14.1 million


	, respectively. Our real estate-related investments accounted for 1%, 3% and 5% of our total revenues for the years ended


	December 31, 2016


	,


	2015


	 and


	2014


	, respectively. The annualized effective interest rate on our real estate-related investment was 7.6% as of


	December 31, 2016


	.




	Financing Objectives




	We financed the majority of our real estate and real estate-related investments with a combination of the proceeds we received from our initial public offering and debt. We used debt financing to increase the amount available for investment and to increase overall investment yields to us and our stockholders. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, the weighted-average interest rate on our debt was 2.9%.




	We borrow funds at both fixed and variable rates; as of


	December 31, 2016


	, we had


	$140.0 million


	 and


	$384.3 million


	 of fixed and variable rate debt outstanding, respectively. Of the variable rate debt outstanding, approximately


	$106.6 million


	 was effectively fixed through the use of interest rate swap agreements. The weighted-average interest rates of our fixed rate debt and variable rate debt as of


	December 31, 2016


	 were 3.5% and 2.7%, respectively. The weighted-average interest rate represents the actual interest rate in effect as of


	December 31, 2016


	 (consisting of the contractual interest rate and the effect of interest rate swaps and floors), using interest rate indices as of


	December 31, 2016


	, where applicable.




	The following is a schedule of maturities, including principal amortization payments, for all of our notes payable outstanding as of


	December 31, 2016


	 (in thousands):

	We plan to exercise our extension options available under our loan agreements or pay-off or refinance the related notes payable prior to their maturity dates.




	We limit our total liabilities to 75% of the cost (before deducting depreciation and other noncash reserves) of all of our tangible assets; however, we may exceed that limit if the majority of the conflicts committee approves each borrowing in excess of this limitation and we disclose such borrowings to our stockholders in our next quarterly report with an explanation from the conflicts committee of the justification for the excess borrowing. We did not exceed this limitation on borrowings during any quarter of 2016. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, our borrowings and other liabilities were approximately


	35%


	 of both the cost (before deducting depreciation and other noncash reserves) and book value (before deducting depreciation) of our tangible assets, respectively.




	Market Outlook - Real Estate and Real Estate Finance Markets




	The following discussion is based on management’s beliefs, observations and expectations with respect to the real estate and real estate finance markets.




	Conditions in the global capital markets remain volatile as of the first quarter of 2017. Current economic data and financial market developments suggest that the global economy is improving, although at a slow and uneven pace. European economic growth has recently picked up, whereas the U.K. and China remain areas of concern. Against this backdrop, the central banks of the world’s major industrialized economies are beginning to back away from their strong monetary accommodation. Quantitative easing in Japan and Europe is slowing, but the liquidity generated from these programs continues to impact the global capital markets.








	 8









	Table of Contents









	At a duration of 91 months (as of year-end 2016), the current business cycle, which commenced in June 2009, is the fourth longest in U.S. history, including the post-World War II cycle, which lasted 58 months. In December 2016, the U.S. Federal Reserve (the “FED”) increased interest rates for the second time since the 2008-2009 financial crisis. Expectations are for the rate increases to continue in the wake of ongoing economic growth and some acceleration in inflationary pressures, with the goal of the FED to normalize the level of interest rates. Little in the U.S. macroeconomic data suggests that the economy is growing too rapidly, the primary symptom of trouble ahead for a business cycle. Real gross domestic product (“GDP”) growth has averaged approximately 2% per year over the past two years, and job growth has averaged about 1.7%. Personal income growth has started to pick up and unemployment statistics indicate that labor force conditions are finally showing real improvements.




	The U.S. commercial real estate market continues to benefit from inflows of foreign capital, particularly from China. With a backdrop of global political conflict, and stabilizing international economic conditions, the U.S. dollar has remained a safe haven currency. The volume of available capital that is seeking “core” properties has helped to push the pricing of some assets past prior peaks, making some markets look expensive. Reduced leverage ratios have shifted more risk toward the equity investor. Traditional sources of capital are favoring a “risk-off” approach, where investors’ appetite for risk falls, when valuing investments. Investors acquiring properties are extremely selective, with cap rate compression having spread into secondary markets over the last two years. Commercial real estate returns are increasingly being driven by property income (yield), as opposed to price appreciation through cap rate compression.




	Lenders with long memories remain disciplined in their underwriting of investments. For balance sheet lenders, such as banks and insurance companies, underwriting standards for commercial real estate have been tightened. This has resulted in lower loan-to-value and higher debt coverage ratios. CMBS originations also have been limited as lenders are attempting to adjust to new securitization rules which require issuers to maintain an ongoing equity stake in pooled transactions. These trends have led to increased uncertainty in the level and cost of debt for commercial properties, and in turn has injected some volatility into commercial real estate markets.




	A major factor contributing to the strength of the real estate cycle is the difficulty of securing construction financing. Lack of construction financing is effectively keeping an oversupply of commercial real estate, which is typical late in a real estate cycle, from emerging. Bank regulators and new risk-based capital guidelines have enforced discipline in lending, which has helped reduce new construction.




	Impact on Our Real Estate Investments




	The volatility in the global financial markets continues to cause a level of uncertainty in our outlook for the performance of the U.S. commercial real estate markets. Both the investing and leasing environments are highly competitive. While foreign capital continues to flow into U.S. real estate markets, the uncertainty regarding the political, regulatory and economic environments has introduced uncertainty into the markets. Possible future declines in rental rates, slower or potentially negative net absorption of leased space and expectations of future rental concessions, including free rent to renew tenants early, to retain tenants who are up for renewal or to attract new tenants, may result in decreases in cash flows. Historically low interest rates could help offset some of the impact of these potential decreases in operating cash flow for properties financed with variable rate mortgages; however, interest rates in the United States have started to increase. The FED increased interest rates in the fourth quarter of 2015 and again in December 2016. The real estate and finance markets anticipate further rate increases as long as the economy remains strong. If this trend continues, management will review our debt financing strategies to optimize the cost of our debt exposure.




	Impact on Our Real Estate-Related Investment




	Our real estate loan receivable is directly secured by commercial real estate. As a result, our real estate-related investment, in general, has been and likely will continue to be impacted by the same factors impacting our real estate properties. The higher yields and the improving credit position of many U.S. tenants and borrowers have attracted global capital. However, the real estate and capital markets are fluid, and the positive trends can reverse quickly. Economic conditions remain relatively volatile and can have a negative impact on the performance of collateral securing our loan investment, and therefore may impact the ability of the borrower under our loan to make contractual interest payments to us.




	As of


	December 31, 2016


	, we had a fixed-rate real estate loan receivable with an outstanding principal balance of $14.1 million and a carrying value (including unamortized origination and closing costs) of $14.1 million that matures in 2018.

	Table of Contents









	Impact on Our Financing Activities




	In light of the risks associated with potentially volatile operating cash flows from some of our real estate properties, and the possible increase in the cost of financing due to higher interest rates, we may have difficulty refinancing some of our debt obligations prior to or at maturity or we may not be able to refinance these obligations at terms as favorable as the terms of our existing indebtedness. Short-term interest rates in the United States have increased. Market conditions can change quickly, potentially negatively impacting the value of our investments.




	As of


	December 31, 2016


	, we had debt obligations in the aggregate principal amount of


	$524.3 million


	 with a weighted-average remaining term of 1.2 years. We had a total of


	$140.0 million


	 of fixed rate notes payable and


	$384.3 million


	 of variable rate notes payable as of


	December 31, 2016


	. The interest rates on


	$106.6 million


	 of our variable rate notes payable are effectively fixed through interest rate swap agreements. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, we had a total of $384.3 million of debt obligations scheduled to mature within 12 months of that date. We plan to exercise our extension options available under our loan agreements or pay off or refinance the related notes payable prior to their maturity dates.




	Economic Dependency




	We are dependent on our advisor for certain services that are essential to us, including the management of the daily operations of our real estate and real estate-related investment portfolio; the disposition of real estate and real estate-related investments; and other general and administrative responsibilities. In the event that our advisor is unable to provide any of these services, we will be required to obtain such services from other sources.




	Competitive Market Factors




	The U.S. commercial real estate leasing markets remain competitive. We face competition from various entities for prospective tenants and to retain our current tenants, including other REITs, pension funds, insurance companies, investment funds and companies, partnerships and developers. Many of these entities have substantially greater financial resources than we do and may be able to accept more risk than we can prudently manage, including risks with respect to the creditworthiness of a tenant. As a result of their greater resources, those entities may have more flexibility than we do in their ability to offer rental concessions to attract and retain tenants. This could put pressure on our ability to maintain or raise rents and could adversely affect our ability to attract or retain tenants. As a result, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and ability to pay distributions to our stockholders may be adversely affected.




	We also face competition from many of the types of entities referenced above regarding the disposition of properties. These entities may possess properties in similar locations and/or of the same property types as ours and may be attempting to dispose of these properties at the same time we are attempting to dispose of some of our properties, providing potential purchasers with a larger number of properties from which to choose and potentially decreasing the sales price for such properties. Additionally, these entities may be willing to accept a lower return on their individual investments, which could further reduce the sales price of such properties. This competition could decrease the sales proceeds we receive for properties that we sell, assuming we are able to sell such properties, which could adversely affect our cash flows and the overall return for our stockholders.




	Although we believe that we are well-positioned to compete effectively in each facet of our business, there is enormous competition in our market sector and there can be no assurance that we will compete effectively or that we will not encounter increased competition in the future that could limit our ability to conduct our business effectively.

	Compliance with Federal, State and Local Environmental Law




	Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous real property owner or operator may be liable for the cost of removing or remediating hazardous or toxic substances on, under or in such property. These costs could be substantial. Such laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. Environmental laws also may impose liens on properties or restrictions on the manner in which properties may be used or businesses may be operated, and these restrictions may require substantial expenditures or prevent us from entering into leases with prospective tenants that may be impacted by such laws. Environmental laws provide for sanctions for noncompliance and may be enforced by governmental agencies or, in certain circumstances, by private parties. Certain environmental laws and common law principles could be used to impose liability for the release of and exposure to hazardous substances, including asbestos-containing materials and lead-based paint. Third parties may seek recovery from real property owners or operators for personal injury or property damage associated with exposure to released hazardous substances and governments may seek recovery for natural resource damage. The cost of defending against claims of environmental liability, of complying with environmental regulatory requirements, of remediating any contaminated property, or of paying personal injury, property damage or natural resource damage claims could reduce our cash available for distribution to our stockholders.




	All of our properties were subject to Phase I environmental assessments prior to the time they were acquired. Some of our properties are subject to potential environmental liabilities arising primarily from historic activities at or in the vicinity of the properties. Based on our environmental diligence and assessments of our properties and our purchase of pollution and remediation legal liability insurance with respect to some of our properties, we do not believe that environmental conditions at our properties are likely to have a material adverse effect on our operations.




	Industry Segments




	As of


	December 31, 2016


	, we aggregated our investments into one reportable business segment. We considered both quantitative and qualitative thresholds and determined that our investment in a real estate loan receivable does not constitute a reportable segment. Prior to the reporting period commencing on January 1, 2016, we had identified two reportable business segments based on our investment types: real estate and real estate-related. However, based on our current investment portfolio, we do not believe that our investment in a real estate-related investment is a reportable segment.

	We have no paid employees. The employees of our advisor and its affiliates provide management, disposition, advisory and certain administrative services for us.

	ITEM 1A.






	RISK FACTORS







	The following are some of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those presented in our forward-looking statements. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face but do represent those risks and uncertainties that we believe are material to us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also harm our business.








	Risks Related to an Investment in Us




	Because no public trading market for our shares currently exists, it will be difficult for our stockholders to sell their shares and, if they are able to sell their shares, they will likely sell them at a substantial discount to the public offering price, adjusted for special distributions, and the estimated value per share.




	Our charter does not require our directors to seek stockholder approval to liquidate our assets by a specified date, nor does our charter require our directors to list our shares for trading on a national securities exchange by a specified date. There is no public market for our shares and we currently have no plans to list our shares on a national securities exchange. Until our shares are listed, if ever, our stockholders may not sell their shares unless the buyer meets the applicable suitability and minimum purchase standards. Any sale must comply with applicable state and federal securities laws. Our charter prohibits the ownership of more than 9.8% of our stock by any person, unless exempted by our board of directors, which may inhibit large investors from purchasing our shares.




	On May 15, 2014, our board of directors amended and restated our share redemption program to provide only for redemptions sought in connection with a Special Redemption. Such Special Redemptions are subject to an annual dollar limitation. On December 9, 2016, our board of directors approved an annual dollar limitation of $10.0 million in the aggregate for the calendar year 2017 (subject to review and adjustment during the year by the board of directors), and further subject to the limitations described in the share redemption program.




	We do not currently expect to have funds available for ordinary redemptions in the future. Thus, until further notice, and except with respect to Special Redemptions, stockholders will not be able to sell any of their shares back to us pursuant to our share redemption program. In addition, even if we were to resume ordinary redemptions, our share redemption program includes numerous restrictions that would limit a stockholder’s ability to sell his or her shares. In its sole discretion, our board of directors may amend, suspend or terminate our share redemption program upon 30 days’ notice, provided that we may increase or decrease the funding available for the redemption of shares under the program upon ten business days’ notice to stockholders.




	Therefore, it will be difficult for our stockholders to sell their shares promptly or at all. If a stockholder is able to sell his or her shares, it would likely be at a substantial discount to the price at which we sold the shares in our public offering, adjusted for special distributions, and to the estimated value per share. It is also likely that our shares would not be accepted as the primary collateral for a loan.




	We face significant competition for tenants and in the disposition of our assets, which may limit our ability pay distributions to stockholders or reduce the value of an investment in us.




	We face competition from various entities for prospective tenants and to retain our current tenants, including other REITs, pension funds, insurance companies, investment funds and companies, partnerships and developers. Many of these entities have substantially greater financial resources than we do and may be able to accept more risk than we can prudently manage, including risks with respect to the creditworthiness of a tenant. As a result of their greater resources, those entities may have more flexibility than we do in their ability to offer rental concessions to attract and retain tenants. This could put pressure on our ability to maintain or raise rents and could adversely affect our ability to attract or retain tenants. As a result, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and ability to pay distributions to our stockholders may be adversely affected.




	We also face competition from many of the types of entities referenced above regarding the disposition of properties. These entities may possess properties in similar locations and/or of the same property types as ours and may be attempting to dispose of these properties at the same time we are attempting to dispose of some of our properties, providing potential purchasers with a larger number of properties from which to choose and potentially decreasing the sales price for such properties. Additionally, these entities may be willing to accept a lower return on their individual investments, which could further reduce the sales price of such properties. This competition could decrease the sales proceeds we receive for properties that we sell, assuming we are able to sell such properties, which could adversely affect our cash flows and the overall return for our stockholders.

	Disruptions in the financial markets and uncertain economic conditions could adversely affect market rental rates and commercial real estate values and our ability to refinance or secure debt financing, service future debt obligations, or pay distributions to our stockholders.




	We relied on debt financing to finance our real estate properties and we may have difficulty refinancing some of our debt obligations prior to or at maturity or we may not be able to refinance these obligations at terms as favorable as the terms of our existing indebtedness. We also may be unable to obtain additional debt financing on attractive terms or at all. If we are not able to refinance our existing indebtedness on attractive terms at the various maturity dates, we may be forced to dispose of some of our assets. Volatile market conditions and a challenging global macro-economic environment may interfere with the implementation of our business strategy and/or force us to modify it.




	Disruptions in the financial markets and uncertain economic conditions could adversely affect the values of our investments. Any disruption to the debt and capital markets could result in fewer buyers seeking to acquire commercial properties and possible increases in capitalization rates and lower property values. Furthermore, any decline in economic conditions could negatively impact commercial real estate fundamentals and result in lower occupancy, lower rental rates and declining values in our real estate portfolio and in the collateral securing our loan investment, which could have the following negative effects on us:













	•






	the values of our investments in commercial properties could decrease below the amounts paid for such investments;
















	•






	the value of collateral securing our loan investment could decrease below the outstanding principal amount of the loan;
















	•






	revenues from our properties could decrease due to fewer tenants and/or lower rental rates, making it more difficult for us to pay distributions or meet our debt service obligations on debt financing; and/or
















	•






	revenues generated by the property and other assets underlying our loan investment could decrease, making it more difficult for the borrower to meet its payment obligations to us, which could in turn make it more difficult for us to pay distributions or meet our debt service obligations on debt financing.
















	•






	All of these factors could reduce our stockholders’ return and decrease the value of an investment in us.







	Because we depend upon our advisor and its affiliates to conduct our operations, any adverse changes in the financial health of our advisor or its affiliates or our relationship with them could hinder our operating performance.




	We depend on our advisor to manage our operations and our portfolio of assets. Our advisor depends upon the fees and other compensation that it receives from us, KBS Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc. (“KBS REIT I”), KBS Real Estate Investment Trust III, Inc. (“KBS REIT III”), KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT, Inc. (“KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT”), KBS Legacy Partners Apartment REIT, Inc. (“KBS Legacy Partners Apartment REIT”), KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II, Inc. (“KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II”), KBS Growth & Income REIT, Inc. (“KBS Growth & Income REIT”) and any future KBS-sponsored programs that it advises in connection with the purchase, management and sale of assets to conduct its operations. Any adverse changes to our relationship with, or the financial condition of, our advisor and its affiliates, could hinder their ability to successfully manage our operations and our portfolio of investments.




	To the extent distributions exceed cash flow from operations, a stockholder’s basis in our stock will be reduced and, to the extent distributions exceed a stockholder’s basis, the stockholder may recognize capital gain.




	Our organizational documents permit us, to the extent permitted by Maryland law, to pay distributions from any source.  If we fund distributions from financings or future offerings or sources other than our cash flow from operations, the overall return to our stockholders may be reduced.  To date, we have funded total distributions paid, which includes net cash distributions and distributions reinvested by stockholders, with cash flow from operations, debt financing, proceeds from the payoff or sale of our real estate loans receivable and proceeds from the sales of real estate properties. Other than distributions paid from the sale of assets and the maturity, payoff or settlement of our debt investment, we currently expect that our distributions will generally be paid from cash flow from operations and funds from operations from current or prior periods. If we fund distributions from borrowings, our interest expense and other financing costs, as well as the repayment of such borrowings, will reduce our earnings and cash flow from operations available for distribution in future periods. If we fund distributions from the sale of assets or the maturity, payoff or settlement of our debt investment, this will affect our ability to generate cash flow from operations in future periods.  In addition, to the extent distributions exceed cash flow from operations, a stockholder’s basis in our stock will be reduced and, to the extent distributions exceed a stockholder’s basis, the stockholder may recognize capital gain. There is no limit on the amount of distributions we may fund from sources other than from cash flow from operations. We can give no assurance regarding the timing, amount or source of future distributions. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we paid aggregate distributions of


	$53.4 million


	, all of which were paid in cash.








	 13









	Table of Contents









	Funds from operations and cash flow from operations during the year ended December 31, 2016 were


	$66.4 million


	 and


	$54.4 million


	, respectively.  We funded our total distributions paid with $51.1 million of current period cash flow from operations and $2.3 million of cash on hand. For a reconciliation of funds from operations to net income, see Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Funds from Operations and Modified Funds from Operations.”




	During the year ended December 31, 2016, we sold one office/flex property. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we sold one office property and received the repayment of one of our real estate loans receivable. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we sold 15 real estate properties and received the repayment of three of our real estate loans receivable. As a result, our general and administrative expenses as a percentage of our cash flow from operations has increased and this increase was significant.




	Our real estate properties generate cash flow in the form of rental revenues and tenant reimbursements and our real estate-related investment generates cash flow in the form of interest income. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we disposed of one office/flex property. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we disposed of one office property. Additionally, we received the repayment of one of our real estate loans receivable


	.


	 During the year ended December 31, 2014, we sold 15 real estate properties and received the repayment of three of our real estate loans receivable. As a result, our cash flow from operations has decreased. Our general and administrative expenses are not directly related to the size of our portfolio and thus will not decrease proportionately. As a result, our general and administrative expenses as a percentage of cash flow from operations has increased significantly and, depending on the amount of assets we sell in the future, this increase could become even more significant.




	The loss of or the inability to retain or obtain key real estate and debt finance professionals at our advisor could delay or hinder implementation of our investment management and disposition strategies, which could limit our ability to pay distributions and decrease the value of an investment in our shares.




	Our success depends to a significant degree upon the contributions of Peter M. Bren, Keith D. Hall, Peter McMillan III and Charles J. Schreiber, Jr., each of whom would be difficult to replace. Neither we nor our advisor nor its affiliates have employment agreements with these individuals and they may not remain associated with us, our advisor or its affiliates. If any of these persons were to cease their association with us, our advisor or its affiliates, we may be unable to find suitable replacements and our operating results could suffer as a result. We do not intend to maintain key person life insurance on any person. We believe that our future success depends, in large part, upon our advisor’s and its affiliates’ ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial, operational and marketing professionals. Competition for such professionals is intense, and our advisor and its affiliates may be unsuccessful in attracting and retaining such skilled individuals. Further, we have established strategic relationships with firms that have special expertise in certain services or detailed knowledge regarding real properties in certain geographic regions. Maintaining such relationships will be important for us to effectively compete with other investors for tenants in such regions. We may be unsuccessful in maintaining such relationships. If we lose or are unable to obtain the services of highly skilled professionals or do not establish or maintain appropriate strategic relationships, our ability to implement our investment management and disposition strategies could be delayed or hindered, and the value of our stockholders’ investments may decline.




	Our rights and the rights of our stockholders to recover claims against our independent directors are limited, which could reduce our stockholders’ and our recovery against our independent directors if they negligently cause us to incur losses.




	Maryland law provides that a director has no liability in that capacity if he or she performs his or her duties in good faith, in a manner he or she reasonably believes to be in the company’s best interests and with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances. Our charter provides that none of our independent directors shall be liable to us or our stockholders for monetary damages and that we will generally indemnify them for losses unless they are grossly negligent or engage in willful misconduct. As a result, our stockholders and we may have more limited rights against our independent directors than might otherwise exist under common law, which could reduce our stockholders’ and our recovery from these persons if they act in a negligent manner. In addition, we may be obligated to fund the defense costs incurred by our independent directors (as well as by our other directors, officers, employees (if we ever have employees) and agents) in some cases, which would decrease the cash otherwise available for distribution to our stockholders.

	We face risks associated with security breaches through cyber-attacks, cyber intrusions or otherwise, as well as other significant disruptions of our information technology (IT) networks and related systems.




	We face risks associated with security breaches, whether through cyber-attacks or cyber intrusions over the Internet, malware, computer viruses, attachments to e-mails, persons inside our organization or persons with access to systems inside our organization, and other significant disruptions of our IT networks and related systems. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. Our IT networks and related systems are essential to the operation of our business and our ability to perform day-to-day operations. Although we make efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of IT networks and related systems, and we have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging. Even the most well protected information, networks, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because the techniques used in such attempted security breaches evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are designed not to be detected and, in fact, may not be detected. Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, and thus it is impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk.




	A security breach or other significant disruption involving our IT networks and related systems could:













	•






	disrupt the proper functioning of our networks and systems and therefore our operations;
















	•






	result in misstated financial reports, violations of loan covenants and/or missed reporting deadlines;
















	•






	result in our inability to properly monitor our compliance with the rules and regulations regarding our qualification as a REIT;
















	•






	result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of, proprietary, confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information of ours or others, which others could use to compete against us or which could expose us to damage claims by third-parties for disruptive, destructive or otherwise harmful purposes and outcomes;
















	•






	require significant management attention and resources to remedy any damages that result;
















	•






	subject us to claims for breach of contract, damages, credits, penalties or termination of leases or other agreements; or
















	•






	damage our reputation among our stockholders.







	Any or all of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.




	We can give no assurances regarding any particular transaction in connection with the exploration of strategic alternatives and the marketing of some of our assets for sale.




	Although the Special Committee engaged Evercore to assist us and the Special Committee with the exploration of strategic alternatives for us, we are not obligated to enter into any particular transaction or any transaction at all. Based on the results of this sales effort, the board of directors may conclude that it would be in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders to sell one or more of our assets and, depending on the scope of the proposed asset sales, thereafter to adopt a plan of liquidation that would involve the sale of our remaining assets. Alternatively, based on the results of the initial sales effort, the board of directors may conclude that it would be in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders for us to engage in a limited number of asset sales and continue to operate as a going concern, but with a portfolio that is smaller than the present portfolio. Although we have begun the process of exploring strategic alternatives and intend to market some of our assets for sale, there is no assurance that this process will result in stockholder liquidity, or provide a return to stockholders that equals or exceeds our estimated value per share.

	Risks Related to Conflicts of Interest




	KBS Capital Advisors and its affiliates, including all of our executive officers and some of our directors and other key real estate and debt finance professionals, face conflicts of interest caused by their compensation arrangements with us and with other KBS-sponsored programs, which could result in actions that are not in the long-term best interests of our stockholders.




	All of our executive officers and some of our directors and other key real estate and debt finance professionals are also officers, directors, managers, key professionals and/or holders of a direct or indirect controlling interest in KBS Capital Advisors, our advisor, KBS Capital Markets Group LLC (“KBS Capital Markets Group”), the entity that acted as the dealer manager for our primary offering, and/or other KBS-affiliated entities. KBS Capital Advisors and its affiliates receive substantial fees from us. These fees could influence our advisor’s advice to us as well as the judgment of its affiliates. Among other matters, these compensation arrangements could affect their judgment with respect to:













	•






	the continuation, renewal or enforcement of our agreements with KBS Capital Advisors and its affiliates, including the advisory agreement;
















	•






	public offerings of equity by us, which would entitle KBS Capital Markets Group to dealer-manager fees and would likely entitle KBS Capital Advisors to increased acquisition, origination and asset-management fees;
















	•






	sales of properties and other investments, which entitle KBS Capital Advisors to disposition fees and possible subordinated incentive fees; and
















	•






	whether and when we seek to sell the company or its assets, which sale could entitle KBS Capital Advisors to a subordinated incentive fee and terminate the asset management fee.







	In addition, the fees our advisor receives in connection with the management of our assets are based on the cost of the investment, and not based on the quality of the investment or the quality of the services rendered to us.




	KBS Capital Advisors faces conflicts of interest relating to the leasing and disposition of properties and such conflicts may not be resolved in our favor, which could limit our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders and reduce our stockholders’ overall investment return.




	We and other KBS-sponsored programs and KBS-advised investors rely on our sponsors and other key real estate professionals at our advisor, including Messrs. Bren, Hall, McMillan and Schreiber, to supervise the property management and leasing of properties. If the KBS team of real estate professionals directs creditworthy prospective tenants to properties owned by another KBS-sponsored program or KBS-advised investor when it could direct such tenants to our properties, our tenant base may have more inherent risk and our properties’ occupancy may be lower than might otherwise be the case.




	In addition, we and other KBS-sponsored programs and KBS-advised investors rely on our sponsors and other key real estate professionals at our advisor to sell our properties. These KBS-sponsored programs and KBS-advised investors may possess properties in similar locations and/or of the same property types as ours and may be attempting to sell these properties at the same time we are attempting to sell some of our properties. If our advisor directs potential purchasers to properties owned by another KBS-sponsored program or KBS-advised investor when it could direct such purchasers to our properties, we may be unable to sell some or all of our properties at the time or at the price we otherwise would, which could limit our ability to pay distributions and reduce our stockholders’ overall investment return.

	Our sponsors, our officers, our advisor and the real estate, debt finance, management and accounting professionals assembled by our advisor face competing demands on their time and this may cause our operations and our stockholders’ investment to suffer.




	We rely on our sponsors, our officers, our advisor and the real estate, debt finance, management and accounting professionals that our advisor retains, including Messrs. Bren, Hall, McMillan, Schreiber and Jeffrey K. Waldvogel and Ms. Stacie K. Yamane, to provide services to us for the day-to-day operation of our business. KBS REIT I, KBS REIT III, KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT, KBS Legacy Partners Apartment REIT, KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II and KBS Growth & Income REIT are also advised by KBS Capital Advisors and rely on our sponsors and many of the same real estate, debt finance, management and accounting professionals, as will future KBS–sponsored programs and KBS-advised investors. Further, our officers and directors are also officers and/or directors of some or all of the other public KBS–sponsored programs. Messrs. Bren, Hall, McMillan, Schreiber and Waldvogel and Ms. Yamane are executive officers of KBS REIT I and KBS REIT III. Messrs. Bren, Hall, Schreiber and Waldvogel and Ms. Yamane are also executive officers of KBS Growth & Income REIT. Messrs. Hall, McMillan and Waldvogel and Ms. Yamane are also executive officers of KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT and KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II, and Messrs. Bren, McMillan and Waldvogel and Ms. Yamane are also executive officers of KBS Legacy Partners Apartment REIT. Messrs. Bren and Schreiber and Ms. Yamane are executive officers of KBS Realty Advisors and its affiliates, the advisors of private KBS–sponsored programs and the investment advisors to KBS-advised investors. In addition, KBS Legacy Partners Apartment REIT and KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT have announced that they are exploring strategic alternatives, and KBS REIT I has announced the passage by its stockholders of a plan of complete liquidation and dissolution of KBS REIT I, the pursuit of each of which would create further demands on the time of our advisor’s real estate, debt finance, management and accounting professionals.




	As a result of their interests in other KBS-sponsored programs, their obligations to KBS-advised investors and the fact that they engage in and will continue to engage in other business activities on behalf of themselves and others, Messrs. Bren, Hall, McMillan, Schreiber and Waldvogel and Ms. Yamane face conflicts of interest in allocating their time among us, KBS REIT I, KBS REIT III, KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT, KBS Legacy Partners Apartment REIT, KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II, KBS Growth & Income REIT, KBS Capital Advisors, other KBS-sponsored programs and KBS-advised investors, as well as other business activities in which they are involved. In addition, our advisor and KBS Realty Advisors and their affiliates share many of the same key real estate, management and accounting professionals. During times of intense activity in other programs and ventures, these individuals may devote less time and fewer resources to our business than are necessary or appropriate to manage our business. Furthermore, some or all of these individuals may become employees of another KBS–sponsored program in an internalization transaction or, if we internalize our advisor, may not become our employees as a result of their relationship with other KBS-sponsored programs. If these events occur, the returns on our investments, and the value of our stockholders’ investment, may decline.




	All of our executive officers and some of our directors and the key real estate and debt finance professionals assembled by our advisor face conflicts of interest related to their positions and/or interests in KBS Capital Advisors and its affiliates, which could hinder our ability to implement our business strategy and to generate returns to our stockholders.




	All of our executive officers and some of our directors and the key real estate and debt finance professionals assembled by our advisor are also executive officers, directors, managers, key professionals and/or holders of a direct or indirect controlling interest in our advisor and other KBS-affiliated entities. Through KBS-affiliated entities, some of these persons also serve as the investment advisors to KBS-advised investors and, through KBS Capital Advisors and KBS Realty Advisors, these persons serve as the advisor to KBS REIT I, KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT, KBS Legacy Partners Apartment REIT, KBS REIT III, KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II, KBS Growth & Income REIT and other KBS-sponsored programs. As a result, they owe fiduciary duties to each of these entities, their stockholders, members and limited partners and their investors, which fiduciary duties may from time to time conflict with the fiduciary duties that they owe to us and our stockholders. Their loyalties to these other entities and investors could result in action or inaction that is detrimental to our business, which could harm the implementation of our business strategy and our leasing opportunities. Further, Messrs. Bren, Hall, McMillan and Schreiber and existing and future KBS-sponsored programs and KBS-advised investors generally are not and will not be prohibited from engaging, directly or indirectly, in any business or from possessing interests in any other business venture or ventures, including businesses and ventures involved in the acquisition, development, ownership, leasing or sale of real estate investments. If we do not successfully implement our business strategy, we may be unable to generate the cash needed to pay distributions to our stockholders and to maintain or increase the value of our assets.

	Our board of directors’ loyalties to KBS REIT I, KBS REIT III, KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT, KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II, KBS Growth & Income REIT and possibly to future KBS-sponsored programs could influence its judgment, resulting in actions that may not be in our stockholders’ best interest or that result in a disproportionate benefit to another KBS-sponsored program at our expense.




	All of our directors are also directors of KBS REIT I and KBS REIT III and one of our directors is also a director of KBS Growth & Income REIT. One of our directors is also a director of KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT and KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II. The loyalties of our directors serving on the boards of directors of KBS REIT I, KBS REIT III, KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT, KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II, and KBS Growth & Income REIT or possibly on the boards of directors of future KBS-sponsored programs, may influence the judgment of our board of directors when considering issues for us that also may affect other KBS-sponsored programs, such as the following:













	•






	We could enter into transactions with other KBS-sponsored programs, such as property sales or financing arrangements. Such transactions might entitle our advisor or its affiliates to fees and other compensation from both parties to the transaction. For example, property sales to other KBS-sponsored programs might entitle our advisor or its affiliates to acquisition fees in connection with its services to the purchaser in addition to disposition and other fees that we might pay to our advisor in connection with such transaction. Decisions of our board or the conflicts committee regarding the terms of those transactions may be influenced by our board’s or the conflicts committee’s loyalties to such other KBS-sponsored programs.
















	•






	A decision of the board or the conflicts committee regarding the timing of a debt or equity offering could be influenced by concerns that the offering would compete with offerings of other KBS-sponsored programs.
















	•






	A decision of the board, the conflicts committee or the Special Committee regarding the timing of property sales could be influenced by concerns that the sales would compete with those of other KBS-sponsored programs.







	Because our independent directors are also independent directors of KBS REIT I and KBS REIT III, they receive compensation for service on the board of directors of KBS REIT I and KBS REIT III. Like us, KBS REIT I and KBS REIT III each pays each independent director an annual retainer of $40,000 as well as compensation for attending meetings as follows: (i) $2,500 for each board meeting attended, (ii) $2,500 for each conflicts or audit committee meeting attended (except that the committee chairman is paid $3,000 for each conflicts or audit committee meeting attended), (iii) $2,000 for each teleconference board meeting attended, and (iv) $2,000 for each teleconference conflicts or audit committee meeting attended (except that the committee chairman is paid $3,000 for each teleconference conflicts or audit committee meeting attended). In addition, like us, KBS REIT I also pays each independent director compensation for attending Special Committee meetings as follows: (i) $2,000 for each Special Committee meeting attended (except that the committee chairman is paid $3,000 for each Special Committee meeting attended) and (ii) $2,000 for each teleconference Special Committee meeting attended (except that the committee chairman is paid $3,000 for each teleconference Special Committee meeting attended). In addition, like us, KBS REIT I and KBS REIT III each reimburses directors for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with attendance at meetings of their boards of directors.








	Risks Related to Our Corporate Structure




	Ownership limitations may restrict change of control or business combination opportunities in which our stockholders might receive a premium for their shares.




	In order for us to qualify as a REIT for each taxable year, no more than 50% in value of our outstanding capital stock may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals during the last half of any calendar year. “Individuals” for this purpose include natural persons, and some entities such as private foundations. To preserve our REIT qualification, our charter generally prohibits any person from directly or indirectly owning more than 9.8% in value of our capital stock. This ownership limitation could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a takeover or other transaction including an extraordinary transaction (such as a merger, tender offer or sale of all or substantially all of our assets), in which holders of our common stock might receive a premium for their shares over the then prevailing market price or which holders might believe to be otherwise in their best interests.

	Our charter permits our board of directors to issue stock with terms that may subordinate the rights of our common stockholders or discourage a third party from acquiring us in a manner that could result in a premium price to our stockholders.




	Our board of directors may classify or reclassify any unissued common stock or preferred stock and establish the preferences, conversion or other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends and other distributions, qualifications and terms or conditions of redemption of any such stock. Thus, our board of directors could authorize the issuance of preferred stock with priority as to distributions and amounts payable upon liquidation over the rights of the holders of our common stock. Such preferred stock could also have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us, including an extraordinary transaction (such as a merger, tender offer or sale of all or substantially all of our assets) that might provide a premium price to holders of our common stock.




	Our stockholders’ investment return may be reduced if we are required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act; if we or our subsidiaries become an unregistered investment company, we could not continue our business.




	Neither we nor any of our subsidiaries intend to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. If we or any of our subsidiaries were obligated to register as an investment company, we would have to comply with a variety of substantive requirements under the Investment Company Act that impose, among other things:













	•






	limitations on capital structure;
















	•






	restrictions on specified investments;
















	•






	prohibitions on transactions with affiliates; and
















	•






	compliance with reporting, record keeping, voting, proxy disclosure and other rules and regulations that would significantly increase our operating expenses.







	Under the relevant provisions of Section 3(a)(1) of the Investment Company Act, an investment company is any issuer that:













	•






	pursuant to Section 3(a)(1)(A), is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities (the “primarily engaged test”); or
















	•






	pursuant to Section 3(a)(1)(C), is engaged or proposes to engage in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities and owns or proposes to acquire “investment securities” having a value exceeding 40% of the value of such issuer’s total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis (the “40% test”). “Investment securities” excludes U.S. government securities and securities of majority-owned subsidiaries that are not themselves investment companies and are not relying on the exception from the definition of investment company under Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) (relating to private investment companies).







	We believe neither we nor our Operating Partnership is required to register as an investment company based on the following analysis. With respect to the 40% test, most of the entities through which we and our Operating Partnership own our assets are majority owned subsidiaries that are not themselves investment companies and are not relying on the exceptions from the definition of investment company under Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7).




	With respect to the primarily engaged test, we and our Operating Partnership are holding companies and do not intend to invest or trade in securities ourselves. Rather, through the majority-owned subsidiaries of our Operating Partnership, we and our Operating Partnership are primarily engaged in the non-investment company businesses of these subsidiaries, namely the business of purchasing or otherwise acquiring real estate and real estate-related assets.




	If any of the subsidiaries of our Operating Partnership fail to meet the 40% test, we believe they will usually, if not always, be able to rely on Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act for an exception from the definition of an investment company. (Otherwise, they should be able to rely on the exceptions for private investment companies pursuant to Section 3(c)(1) and Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act.) As reflected in no-action letters, the SEC staff’s position on Section 3(c)(5)(C) generally requires that an issuer maintain at least 55% of its assets in “mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate,” or qualifying assets; at least 80% of its assets in qualifying assets plus real estate-related assets; and no more than 20% of the value of its assets in other than qualifying assets and real estate-related assets, which we refer to as miscellaneous assets. To constitute a qualifying asset under this 55% requirement, a real estate interest must meet various criteria based on no-action letters. We expect that each of the subsidiaries of our Operating Partnership relying on Section 3(c)(5)(C) will invest at least 55% of its assets in qualifying assets, and approximately an additional 25% of its assets in other types of real estate-related assets. If any subsidiary relies on Section 3(c)(5)(C), we expect to rely on guidance published by the SEC staff or on our analyses of guidance published with respect to types of assets to determine which assets are qualifying real estate assets and real estate-related assets.

	To maintain compliance with the Investment Company Act, our subsidiaries may be unable to sell assets we would otherwise want them to sell and may need to sell assets we would otherwise wish them to retain. In addition, our subsidiaries may have to acquire additional assets that they might not otherwise have acquired. Moreover, the SEC or its staff may issue interpretations with respect to various types of assets that are contrary to our views and current SEC staff interpretations are subject to change, which increases the risk of non-compliance and the risk that we may be forced to make adverse changes to our portfolio. If we were required to register as an investment company but failed to do so, we would be prohibited from engaging in our business and criminal and civil actions could be brought against us. In addition, our contracts would be unenforceable unless a court required enforcement and a court could appoint a receiver to take control of us and liquidate our business.




	Rapid changes in the values of our assets may make it more difficult for us to maintain our qualification as a REIT or our exception from the definition of an investment company under the Investment Company Act.




	If the market value or income potential of our qualifying real estate assets changes as compared to the market value or income potential of our non-qualifying assets, or if the market value or income potential of our assets that are considered “real estate-related assets” under the Investment Company Act or REIT qualification tests changes as compared to the market value or income potential of our assets that are not considered “real estate-related assets” under the Investment Company Act or REIT qualification tests, whether as a result of increased interest rates, prepayment rates or other factors, we may need to modify our investment portfolio in order to maintain our REIT qualification or exception from the definition of an investment company. If the decline in asset values or income occurs quickly, this may be especially difficult, if not impossible, to accomplish. This difficulty may be exacerbated by the illiquid nature of many of the assets that we may own. We may have to make investment decisions that we otherwise would not make absent REIT and Investment Company Act considerations.




	Our stockholders will have limited control over changes in our policies and operations, which increases the uncertainty and risks our stockholders face.




	Our board of directors determines our major policies, including our policies regarding financing, debt capitalization, REIT qualification and distributions. Our board of directors may amend or revise these and other policies without a vote of the stockholders. Under Maryland General Corporation Law and our charter, our stockholders have a right to vote only on limited matters. Our board’s broad discretion in setting policies and our stockholders’ inability to exert control over those policies increases the uncertainty and risks our stockholders face.




	Our share redemption program only provides for Special Redemptions. We currently do not expect to have funds available for ordinary redemptions in the future.




	Our share redemption program only provides for Special Redemptions. Such Special Redemptions are subject to an annual dollar limitation. On December 9, 2016, our board of directors approved an annual dollar limitation of $10.0 million in the aggregate for the calendar year 2017 (subject to review and adjustment during the year by the board of directors), and further subject to the limitations described in the share redemption program. Based on historical redemption activity, we believe the $10.0 million redemption limitation for the calendar year 2017 will be sufficient for these Special Redemptions. During each calendar year, the annual dollar limitation for the share redemption program will be reviewed and adjusted from time to time.




	We currently do not expect to have funds available for ordinary redemptions in the future. Thus, until further notice, and except with respect to Special Redemptions, stockholders will not be able to sell any of their shares back to us pursuant to our share redemption program. In addition, even if we were to resume ordinary redemptions, our share redemption program includes numerous restrictions that would limit a stockholder’s ability to sell his or her shares, including that we have no obligation to redeem shares if the redemption would violate the restrictions on distributions under Maryland law, which prohibits distributions that would cause a corporation to fail to meet statutory tests of solvency. In its sole discretion, our board of directors may amend, suspend or terminate our share redemption program upon 30 days’ notice, provided that we may increase or decrease the funding available for the redemption of shares under the program upon ten business days’ notice to stockholders.

	Pursuant to our share redemption program, the redemption price per share for eligible redemptions is equal to the estimated value per share. On December 14, 2016, our board of directors approved an estimated value per share of our common stock of $5.49 (unaudited) based on the estimated value of our assets less the estimated value of our liabilities divided by the number of shares outstanding, all as of September 30, 2016. Therefore, commencing with the December 30, 2016 redemption date, the redemption price for all shares eligible for redemption is $5.49 (unaudited) per share. For a full description of the methodologies and assumptions used to value our assets and liabilities in connection with the calculation of the estimated value per share, see Part II, Item 5, “Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities — Market Information.” The value of our shares will fluctuate over time in response to developments related to individual assets in our portfolio and the management of those assets, in response to the real estate and finance markets and due to other factors. As such, the estimated value per share does not take into account developments in our portfolio since December 14, 2016. We currently expect to utilize our advisor and/or an independent valuation firm to update the estimated value per share no later than December 2017.




	The estimated value per share of our common stock may not reflect the value that stockholders will receive for their investment and does not take into account how developments subsequent to the valuation date related to individual assets, the financial or real estate markets or other events may have increased or decreased the value of our portfolio.




	On December 14, 2016, our board of directors approved an estimated value per share of our common stock of $5.49 (unaudited) based on the estimated value of our assets less the estimated value of our liabilities divided by the number of shares outstanding, all as of September 30, 2016. We provided this estimated value per share to assist broker-dealers that participated in our initial public offering in meeting their customer account statement reporting obligations under National Association of Securities Dealers (“NASD”) Conduct Rule 2340, as required by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”). This valuation was performed in accordance with the provisions of and also to comply with Practice Guideline 2013-01,


	Valuations of Publicly Registered Non-Listed REITs


	, issued by the Investment Program Association (“IPA”) in April 2013 (the “IPA Valuation Guidelines”). The estimated value per share was based on the recommendation and valuation performed by our advisor. We engaged CBRE, Inc. (“CBRE”) an independent, third-party real estate valuation firm, to provide appraisals for our real estate properties.




	As with any valuation methodology, the methodologies used are based upon a number of estimates and assumptions that may not be accurate or complete. Different parties using different assumptions and estimates could derive a different estimated value per share of our common stock, and this difference could be significant. The estimated value per share is not audited and does not represent the fair value of our assets less the fair value of our liabilities according to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), nor does it represent a liquidation value of our assets and liabilities or the price at which our shares of common stock would trade on a national securities exchange. The estimated value per share does not reflect a discount for the fact that we are externally managed, nor does it reflect a real estate portfolio premium/discount versus the sum of the individual property values. The estimated value per share also does not take into account estimated disposition costs and fees for real estate properties that are not under contract to sell, debt prepayment penalties or swap breakage fees that could apply upon the prepayment of certain of our debt obligations or termination of related swap agreements prior to expiration or the impact of restrictions on the assumption of debt. We have generally incurred disposition costs and fees related to the sale of each real estate property since inception of 1.7% to 3.5% of the gross sales price less concessions and credits, with the weighted average being approximately 2.3%.  If this range of disposition costs and fees was applied to our real estate properties, which do not include these costs and fees in the appraised values, the resulting impact on the estimated value per share would be a decrease of $0.14 to $0.28 per share.  Accordingly, with respect to the estimated value per share, we can give no assurance that:













	•






	a stockholder would be able to resell his or her shares at this estimated value per share;
















	•






	a stockholder would ultimately realize distributions per share equal to our estimated value per share upon liquidation of our assets and settlement of our liabilities or a sale of our company;
















	•






	our shares of common stock would trade at the estimated value per share on a national securities exchange;
















	•






	an independent third-party appraiser or other third-party valuation firm would agree with our estimated value per share; or
















	•






	the methodology used to calculate our estimated value per share would be acceptable to FINRA or for compliance with ERISA reporting requirements.







	For a full description of the methodologies and assumptions used to value our assets and liabilities in connection with the calculation of the estimated value per share, see Part II, Item 5, “Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities — Market Information.” We currently expect to utilize our advisor and/or an independent valuation firm to update the estimated value per share no later than December 2017.

	Table of Contents









	In addition, the value of our shares will fluctuate over time in response to developments related to individual assets in our portfolio and the management of those assets, in response to fluctuations in the real estate and finance markets and due to other factors. As such, the estimated value per share does not take into account developments in our portfolio since December 14, 2016, including:













	•






	potential future asset sales at values different from those used in the determination of estimated value per share as well as any impairment charges related to these or other assets as a result of changes in the expected hold period, or the estimated cash flows for or future expenses related to these assets;
















	•






	any impairments we may recognize with respect to our real estate-related investment;
















	•






	any increases or decreases in value of any of our real estate or real estate-related investments;
















	•






	any disruptions in the real estate and financial markets or general economic conditions;
















	•






	any unforeseen capital expenditure requirements;
















	•






	any inability to meet our existing debt service obligations, or to repay or refinance such obligations on attractive terms or at all at or prior to maturity.







	Our stockholders’ interest in us will be diluted if we issue additional shares, which could reduce the overall value of their investment.




	Our common stockholders do not have preemptive rights to any shares we issue in the future. Our charter authorizes us to issue 1,010,000,000 shares of capital stock, of which 1,000,000,000 shares are designated as common stock and 10,000,000 shares are designated as preferred stock. Our board of directors may increase the number of authorized shares of capital stock without stockholder approval. Our board may elect to (i) sell additional shares in future public offerings, (ii) issue equity interests in private offerings, or (iii) issue shares to our advisor, or its successors or assigns, in payment of an outstanding obligation. To the extent we issue additional equity interests, our stockholders’ percentage ownership interest in us will be diluted. In addition, depending upon the terms and pricing of any additional offerings, the use of the proceeds and the value of our real estate investments, our stockholders may also experience dilution in the book value and fair value of their shares and in the earnings and distributions per share.




	Payment of fees to KBS Capital Advisors and its affiliates reduces cash available for distribution to stockholders and increases the risk that our stockholders will not be able to recover the amount of their investment in our shares.




	KBS Capital Advisors and its affiliates performed services for us in connection with the selection and acquisition or origination of our investments, and continue to perform services for us in connection with the management, leasing and disposition of our properties and the management, structuring, administration and disposition of our other investments. We pay them substantial fees for these services, which results in immediate dilution of the value of our stockholders’ investment in us and reduces the amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders.




	We may also pay significant fees during our liquidation stage. Although most of the fees expected to be paid during our liquidation stage are contingent on our stockholders first receiving agreed-upon investment returns, the investment-return thresholds may be reduced with the approval of our conflicts committee and subject to the other limitations in our charter.




	Therefore, these fees increase the risk that the cash available for distribution to common stockholders upon a liquidation of our portfolio would be less than stockholders paid for our shares. These substantial fees and other payments also increase the risk that our stockholders will not be able to resell their shares at a profit.




	If we are unable to obtain funding for future capital needs, cash distributions to our stockholders and the value of our investments could decline.




	When tenants do not renew their leases or otherwise vacate their space, we will often need to expend substantial funds for improvements to the vacated space in order to attract replacement tenants. Even when tenants do renew their leases we may agree to make improvements to their space as part of our negotiations. If we need additional capital in the future to improve or maintain our properties or for any other reason, we may have to obtain funding from sources other than our cash flow from operations, such as borrowings, asset sales or future equity offerings. These sources of funding may not be available on attractive terms or at all. If we cannot procure additional funding for capital improvements, our investments may generate lower cash flow or decline in value, or both, which would limit our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders and could reduce the value of our stockholders’ investment in us.

	Our stockholders may be more likely to sustain a loss on their investment in us because our sponsors do not have as strong an economic incentive to avoid losses as do sponsors who have made significant equity investments in their companies.




	Our sponsors have only invested $200,000 in us through the purchase of 20,000 shares of our common stock at $10.00 per share. Our sponsors will have little exposure to loss in the value of our shares. With this limited exposure, our stockholders may be at a greater risk of loss because our sponsors do not have as much to lose from a decrease in the value of our shares as do those sponsors who make more significant equity investments in their companies.




	Although we are not currently afforded the protection of the Maryland General Corporation Law relating to deterring or defending hostile takeovers, our board of directors could opt into these provisions of Maryland law in the future, which may discourage others from trying to acquire control of us and may prevent our stockholders from receiving a premium price for their stock in connection with a business combination.




	Under Maryland law, “business combinations” between a Maryland corporation and certain interested stockholders or affiliates of interested stockholders are prohibited for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. These business combinations include a merger, consolidation, share exchange or, in circumstances specified in the statute, an asset transfer or issuance or reclassification of equity securities. Also under Maryland law, control shares of a Maryland corporation acquired in a control share acquisition have no voting rights except to the extent approved by a vote of two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. Shares owned by the acquirer, an officer of the corporation or an employee of the corporation who is also a director of the corporation are excluded from the vote on whether to accord voting rights to the control shares. Should our board opt into these provisions of Maryland law, it may discourage others from trying to acquire control of us and increase the difficulty of consummating any offer. Similarly, provisions of Title 3, Subtitle 8 of the Maryland General Corporation Law could provide similar anti-takeover protection.








	General Risks Related to Investments in Real Estate




	Economic, market and regulatory changes that impact the real estate market generally may decrease the value of our investments and weaken our operating results.




	Our operating results and the performance of our properties are subject to the risks typically associated with real estate, any of which could decrease the value of our investments and could weaken our operating results, including:













	•






	downturns in national, regional and local economic conditions;
















	•






	competition from other office buildings;
















	•






	adverse local conditions, such as oversupply or reduction in demand for office buildings and changes in real estate zoning laws that may reduce the desirability of real estate in an area;
















	•






	vacancies, changes in market rental rates and the need to periodically repair, renovate and re-let space;
















	•






	changes in interest rates and the availability of permanent mortgage financing, which may render the sale of a property or loan difficult or unattractive;
















	•






	changes in tax (including real and personal property tax), real estate, environmental and zoning laws;
















	•






	natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes and floods;
















	•






	acts of war or terrorism, including the consequences of terrorist attacks, such as those that occurred on September 11, 2001;
















	•






	the potential for uninsured or underinsured property losses; and
















	•






	periods of high interest rates and tight money supply.







	Any of the above factors, or a combination thereof, could result in a decrease in our cash flow from operations and a decrease in the value of our investments, which would have an adverse effect on our operations, on our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders and on the value of our stockholders’ investment in us.




	If our acquisitions fail to perform as expected, cash distributions to our stockholders may decline.




	Since breaking escrow in June 2008, we made acquisitions of real estate and real estate-related assets based on an underwriting analysis with respect to each asset and how the asset fits into our portfolio. If these assets do not perform as expected we may have less cash flow from operations available to fund distributions and stockholders’ returns may be reduced.

	We acquired the 100 & 200 Campus Drive Buildings on September 9, 2008, the 300-600 Campus Drive Buildings on October 10, 2008, Union Bank Plaza on September 15, 2010 and Corporate Technology Center on March 28, 2013. A significant percentage of our assets is invested in the 100 & 200 Campus Drive Buildings, the 300-600 Campus Drive Buildings, Union Bank Plaza and Corporate Technology Center and the value of our stockholders’ investment in us will fluctuate with the performance of these investments.




	The 100 & 200 Campus Drive Buildings represented


	10.4%


	 of our total assets and represented approximately 7.9% of our total annualized base rent as of December 31, 2016. The 300-600 Campus Drive Buildings represented


	11.7%


	 of our total assets and represented approximately 13.4% of our total annualized base rent as of December 31, 2016. Union Bank Plaza represented approximately


	13.4%


	 of our total assets and represented approximately 16.7% of our total annualized base rent as of December 31, 2016. Corporate Technology Center represented approximately


	15.6%


	 of our total assets and represented approximately 14.2% of our total annualized base rent as of December 31, 2016. As a result, the geographic concentration of our portfolio makes us particularly susceptible to adverse economic developments in the Florham Park, New Jersey, Los Angeles and San Jose real estate markets, respectively. Any adverse economic or real estate developments in these markets, such as business layoffs or downsizing, industry slowdowns, relocations of businesses, changing demographics and other factors, or any decrease in demand for office space resulting from the local business climate, could adversely affect our operating results and our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders.




	Because of the concentration of a significant portion of our assets in two geographic areas, any adverse economic, real estate or business conditions in these areas could affect our operating results and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.




	As of


	December 31, 2016


	, our real estate properties in California and New Jersey represented


	33.8%


	 and


	22.1%


	 of our total assets, respectively. As a result, the geographic concentration of our portfolio makes it particularly susceptible to adverse economic developments in the California and New Jersey real estate markets. Any adverse economic or real estate developments in these markets, such as business layoffs or downsizing, industry slowdowns, relocations of businesses, changing demographics and other factors, or any decrease in demand for office space resulting from the local business climate, could adversely affect our operating results and our ability to pay distributions to stockholders.




	Properties that have significant vacancies could be difficult to sell, which could diminish the return on these properties and adversely affect our cash flow and ability to pay distributions to our stockholders.




	A property may incur vacancies either by the expiration and non-renewal of tenant leases or the continued default of tenants under their leases. If vacancies continue for a long period of time, we may suffer reduced revenues, resulting in less cash available for distribution to our stockholders. In addition, the resale value of the property could be diminished because the market value of a particular property depends principally upon the value of the cash flow generated by the leases associated with that property. Such a reduction in the resale value of a property could also reduce the value of our stockholders’ investment in us.




	We depend on tenants for our revenue generated by our real estate investments and, accordingly, our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders is partially dependent upon the success and economic viability of our tenants and our ability to retain and attract tenants. Non-renewals, terminations or lease defaults could reduce our net income and limit our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders.




	The success of our real estate investments materially depends upon the financial stability of the tenants leasing the properties we own. The inability of a single major tenant or a significant number of smaller tenants to meet their rental obligations would significantly lower our net income. A non-renewal after the expiration of a lease term, termination or default by a tenant on its lease payments to us would cause us to lose the revenue associated with such lease and require us to find an alternative source of revenue to meet mortgage payments and prevent a foreclosure, if the property is subject to a mortgage. In the event of a tenant default or bankruptcy, we may experience delays in enforcing our rights as landlord of a property and may incur substantial costs in protecting our investment and re-leasing the property. Tenants may have the right to terminate their leases upon the occurrence of certain customary events of default and, in other circumstances, may not renew their leases or, because of market conditions, may only be able to renew their leases on terms that are less favorable to us than the terms of their initial leases. When tenants exercise early termination rights, our cash flow and earnings will be adversely affected to the extent that we are unable to generate an equivalent amount of net rental income by leasing the vacated space to new third party tenants.




	Further, some of our properties may be outfitted to suit the particular needs of the tenants. We may have difficulty replacing the tenants of these properties if the outfitted space limits the types of businesses that could lease that space without major renovation. If a tenant does not renew a lease or terminates or defaults on a lease, we may be unable to lease the property for the rent previously received or sell the property without incurring a loss.

	The bankruptcy or insolvency of our tenants or delays by our tenants in making rental payments could seriously harm our operating results and financial condition.




	Any bankruptcy filings by or relating to any of our tenants could bar us from collecting pre-bankruptcy debts from that tenant, unless we receive an order permitting us to do so from the bankruptcy court. A tenant bankruptcy could delay our efforts to collect past due balances under the relevant leases, and could ultimately preclude full collection of these sums. If a lease is rejected by a tenant in bankruptcy, we would have only a general unsecured claim for damages. Any unsecured claim we hold against a bankrupt entity may be paid only to the extent that funds are available and only in the same percentage as is paid to all other holders of unsecured claims. We may recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims, which would harm our financial condition.




	Our inability to sell a property at the time and on the terms we want could limit our ability to pay cash distributions to our stockholders and could reduce the value of our stockholders’ investment in us.




	Many factors that are beyond our control affect the real estate market and could affect our ability to sell properties for the price, on the terms or within the time frame that we desire. These factors include general economic conditions, the availability of financing, interest rates and other factors, including supply and demand. Because real estate investments are relatively illiquid, we have a limited ability to vary our portfolio in response to changes in economic or other conditions. Further, before we can sell a property on the terms we want, it may be necessary to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements. However, we can give no assurance that we will have the funds available to correct such defects or to make such improvements. We may be unable to sell our properties at a profit. Our inability to sell properties at the time and on the terms we want could reduce our cash flow, limit our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders and reduce the value of our stockholders’ investment in us.




	Costs imposed pursuant to laws and governmental regulations may reduce our net income and our cash available for distribution to our stockholders.




	Real property and the operations conducted on real property are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment and human health. We could be subject to liability in the form of fines, penalties or damages for noncompliance with these laws and regulations. These laws and regulations generally govern wastewater discharges, air emissions, the operation and removal of underground and above-ground storage tanks, the use, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of solid and hazardous materials, the remediation of contamination associated with the release or disposal of solid and hazardous materials, the presence of toxic building materials and other health and safety-related concerns.




	Some of these laws and regulations may impose joint and several liability on the tenants, owners or operators of real property for the costs to investigate or remediate contaminated properties, regardless of fault, whether the contamination occurred prior to purchase, or whether the acts causing the contamination were legal. Our tenants’ operations, the condition of properties at the time we buy them, operations in the vicinity of our properties, such as the presence of underground storage tanks, or activities of unrelated third parties may affect our properties.




	The presence of hazardous substances, or the failure to properly manage or remediate these substances, may hinder our ability to sell, rent or pledge such property as collateral for future borrowings. Any material expenditures, fines, penalties or damages we must pay will reduce our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders and may reduce the value of our stockholders’ investment.

	The costs of defending against claims of environmental liability, of complying with environmental regulatory requirements, of remediating any contaminated property, or of paying personal injury or other damage claims could reduce our cash available for distribution to our stockholders.




	Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous real property owner or operator may be liable for the cost of removing or remediating hazardous or toxic substances on, under or in such property. These costs could be substantial. Such laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. Environmental laws also may impose liens on property or restrictions on the manner in which property may be used or businesses may be operated, and these restrictions may require substantial expenditures or prevent us from entering into leases with prospective tenants that may be impacted by such laws. Environmental laws provide for sanctions for noncompliance and may be enforced by governmental agencies or, in certain circumstances, by private parties. Certain environmental laws and common law principles could be used to impose liability for the release of and exposure to hazardous substances, including asbestos-containing materials and lead-based paint. Third parties may seek recovery from real property owners or operators for personal injury or property damage associated with exposure to released hazardous substances and governments may seek recovery for natural resource damage. The costs of defending against claims of environmental liability, of complying with environmental regulatory requirements, of remediating any contaminated property, or of paying personal injury, property damage or natural resource damage claims could reduce our cash available for distribution to our stockholders. All of our properties were subject to Phase I environmental assessments prior to the time they were acquired.




	Costs associated with complying with the Americans with Disabilities Act may decrease our cash available for distribution.




	Our properties may be subject to the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended (the “Disabilities Act”). Under the Disabilities Act, all places of public accommodation are required to comply with federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. The Disabilities Act has separate compliance requirements for “public accommodations” and “commercial facilities” that generally require that buildings and services be made accessible and available to people with disabilities. The Disabilities Act’s requirements could require removal of access barriers and could result in the imposition of injunctive relief, monetary penalties or, in some cases, an award of damages. Any funds used for Disabilities Act compliance will reduce our net income and the amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders.




	Uninsured losses relating to real property or excessively expensive premiums for insurance coverage could reduce our cash flow from operations and the return on our stockholders’ investment in us.




	There are types of losses, generally catastrophic in nature, such as losses due to wars, acts of terrorism, earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, pollution or environmental matters, that are uninsurable or not economically insurable, or may be insured subject to limitations, such as large deductibles or co-payments. Insurance risks associated with potential acts of terrorism could sharply increase the premiums we pay for coverage against property and casualty claims. Additionally, mortgage lenders in some cases have begun to insist that commercial property owners purchase coverage against terrorism as a condition to providing mortgage loans. Such insurance policies may not be available at reasonable costs, if at all, which could inhibit our ability to finance or refinance our properties. In such instances, we may be required to provide other financial support, either through financial assurances or self-insurance, to cover potential losses. We may not have adequate coverage for such losses. If any of our properties incurs a casualty loss that is not fully insured, the value of our assets will be reduced by any such uninsured loss, which will reduce the value of our stockholders’ investment. In addition, other than any working capital reserve or other reserves we may establish, we have limited sources of funding to repair or reconstruct any uninsured property. Also, to the extent we must pay unexpectedly large amounts for insurance, we could suffer reduced earnings that would result in lower distributions to our stockholders.




	Terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may affect the markets in which we operate, which could delay or hinder our ability to meet our investment objectives and reduce our stockholders’ overall return.






	Terrorist attacks or armed conflicts may directly impact the value of our properties through damage, destruction, loss or increased security costs. We have invested in major metropolitan markets. We may not be able to obtain insurance against the risk of terrorism because it may not be available or may not be available on terms that are economically feasible. The terrorism insurance that we obtain may not be sufficient to cover loss for damages to our properties as a result of terrorist attacks. The inability to obtain sufficient terrorism insurance or any terrorism insurance at all could limit our refinancing options as some mortgage lenders have begun to insist that specific coverage against terrorism be purchased by commercial owners as a condition of providing loans.

	Risks Related to Real Estate-Related Investments




	Our real estate-related investment is and will be subject to the risks typically associated with real estate.




	Our mortgage loan investment is secured by a lien on real property that, upon the occurrence of a default on the loan, could result in our taking ownership of the property. The value of this property may have changed since we originated the loan and if it has dropped, our risk will increase because of the lower value of the security associated with the loan. In this manner, real estate values could impact the value of our loan investment. Therefore, our real estate-related investment is subject to the risks typically associated with real estate, which are described above under the heading “—General Risks Related to Investments in Real Estate.”




	Our mortgage loan investment is and will be subject to interest rate fluctuations that affect our return as compared to market interest rates; accordingly, the value of our stockholders’ investment in us is subject to fluctuations in interest rates.




	With respect to our fixed rate, long-term loan receivable, if interest rates rise, the loan could yield a return that is lower than then-current market rates. If interest rates decrease, we will be adversely affected to the extent that the loan is prepaid because we would no longer receive the revenue generated by the loan. For this reason, our return on this loan and the value of our stockholders’ investment in us are and will be subject to fluctuations in interest rates.




	Our mortgage loan investment is subject to delinquency, foreclosure and loss, which could result in losses to us.




	Commercial real estate loans are secured by commercial real estate properties that are subject to risks of delinquency and foreclosure. The ability of a borrower to repay a loan secured by an income-producing property typically is dependent primarily upon the successful operation of such property rather than upon the existence of independent income or assets of the borrower. If the net operating income of the property is reduced, the borrower’s ability to repay the loan may be impaired. Net operating income of an income-producing property can be affected by, among other things: tenant mix, success of tenant businesses, occupancy rates, property management decisions, property location and condition, competition from comparable types of properties, changes in laws that increase operating expenses or limit rents that may be charged, any need to address environmental contamination at the property, the occurrence of any uninsured casualty at the property, changes in national, regional or local economic conditions and/or specific industry segments, declines in regional or local real estate values, declines in regional or local rental or occupancy rates, increases in interest rates, real estate tax rates and other operating expenses, changes in governmental rules, fiscal policies and regulations (including environmental legislation), natural disasters, terrorism, social unrest and civil disturbances.




	In the event of any default under our mortgage loan, we will bear a risk of loss of principal and accrued interest to the extent of any deficiency between the value of the collateral and the principal and accrued interest of the mortgage loan, which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow from operations. Foreclosure on a property securing a mortgage loan can be an expensive and lengthy process that could have a substantial negative effect on our anticipated return on the investment. In the event of the bankruptcy of our mortgage loan borrower, the mortgage loan will be deemed to be secured only to the extent of the value of the underlying collateral at the time of bankruptcy (as determined by the bankruptcy court), and the lien securing the mortgage loan will be subject to the avoidance powers of the bankruptcy trustee or debtor-in-possession to the extent the lien is unenforceable under state law.




	In addition, if there is a default under our mortgage loan, we may not be able to repossess and sell the underlying property quickly. The resulting time delay could reduce the value of our investment in the defaulted mortgage loan. An action to foreclose on a property securing a mortgage loan is regulated by state statutes and regulations and is subject to many of the delays and expenses of other lawsuits if the borrower raises defenses or counterclaims. In the event of default by a borrower, these restrictions, among other things, may impede our ability to foreclose on or sell the mortgaged property or to obtain proceeds sufficient to repay all amounts due to us on the mortgage loan.




	Our real estate loan investment is illiquid and we may not be able to adjust this portion of our portfolio in response to changes in economic and other conditions.




	Our real estate loan investment is illiquid. As a result, our ability to vary this portion of our portfolio in response to changes in economic and other conditions may be relatively limited.

	We depend on the borrower for the revenue generated by our real estate-related investment and, accordingly, our revenue and our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders are partially dependent upon the success and economic viability of such borrower.




	The success of our real estate-related investment materially depends on the financial stability of the borrower under the investment. The inability of the borrower to meet its payment obligations could result in reduced revenue or losses for us. In the event of the default or bankruptcy of the borrower, we may experience delays in enforcing our rights as a creditor, and such rights may be subordinated to the rights of other creditors. These events could negatively affect the cash available for distribution to our stockholders and the value of their investment in us.




	Hedging against interest rate exposure may adversely affect our earnings, limit our gains or result in losses, which could adversely affect cash available for distribution to our stockholders.




	We have entered and in the future may enter into interest rate swap agreements or pursue other interest rate hedging strategies. Our hedging activity will vary in scope based on the level of interest rates, the type of investments we hold at the relevant time and other changing market conditions. Interest rate hedging may fail to protect or could adversely affect us because, among other things:













	•






	interest rate hedging can be expensive, particularly during periods of rising and volatile interest rates;
















	•






	available interest rate hedging may not correspond directly with the interest rate risk for which protection is sought;
















	•






	the duration of the hedge products may not match the duration of the related liability or asset;
















	•






	the amount of income that a REIT may earn from hedging transactions to offset losses due to fluctuations in interest rates is limited by federal tax provisions governing REITs;
















	•






	the credit quality of the party owing money on the hedge may be downgraded to such an extent that it impairs our ability to sell or assign our side of the hedging transaction;
















	•






	the party owing money in the hedging transaction may default on its obligation to pay; and
















	•






	we may purchase a hedge that turns out not to be necessary, i.e., a hedge that is out of the money.







	Any hedging activity we engage in may adversely affect our earnings, which could adversely affect cash available for distribution to our stockholders. Therefore, while we may enter into such transactions to seek to reduce interest rate risks, unanticipated changes in interest rates may result in poorer overall investment performance than if we had not engaged in any such hedging transactions. In addition, the degree of correlation between price movements of the instruments used in a hedging strategy and price movements in the investments being hedged or liabilities being hedged may vary materially. Moreover, for a variety of reasons, we may not seek to establish a perfect correlation between such hedging instruments and the interest rate risk sought to be hedged. Any such imperfect correlation may prevent us from achieving the intended accounting treatment and may expose us to risk of loss.




	We assume the credit risk of our counterparties with respect to derivative transactions.




	We enter into derivative contracts for risk management purposes to hedge our exposure to cash flow variability caused by changing interest rates on our variable rate notes payable. These derivative contracts generally are entered into with bank counterparties and are not traded on an organized exchange or guaranteed by a central clearing organization. We would therefore assume the credit risk that our counterparties will fail to make periodic payments when due under these contracts or become insolvent. If a counterparty fails to make a required payment, becomes the subject of a bankruptcy case, or otherwise defaults under the applicable contract, we would have the right to terminate all outstanding derivative transactions with that counterparty and settle them based on their net market value or replacement cost. In such an event, we may be required to make a termination payment to the counterparty, or we may have the right to collect a termination payment from such counterparty. We assume the credit risk that the counterparty will not be able to make any termination payment owing to us. We may not receive any collateral from a counterparty, or we may receive collateral that is insufficient to satisfy the counterparty’s obligation to make a termination payment. If a counterparty is the subject of a bankruptcy case, we will be an unsecured creditor in such case unless the counterparty has pledged sufficient collateral to us to satisfy the counterparty’s obligations to us.




	We assume the risk that our derivative counterparty may terminate transactions early.




	If we fail to make a required payment or otherwise default under the terms of a derivative contract, the counterparty would have the right to terminate all outstanding derivative transactions between us and that counterparty and settle them based on their net market value or replacement cost. In certain circumstances, the counterparty may have the right to terminate derivative transactions early even if we are not defaulting. If our derivative transactions are terminated early, it may not be possible for us to replace those transactions with another counterparty, on as favorable terms or at all.








	 28









	Table of Contents









	We may be required to collateralize our derivative transactions.




	We may be required to secure our obligations to our counterparties under our derivative contracts by pledging collateral to our counterparties. That collateral may be in the form of cash, securities or other assets. If we default under a derivative contract with a counterparty, or if a counterparty otherwise terminates one or more derivative contracts early, that counterparty may apply such collateral toward our obligation to make a termination payment to the counterparty. If we have pledged securities or other assets, the counterparty may liquidate those assets in order to satisfy our obligations. If we are required to post cash or securities as collateral, such cash or securities will not be available for use in our business. Cash or securities pledged to counterparties may be repledged by counterparties and may not be held in segregated accounts. Therefore, in the event of a counterparty insolvency, we may not be entitled to recover some or all collateral pledged to that counterparty, which could result in losses and have an adverse effect on our operations.




	There can be no assurance that the direct or indirect effects of the Dodd-Frank Act and other applicable non-US regulations will not have an adverse effect on our interest rate hedging activities.




	Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) imposed additional regulations on derivatives markets and transactions. Such regulations and, to the extent we trade with counterparties organized in non-US jurisdictions, any applicable regulations in those jurisdictions, are still being implemented, and will affect our interest rate hedging activities. While the full impact of regulation on our interest rate hedging activities cannot be fully assessed until all final rules and regulations are implemented, such regulation may affect our ability to enter into hedging or other risk management transactions, may increase our costs in entering into such transactions, and/or may result in us entering into such transactions on less favorable terms than prior to implementation of such regulation. For example, but not by way of limitation, the Dodd-Frank Act and the rule making thereunder provides for significantly increased regulation of the derivative transactions used to affect our interest rate hedging activities, including: (i) regulatory reporting, (ii) subject to an exemption for end-users of swaps upon which we and our subsidiaries generally rely, mandated clearing of certain derivatives transactions through central counterparties and execution on regulated exchanges or execution facilities and, (iii) to the extent we are required to clear any such transactions, margin and collateral requirements. The imposition, or the failure to comply with, any of the foregoing requirements may have an adverse effect on our business and our stockholders’ return.




	Declines in the market values of our investments may adversely affect periodic reported results of operations and credit availability, which may reduce earnings and, in turn, cash available for distribution to our stockholders.




	A decline in the market value of our assets may adversely affect us, particularly in instances where we have borrowed money based on the market value of those assets. If the market value of those assets declines, the lender may require us to post additional collateral to support the loan. If we were unable to post the additional collateral, we may have to sell assets at a time when we might not otherwise have chosen to do so. A reduction in available credit may reduce our earnings and, in turn, cash available for distribution to stockholders.




	Further, credit facility providers may require us to maintain a certain amount of cash reserves or to set aside unleveraged assets sufficient to maintain a specified liquidity position, which would allow us to satisfy our collateral obligations. As a result, if the market value of our investments declines, we may not be able to leverage our assets as fully as we would choose, which could reduce our return on equity. In the event that we are unable to meet these contractual obligations, our financial condition could deteriorate rapidly.




	The market value of our real estate-related investment may decline for a number of reasons, such as changes in prevailing market rates, a default related to the underlying collateral and widening of credit spreads.




	Our investments in derivatives are carried at estimated fair value as determined by us and, as a result, there may be uncertainty as to the value of these instruments.




	Our investments in derivatives are recorded at fair value but have limited liquidity and are not publicly traded. The fair value of our derivatives may not be readily determinable. We will estimate the fair value of any such investments on a quarterly basis. Because such valuations are inherently uncertain, may fluctuate over short periods of time and may be based on numerous estimates, our determinations of fair value may differ materially from the values that would have been used if a ready market for these investments existed. The value of our common stock could be adversely affected if our determinations regarding the fair value of these investments are materially higher than the values that we ultimately realize upon their disposal or maturity.

	Risks Associated with Debt Financing




	We obtain mortgage indebtedness, lines of credit and other borrowings, which increases our risk of loss due to potential foreclosure.




	We obtain lines of credit and long-term financing secured by our properties and other assets. We have acquired many of our real properties by financing a portion of the price of the properties and mortgaging or pledging some or all of the properties purchased as security for that debt. We may also incur mortgage debt on properties that we already own in order to fund property improvements and other capital expenditures, to pay distributions and for other purposes. In addition, we may borrow as necessary or advisable to ensure that we maintain our qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, including borrowings to satisfy the REIT requirement that we distribute at least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income to our stockholders (computed without regard to the dividends-paid deduction and excluding net capital gain). However, we can give our stockholders no assurance that we will be able to obtain such borrowings on satisfactory terms or at all.




	If there is a shortfall between the cash flow generated by a mortgaged property and the cash flow needed to service mortgage debt on that property, then the amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders may be reduced. In addition, incurring mortgage debt increases the risk of loss of a property since defaults on indebtedness secured by a property may result in lenders initiating foreclosure actions. In that case, we could lose the property securing the loan that is in default, reducing the value of our stockholders’ investment. For tax purposes, a foreclosure of any of our properties would be treated as a sale of the property for a purchase price equal to the outstanding balance of the debt secured by the mortgage. If the outstanding balance of the debt secured by the mortgage exceeds our tax basis in the property, we would recognize taxable income on foreclosure even though we would not necessarily receive any cash proceeds. We have given and may give full or partial guarantees to lenders of mortgage or other debt on behalf of the entities that own our properties. When we give a guaranty on behalf of an entity that owns one of our properties, we will be responsible to the lender for satisfaction of all or a part of the debt or other amounts related to the debt if it is not paid by such entity. If any mortgages contain cross-collateralization or cross-default provisions, a default on a mortgage secured by a single property could affect mortgages secured by other properties.




	High mortgage rates or changes in underwriting standards may make it difficult for us to refinance properties, which could reduce our cash flow from operations and the amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders.




	We may be unable to refinance part or all of the property subject to the mortgage debt when it becomes due or of being unable to refinance on favorable terms. If interest rates are higher when we refinance properties, our income could be reduced. We may be unable to refinance or may only be able to partly refinance properties if underwriting standards, including loan to value ratios and yield requirements, among other requirements, are more strict than when we originally financed the properties. If any of these events occurs, our cash flow could be reduced and/or we might have to pay down existing mortgages. This, in turn, would reduce cash available for distribution to our stockholders, could cause us to require additional capital and may hinder our ability to raise capital by issuing more stock or by borrowing more money.




	Lenders may require us to enter into restrictive covenants relating to our operations, which could limit our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders.




	When providing financing, a lender may impose restrictions on us that affect our distribution and operating policies and our ability to incur additional debt. Loan agreements into which we enter may contain covenants that limit our ability to further mortgage a property or that prohibit us from discontinuing insurance coverage or replacing our advisor. These or other limitations would decrease our operating flexibility and our ability to achieve our operating objectives and limit our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders.




	Increases in interest rates would increase the amount of our debt payments and limit our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders.




	We have incurred variable rate debt and we may incur additional debt or refinance existing debt in the future. Increases in interest rates will increase the cost of that debt, which could reduce our cash flow from operations and the cash we have available for distribution to our stockholders. In addition, if we need to repay existing debt during periods of rising interest rates, we could be required to liquidate one or more of our investments at times that may not permit realization of the maximum return on such investments.

	We have broad authority to incur debt and high debt levels could hinder our ability to pay distributions and decrease the value of our stockholders’ investment.




	We limit our total liabilities to 75% of the cost (before deducting depreciation and other noncash reserves) of our tangible assets; however, we may exceed this limit if the majority of the conflicts committee approves each borrowing in excess of this limitation and we disclose such borrowings to our stockholders in our next quarterly report with an explanation from the conflicts committee of the justification for the excess borrowing. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, our borrowings and other liabilities were approximately


	35%


	 of both the cost (before deducting depreciation and other noncash reserves) and book value (before deducting depreciation) of our tangible assets, respectively. High debt levels would cause us to incur higher interest charges and higher debt service payments and may also be accompanied by restrictive covenants. These factors could limit the amount of cash we have available to distribute to our stockholders and could result in a decline in the value of our stockholders’ investment in us.








	Federal Income Tax Risks




	Failure to qualify as a REIT would reduce our net earnings available for distribution.




	Our qualification as a REIT will depend upon our ability to meet requirements regarding our organization and ownership, distributions of our income, the nature and diversification of our income and assets and other tests imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. If we fail to qualify as a REIT for any taxable year after electing REIT status, we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at corporate rates. In addition, we would generally be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year in which we lost our REIT status. Losing our REIT status would reduce our net earnings available for distribution to stockholders because of the additional tax liability. In addition, distributions to stockholders would no longer qualify for the dividends-paid deduction and we would no longer be required to pay distributions. If this occurs, we might be required to borrow funds or liquidate some investments in order to pay the applicable tax.




	Failure to qualify as a REIT would subject us to federal income tax, which would reduce the cash available for distribution to our stockholders.




	We believe that we have operated and will continue to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes commencing with the taxable year ended December 31, 2008. However, the federal income tax laws governing REITs are extremely complex, and interpretations of the federal income tax laws governing qualification as a REIT are limited. Qualifying as a REIT requires us to meet various tests regarding the nature of our assets and our income, the ownership of our outstanding stock, and the amount of our distributions on an ongoing basis. Accordingly, we cannot be certain that we will be successful in operating so we can remain qualified as a REIT. While we intend to continue to operate so that we will qualify as a REIT, given the highly complex nature of the rules governing REITs, the ongoing importance of factual determinations, including the tax treatment of certain investments we may make, and the possibility of future changes in our circumstances, no assurance can be given that we will so qualify for any particular year. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any calendar year and we do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, we would be required to pay federal income tax on our taxable income. We might need to borrow money or sell assets to pay that tax. Our payment of income tax would decrease the amount of our income available for distribution to our stockholders. Furthermore, if we fail to maintain our qualification as a REIT and we do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, we no longer would be required to distribute substantially all of our REIT taxable income to our stockholders. Unless our failure to qualify as a REIT were excused under federal tax laws, we would be disqualified from taxation as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost.

	Even if we qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we may be subject to federal, state, local or other tax liabilities that reduce our cash flow and our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders.




	Even if we qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we may be subject to some federal, state and local taxes on our income or property. For example:













	•






	In order to qualify as a REIT, we must distribute annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income to our stockholders (which is determined without regard to the dividends-paid deduction or net capital gain). To the extent that we satisfy the distribution requirement but distribute less than 100% of our REIT taxable income, we will be subject to federal corporate income tax on the undistributed income.
















	•






	We will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on the amount, if any, by which distributions we pay in any calendar year are less than the sum of 85% of our ordinary income, 95% of our capital gain net income and 100% of our undistributed income from prior years.
















	•






	If we elect to treat property that we acquire in connection with a foreclosure of a mortgage loan or certain leasehold terminations as “foreclosure property,” we may avoid the 100% tax on the gain from a resale of that property, but the income from the sale or operation of that property may be subject to corporate income tax at the highest applicable rate.
















	•






	If we sell an asset, other than foreclosure property, that we hold primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business, our gain would be subject to the 100% “prohibited transaction” tax unless such sale were made by one of our taxable REIT subsidiaries.







	REIT distribution requirements could adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan.




	We generally must distribute annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, subject to certain adjustments and excluding any net capital gain, in order for federal corporate income tax not to apply to earnings that we distribute. To the extent that we satisfy this distribution requirement, but distribute less than 100% of our REIT taxable income, we will be subject to federal corporate income tax on our undistributed REIT taxable income. In addition, we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that we pay out to our stockholders in a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under federal tax laws. We also may decide to retain net capital gain we earn from the sale or other disposition of our property and pay U.S. federal income tax directly on such income. In that event, our stockholders would be treated as if they earned that income and paid the tax on it directly. However, stockholders that are tax-exempt, such as charities or qualified pension plans, would have no benefit from their deemed payment of such tax liability unless they file U.S. federal income tax returns and thereon seek a refund of such tax. We also will be subject to corporate tax on any undistributed taxable income. We intend to pay distributions to our stockholders to comply with the REIT requirements of the Internal Revenue Code.




	From time to time, we may generate taxable income greater than our income for financial reporting purposes, or our taxable income may be greater than our cash flow available for distribution to stockholders (for example, where a borrower defers the payment of interest in cash pursuant to a contractual right or otherwise). If we do not have other funds available in these situations we could be required to borrow funds, sell investments at disadvantageous prices or find another alternative source of funds to pay distributions sufficient to enable us to pay out enough of our taxable income to satisfy the REIT distribution requirements and to avoid corporate income tax and the 4% excise tax in a particular year. These alternatives could increase our costs or reduce our equity. Thus, compliance with the REIT requirements may hinder our ability to operate solely on the basis of maximizing profits.




	To maintain our REIT status, we may be forced to forego otherwise attractive business opportunities, which may delay or hinder our ability to meet our investment objectives and reduce our stockholders’ overall return.




	To qualify as a REIT, we must satisfy certain tests on an ongoing basis concerning, among other things, the sources of our income, nature of our assets and the amounts we distribute to our stockholders. We may be required to pay distributions to stockholders at times when it would be more advantageous to reinvest cash in our business or when we do not have funds readily available for distribution. Compliance with the REIT requirements may hinder our ability to operate solely on the basis of maximizing profits and reduce the value of our stockholders’ investment.

	If our operating partnership fails to maintain its status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, its income would be subject to taxation and our REIT status would be terminated.




	We intend to maintain the status of our operating partnership as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. However, if the IRS were to successfully challenge the status of our operating partnership as a partnership, it would be taxable as a corporation. In such event, this would reduce the amount of distributions that our operating partnership could make to us. This would also result in our losing REIT status and becoming subject to a corporate level tax on our own income. This would substantially reduce our cash available to pay distributions and the return on your investment. In addition, if any of the entities through which our operating partnership owns its properties, in whole or in part, loses its characterization as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, the underlying entity would become subject to taxation as a corporation, thereby reducing distributions to our operating partnership and jeopardizing our ability to maintain REIT status.




	Potential characterization of distributions or gain on sale may be treated as unrelated business taxable income to tax-exempt investors.




	If (i) all or a portion of our assets are subject to the rules relating to taxable mortgage pools, (ii) we are a “pension-held REIT,” (iii) a tax-exempt stockholder has incurred debt to purchase or hold our common stock, or (iv) the residual Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduit interests, or REMICs, we buy (if any) generate “excess inclusion income,” then a portion of the distributions to and, in the case of a stockholder described in clause (iii), gains realized on the sale of common stock by such tax-exempt stockholder may be subject to federal income tax as unrelated business taxable income under the Internal Revenue Code.




	The tax on prohibited transactions will limit our ability to engage in transactions that would be treated as sales for federal income tax purposes.




	A REIT’s net income from prohibited transactions is subject to a 100% tax. In general, prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of assets, other than foreclosure property, deemed held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business. We might be subject to this tax if we were to dispose of loans in a manner that was treated as a sale of the loans for federal income tax purposes. Therefore, in order to avoid the prohibited transactions tax, we may choose not to engage in certain sales of loans at the REIT level, even though the sales might otherwise be beneficial to us.




	It may be possible to reduce the impact of the prohibited transaction tax by conducting certain activities through taxable REIT subsidiaries. However, to the extent that we engage in such activities through taxable REIT subsidiaries, the income associated with such activities may be subject to full corporate income tax.




	Complying with REIT requirements may force us to liquidate otherwise attractive investments.




	To qualify as a REIT, we must ensure that at the end of each calendar quarter, at least 75% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash items, government securities and qualified REIT real estate assets, including certain mortgage loans and residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities. The remainder of our investment in securities (other than government securities and qualified real estate assets) generally cannot include more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer or more than 10% of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer. In addition, in general, no more than 5% of the value of our assets (other than government securities and qualified real estate assets) can consist of the securities of any one issuer, and no more than 25% (20% for taxable years after 2017) of the value of our total assets can be represented by securities of one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries. If we fail to comply with these requirements at the end of any calendar quarter, we must correct the failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing our REIT qualification and suffering adverse tax consequences. As a result, we may be required to liquidate from our portfolio otherwise attractive investments. These actions could have the effect of reducing our income and amounts available for distribution to our stockholders.




	Liquidation of assets may jeopardize our REIT qualification.




	To qualify as a REIT, we must comply with requirements regarding our assets and our sources of income. If we are compelled to liquidate our investments to repay obligations to our lenders, we may be unable to comply with these requirements, ultimately jeopardizing our qualification as a REIT, or we may be subject to a 100% tax on any resultant gain if we sell assets that are treated as dealer property or inventory.

	Complying with REIT requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively.




	The REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code may limit our ability to hedge our assets and operations. Under these provisions, any income that we generate from transactions intended to hedge our interest rate, inflation and/or currency risks will be excluded from gross income for purposes of the REIT 75% and 95% gross income tests if the purpose of the instrument is to (i) hedge interest rate risk on liabilities incurred to carry or acquire real estate, (ii) hedge risk of currency fluctuations with respect to any item of income or gain that would be qualifying income under the REIT 75% or 95% gross income tests or (iii) manage risk with respect to the termination of certain prior hedging transactions described in (i) and/or (ii) above and, in each case, such instrument is properly identified under applicable Treasury Regulations. Income from hedging transactions that do not meet these requirements will generally constitute nonqualifying income for purposes of both the REIT 75% and 95% gross income tests. As a result of these rules, we may have to limit our use of hedging techniques that might otherwise be advantageous, which could result in greater risks associated with interest rate or other changes than we would otherwise incur.




	The ability of our board of directors to revoke our REIT qualification without stockholder approval may subject us to U.S. federal income tax and reduce distributions to our stockholders.




	Our charter provides that our board of directors may revoke or otherwise terminate our REIT election, without the approval of our stockholders, if it determines that it is no longer in our best interest to continue to qualify as a REIT. While we intend to elect and qualify to be taxed as a REIT, we may not elect to be treated as a REIT or may terminate our REIT election if we determine that qualifying as a REIT is no longer in our best interests. If we cease to be a REIT, we would become subject to U.S. federal income tax on our taxable income and would no longer be required to distribute most of our taxable income to our stockholders, which may have adverse consequences on our total return to our stockholders and on the market price of our common stock.




	We may be subject to adverse legislative or regulatory tax changes.




	At any time, the federal income tax laws or regulations governing REITs or the administrative interpretations of those laws or regulations may be amended. We cannot predict when or if any new federal income tax law, regulation or administrative interpretation, or any amendment to any existing federal income tax law, regulation or administrative interpretation, will be adopted, promulgated or become effective and any such law, regulation or interpretation may take effect retroactively. We and our stockholders could be adversely affected by any such change in, or any new, federal income tax law, regulation or administrative interpretation. You are urged to consult with your tax advisor with respect to the impact of recent legislation on your investment in our shares and the status of legislative, regulatory or administrative developments and proposals and their potential effect on an investment in our shares.




	Although REITs generally receive better tax treatment than entities taxed as regular corporations, it is possible that future legislation would result in a REIT having fewer tax advantages, and it could become more advantageous for a company that invests in real estate to elect to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a corporation. As a result, our charter provides our board of directors with the power, under certain circumstances, to revoke or otherwise terminate our REIT election and cause us to be taxed as a regular corporation, without the vote of our stockholders. Our board of directors has fiduciary duties to us and our stockholders and could only cause such changes in our tax treatment if it determines in good faith that such changes are in the best interest of our stockholders.




	Dividends payable by REITs do not qualify for the reduced tax rates.




	In general, the maximum tax rate for dividends payable to domestic stockholders that are individuals, trusts and estates is 20%. Dividends payable by REITs, however, are generally not eligible for this reduced rate. While this tax treatment does not adversely affect the taxation of REITs or dividends paid by REITs, the more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate dividends could cause investors who are individuals, trusts or estates to perceive investments in REITs to be relatively less attractive than investments in stock of non‑REIT corporations that pay dividends, which could adversely affect the value of the stock of REITs, including our common stock.




	Qualifying as a REIT involves highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.




	Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex Internal Revenue Code provisions for which only limited judicial and administrative authorities exist. Even a technical or inadvertent violation could jeopardize our REIT qualification. Our continued qualification as a REIT will depend on our satisfaction of certain asset, income, organizational, distribution, stockholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis. In addition, our ability to satisfy the requirements to qualify as a REIT depends in part on the actions of third parties over which we have no control or only limited influence, including in cases where we own an equity interest in an entity that is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

	The taxation of distributions to our stockholders can be complex; however, distributions that we make to our stockholders generally will be taxable as ordinary income, which may reduce your anticipated return from an investment in us.




	Distributions that we make to our taxable stockholders to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits (and not designated as capital gain dividends or qualified dividend income) generally will be taxable as ordinary income. However, a portion of our distributions may (i) be designated by us as capital gain dividends generally taxable as long-term capital gain to the extent that they are attributable to net capital gain recognized by us, (ii) be designated by us as qualified dividend income generally to the extent they are attributable to dividends we receive from non-REIT corporations, if any, or (iii) constitute a return of capital generally to the extent that they exceed our current and accumulated earnings and profits as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A return of capital distribution is not taxable, but has the effect of reducing the basis of a stockholder’s investment in our common stock.




	Non-U.S. stockholders will be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax and may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on distributions received from us and upon the disposition of our shares.




	Subject to certain exceptions, distributions received from us will be treated as dividends of ordinary income to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits. Such dividends ordinarily will be subject to U.S. withholding tax at a 30% rate, or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty, unless the distributions are treated as “effectively connected” with the conduct by the non-U.S. stockholder of a U.S. trade or business. Pursuant to the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act of 1980, or FIRPTA, capital gain distributions attributable to sales or exchanges of “U.S. real property interests,” or USRPIs, generally will be taxed to a non-U.S. stockholder as if such gain were effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business unless FIRPTA provides an exemption. However, a capital gain dividend will not be treated as effectively connected income if (i) the distribution is received with respect to a class of stock that is regularly traded on an established securities market located in the United States and (ii) the non-U.S. stockholder does not own more than 10% of the class of our stock at any time during the one-year period ending on the date the distribution is received. We do not anticipate that our shares will be “regularly traded” on an established securities market for the foreseeable future, and therefore, this exception is not expected to apply.




	Gain recognized by a non-U.S. stockholder upon the sale or exchange of our common stock generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxation unless such stock constitutes a USRPI under FIRPTA (subject to specific FIRPTA exemptions for certain non-U.S. stockholders). Our common stock will not constitute a USRPI so long as we are a “domestically-controlled qualified investment entity.” A domestically-controlled qualified investment entity includes a REIT if at all times during a specified testing period, less than 50% in value of such REIT’s stock is held directly or indirectly by non-U.S. stockholders. We believe, but cannot assure you, that we will be a domestically-controlled qualified investment entity.




	Even if we do not qualify as a domestically-controlled qualified investment entity at the time a non-U.S. stockholder sells or exchanges our common stock, gain arising from such a sale or exchange would not be subject to U.S. taxation under FIRPTA as a sale of a USRPI if: (a) our common stock is “regularly traded,” as defined by applicable Treasury Regulations, on an established securities market, and (b) such non-U.S. stockholder owned, actually and constructively, 10% or less of our common stock at any time during the five-year period ending on the date of the sale. However, it is not anticipated that our common stock will be “regularly traded” on an established market. We encourage you to consult your tax advisor to determine the tax consequences applicable to you if you are a non-U.S. stockholder.

	Retirement Plan Risks




	If the fiduciary of an employee benefit plan subject to ERISA (such as a profit sharing, Section 401(k) or pension plan) or an owner of a retirement arrangement subject to Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code (such as an individual retirement account (“IRA”)) fails to meet the fiduciary and other standards under ERISA or the Internal Revenue Code as a result of an investment in our stock, the fiduciary could be subject to penalties and other sanctions.




	There are special considerations that apply to employee benefit plans subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”) (such as profit sharing, Section 401(k) or pension plans) and other retirement plans or accounts subject to Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code (such as an IRA) that invest in our shares. Fiduciaries and IRA owners that invest the assets of such a plan or account in our common stock should satisfy themselves that:













	•






	the investment is consistent with their fiduciary and other obligations under ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code;
















	•






	the investment is made in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan or IRA, including the plan’s or account’s investment policy;
















	•






	the investment satisfies the prudence and diversification requirements of Sections 404(a)(1)(B) and 404(a)(1)(C) of ERISA and other applicable provisions of ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code;
















	•






	the investment in our shares, for which no public market currently exists, is consistent with the liquidity needs of the plan or IRA;
















	•






	the investment will not produce an unacceptable amount of “unrelated business taxable income” for the plan or IRA;
















	•






	our stockholders will be able to comply with the requirements under ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code to value the assets of the plan or IRA annually; and
















	•






	the investment will not constitute a prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code.







	With respect to the annual valuation requirements described above, we will provide an estimated value for our common stock annually. We can make no claim whether such estimated value will or will not satisfy the applicable annual valuation requirements under ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code.  The Department of Labor or the Internal Revenue Service may determine that a plan fiduciary or an IRA custodian is required to take further steps to determine the value of our common stock. In the absence of an appropriate determination of value, a plan fiduciary or an IRA custodian may be subject to damages, penalties or other sanctions. For information regarding our estimated value per share, see Part II, Item 5, “Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters, and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities - Market Information” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.




	Failure to satisfy the fiduciary standards of conduct and other applicable requirements of ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code may result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties and could subject the fiduciary to claims for damages or for equitable remedies, including liability for investment losses. In addition, if an investment in our shares constitutes a prohibited transaction under ERISA or the Internal Revenue Code, the fiduciary or IRA owner who authorized or directed the investment may be subject to the imposition of excise taxes with respect to the amount invested. In addition, the investment transaction must be undone. In the case of a prohibited transaction involving an IRA owner, the IRA may be disqualified as a tax-exempt account and all of the assets of the IRA may be deemed distributed and subjected to tax. ERISA plan fiduciaries and IRA owners should consult with counsel before making an investment in our common stock.




	If our assets are deemed to be plan assets, the Advisor and we may be exposed to liabilities under Title I of ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code.




	In some circumstances where an ERISA plan holds an interest in an entity, the assets of the entity are deemed to be ERISA plan assets unless an exception applies. This is known as the “look-through rule.” Under those circumstances, the obligations and other responsibilities of plan sponsors, plan fiduciaries and plan administrators, and of parties in interest and disqualified persons, under Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code, may be applicable, and there may be liability under these and other provisions of ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code. We believe that our assets should not be treated as plan assets because the shares should qualify as “publicly-offered securities” that are exempt from the look-through rules under applicable Treasury Regulations. We note, however, that because certain limitations are imposed upon the transferability of shares so that we may qualify as a REIT, and perhaps for other reasons, it is possible that this exemption may not apply. If that is the case, and if we or our advisor are exposed to liability under ERISA or the Internal Revenue Code, our performance and results of operations could be adversely affected. Stockholders should consult with their legal and other advisors concerning the impact of ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code on their investment and our performance.

	 ITEM 5.






	MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES







	Stockholder Information




	As of


	March 8, 2017


	, we had approximately


	188.6 million


	 shares of common stock outstanding held by a total of approximately 47,500 stockholders. The number of stockholders is based on the records of DST Systems, Inc., which serves as our transfer agent.




	Market Information




	No public market currently exists for our shares of common stock, and we currently have no plans to list our shares on a national securities exchange. Until our shares are listed, if ever, our stockholders may not sell their shares unless the buyer meets the applicable suitability and minimum purchase requirements. Any sale must comply with applicable state and federal securities laws. In addition, our charter prohibits the ownership of more than 9.8% of our stock by a single person, unless exempted by our board of directors. Consequently, there is the risk that our stockholders may not be able to sell their shares at a time or price acceptable to them.




	We provide an estimated value per share to assist broker-dealers that participated in our initial public offering in meeting their customer account statement reporting obligations under NASD Conduct Rule 2340 as required by FINRA. This valuation was performed in accordance with the provisions of and also to comply with the IPA Valuation Guidelines. For this purpose, we estimated the value of the shares of our common stock as $5.49 (unaudited) per share as of December 31, 2016. This estimated value per share is based on our board of directors’ approval on December 14, 2016 of an estimated value per share of our common stock of $5.49 (unaudited) based on the estimated value of our assets less the estimated value of our liabilities, or net asset value, divided by the number of shares outstanding, all as of September 30, 2016. There were no material changes between September 30, 2016 and December 14, 2016 that impacted the overall estimated value per share.




	The conflicts committee, composed solely of all of our independent directors, is responsible for the oversight of the valuation process used to determine the estimated value per share of our common stock, including the review and approval of the valuation and appraisal processes and methodologies used to determine our estimated value per share, the consistency of the valuation and appraisal methodologies with real estate industry standards and practices and the reasonableness of the assumptions used in the valuations and appraisals. The estimated value per share was based upon the recommendation and valuation prepared by our advisor. Our advisor’s valuation of our 11 real estate properties held as of September 30, 2016 was based on appraisals performed by CBRE, an independent third-party valuation firm. CBRE prepared appraisal reports, summarizing key inputs and assumptions, for each of our real estate properties. Our advisor performed valuations with respect to our real estate-related investments, cash, other assets, mortgage debt and other liabilities. The methodologies and assumptions used to determine the estimated value of our assets and the estimated value of our liabilities are described further below.




	Our advisor used the appraised values of our real estate properties, together with our advisor’s estimated value of each of our other assets and our liabilities, to calculate and recommend an estimated value per share of our common stock. Based on (i) the conflicts committee’s receipt and review of our advisor’s valuation report, including our advisor’s summary of the appraisal reports prepared by CBRE and our advisor’s estimated value of each of our other assets and our liabilities, (ii) the conflicts committee’s review of the reasonableness of our estimated value per share resulting from our advisor’s valuation process, and (iii) other factors considered by the conflicts committee and the conflicts committee’s own extensive knowledge of our assets and liabilities, the conflicts committee concluded that the estimated value per share proposed by our advisor was reasonable and recommended to our board of directors that it adopt $5.49 (unaudited) as the estimated value per share of our common stock. The board of directors unanimously agreed to accept the recommendation of the conflicts committee and approved $5.49 (unaudited) as the estimated value per share of our common stock, which determination is ultimately and solely the responsibility of the board of directors.

	 The December 8, 2015 estimated value per share was based upon the recommendation and valuation of our advisor. Our advisor’s valuation of our real estate properties was based on appraisals of our 12 real estate properties held as of September 30, 2015 performed by CBRE. Our advisor performed valuations of our real estate-related investment, cash, other assets, mortgage debt and other liabilities. For more information relating to the December 8, 2015 estimated value per share and the assumptions and methodologies used by CBRE and our advisor, see our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on December 9, 2015.





	(2)



	 The decrease in the estimated value of real estate properties per share was primarily due to the sale of one real estate property and decreases in the appraised values of the real estate properties, partially offset by capital additions subsequent to September 30, 2015.





	(3)



	 The decrease in cash per share was primarily due to principal repayments on our mortgage debt.





	(4)



	 The decrease in the estimated value of mortgage debt per share was primarily due to principal repayments to pay off certain mortgages, a principal repayment as a result of the sale of one real estate property and amortizing principal payments subsequent to September 30, 2015.




	The decrease in our estimated value per share from the previous estimate was primarily due to the items noted in the table below, which reflect the significant contributors to the decrease in the estimated value per share from $5.62 (unaudited) to $5.49 (unaudited).  The changes are not equal to the change in values of each asset and liability group presented in the table above due to asset sales or payoffs, debt repayments and other factors, which caused the value of certain asset or liability groups to change with no impact to our fair value of equity or the overall estimated value per share.

	Table of Contents









	As with any valuation methodology, the methodologies used are based upon a number of estimates and assumptions that may not be accurate or complete. Different parties using different assumptions and estimates could derive a different estimated value per share of our common stock, and this difference could be significant. The estimated value per share is not audited and does not represent the fair value of our assets less the fair value of our liabilities according to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), nor does it represent a liquidation value of our assets and liabilities or the price at which our shares of common stock would trade on a national securities exchange. The estimated value per share does not reflect a discount for the fact that we are externally managed, nor does it reflect a real estate portfolio premium/discount versus the sum of the individual property values. The estimated value per share also does not take into account estimated disposition costs and fees for real estate properties that are not under contract to sell, debt prepayment penalties or swap breakage fees that could apply upon the prepayment of certain of our debt obligations or termination of related swap agreements prior to expiration or the impact of restrictions on the assumption of debt. We have generally incurred disposition costs and fees related to the sale of each real estate property since inception of 1.7% to 3.5% of the gross sales price less concessions and credits, with the weighted average being approximately 2.3%.  If this range of disposition costs and fees was applied to our real estate properties, which do not include these costs and fees in the appraised values, the resulting impact on the estimated value per share would be a decrease of $0.14 to $0.28 per share. 




	Our estimated value per share takes into consideration any potential liability related to a subordinated participation in cash flows our advisor is entitled to upon meeting certain stockholder return thresholds in accordance with the advisory agreement. For purposes of determining the estimated value per share, our advisor calculated the potential liability related to this incentive fee based on a hypothetical liquidation of the assets and liabilities at their estimated fair values, after considering the impact of any potential closing costs and fees related to the disposition of real estate properties, and determined that there would be no liability related to the subordinated participation in cash flows.




	As of December 14, 2016, we had no potentially dilutive securities outstanding that would impact the estimated value per share of our common stock.




	Methodology




	Our goal for the valuation was to arrive at a reasonable and supportable estimated value per share, using a process that was designed to be in compliance with the IPA Valuation Guidelines and using what we and our advisor deemed to be appropriate valuation methodologies and assumptions. The following is a summary of the valuation and appraisal methodologies, assumptions and estimates used to value our assets and liabilities:




	Real Estate




	Independent Valuation Firm:


	 CBRE



	(1)



	 was selected by our advisor and approved by our conflicts committee and board of directors to appraise our real estate properties. CBRE is not affiliated with us or our advisor. The compensation we paid to CBRE was based on the scope of work and not on the appraised values of our real estate properties.  The appraisals were performed in accordance with the Code of Ethics and the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice, or USPAP, the real estate appraisal industry standards created by The Appraisal Foundation, as well as the requirements of the state where each real property is located.  Each appraisal was reviewed, approved and signed by an individual with the professional designation of MAI (Member of the Appraisal Institute). The use of the reports is subject to the requirements of the Appraisal Institute relating to review by its duly authorized representatives.




	CBRE collected all reasonably available material information that it deemed relevant in appraising our real estate properties. CBRE obtained property-level information from our advisor, including (i) property historical and projected operating revenues and expenses; (ii) property lease agreements; and (iii) information regarding recent or planned capital expenditures. CBRE reviewed and relied in part on the property-level information provided by our advisor and considered this information in light of its knowledge of each property’s specific market conditions.




	_____________________





	(1)



	 CBRE is actively engaged in the business of appraising commercial real estate properties similar to those we own in connection with public securities offerings, private placements, business combinations and similar transactions. We engaged CBRE to deliver appraisal reports relating to our real estate properties and CBRE received fees upon the delivery of such reports. In addition, we have agreed to indemnify CBRE against certain liabilities arising out of this engagement. CBRE is an affiliate of CBRE Group, Inc., a parent holding company of affiliated companies that are engaged in the ordinary course of business in many areas related to commercial real estate and related services. In the two years prior to December 14, 2016, CBRE and its affiliates provided a number of commercial real estate, appraisal, valuation and financial advisory services for us and our affiliates and have received fees in connection with such services. CBRE and its affiliates may from time to time in the future perform other commercial real estate, appraisal, valuation and financial advisory services for us and our affiliates in transactions related to the properties that are the subjects of the appraisals, so long as such other services do not adversely affect the independence of the applicable CBRE appraiser as certified in the applicable appraisal report.




	In the ordinary course of its business, CBRE and its affiliates, directors and officers may structure and effect transactions for their own accounts or for the accounts of their customers in commercial real estate assets of the same kind and in the same markets as our assets.

	Table of Contents









	In conducting its investigation and analyses, CBRE took into account customary and accepted financial and commercial procedures and considerations as it deemed relevant. Although CBRE reviewed information supplied or otherwise made available by us or our advisor for reasonableness, it assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all such information and of all information supplied or otherwise made available to it by any other party and did not independently verify any such information. With respect to operating or financial forecasts and other information and data provided to or otherwise reviewed by or discussed with CBRE, CBRE assumed that such forecasts and other information and data were reasonably prepared in good faith on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of our management and/or our advisor. CBRE relied on us to advise it promptly if any information previously provided became inaccurate or was required to be updated during the period of its review.




	In performing its analyses, CBRE made numerous other assumptions as of various points in time with respect to industry performance, general business, economic and regulatory conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond its and our control, as well as certain factual matters. For example, unless specifically informed to the contrary, CBRE assumed that we had clear and marketable title to each real estate property appraised, that no title defects existed, that any improvements were made in accordance with law, that no hazardous materials were present or had been present previously, that no deed restrictions existed, and that no changes to zoning ordinances or regulations governing use, density or shape were pending or being considered. Furthermore, CBRE’s analyses, opinions and conclusions were necessarily based upon market, economic, financial and other circumstances and conditions existing as of or prior to the date of the appraisal, and any material change in such circumstances and conditions may affect CBRE’s analyses and conclusions.  CBRE’s appraisal reports contain other assumptions, qualifications and limitations that qualify the analyses, opinions and conclusions set forth therein.  Furthermore, the prices at which our real estate properties may actually be sold could differ from their appraised values.




	Although CBRE considered any comments to its appraisal reports received from us or our advisor, the final appraised values of our real estate properties were determined by CBRE.  The appraisal reports for our real estate properties are addressed solely to us to assist our advisor in calculating and recommending an updated estimated value per share of our common stock. The appraisal reports are not addressed to the public and may not be relied upon by any other person to establish an estimated value per share of our common stock and do not constitute a recommendation to any person to purchase or sell any shares of our common stock. In preparing its appraisal reports, CBRE did not solicit third-party indications of interest for our real estate properties. In preparing its appraisal reports, CBRE also did not, and was not requested to, solicit third party indications of interest for our common stock in connection with possible purchases thereof or the acquisition of all or any part of us. While CBRE was responsible for providing appraisals of our real estate properties for us, CBRE was not responsible for, did not calculate, and did not participate in, the determination of the estimated value per share of our common stock.




	The foregoing is a summary of the standard assumptions, qualifications and limitations that generally apply to CBRE’s appraisal reports. All of the CBRE appraisal reports, including the analyses, opinions and conclusions set forth in such reports, are qualified by the assumptions, qualifications and limitations set forth in the respective appraisal reports.




	Real Estate Valuation




	As of September 30, 2016, we owned 11 real estate properties (consisting of 10 office properties and an office campus consisting of eight office buildings). CBRE appraised each of our real estate properties using various methodologies including the direct capitalization approach, discounted cash flow analyses and sales comparison approach and relied primarily on 10-year discounted cash flow analyses for the final appraisal of each of the properties. CBRE calculated the discounted cash flow value of our real estate properties using property-level cash flow estimates, terminal capitalization rates and discount rates that fall within ranges it believes would be used by similar investors to value our real estate properties based on recent comparable market transactions adjusted for unique property and market-specific factors.




	The total appraised value of our real estate properties as of September 30, 2016 was $1.511 billion. The total cost basis of these properties as of September 30, 2016 was $1.608 billion. This amount includes the purchase price of $1.407 billion, $182.4 million in capital expenditures, leasing commissions and tenant improvements since inception and $18.6 million of acquisition fees and expenses. The appraised value of our real estate properties as of September 30, 2016 compared to the total acquisition cost of these properties plus subsequent capital expenditures, leasing commissions and tenant improvements and acquisition fees and expenses through September 30, 2016, results in an overall decrease in the real estate value of the properties of approximately 6.02%.








	 42









	Table of Contents









	The following table summarizes the key assumptions that CBRE used in the 10-year discounted cash flow models to arrive at the appraised values for our real estate properties:

























	 






	Range in Values






	 






	Weighted-Average Basis








	Terminal capitalization rate

	(1)



	 The net operating income compounded annual growth rates (“CAGRs”) reflect both the contractual and market rents and reimbursements (in cases where the contractual lease period is less than the hold period of the property) net of expenses over the holding period. The range of CAGRs shown is the constant annual rate at which the net operating income is projected to grow to reach the net operating income in the final year of the hold period for each of the properties. The high-end range in values reflects the lease up of a property with a considerable amount of vacancy and that was 52% leased as of September 30, 2016.




	While we believe that CBRE’s assumptions and inputs are reasonable, a change in these assumptions and inputs would significantly impact the appraised value of our real estate properties and thus, our estimated value per share. The table below illustrates the impact on the estimated value per share if the terminal capitalization rates or discount rates CBRE used to appraise our real estate properties were adjusted by 25 basis points, assuming all other factors remain unchanged. Additionally, the table below illustrates the impact on our estimated value per share if the terminal capitalization rates or discount rates were adjusted by 5% in accordance with the IPA Valuation Guidelines, assuming all other factors remain unchanged:

	(0.22






	)










	Finally, each 1% change in the appraised value of our real estate properties would result in a change of $0.08 to the estimated value per share, assuming all other factors remain unchanged.




	Real Estate Loan Receivable




	As of September 30, 2016, we owned one real estate loan receivable. The estimated value for our real estate loan receivable is equal to the GAAP fair value disclosed in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2016, but does not equal the book value of the loan in accordance with GAAP. The value of the real estate loan receivable was estimated by applying a discounted cash flow analysis over the remaining expected life of the investment, excluding any potential transaction costs. The cash flow estimate used in the analysis during the term of the investment was based on the investment’s contractual cash flow, which we anticipate we will receive. The expected cash flow for the loan was discounted at a rate that we expect a market participant would require for an instrument with similar characteristics, including remaining loan term, loan-to-value ratio, type of collateral, current performance, credit enhancements and other factors.




	The cost of our real estate loan receivable was $14.1 million, including $23,000 of origination fees and costs and $0.4 million of principal repayments. As of September 30, 2016, the fair value of our real estate loan receivable was $14.3 million and the outstanding principal balance was $14.1 million. The discount rate applied to the cash flow from the real estate loan receivable, which has a remaining term of 1.8 years, was approximately 7.0%. Similar to the valuation for real estate, a change in the assumptions and inputs would change the fair value of our real estate loan receivable and thus, our estimated value per share. Assuming all other factors remain unchanged, a decrease or increase in the discount rates of 25 basis points would have no impact on the estimated value per share and, additionally, a 5% decrease or increase in the discount rates would have no impact on the estimated value per share.




	Notes Payable




	The estimated values of our notes payable are equal to the GAAP fair values disclosed in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2016. The estimated value of our notes payable does not equal the book value of the loans in accordance with GAAP. The GAAP fair values of our notes payable were determined using a discounted cash flow analysis. The discounted cash flow analysis was based on projected cash flow over the remaining loan terms, including extensions we expect to exercise, and on management’s estimates of current market interest rates for instruments with similar characteristics, including remaining loan term, loan-to-value ratio and type of collateral.








	 43









	Table of Contents









	As of September 30, 2016, the GAAP fair value and carrying value of our notes payable were $526.1 million and $523.8 million, respectively. The weighted-average discount rate applied to the future estimated debt payments was approximately 2.85%. Our notes payable have a weighted-average remaining term of 1.3 years. The table below illustrates the impact on our estimated value per share if the discount rates were adjusted by 25 basis points, assuming all other factors remain unchanged, with respect to our notes payable. Additionally, the table below illustrates the impact on the estimated value per share if the discount rates were adjusted by 5% in accordance with the IPA Valuation Guidelines, assuming all other factors remain unchanged:

	Other Assets and Liabilities




	The carrying values of a majority of our other assets and liabilities are considered to equal their fair value due to their short maturities or liquid nature. Certain balances, such as straight-line rent receivables, lease intangible assets and liabilities, capital expenditures payable, deferred financing costs, unamortized lease commissions and unamortized lease incentives, have been eliminated for the purpose of the valuation due to the fact that the values of those balances were already considered in the valuation of the related asset or liability. Our advisor has also excluded redeemable common stock, as temporary equity does not represent a true liability to us and the shares that this amount represents are included in our total outstanding shares of common stock for purposes of calculating the estimated value per share of our common stock.




	Limitations of the Estimated Value Per Share




	As mentioned above, we are providing this estimated value per share to assist broker dealers that participated in our initial public offering in meeting their customer account statement reporting obligations. This valuation was performed in accordance with the provisions of and also to comply with the IPA Valuation Guidelines. The estimated value per share set forth above first appeared on the December 31, 2016 customer account statements that were mailed in January 2017. As with any valuation methodology, the methodologies used are based upon a number of estimates and assumptions that may not be accurate or complete. Different parties with different assumptions and estimates could derive a different estimated value per share of our common stock, and this difference could be significant. The estimated value per share is not audited and does not represent the fair value of our assets less the fair value of our liabilities according to GAAP.




	Accordingly, with respect to the estimated value per share, we can give no assurance that:













	•

	Further, the estimated value per share as of December 14, 2016 is based on the estimated value of our assets less the estimated value of our liabilities divided by the number of shares outstanding, all as of September 30, 2016. The value of our shares will fluctuate over time in response to developments related to individual assets in our portfolio and the management of those assets, in response to the real estate and finance markets and due to other factors. The estimated value per share does not reflect a discount for the fact that we are externally managed, nor does it reflect a real estate portfolio premium/discount versus the sum of the individual property values. The estimated value per share does not take into account estimated disposition costs and fees for real estate properties that are not under contract to sell, debt prepayment penalties or swap breakage fees that could apply upon the prepayment of certain of our debt obligations or termination of related swap agreements prior to expiration or the impact of restrictions on the assumption of debt. We have generally incurred disposition costs and fees related to the sale of each real estate property since inception of 1.7% to 3.5% of the gross sales price less concessions and credits, with the weighted average being approximately 2.3%.  If this range of disposition costs and fees was applied to our real estate properties, which do not include these costs and fees in the appraised values, the resulting impact on the estimated value per share would be a decrease of $0.14 to $0.28 per share. We currently expect to utilize our advisor and/or an independent valuation firm to update the estimated value per share no later than December 2017.

	 The estimated value per share of $6.05 resulted, in part, from the payment of a special distribution of $4.50 per share of common stock to stockholders of record as of September 15, 2014. Excluding the impact of the special distribution, our estimated value per share of common stock would have been $10.55 as of September 22, 2014. Our board of directors declared special distributions in the amount of $3.75, $0.30 and $0.45 per share on the outstanding shares of our common stock on July 8, 2014, August 5, 2014 and August 29, 2014, respectively, for an aggregate amount of $4.50 per share of common stock, to all stockholders of record as of the close of business on September 15, 2014. These special distributions were paid on September 23, 2014 and were funded from our proceeds from the disposition of nine real estate properties between May 2014 and August 2014 as well as cash on hand resulting primarily from the repayment or sale of five real estate loans receivable during 2013 and 2014.




	Distribution Information




	Over the long term, we expect that our distributions will generally be paid from cash flow from operations and FFO from current or prior periods (except with respect to distributions related to sales of our assets and distributions related to the repayment of principal under our mortgage loan investment).




	During the year ended


	December 31, 2016


	, we sold one office/flex property. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we sold one office property and received the repayment of one of our real estate loans receivable, and during the year ended December 31, 2014, we sold 15 real estate properties and received repayments on three of our real estate loans receivable. Our cash flow from operations has decreased and will continue to decrease as a result of our disposition activity, and we have adjusted our distribution policy with respect to the amount of monthly distribution payments to take into account our disposition activity and current real estate investments. We may continue to make strategic asset sales as opportunities become available in the market. Our focus in 2017 is to: continue to strategically sell assets and consider paying special distributions to stockholders; negotiate lease renewals or new leases that facilitate the sales process and enhance property stability for prospective buyers; complete capital projects, such as renovations or amenity enhancements, to attract quality buyers; and finalize the strategic alternatives assessment and decide on a course of action. Any future special distributions we make from the proceeds of future dispositions will reduce our estimated value per share and this reduction will be reflected in our updated estimated value per share, which we expect to update no later than December 2017.

	Table of Contents









	Our operating performance and ability to pay distributions from our cash flow from operations and/or the disposition of our assets cannot be accurately predicted and may deteriorate in the future due to numerous factors, including those discussed under “Forward-Looking Statements,” Part I, Item 1, “Market Outlook — Real Estate and Real Estate Finance Markets,” Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources” and “ — Results of Operations” herein. Those factors include: the future operating performance of our investments in the existing real estate and financial environment; the success and economic viability of our tenants; the ability of our borrower to continue to make debt service payments and/or to repay its loan upon maturity; our ability to refinance existing indebtedness at comparable terms; changes in interest rates on our variable rate debt obligations; our ability to successfully dispose of some of our assets; and the sources and amounts of cash we have available for distributions.




	Our board has the authority under our organizational documents, to the extent permitted by Maryland law, to pay distributions from any source, including proceeds from the issuance of securities in the future. Our board of directors has not pre-established a percentage range of return for distributions to stockholders or a minimum distribution level, and our charter does not require that we pay distributions to our stockholders. The rate will be determined by our board of directors based on our financial condition and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant.




	We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code and have operated as such beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 2008. To maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must meet certain organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (computed without regard to the dividends-paid deduction or net capital gain and which does not necessarily equal net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP). Our board of directors may authorize distributions in excess of those required for us to maintain REIT status depending on our financial condition and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant.




	Distributions declared per common share were $0.281 and $0.293 in the aggregate for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Distributions per common share were based on a monthly record date for each month during the period commencing January 2015 through December 2016.




	Other than special distributions, distributions are generally paid on or about the first business day of the following month. Distributions declared during


	2015

	2016


	, aggregated by quarter, are as follows (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts):

	On January 27, 2017, our board of directors declared a distribution in the amount of


	$0.02331370


	 per share of common stock to stockholders of record as of the close of business on January 27, 2017, which we paid on February 1, 2017, and a distribution in the amount of


	$0.02105753


	 per share of common stock to stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 20, 2017, which we paid on March 1, 2017. On March 10, 2017, our board of directors declared a March 2017 distribution in the amount of


	$0.02331370


	 per share of common stock to stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 20, 2017, which we expect to pay in April 2017, and an April 2017 distribution in the amount of


	$0.02256164


	 per share of common stock to stockholders of record as of the close of business on April 20, 2017, which we expect to pay in May 2017. Distributions are paid on or about the first business day of the following month.




	Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities




	During the fiscal year ended


	December 31, 2016


	, we did not sell any equity securities that were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933.




	Share Redemption Program




	Our share redemption program provides only for redemptions sought upon a stockholder’s death, “qualifying disability” or “determination of incompetence” (each as defined in the share redemption program document, and together with redemptions sought in connection with a stockholder’s death, “Special Redemptions”). Such redemptions are subject to the limitations described in the share redemption program document, including:













	•






	During each calendar year, Special Redemptions are limited to an annual dollar amount determined by the board of directors, which may be reviewed during the year and increased or decreased upon ten business days’ notice to our stockholders. We may provide notice by including such information (a) in a Current Report on Form 8-K or in our annual or quarterly reports, all publicly filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission or (b) in a separate mailing to the stockholders. On December 8, 2015, the board of directors approved the dollar amount limitation for Special Redemptions for calendar year 2016 of $10.0 million in the aggregate. On December 9, 2016, our board of directors approved the same annual dollar limitation of $10.0 million in the aggregate for the calendar year 2017 (subject to review and adjustment during the year by the board of directors), and further subject to the limitations described in the share redemption program.
















	•






	During any calendar year, we may redeem no more than 5% of the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the prior calendar year.
















	•






	We have no obligation to redeem shares if the redemption would violate the restrictions on distributions under Maryland General Corporation Law, as amended from time to time, which prohibits distributions that would cause a corporation to fail to meet statutory tests of solvency.







	If we cannot repurchase all shares presented for redemption in any month because of the limitations on redemptions set forth in our share redemption program, then we will honor redemption requests on a pro rata basis, except that if a pro rata redemption would result in a stockholder owning less than the minimum purchase requirement described in our currently effective, or our most recently effective, registration statement as such registration statement has been amended or supplemented, then we would redeem all of such stockholder’s shares.




	Upon a transfer of shares, any pending redemption requests with respect to such transferred shares will be canceled as of the date the transfer is accepted by us.  Stockholders wishing to continue to have a redemption request related to any transferred shares considered by us must resubmit their redemption request.




	Pursuant to the share redemption program, redemptions made in connection with Special Redemptions are made at a price per share equal to the most recent estimated value per share of our common stock as of the applicable redemption date. We do not currently expect to have funds available for ordinary redemptions in the future.




	On December 8, 2015, our board of directors approved an estimated value per share of our common stock of $5.62 (unaudited) based on the estimated value of our assets less the estimated value of our liabilities, divided by the number of shares outstanding, all as of September 30, 2015. The change in the redemption price became effective for the December 2015 redemption date, which was December 31, 2015, and was effective through the November 2016 redemption date. For a full description of the methodologies used to value our assets and liabilities in connection with the calculation of the December 2015 estimated value per share, see our Current Report on Form 8-K, filed with the SEC on December 9, 2015.

	Table of Contents









	On December 14, 2016, our board of directors approved an estimated value per share of our common stock of $5.49 (unaudited) based on the estimated value of our assets less the estimated value of our liabilities, divided by the number of shares outstanding, all as of September 30, 2016. The change in the redemption price became effective for the December 2016 redemption date, which was December 30, 2016, and will be effective until the estimated value per share is updated. We expect to utilize our advisor and/or an independent valuation firm to update the estimated value per share no later than December 2017. For a full description of the methodologies used to value our assets and liabilities in connection with the calculation of the estimated value per share, see Part II, Item 5, “Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities — Market Information.”




	We may amend, suspend or terminate our share redemption program upon 30 days’ notice to our stockholders, provided that we may increase or decrease the funding available for the redemption of shares under the program upon ten business days’ notice to our stockholders. We may provide this notice by including such information (a) in a Current Report on Form 8-K or in our annual or quarterly reports, all publicly filed with the SEC or (b) in a separate mailing to our stockholders.




	We funded redemptions during the year ended December 31, 2016 with proceeds from the sale of real estate properties and existing cash on hand. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we redeemed shares pursuant to our share redemption program as follows:

	 We announced the adoption and commencement of the program on April 8, 2008.

	  During the year ended December 31, 2016, shares eligible for redemption were redeemed at the prices set forth above.





	(3)



	 We limit the dollar value of shares that may be redeemed under the share redemption program as described above. During the year ended 


	December 31, 2016


	, we redeemed $4.7 million of shares of common stock. The only redemptions we made under our share redemption program during the year ended 


	December 31, 2016


	 were those that qualified as, and met the requirements for, Special Redemptions under our share redemption program. For the year ended 


	December 31, 2016


	, we fulfilled all redemption requests that qualified as Special Redemptions under our share redemption program. On December 9, 2016, our board of directors approved an annual dollar limitation for Special Redemptions of $10.0 million in the aggregate for the calendar year 2017. Based on the redemption limitations described above in our share redemption program and redemptions through February 28, 2017, we may redeem up to $9.3 million of shares in connection with Special Redemptions for the remainder of 2017.

	 We believe that funds from operations (“FFO”) is a beneficial indicator of the performance of an equity REIT. We compute FFO in accordance with the current National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) definition. FFO represents net income, excluding gains and losses from sales of operating real estate assets (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar conditions based on historical cost accounting and useful-life estimates), impairment losses on real estate assets, depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, and adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. We believe FFO facilitates comparisons of operating performance between periods and among other REITs. However, our computation of FFO may not be comparable to other REITs that do not define FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than we do. Our management believes that historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. As a result, we believe that the use of FFO, together with the required GAAP presentations, provides a more complete understanding of our performance relative to our competitors and a more informed and appropriate basis on which to make decisions involving operating, financing, and investing activities.




	FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure and does not represent net income as defined by GAAP. Net income as defined by GAAP is the most relevant measure in determining our operating performance because FFO includes adjustments that investors may deem subjective, such as adding back expenses such as depreciation and amortization. Accordingly, FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our operating performance.

	MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS







	The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the “Selected Financial Data” above and our accompanying consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto. Also see “Forward-Looking Statements” preceding Part I and Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”




	Overview




	We were formed on July 12, 2007 as a Maryland corporation that elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) beginning with the taxable year ended December 31, 2008 and we intend to continue to operate in such a manner. We conduct our business primarily through our Operating Partnership, of which we are the sole general partner. Subject to certain restrictions and limitations, our business is managed by our advisor, KBS Capital Advisors LLC, pursuant to an advisory agreement. KBS Capital Advisors conducts our operations and manages our portfolio of real estate and real estate-related investments. Our advisor owns 20,000 shares of our common stock. We have no paid employees.




	We invested in a diverse portfolio of real estate and real estate-related investments. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, we owned


	11


	 real estate properties (consisting of


	10


	 office properties and an office campus consisting of


	eight


	 office buildings) and


	one


	 real estate loan receivable.




	On September 27, 2007, we filed a registration statement on Form S-11 with the SEC to offer a maximum of 280,000,000 shares of common stock for sale to the public, of which 200,000,000 shares were registered in our primary offering and 80,000,000 shares were registered under our dividend reinvestment plan. We ceased offering shares of common stock in our primary offering on December 31, 2010. We sold


	182,681,633


	 shares of common stock in our primary offering for gross offering proceeds of $1.8 billion. We terminated the offering under our dividend reinvestment plan effective May 29, 2014. We sold


	30,903,504


	 shares of common stock under our dividend reinvestment plan for gross offering proceeds of


	$298.2 million


	. Also as of


	December 31, 2016


	, we had redeemed


	24,885,185


	 shares sold in our offering for


	$240.1 million


	.




	On January 27, 2016, our board of directors formed the Special Committee composed of all of our independent directors to explore the availability of strategic alternatives involving us. As part of the process of exploring strategic alternatives, on February 23, 2016, the Special Committee engaged Evercore to act as our financial advisor and to assist us and the Special Committee with this process. Under the terms of the engagement, Evercore provided various financial advisory services, as requested by the Special Committee as customary for an engagement in connection with exploring strategic alternatives. Although the Special Committee has engaged Evercore to assist us and the Special Committee with the exploration of strategic alternatives for us, we are not obligated to enter into any particular transaction or any transaction at all.




	While the Special Committee continues to explore strategic alternatives for us, the Special Committee has determined that it would be in our best interest and the best interest of our stockholders to market some of our assets for sale. Based on the results of this sales effort, the board of directors may conclude that it would be in our best interest and the best interest of our stockholders to sell one or more of our assets and, depending on the scope of the proposed asset sales, thereafter to adopt a plan of liquidation that would involve the sale of our remaining assets. In the event of such a determination, the proposed plan of liquidation would be presented to our stockholders for approval. Alternatively, based on the results of the initial sales effort, the board of directors may conclude that it would be in our best interest and the best interest of our stockholders for us to engage in a limited number of asset sales and continue to operate as a going concern, but with a portfolio that is smaller than the present portfolio. Although we have begun the process of exploring strategic alternatives and are marketing some of our assets for sale, there is no assurance that this process will result in stockholder liquidity, or provide a return to stockholders that equals or exceeds our estimated value per share.




	Our focus in 2017 is to: continue to strategically sell assets and consider special distributions to stockholders; negotiate lease renewals or new leases that facilitate the sales process and enhance property stability for prospective buyers; complete capital projects, such as renovations or amenity enhancements, to attract quality buyers; and finalize the strategic alternatives assessment and decide on a course of action.

	Market Outlook – Real Estate and Real Estate Finance Markets




	The following discussion is based on management’s beliefs, observations and expectations with respect to the real estate and real estate finance markets.




	Conditions in the global capital markets remain volatile as of the first quarter of 2017. Current economic data and financial market developments suggest that the global economy is improving, although at a slow and uneven pace. European economic growth has recently picked up, whereas the U.K. and China remain areas of concern. Against this backdrop, the central banks of the world’s major industrialized economies are beginning to back away from their strong monetary accommodation. Quantitative easing in Japan and Europe is slowing, but the liquidity generated from these programs continues to impact the global capital markets. For further discussion of current market conditions, see Part I, Item 1, “Business ─ Market Outlook ─ Real Estate and Real Estate Finance Markets.”




	Impact on Our Real Estate Investments




	The volatility in the global financial markets continues to cause a level of uncertainty in our outlook for the performance of the U.S. commercial real estate markets. Both the investing and leasing environments are highly competitive. While foreign capital continues to flow into U.S. real estate markets, the uncertainty regarding the political, regulatory and economic environments has introduced uncertainty into the markets. Possible future declines in rental rates, slower or potentially negative net absorption of leased space and expectations of future rental concessions, including free rent to renew tenants early, to retain tenants who are up for renewal or to attract new tenants, may result in decreases in cash flows. Historically low interest rates could help offset some of the impact of these potential decreases in operating cash flow for properties financed with variable rate mortgages; however, interest rates in the United States have started to increase. The FED increased interest rates in the fourth quarter of 2015 and again in December 2016. The real estate and finance markets anticipate further rate increases as long as the economy remains strong. If this trend continues, management will review our debt financing strategies to optimize the cost of our debt exposure.




	Impact on Our Real Estate-Related Investment




	Our real estate loan receivable is directly secured by commercial real estate. As a result, our real estate-related investment, in general, has been and likely will continue to be impacted by the same factors impacting our real estate properties. The higher yields and the improving credit position of many U.S. tenants and borrowers have attracted global capital. However, the real estate and capital markets are fluid, and the positive trends can reverse quickly. Economic conditions remain relatively volatile and can have a negative impact on the performance of collateral securing our loan investment, and therefore may impact the ability of the borrower under our loan to make contractual interest payments to us.




	As of


	December 31, 2016


	, we had a fixed-rate real estate loan receivable with an outstanding principal balance of $14.1 million and a carrying value (including unamortized origination and closing costs) of $14.1 million that matures in 2018.




	Impact on Our Financing Activities




	In light of the risks associated with potentially volatile operating cash flows from some of our real estate properties, and the possible increase in the cost of financing due to higher interest rates, we may have difficulty refinancing some of our debt obligations prior to or at maturity or we may not be able to refinance these obligations at terms as favorable as the terms of our existing indebtedness. Short-term interest rates in the United States have increased. Market conditions can change quickly, potentially negatively impacting the value of our investments.




	As of


	December 31, 2016


	, we had debt obligations in the aggregate principal amount of


	$524.3 million


	 with a weighted-average remaining term of 1.2 years. We had a total of


	$140.0 million


	 of fixed rate notes payable and


	$384.3 million


	 of variable rate notes payable as of


	December 31, 2016


	. The interest rates on


	$106.6 million


	 of our variable rate notes payable are effectively fixed through interest rate swap agreements. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, we had a total of $384.3 million of debt obligations scheduled to mature within 12 months of that date. We plan to exercise our extension options available under our loan agreements, if applicable, or pay down or refinance the related notes payable prior to their maturity dates.

	Liquidity and Capital Resources




	Our principal demands for funds during the short- and long-term are and will be for: the payment of operating expenses, capital expenditures and general and administrative expenses; payments under debt obligations; Special Redemptions of common stock pursuant to our share redemption program; and payments of distributions to stockholders.




	We intend to use our cash on hand, cash flow generated by our real estate properties and real estate-related investment, proceeds from debt financing, proceeds from the sale of real estate properties and possibly the principal repayment on or sale of our real estate loan receivable as our primary sources of immediate and long-term liquidity. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, we had an aggregate of $41.0 million available for future disbursements under two credit facilities, subject to certain conditions and restrictions set forth in the respective loan agreements.




	Our share redemption program provides only for Special Redemptions. During each calendar year, such Special Redemptions are limited to an annual dollar amount determined by the board of directors, which may be reviewed during the year and increased or decreased upon ten business days’ notice to our stockholders. Special Redemptions are made at a price per share equal to the most recent estimated value per share of our common stock as of the applicable redemption date. We currently do not expect to make ordinary redemptions in the future. On December 9, 2016, our board of directors approved an annual dollar limitation of $10.0 million in the aggregate for the calendar year 2017 (subject to review and adjustment during the year by the board of directors), and further subject to the limitations described in the share redemption program.




	Our investments in real estate generate cash flow in the form of rental revenues and tenant reimbursements, which are reduced by operating expenditures, debt service payments, the payment of asset management fees and corporate general and administrative expenses. Cash flow from operations from our real estate investments is primarily dependent upon the occupancy level of our portfolio, the net effective rental rates on our leases, the collectibility of rent and operating recoveries from our tenants and how well we manage our expenditures. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, our real estate was


	85%


	 occupied and our bad debt reserve was less than 1% of annualized base rent.




	Our real estate-related investment generates cash flow in the form of interest income, which is reduced by the payment of asset management fees and corporate general and administrative expenses. Cash flow from operations from our real estate-related investment is primarily dependent on the operating performance of the underlying collateral and the borrower’s ability to make debt service payments. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, the borrower under our real estate loan receivable was current on its debt service payments to us.




	For the


	year


	 ended


	December 31, 2016


	, our cash needs for capital expenditures and the payment of debt obligations were met with the proceeds from the payoff or sale of real estate loans receivable and proceeds from the sales of real estate properties from prior periods. Operating cash needs during the same period were met with cash flow generated by our real estate and real estate-related investments. We made distributions to our stockholders during the


	year


	 ended


	December 31, 2016


	 using cash flows from operations and cash on hand. We believe that our cash on hand, cash flow from operations, availability under our credit facilities, proceeds from the sales of real estate properties and the repayment of or sale of our real estate loan receivable will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, we had a total of $384.3 million of debt obligations scheduled to mature within 12 months of that date. We plan to exercise our extension options available under our loan agreements, if applicable, or pay down or refinance the related notes payable prior to their maturity dates.




	On December 14, 2016, our board of directors approved an estimated value per share of our common stock of $5.49 (unaudited) based on the estimated value of our assets less the estimated value of our liabilities, divided by the number of shares outstanding, all as of September 30, 2016. For a full description of the assumptions, methodologies and limitations used to value our assets and liabilities in connection with the calculation of our estimated value per share, see Part II, Item 5, “Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities — Market Information.”




	Our cash flow from operations has decreased and will continue to decrease as a result of our disposition activity, and we have adjusted our distribution policy with respect to the amount of monthly distribution payments to take into account our disposition activity and current real estate investments. We may continue to make strategic asset sales as opportunities become available in the market. Any future special distributions we make from the proceeds of future dispositions will reduce our estimated value per share and this reduction will be reflected in our updated estimated value per share, which we expect to update no later than December 2017.

	. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the timing of lease commission payments. We anticipate cash flows from operating activities to decrease to the extent we make additional asset sales.




	Cash Flows from Investing Activities




	Net cash provided by investing activities was


	$2.9 million


	 for the


	year


	 ended


	December 31, 2016


	, and primarily consisted of the following:













	•






	$41.2 million of proceeds from the sale of one office/flex property; and
















	•






	$38.4 million used for improvements to real estate.







	Cash Flows from Financing Activities




	  During the


	year


	 ended


	December 31, 2016


	, net cash used in financing activities was


	$82.1 million


	 and consisted primarily of the following:













	•






	$53.4 million of cash distributions;
















	•






	$40.2 million of principal payments on notes payable;
















	•






	$17.0 million of proceeds from note payable; and
















	•






	$4.7 million of cash used for redemptions of common stock.







	In addition to using our capital resources to meet our debt service obligations, for capital expenditures and for operating costs, we use our capital resources to make certain payments to our advisor. We paid our advisor fees in connection with the acquisition and origination of our assets and pay our advisor fees in connection with the management and disposition of our assets and for certain costs incurred by our advisor in providing services to us. Among the fees payable to our advisor is an asset management fee. With respect to investments in real estate, we pay our advisor a monthly asset management fee equal to one-twelfth of 0.75% of the amount paid or allocated to acquire the investment, plus the cost of any subsequent development, construction or improvements to the property. This amount includes any portion of the investment that was debt financed and is inclusive of acquisition fees and expenses related thereto. With respect to investments in loans and any investments other than real estate, we pay our advisor a monthly asset management fee calculated, each month, as one-twelfth of 0.75% of the lesser of (i) the amount paid or allocated to acquire or fund the loan or other investment (which amount includes any portion of the investment that was debt financed and is inclusive of acquisition or origination fees and expenses related thereto) and (ii) the outstanding principal amount of such loan or other investment, plus the acquisition or origination fees and expenses related to the acquisition or funding of such investment, as of the time of calculation. We also continue to reimburse our advisor and our dealer manager for certain stockholder services.

	As of


	December 31, 2016


	, we had


	$48.0 million


	 of cash and cash equivalents and up to $41.0 million available for future disbursements under two credit facilities, subject to certain conditions and restrictions set forth in the respective loan agreements, to meet our operational and capital needs.




	In order to execute our investment strategy, we primarily utilized secured debt to finance a portion of our investment portfolio. Management remains vigilant in monitoring the risks inherent with the use of debt in our portfolio and is taking actions to ensure that these risks, including refinance and interest rate risks, are properly balanced with the benefit of using leverage. We limit our total liabilities to 75% of the cost (before deducting depreciation and other noncash reserves) of our tangible assets; however, we may exceed that limit if the majority of the conflicts committee approves each borrowing in excess of such limitation and we disclose such borrowings to our stockholders in our next quarterly report with an explanation from the conflicts committee of the justification for the excess borrowing. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, our borrowings and other liabilities were approximately


	35%


	 of both the cost (before deducting depreciation and other noncash reserves) and book value (before deducting depreciation) of our tangible assets, respectively.

	Results of Operations




	Overview




	As of


	December 31, 2015


	, we owned 10 office properties, one office/flex property, an office campus consisting of eight office buildings and one real estate loan receivable. Subsequent to


	December 31, 2015


	, we sold one office/flex property. As a result, as of


	December 31, 2016


	, we owned


	10


	 office properties, an office campus consisting of


	eight


	 office buildings and


	one


	 real estate loan receivable. The results of operations presented for the


	years


	 ended


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	2015


	 are not directly comparable due to the dispositions of two real estate properties and the repayment of one real estate loan receivable subsequent to January 1, 2015. In general, we expect income and expenses to decrease in future periods due to disposition activity.

	December 31, 2016


	 compared to the


	year


	 ended


	December 31, 2015


	 related to real estate and real estate-related investments owned by us throughout both periods presented.




	Rental income and tenant reimbursements decreased from $153.5 million for the


	year


	 ended


	December 31, 2015


	 to $147.5 million for the


	year


	 ended


	December 31, 2016


	, primarily due to the dispositions of two real estate properties subsequent to January 1, 2015, and a net decrease in rental income from properties held throughout both periods.  Rental income related to properties held throughout both periods decreased primarily due to an overall decrease in occupancy in such properties of 1% and an aggregate decrease in average annualized base rent per square foot in such properties of 0.4%. Overall, we expect rental income and tenant reimbursements to decrease in future periods due to the anticipated dispositions of real estate properties. For the


	years


	 ended


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	2015


	, rental income and tenant reimbursements from our real estate properties sold were $1.4 million and $6.0 million, respectively.




	Interest income from our real estate loans receivable, recognized using the interest method, decreased from


	$4.6 million


	 for the


	year


	 ended


	December 31, 2015


	 to


	$1.1 million


	 for the


	year


	 ended


	December 31, 2016


	, primarily as a result of the payoff of a real estate loan receivable in August 2015. Interest income from real estate loans receivable in future periods compared to historical periods will decrease as a result of the payoff or sale of our real estate loan receivable.




	Other operating income decreased from


	$7.2 million


	 for the


	year


	 ended


	December 31, 2015


	 to


	$6.9 million


	 for the


	year


	 ended


	December 31, 2016


	, primarily due to the dispositions of two real estate properties subsequent to January 1, 2015 and a decrease in parking revenues for properties held throughout both periods. Overall, we expect other operating income to decrease in future periods due to anticipated dispositions of real estate properties. For the


	years


	 ended


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	2015


	, other operating income from our real estate properties sold was


	$0


	 and


	$0.1 million


	, respectively.




	Operating, maintenance and management costs decreased from


	$36.1 million


	 for the


	year


	 ended


	December 31, 2015


	 to


	$34.6 million


	 for the


	year


	 ended


	December 31, 2016


	. The decrease was primarily due to the dispositions of two real estate properties subsequent to January 1, 2015 and a decrease in snow removal costs and utility costs for properties held throughout both periods. Operating, maintenance and management costs may increase in future periods, as compared to historical periods, as a result of inflation. Overall, we expect operating, maintenance and management costs to decrease in future periods due to the anticipated dispositions of real estate properties. For the


	years


	 ended


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	2015


	, operating, maintenance and management costs from our real estate properties sold were


	$37,000


	 and


	$0.8 million


	, respectively.

	Real estate taxes and insurance decreased from


	$20.5 million


	 for the


	year


	 ended


	December 31, 2015


	 to


	$20.1 million


	 for the


	year


	 ended


	December 31, 2016


	. This decrease was primarily due to the dispositions of two real estate properties subsequent to January 1, 2015, partially offset by a net increase in real estate taxes and insurance for properties held throughout both periods. We expect real estate taxes and insurance to decrease in future periods due to the anticipated dispositions of real estate properties. For the


	years


	 ended


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	2015


	, real estate taxes and insurance from our real estate properties sold were


	$0.3 million


	 and


	$0.9 million


	, respectively.




	Asset management fees with respect to our real estate and real estate-related investments decreased from


	$12.1 million


	 for the


	year


	 ended


	December 31, 2015


	 to


	$11.8 million


	 for the


	year


	 ended


	December 31, 2016


	, due to the disposition of two real estate properties and the payoff of a real estate loan receivable subsequent to January 1, 2015, partially offset by an increase in asset management fees due to an overall increase in the average total real estate balance for properties held throughout both periods. All asset management fees incurred as of


	December 31, 2016


	 have been paid. We expect asset management fees to decrease in future periods due to anticipated asset sales or other dispositions. For the


	years


	 ended


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	2015


	, asset management fees from our real estate and real estate-related investments sold or otherwise disposed of were $0.1 million and $0.6 million, respectively.




	General and administrative expenses increased from $4.5 million for the


	year


	 ended


	December 31, 2015


	 to $6.4 million for the


	year


	 ended


	December 31, 2016


	. This increase was primarily due to professional fees related to the Special Committee’s engagement of Evercore to act as our financial advisor and legal fees related to the anticipated dispositions of our real estate properties. See “—Liquidity and Capital Resources” for our discussion on the engagement of Evercore.




	Depreciation and amortization increased from


	$56.3 million


	 for the


	year


	 ended


	December 31, 2015


	 to


	$58.8 million


	 for the


	year


	 ended


	December 31, 2016


	, primarily due to the reclassification of two real estate properties from held for sale to held for investment, which resulted in a portion of the depreciation and amortization expense being classified as an impairment charge during the


	year


	 ended


	December 31, 2015


	. This increase was offset by a decrease in depreciation and amortization due to the disposition of two real estate properties subsequent to January 1, 2015. We expect depreciation and amortization to decrease in future periods due to the anticipated dispositions of real estate properties and an overall decrease in amortization of tenant origination costs related to lease expirations. For the


	years


	 ended


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	2015


	, depreciation and amortization from our real estate properties sold or held for sale was


	$0.4 million


	 and


	$1.1 million


	, respectively.




	Interest expense decreased from


	$22.1 million


	 for the


	year


	 ended


	December 31, 2015


	 to


	$16.7 million


	 for the


	year


	 ended


	December 31, 2016


	. The decrease in interest expense is primarily due to an overall decrease to our total debt outstanding due to loan repayments in connection with dispositions of two real estate properties subsequent to January 1, 2015, and an overall decrease in the average loan balance of our existing notes payable related to properties held throughout both periods. Included in interest expense is the amortization of deferred financing costs of


	$2.0 million


	 and


	$1.8 million


	 for the


	years


	 ended


	December 31, 2015


	 and


	2016


	, respectively. Also included in interest expense during the


	years


	 ended


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	2015


	 were $0.2 million and $0.2 million of termination fees related to the payoff of loans secured by the real estate properties sold subsequent to January 1, 2015. During the


	years


	 ended


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	2015


	, we recorded $0.5 million and $2.4 million of unrealized gain on interest rate swaps, respectively. In general, we expect interest expense to decrease in future periods due to debt repayments related to assets sold and anticipated asset sales, which may be offset by certain fees and costs that may be incurred due to the prepayment of certain loans. Our interest expense in future periods will also vary based on fluctuations in one-month LIBOR (for our variable rate debt, to the extent that such variable rate debt is not subject to an interest rate swap agreement) and our level of future borrowings, which will depend on the availability and cost of debt financing, draws on our credit facilities and any debt repayments we make. In addition, our interest expense in future periods will vary based on fair value changes with respect to our interest rate swaps that are not accounted for as cash flow hedges. For the


	years


	 ended


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	2015


	, interest expense from our real estate properties sold was


	$0.5 million


	 and


	$1.1 million


	, respectively.

	During the


	year


	 ended


	December 31, 2015


	, we recognized aggregate impairment charges of


	$23.1 million


	, including an impairment charge of $18.6 million to write-down the carrying value of the 100 & 200 Campus Drive Buildings, an office property located in Florham Park, New Jersey, to its estimated fair value as a result of changes in cash flow estimates. The decrease in cash flow projections was primarily due to (i) the lack of demand in the Florham Park office rental market resulting in slower rent growth and longer lease up periods and (ii) an increase in projected vacancy related to a tenant occupying 199,024 rentable square feet, or approximately 34% of the 100 & 200 Campus Drive Buildings. This tenant’s lease expired in November 2016. As a result, we revised our cash flow projections for longer lease up periods and additional tenant improvement costs and leasing concessions required to attract new tenants. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded aggregate impairment charges of $4.5 million with respect to two real estate properties that were reclassified from held for sale to held for investment. The impairment charge was recorded to adjust the carrying values of the properties for any depreciation and amortization expense that would have been recognized if the properties had always been classified as held for investment, which otherwise would have been recorded through depreciation and amortization expense. We did not recognize any impairment charge during the

	 related to real estate and real estate-related investments owned by us throughout both periods presented.




	Rental income and tenant reimbursements decreased from $255.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $153.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to the dispositions of real estate properties subsequent to January 1, 2014 and reset of tenant base years for lease renewals.  For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, rental income and tenant reimbursements from our real estate properties sold were $1.9 million and $102.0 million, respectively.




	Interest income from our real estate loans receivable, recognized using the interest method, decreased from $12.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily as a result of the payoff or sale of real estate loans receivable subsequent to January 1, 2014.

	Other operating income decreased from $9.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $7.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to the dispositions of real estate properties subsequent to January 1, 2014. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, other operating income from our real estate properties sold was $0.1 million and $2.8 million, respectively.




	Operating, maintenance and management costs decreased from $58.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $36.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to the dispositions of real estate properties subsequent to January 1, 2014. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, operating, maintenance and management costs from our real estate properties sold were $0.5 million and $23.4 million, respectively.




	Real estate taxes and insurance decreased from $36.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $20.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease was primarily due to the dispositions of real estate properties subsequent to January 1, 2014, partially offset by an increase due to higher property tax assessed values for two of our real estate properties held throughout both periods. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, real estate taxes and insurance from our real estate properties sold were $0.2 million and $17.4 million, respectively.




	Asset management fees with respect to our real estate and real estate-related investments decreased from $18.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $12.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, due to the disposition of real estate properties and the payoff or sale of real estate loans receivable subsequent to January 1, 2014. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, asset management fees from our real estate properties sold were $0.1 million and $6.5 million, respectively, and were $0.3 million and $0.6 million from real estate loans receivable paid off or sold, respectively.




	Depreciation and amortization decreased from $78.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $56.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to (i) the dispositions of real estate properties subsequent to January 1, 2014, (ii) the reclassification of two real estate properties from held for sale to held for investment, which resulted in a portion of the depreciation and amortization expense being classified as an impairment charge during the year ended December 31, 2015 and (iii) a decrease in amortization of tenant origination and absorption costs for properties held throughout both periods. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, depreciation and amortization from our real estate properties sold or held for sale was $0 and $21.7 million, respectively.




	Interest expense decreased from $62.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $22.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in interest expense is primarily due to an overall decrease to our total debt outstanding due to loan payoffs or reductions in connection with dispositions of real estate properties and in part due to a decrease in the average loan balance of our existing notes payable related to properties held throughout both periods. Included in interest expense is the amortization of deferred financing costs of $4.7 million and $2.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015, respectively. Also included in interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2014 was $3.0 million of unrealized swap losses primarily due to hedge ineffectiveness as a result of anticipated early repayment of debt in connection with asset sales and $0.7 million of termination fees related to the payoff of loans secured by the real estate properties sold during the year ended December 31, 2014. As of December 31, 2014, we had dedesignated all of our interest rate swap agreements. As a result, changes to the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements are recognized directly in earnings as interest expense. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded $2.4 million of unrealized gain on interest rate swaps. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, interest expense from our real estate properties sold was $0.4 million and $33.9 million, respectively.




	During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded aggregate impairment charges of $23.1 million, including an impairment charge of $18.6 million to write-down the carrying value of the 100 & 200 Campus Drive Buildings, an office property located in Florham Park, New Jersey, to its estimated fair value as a result of changes in cash flow estimates. Please see “ — Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2016 versus the year ended December 31, 2015” above for a discussion of the 2015 impairment charges. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recognized an impairment charge of $15.6 million consisting of (i) $10.6 million with respect to a real estate property held for investment, (ii) $3.9 million with respect to two of our real estate properties that were reclassified from held for sale to held for investment and (iii) $1.1 million on a real estate property sold during the year ended December 31, 2014. The impairment charge for the property held for investment was to reduce the carrying value of this property to its estimated fair value.  The impairment was caused by us revising our cash flow projections and the estimated hold period of the investment due to longer than estimated lease-up periods and lower projected rental rates. The impairment charge related to the reclassified properties was recorded to adjust the carrying values of the properties for any depreciation and amortization expense that would have been recognized if the properties had always been classified as held for investment, which otherwise would have been recorded through depreciation and amortization expense.

	We recognized a gain on sale of real estate of $27.4 million related to the disposition of one office property during the year ended December 31, 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recognized a gain on sale of real estate of $441.6 million related to the disposition of nine office properties, one industrial property, a portfolio of four industrial properties and a leasehold interest in one industrial property.








	Funds from Operations and Modified Funds from Operations




	We believe that FFO is a beneficial indicator of the performance of an equity REIT. We compute FFO in accordance with the current NAREIT definition. FFO represents net income, excluding gains and losses from sales of operating real estate assets (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar conditions based on historical cost accounting and useful-life estimates), impairment losses on real estate assets, depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, and adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. We believe FFO facilitates comparisons of operating performance between periods and among other REITs. However, our computation of FFO may not be comparable to other REITs that do not define FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than we do. Our management believes that historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. As a result, we believe that the use of FFO, together with the required GAAP presentations, provides a more complete understanding of our performance relative to our competitors and provides a more informed and appropriate basis on which to make decisions involving operating, financing, and investing activities.




	Changes in accounting rules have resulted in a substantial increase in the number of non-operating and non-cash items included in the calculation of FFO. As a result, our management also uses modified funds from operations (“MFFO”) as an indicator of our ongoing performance as well as our dividend sustainability. MFFO excludes from FFO: acquisition fees and expenses; adjustments related to contingent purchase price obligations; amounts relating to straight-line rents and amortization of above and below market intangible lease assets and liabilities; accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on debt investments; amortization of closing costs relating to debt investments; impairments of real estate-related investments; mark-to-market adjustments included in net income; and gains or losses included in net income for the extinguishment or sale of debt or hedges. We compute MFFO in accordance with the definition of MFFO included in the practice guideline issued by the IPA in November 2010 as interpreted by management. Our computation of MFFO may not be comparable to other REITs that do not compute MFFO in accordance with the current IPA definition or that interpret the current IPA definition differently than we do.




	We believe that MFFO is helpful as a measure of ongoing operating performance because it excludes non-operating items included in FFO.  MFFO excludes non-cash items such as straight-line rental revenue.  Additionally, we believe that MFFO provides investors with supplemental performance information that is consistent with the performance indicators and analysis used by management, in addition to net income and cash flows from operating activities as defined by GAAP, to evaluate the sustainability of our operating performance.  MFFO provides comparability in evaluating the operating performance of our portfolio with other non-traded REITs which typically have limited lives with short and defined acquisition periods and targeted exit strategies.  MFFO, or an equivalent measure, is routinely reported by non-traded REITs, and we believe often used by analysts and investors for comparison purposes.




	FFO and MFFO are non-GAAP financial measures and do not represent net income as defined by GAAP. Net income as defined by GAAP is the most relevant measure in determining our operating performance because FFO and MFFO include adjustments that investors may deem subjective, such as adding back expenses such as depreciation and amortization and the other items described above. Accordingly, FFO and MFFO should not be considered as alternatives to net income as an indicator of our current and historical operating performance. In addition, FFO and MFFO do not represent cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered an indication of our liquidity. We believe FFO and MFFO, in addition to net income and cash flows from operating activities as defined by GAAP, are meaningful supplemental performance measures; however, neither FFO nor MFFO reflects adjustments for the operations of properties and real estate-related investments sold or held for sale during the periods presented. During periods of significant disposition activity, FFO and MFFO are much more limited measures of future performance and dividend sustainability. In connection with our presentation of FFO and MFFO, we are providing information related to the proportion of MFFO related to properties sold and real estate-related investments sold or repaid as of


	December 31, 2016


	.








	 59









	Table of Contents









	 Although MFFO includes other adjustments, the exclusion of straight-line rent, the amortization of above- and below-market leases, the amortization of discounts and closing costs, prepayment fees received on notes receivable, termination fees on derivative instruments, unrealized gains (losses) on derivative instruments and prepayment fees related to the extinguishment of debt are the most significant adjustments for the periods presented.  We have excluded these items based on the following economic considerations:













	•






	Adjustments for straight-line rent. 


	 These are adjustments to rental revenue as required by GAAP to recognize contractual lease payments on a straight-line basis over the life of the respective lease.  We have excluded these adjustments in our calculation of MFFO to more appropriately reflect the current economic impact of our in-place leases, while also providing investors with a useful supplemental metric that addresses core operating performance by removing rent we expect to receive in a future period or rent that was received in a prior period;
















	•






	Amortization of above- and below-market leases.


	  Similar to depreciation and amortization of real estate assets and lease related costs that are excluded from FFO, GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of intangible lease assets and liabilities diminishes predictably over time and requires that these charges be recognized currently in revenue.  Since real estate values and market lease rates in the aggregate have historically risen or fallen with local market conditions, management believes that by excluding these charges, MFFO provides useful supplemental information on the realized economics of the real estate;
















	•






	Amortization of discounts and closing costs.


	  Discounts and closing costs related to debt investments are amortized over the term of the loan as an adjustment to interest income.  This application results in income recognition that is different than the underlying contractual terms of the debt investments.  We have excluded the amortization of discounts and closing costs related to our debt investments in our calculation of MFFO to more appropriately reflect the economic impact of our debt investments, as discounts will not be economically recognized until the loan is repaid and closing costs are essentially the same as acquisition fees and expenses on real estate.  We believe excluding these items provides investors with a useful supplemental metric that directly addresses core operating performance;
















	•






	Prepayment fees received on notes receivable.


	  Prepayment fees related to notes receivable are included in interest income from real estate loans receivable.  Although these amounts increase net income, we exclude them from MFFO to more appropriately present the ongoing operating performance of our real estate-related investments on a comparative basis;
















	•






	Termination fees on derivative instruments.


	Termination fees on derivative instruments are included in interest expense. Although these amounts reduce net income, we exclude them from MFFO to more appropriately reflect the ongoing impact of our interest rate swap agreements;
















	•






	Unrealized gains (losses) on derivative instruments.


	  These adjustments include unrealized gains (losses) from mark-to-market adjustments on interest rate swaps and losses due to hedge ineffectiveness.  The change in fair value of interest rate swaps not designated as a hedge and the change in fair value of the ineffective portion of interest rate swaps are non-cash adjustments recognized directly in earnings and are included in interest expense.  We have excluded these adjustments in our calculation of MFFO to more appropriately reflect the economic impact of our interest rate swap agreements; and
















	•






	Prepayment fees related to the extinguishment of debt.


	  Prepayment fees related to the extinguishment of debt are generally included in interest expense. Although these amounts reduce net income, we exclude them from MFFO to more appropriately present the ongoing operating performance of our real estate investments on a comparative basis.

	Table of Contents









	For the


	year


	 ended


	December 31, 2016


	, we paid aggregate distributions of $53.4 million, all of which were paid in cash. FFO and cash flow from operations for the


	year


	 ended


	December 31, 2016


	 were


	$66.4 million


	 and


	$54.4 million


	, respectively.  We funded our total distributions paid with $51.1 million of current period cash flow from operations and $2.3 million of cash on hand. For purposes of determining the source of our distributions paid, we assume first that we use cash flow from operations from the relevant periods to fund distribution payments. See the reconciliation of FFO to net income above.




	Over the long term, we expect that our distributions will generally be paid from cash flow from operations and FFO from current or prior periods (except with respect to distributions related to sales of our assets and distributions related to the repayment of principal under our mortgage loan investment).




	During the


	year


	 ended


	December 31, 2016


	, we sold one office/flex property. During the


	year


	 ended


	December 31, 2015


	, we sold one office property and received the repayment of one of our real estate loans receivable, and during the year ended December 31, 2014, we sold 15 real estate properties and received repayments of three of our real estate loans receivable. Our cash flow from operations has decreased and will continue to decrease as a result of our disposition activity, and we have adjusted our distribution policy with respect to the amount of monthly distribution payments to take into account our disposition activity and current real estate investments. We may continue to make strategic asset sales as opportunities become available in the market. Any future special distributions we make from the proceeds of future dispositions will reduce our estimated value per share and this reduction will be reflected in our updated estimated value per share, which we expect to update no later than December 2017.




	Our operating performance and ability to pay distributions from our cash flow from operations and/or the disposition of our assets cannot be accurately predicted and may deteriorate in the future due to numerous factors, including those discussed under “Forward-Looking Statements,” Part I, Item 1, “Business — Market Outlook — Real Estate and Real Estate Finance Markets,” Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results of Operations.” Those factors include: the future operating performance of our investments in the existing real estate and financial environment; the success and economic viability of our tenants; the ability of our borrower to continue to make debt service payments and/or to repay its loan upon maturity; our ability to refinance existing indebtedness at comparable terms; changes in interest rates on our variable rate debt obligations; our ability to successfully dispose of some of our assets; and the sources and amounts of cash we have available for distributions.








	Critical Accounting Policies




	Below is a discussion of the accounting policies that management considers critical in that they involve significant management judgments and assumptions, require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain and because they are important for understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. With different estimates or assumptions, materially different amounts could be reported in our financial statements. Additionally, other companies may utilize different estimates that may impact the comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses.




	Revenue Recognition




	Real Estate




	We recognize minimum rent, including rental abatements, lease incentives and contractual fixed increases attributable to operating leases, on a straight-line basis over the term of the related leases when collectibility is reasonably assured and record amounts expected to be received in later years as deferred rent receivable. If the lease provides for tenant improvements, we determine whether the tenant improvements, for accounting purposes, are owned by the tenant or by us. When we are the owner of the tenant improvements, the tenant is not considered to have taken physical possession or have control of the physical use of the leased asset until the tenant improvements are substantially completed. When the tenant is the owner of the tenant improvements, any tenant improvement allowance (including amounts that a tenant can take in the form of cash or a credit against its rent) that is funded is treated as a lease incentive and amortized as a reduction of revenue over the lease term. Tenant improvement ownership is determined based on various factors including, but not limited to:













	•






	whether the lease stipulates how a tenant improvement allowance may be spent;
















	•






	whether the amount of a tenant improvement allowance is in excess of market rates;
















	•






	whether the tenant or landlord retains legal title to the improvements at the end of the lease term;
















	•






	whether the tenant improvements are unique to the tenant or general-purpose in nature; and
















	•






	whether the tenant improvements are expected to have any residual value at the end of the lease.











	 62









	Table of Contents









	  We record property operating expense reimbursements due from tenants for common area maintenance, real estate taxes, and other recoverable costs in the period the related expenses are incurred.




	We make estimates of the collectibility of our tenant receivables related to base rents, including deferred rent receivable, expense reimbursements and other revenue or income. We specifically analyze accounts receivable, deferred rent receivable, historical bad debts, customer creditworthiness, current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. In addition, with respect to tenants in bankruptcy, we make estimates of the expected recovery of pre-petition and post-petition claims in assessing the estimated collectibility of the related receivable. In some cases, the ultimate resolution of these claims can exceed one year. When a tenant is in bankruptcy, we will record a bad debt reserve for the tenant’s receivable balance and generally will not recognize subsequent rental revenue until cash is received or until the tenant is no longer in bankruptcy and has the ability to make rental payments.




	We recognize a gain on sales of real estate upon the closing of a transaction with the purchaser. Gains on real estate sold are recognized using the full accrual method when collectibility of the sales price is reasonably assured, we are not obligated to perform additional activities that may be considered significant, the initial investment from the buyer is sufficient and other profit recognition criteria have been satisfied. Gain on sales of real estate may be deferred in whole or in part until the requirements for gain recognition have been met.




	Real Estate Loans Receivable




	Interest income on our real estate loans receivable is recognized on an accrual basis over the life of the investment using the interest method. Direct loan origination fees and origination or acquisition costs, as well as acquisition premiums or discounts, are amortized over the term of the loan as an adjustment to interest income. We will place loans on nonaccrual status when any portion of principal or interest is 90 days past due, or earlier when concern exists as to the ultimate collection of principal or interest. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, we will reserve for any unpaid accrued interest and generally will not recognize subsequent interest income until the cash is received, or the loan returns to accrual status. We will resume the accrual of interest if we determine the collection of interest, according to the contractual terms of the loan, is probable.




	Real Estate




	Depreciation and Amortization




	Real estate costs related to the acquisition and improvement of properties are capitalized and amortized over the expected useful life of the asset on a straight-line basis. Repair and maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred and significant replacements and betterments are capitalized. Repair and maintenance costs include all costs that do not extend the useful life of the real estate asset. We consider the period of future benefit of an asset to determine its appropriate useful life. Expenditures for tenant improvements are capitalized and amortized over the shorter of the tenant’s lease term or expected useful life. We anticipate the estimated useful lives of our assets by class to be generally as follows:





















	Buildings






	25-40 years








	Building improvements






	10-25 years








	Tenant improvements






	Shorter of lease term or expected useful life









	Tenant origination and absorption costs






	Remaining term of related leases, including below-market renewal periods









	Impairment of Real Estate and Related Intangible Assets and Liabilities




	We continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that the carrying amounts of our real estate and related intangible assets and liabilities may not be recoverable or realized. When indicators of potential impairment suggest that the carrying value of real estate and related intangible assets and liabilities may not be recoverable, we assess the recoverability by estimating whether we will recover the carrying value of the real estate and related intangible assets and liabilities through its undiscounted future cash flows and its eventual disposition. If, based on this analysis, we do not believe that we will be able to recover the carrying value of the real estate and related intangible assets and liabilities, we would record an impairment loss to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the real estate and related intangible assets and liabilities.




	Projecting future cash flows involves estimating expected future operating income and expenses related to the real estate and its related intangible assets and liabilities as well as market and other trends. Using inappropriate assumptions to estimate cash flows could result in incorrect fair values of the real estate and its related intangible assets and liabilities and could result in the overstatement of the carrying values of our real estate and related intangible assets and liabilities and an overstatement of our net income.

	Real Estate Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations




	We generally consider real estate to be “held for sale” when the following criteria are met: (i) management commits to a plan to sell the property, (ii) the property is available for sale immediately, (iii) the property is actively being marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value, (iv) the sale of the property within one year is considered probable and (v) significant changes to the plan to sell are not expected. Real estate that is held for sale and its related assets are classified as “real estate held for sale” and “assets related to real estate held for sale,” respectively, for all periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Notes payable and other liabilities related to real estate held for sale are classified as “notes payable related to real estate held for sale” and “liabilities related to real estate held for sale,” respectively, for all periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Real estate classified as held for sale is no longer depreciated and is reported at the lower of its carrying value or its estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell. Additionally, with respect to properties that were classified as held for sale in financial statements prior to January 1, 2014, we record the operating results as discontinued operations for all periods presented if the operations have been or are expected to be eliminated and we will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the property following the sale. Operating results of properties that were disposed of or classified as held for sale in the ordinary course of business during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 that had not been classified as held for sale in financial statements prior to January 1, 2014 are included in continuing operations on our consolidated statements of operations.




	Change in a Plan to Sell




	When real estate is initially considered “held for sale” it is measured at the lower of its depreciated book value, or estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell. Changes in the market may compel us to decide to reclassify a property that was designated as held for sale to held for investment.  A property that is reclassified from held for sale to held for investment is measured and recorded at the lower of (i) its carrying amount before the property was classified as held for sale, adjusted for any depreciation and amortization expense that would have been recognized had the property been continuously classified as held and used, or (ii) its fair value at the date of the subsequent decision not to sell. Any adjustment to the carrying amount of the property as a result of the reclassification is included in income from continuing operations as an impairment charge on real estate held for investment.




	Real Estate Loan Receivable




	Our real estate loan receivable is recorded at amortized cost, net of loan loss reserves (if any), and evaluated for impairment at each balance sheet date. The amortized cost of a real estate loan receivable is the outstanding unpaid principal balance, net of unamortized acquisition premiums or discounts and unamortized costs and fees directly associated with the origination or acquisition of the loan.




	As of December 31, 2016, we did not have a loan loss reserve and we did not record any impairment losses related to our real estate loans receivable during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. However in the future, we may experience losses from our investments in loans receivable requiring us to record loan loss reserves. Realized losses on individual loans could be material and significantly exceed any recorded reserves.




	The reserve for loan losses is a valuation allowance that reflects our estimate of loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The reserve is adjusted through “Provision for loan losses” in our consolidated statements of operations and is decreased by charge-offs to specific loans when losses are confirmed. We consider a loan to be impaired when, based upon current information and events, we believe that it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement. We also consider a loan to be impaired if we grant the borrower a concession through a modification of the loan terms or if we expect to receive assets (including equity interests in the borrower) with fair values that are less than the carrying value of our loan in satisfaction of the loan. A reserve is established when the present value of payments expected to be received, observable market prices, the estimated fair value of the collateral (for loans that are dependent on the collateral for repayment) or amounts expected to be received in satisfaction of a loan are lower than the carrying value of that loan.




	Failure to recognize impairments would result in the overstatement of earnings and the carrying value of our real estate loans held for investment. Actual losses, if any, could differ significantly from estimated amounts.

	Marketable Securities




	We classify our investments in marketable securities as available-for-sale, since we may sell them prior to their maturity but do not hold them principally for the purpose of making frequent investments and sales with the objective of generating profits on short-term differences in price. These investments are carried at estimated fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Estimated fair values are generally based on quoted market prices, when available, or on estimates provided by independent pricing sources or dealers who make markets in such securities. In certain circumstances, such as when the market for the securities becomes inactive, we may determine it is appropriate to perform an internal valuation of the securities. Upon the sale of a security, the previously recognized unrealized gain (loss) is reversed out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and the actual realized gain (loss) is recognized in earnings.




	On a quarterly basis, we evaluate our marketable securities for other-than-temporary impairment. We review the projected future cash flows from these securities for changes in assumptions due to prepayments, credit loss experience and other factors. If, based on our quarterly estimate of cash flows, there has been an adverse change in the estimated cash flows from the cash flows previously estimated, the present value of the revised cash flows is less than the present value previously estimated, and the fair value of the securities is less than their amortized cost basis, an other-than-temporary impairment is deemed to have occurred.




	We recognize interest income on marketable securities that are beneficial interests in securitized financial assets and are rated “AA” and above on an accrual basis according to the contractual terms of the securities. Discounts or premiums are amortized to interest income over the life of the investment using the interest method.




	We recognize interest income on marketable securities that are beneficial interests in securitized financial assets that are rated below “AA” using the effective yield method, which requires us to periodically project estimated cash flows related to these securities and recognize interest income at an interest rate equivalent to the estimated yield on the security, as calculated using the security’s estimated cash flows and amortized cost basis, or reference amount. Changes in the estimated cash flows are recognized through an adjustment to the yield on the security on a prospective basis. Projecting cash flows for these types of securities requires significant judgment, which may have a significant impact on the timing of revenue recognized on these investments.




	We are required to distinguish between other-than-temporary impairments related to credit and other-than-temporary impairments related to other factors (e.g., market fluctuations) on our debt securities that we do not intend to sell and where it is not likely that we will be required to sell the security prior to the anticipated recovery of its amortized cost basis. We calculate the credit component of the other-than-temporary impairment as the difference between the amortized cost basis of the security and the present value of its estimated cash flows discounted at the yield used to recognize interest income. The credit component will be charged to earnings and the component related to other factors is recorded to other comprehensive income (loss).




	Derivative Instruments




	We enter into derivative instruments for risk management purposes to hedge our exposure to cash flow variability caused by changing interest rates on our variable rate notes payable. We record these derivative instruments at fair value on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Derivative instruments designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows or other types of forecasted transactions are considered cash flow hedges. The change in fair value of the effective portion of a derivative instrument that is designated as a cash flow hedge is recorded as other comprehensive income (loss) in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) and consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity. The changes in fair value for derivative instruments that are not designated as a hedge or that do not meet the hedge accounting criteria are recorded as gain or loss on derivative instruments in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.




	We formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as our risk-management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. This process includes designating all derivative instruments that are part of a hedging relationship to specific forecasted transactions or recognized obligations on the consolidated balance sheets. We also assess and document, both at the hedging instrument’s inception and on a quarterly basis thereafter, whether the derivative instruments that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows associated with the respective hedged items. When we determine that a derivative instrument ceases to be highly effective as a hedge, or that it is probable the underlying forecasted transaction will not occur, we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively and reclassify amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings.








	 65









	Table of Contents









	The termination of a cash flow hedge prior to the maturity date may result in a net derivative instrument gain or loss that continues to be reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and is reclassified into earnings over the period of the original forecasted hedged transaction (i.e., LIBOR based debt service payments) unless it is probable that the original forecasted hedged transaction will not occur by the end of the originally specified time period (as documented at the inception of the hedging relationship) or within an additional two-month period of time thereafter. If it is probable that the hedged forecasted transaction will not occur either by the end of the originally specified time period or within the additional two-month period of time, that derivative instrument gain or loss reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) shall be reclassified into earnings immediately.




	Fair Value Measurements




	Under GAAP, we are required to measure certain financial instruments at fair value on a recurring basis. In addition, we are required to measure other non-financial and financial assets at fair value on a non-recurring basis (e.g., carrying value of impaired real estate loans receivable and long-lived assets). Fair value is defined as the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The GAAP fair value framework uses a three-tiered approach. Fair value measurements are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:













	•






	Level 1: unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities;
















	•






	Level 2: quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-derived valuations in which significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets; and
















	•






	Level 3: prices or valuation techniques where little or no market data is available that requires inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.







	When available, we utilize quoted market prices from independent third-party sources to determine fair value and classify such items in Level 1 or Level 2. In instances where the market for a financial instrument is not active, regardless of the availability of a nonbinding quoted market price, observable inputs might not be relevant and could require us to make a significant adjustment to derive a fair value measurement. Additionally, in an inactive market, a market price quoted from an independent third party may rely more on models with inputs based on information available only to that independent third party. When we determine the market for a financial instrument owned by us to be illiquid or when market transactions for similar instruments do not appear orderly, we use several valuation sources (including internal valuations, discounted cash flow analysis and quoted market prices) and establish a fair value by assigning weights to the various valuation sources. Additionally, when determining the fair value of liabilities in circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for an identical liability is not available, we measure fair value using (i) a valuation technique that uses the quoted price of the identical liability when traded as an asset or quoted prices for similar liabilities when traded as assets or (ii) another valuation technique that is consistent with the principles of fair value measurement, such as the income approach or the market approach.




	Changes in assumptions or estimation methodologies can have a material effect on these estimated fair values. In this regard, the derived fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and, in many cases, may not be realized in an immediate settlement of the instrument.




	We consider the following factors to be indicators of an inactive market: (i) there are few recent transactions, (ii) price quotations are not based on current information, (iii) price quotations vary substantially either over time or among market makers (for example, some brokered markets), (iv) indexes that previously were highly correlated with the fair values of the asset or liability are demonstrably uncorrelated with recent indications of fair value for that asset or liability, (v) there is a significant increase in implied liquidity risk premiums, yields, or performance indicators (such as delinquency rates or loss severities) for observed transactions or quoted prices when compared with our estimate of expected cash flows, considering all available market data about credit and other nonperformance risk for the asset or liability, (vi) there is a wide bid-ask spread or significant increase in the bid-ask spread, (vii) there is a significant decline or absence of a market for new issuances (that is, a primary market) for the asset or liability or similar assets or liabilities, and (viii) little information is released publicly (for example, a principal-to-principal market).




	We consider the following factors to be indicators of non-orderly transactions: (i) there was not adequate exposure to the market for a period before the measurement date to allow for marketing activities that are usual and customary for transactions involving such assets or liabilities under current market conditions, (ii) there was a usual and customary marketing period, but the seller marketed the asset or liability to a single market participant, (iii) the seller is in or near bankruptcy or receivership (that is, distressed), or the seller was required to sell to meet regulatory or legal requirements (that is, forced), and (iv) the transaction price is an outlier when compared with other recent transactions for the same or similar assets or liabilities.

	Income Taxes




	We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code. To continue to qualify as a REIT, we must meet certain organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute at least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income to stockholders (which is computed without regard to the dividends-paid deduction or net capital gain and which does not necessarily equal net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP). As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income that we distribute as dividends to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates and generally will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost, unless the Internal Revenue Service grants us relief under certain statutory provisions. Such an event could materially and adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to stockholders. However, we believe that we are organized and operate in such a manner as to qualify for treatment as a REIT.

	QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK







	We are exposed to the effects of interest rate changes as a result of borrowings used to maintain liquidity, to fund the financing and refinancing of our real estate and real estate-related investment portfolio, and to fund our operations. Our profitability and the value of our investment portfolio may be adversely affected during any period as a result of interest rate changes. Our interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings, prepayment penalties and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We have managed and will continue to manage interest rate risk by maintaining a ratio of fixed rate, long-term debt such that variable rate exposure is kept at an acceptable level. In addition, we may utilize a variety of financial instruments, including interest rate caps, floors, and swap agreements, in order to limit the effects of changes in interest rates on our operations. When we use these types of derivatives to hedge the risk of interest-earning assets or interest-bearing liabilities, we may be subject to certain risks, including the risk that losses on a hedge position will reduce the funds available for payments of distributions to our stockholders and that the losses may exceed the amount we invested in the instruments.

	 using the interest method, which we use to recognize interest income on our real estate loan receivable.

	 The weighted-average interest rate represents the actual interest rate in effect as of


	December 31, 2016


	 (consisting of the contractual interest rate and the effect of interest rate swaps and floors), using interest rate indices as of


	December 31, 2016


	, where applicable.

	 Average pay rate is the interest rate swap fixed rate.





	(4)



	 Average receive rate is the 30-day LIBOR rate as of


	December 31, 2016


	.




	We borrow funds and made real estate-related investments at a combination of fixed and variable rates. Interest rate fluctuations will generally not affect our future earnings or cash flows on our fixed rate debt or fixed rate real estate loan receivable unless such instruments mature or are otherwise terminated. However, interest rate changes will affect the fair value of our fixed rate instruments. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, the fair value and carrying value of our fixed rate real estate loan receivable were


	$14.1 million


	 and


	$14.1 million


	, respectively. The fair value estimate of our real estate loan receivable is calculated using an internal valuation model that considers the expected cash flows for the loan, underlying collateral value (for collateral-dependent loans) and the estimated yield requirements of institutional investors for loans with similar characteristics, including remaining loan term, loan-to-value, type of collateral and other credit enhancements. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, the fair value of our fixed rate debt was $138.2 million and the outstanding principal balance of our fixed rate debt was


	$140.0 million


	. The fair value estimate of our fixed rate debt is calculated using a discounted cash flow analysis utilizing rates we would expect to pay for debt of a similar type and remaining maturity if the loans were originated as of


	December 31, 2016


	. With respect to our fixed rate instruments, we do not expect that fluctuations in interest rates, and the resulting change in fair value of our fixed rate instruments, would have a significant impact on our ongoing operations.




	Conversely, movements in interest rates on our variable rate debt would change our future earnings and cash flows, but not significantly affect the fair value of those instruments. However, changes in required risk premiums would result in changes in the fair value of variable rate instruments. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, we were exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on


	$277.7 million


	 of variable rate debt outstanding, after giving consideration to the impact of interest rate swap agreements on approximately


	$106.6 million


	 of our variable rate debt. Based on interest rates as of


	December 31, 2016


	, if interest rates were 100 basis points higher during the 12 months ending December 31, 2017, interest expense on our variable rate debt would increase by $2.8 million. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, one-month LIBOR was 0.77167% and if this index was reduced to 0% during the 12 months ending December 31, 2017, interest expense on our variable rate debt would decrease by $2.1 million.

	The annual effective interest rate of our fixed rate real estate loan receivable as of


	December 31, 2016


	 was 7.6%. The annual effective interest rate represents the effective interest rate as of


	December 31, 2016


	, using the interest method, which we use to recognize interest income on our real estate loan receivable. The weighted-average interest rates of our fixed rate debt and variable rate debt as of


	December 31, 2016


	 were 3.5% and 2.7%, respectively. The weighted-average interest rate represents the actual interest rate in effect as of

	As of the end of the period covered by this report, management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon, and as of the date of, the evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file and submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as and when required. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file and submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.




	Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting




	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.




	In connection with the preparation of our Form 10-K, our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016. In making that assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013).




	Based on its assessment, our management believes that, as of December 31, 2016, our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria. There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

	CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE







	Director Independence




	Although our shares are not listed for trading on any national securities exchange, a majority of the directors, and all of the members of the audit committee, conflicts committee and Special Committee, are “independent” as defined by the New York Stock Exchange. The board of directors has affirmatively determined that Hank Adler, Barbara R. Cambon and Stuart A. Gabriel, Ph.D. each satisfies the New York Stock Exchange independence standards. In determining that Professor Gabriel is independent under the New York Stock Exchange independence standards, the board of directors considered that Peter M. Bren, one of our executive officers and sponsors, is a founding member of the Richard S. Ziman Center for Real Estate at the UCLA Anderson School of Management, that Professor Gabriel is a Director of the Richard S. Ziman Center for Real Estate and Professor of Finance and Arden Realty Chair at the UCLA Anderson School of Management and that in March 2012, Mr. Bren pledged a gift of $1.25 million to the Richard S. Ziman Center for Real Estate at the UCLA Anderson School of Management. The contribution by Mr. Bren would be made over five years in the amount of $250,000 per year. Because this contribution is to a tax exempt entity and the contribution will not exceed $250,000 in any year, the board of directors determined that this contribution was not material and Professor Gabriel met the New York Stock Exchange independence standards.

	Report of the Conflicts Committee




	Review of Our Policies




	The conflicts committee has reviewed our policies and determined that they are in the best interest of our stockholders. Set forth below is a discussion of the basis for that determination.




	Portfolio Management, Disposition and Distribution Policy


	. On January 27, 2016, our board of directors formed the Special Committee composed of all of our independent directors to explore the availability of strategic alternatives involving us. As part of the process of exploring strategic alternatives, on February 23, 2016, the Special Committee engaged Evercore to act as our financial advisor and to assist us and the Special Committee with this process. Under the terms of the engagement, Evercore provided various financial advisory services, as requested by the Special Committee as customary for an engagement in connection with exploring strategic alternatives. Although the Special Committee engaged Evercore to assist us and the Special Committee with the exploration of strategic alternatives for us, we are not obligated to enter into any particular transaction or any transaction at all.




	While the Special Committee continues to explore strategic alternatives for us, the Special Committee has determined that it would be in our best interest and the best interest of our stockholders to market some of our assets for sale. Based on the results of this sales effort, the board of directors may conclude that it would be in our best interest and the best interest of our stockholders to sell one or more of our assets and, depending on the scope of the proposed asset sales, thereafter to adopt a plan of liquidation that would involve the sale of our remaining assets. In the event of such a determination, the proposed plan of liquidation would be presented to our stockholders for approval. Alternatively, based on the results of the initial sales effort, the board of directors may conclude that it would be in our best interest and the best interest of our stockholders for us to engage in a limited number of asset sales and continue to operate as a going concern, but with a portfolio that is smaller than the present portfolio. Although we have begun the process of exploring strategic alternatives and are marketing some of our assets for sale, there is no assurance that this process will result in stockholder liquidity, or provide a return to stockholders that equals or exceeds our estimated value per share.




	Our focus in 2017 is to: continue to strategically sell assets and consider special distributions to stockholders; negotiate lease renewals or new leases that facilitate the sales process and enhance property stability for prospective buyers; complete capital improvement projects, such as renovations or amenity enhancements, to attract quality buyers; and finalize the strategic alternatives assessment and decide on a course of action.




	We originally intended to hold our core properties for four to seven years. However, economic and market conditions may influence us to hold our investments for different periods of time, and we currently expect our hold period for the majority of our remaining properties may last for a few more years. We intend to hold our real estate-related investment until maturity. Our advisor has developed a well-defined exit strategy for each investment we make and periodically performs a hold-sell analysis on each asset. These periodic analyses focus on the remaining available value enhancement opportunities for the asset, the demand for the asset in the marketplace, market conditions and our overall portfolio objectives to determine if the sale of the asset, whether via an individual sale or as part of a portfolio sale or merger, would generate a favorable return to our stockholders. We may sell an asset before the end of the expected holding period if we believe that market conditions and asset positioning have maximized its value or the sale of the asset would otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders.




	During the year ended December 31, 2016, we sold one office/flex property. Since inception, we have sold 18 properties and we have sold or received principal repayments on seven of our real estate loans receivable.




	As discussed above, we plan to make certain strategic asset sales and, from time to time, may declare special distributions to our stockholders that would be funded with the net proceeds from those asset sales or from cash flow from other sources.




	Over the long term, we expect that our distributions will generally be paid from cash flow from operations and FFO from current or prior periods (except with respect to distributions related to sales of our assets and distributions related to the repayment of principal under our mortgage loan investment). Our cash flow from operations has decreased and will continue to decrease as a result of our disposition activity, and we have adjusted our distribution policy with respect to the amount of monthly distribution payments to take into account our disposition activity and current real estate investments. Any future special distributions we make from the proceeds of future dispositions will reduce our estimated value per share and this reduction will be reflected in our updated estimated value per share, which we expect to update no later than December 2017.








	 78









	Table of Contents









	Our operating performance and ability to pay distributions from our cash flow from operations and/or the disposition of our assets cannot be accurately predicted and may deteriorate in the future due to numerous factors, including: the future operating performance of our investments in the existing real estate and the financial environment; the success and economic viability of our tenants; the ability of our borrower to continue to make its debt service payments and/or to repay the loan upon maturity; our ability to refinance existing indebtedness at comparable terms; changes in interest rates on our variable rate debt obligations; our ability to successfully dispose of some of our assets; and the sources and amounts of cash we have available for distributions.




	Distributions declared per common share were $0.281 in the aggregate for the year ended December 31, 2016. Distributions declared per common share assumes each share was issued and outstanding at each record date for distributions. Distributions per common share were based on a monthly record date for each month during the period commencing January 2016 through December 2016.




	Acquisition and Investment Policies


	. We did not acquire any real estate properties or acquire or originate any real estate loans receivable during the period from January 1, 2016 through January 31, 2017, and we do not expect to make new acquisitions of real estate or real estate-related investments in the future. We used substantially all of the net proceeds from our initial public offering to invest in and manage a diverse portfolio of real estate and real estate-related investments. We diversified our portfolio by investment size, investment type, investment risk and geographic region with the goal of obtaining a portfolio of income-producing real estate and real estate-related assets that provide attractive and stable returns to our stockholders and would allow us to preserve and return our stockholders’ capital contributions. As of January 31, 2017, we owned 11 real estate properties (consisting of 10 office properties and an office campus consisting of eight office buildings) and one real estate loan receivable. See “—Disposition Policies” below.




	Borrowing Policies


	. In order to execute our investment strategy, we primarily utilized secured debt to finance a portion of our investment portfolio. Management remains vigilant in monitoring the risks inherent with the use of debt in our portfolio and is taking actions to ensure that these risks, including refinance and interest rate risks, are properly balanced with the benefit of using leverage. We limit our total liabilities to 75% of the cost (before deducting depreciation and other noncash reserves) of our tangible assets; however, we may exceed that limit if the majority of the conflicts committee approves each borrowing in excess of this limitation and we disclose such borrowings to our stockholders in our next quarterly report with an explanation from the conflicts committee of the justification for the excess borrowing. As of January 31, 2017, our borrowings and other liabilities were approximately 34% of both the cost (before deducting depreciation and other noncash reserves) and book value (before deducting depreciation) of our tangible assets, respectively.




	Policy Regarding Working Capital Reserves


	. We establish an annual budget for capital requirements and working capital reserves that we update periodically during the year. We may use cash on hand, proceeds from asset sales or loan receivable repayments, debt proceeds and cash flow from operations to meet our needs for working capital for the upcoming year and to build a moderate level of cash reserves.




	Policies Regarding Operating Expenses


	. Under our charter, we are required to limit our total operating expenses to the greater of 2% of our average invested assets or 25% of our net income for the four most recently completed fiscal quarters, as these terms are defined in our charter, unless the conflicts committee has determined that such excess expenses were justified based on unusual and non-recurring factors. Operating expenses for the four fiscal quarters ended December 31, 2016 did not exceed the charter-imposed limitation. For the four consecutive quarters ended December 31, 2016, total operating expenses represented approximately 1.2% of our average invested assets and approximately 27.3% of net income.




	Policy Regarding Transactions with Related Persons


	. Our charter requires the conflicts committee to review and approve all transactions between us and our advisor, any of our officers or directors or any of their affiliates. Prior to entering into a transaction with a related party, a majority of the conflicts committee must conclude that the transaction is fair and reasonable to us and on terms and conditions not less favorable to us than those available from unaffiliated third parties. In addition, our Code of Conduct and Ethics lists examples of types of transactions with related parties that would create prohibited conflicts of interest and requires our officers and directors to be conscientious of actual and potential conflicts of interest with respect to our interests and to seek to avoid such conflicts or handle such conflicts in an ethical manner at all times consistent with applicable law. Our executive officers and directors are required to report potential and actual conflicts to the Compliance Officer, currently our advisor’s Chief Audit Executive, via the Ethics Hotline or directly to the audit committee chair, as appropriate.




	Certain Transactions with Related Persons


	. The conflicts committee has reviewed the material transactions between our affiliates and us since the beginning of 2016 as well as any such currently proposed transactions. Set forth below is a description of such transactions and the conflicts committee’s report on their fairness.

	We have entered into agreements with certain affiliates pursuant to which they provide services to us. Peter M. Bren, Keith D. Hall, Peter McMillan III and Charles J. Schreiber, Jr. control and indirectly own KBS Capital Advisors and KBS Capital Markets Group, the entity that acted as our dealer manager. We refer to these individuals as our sponsors. They are also some of our executive officers. All four of our sponsors actively participate in the management and operations of our advisor. Our advisor has three managers: an entity owned and controlled by Mr. Bren; an entity owned and controlled by Messrs. Hall and McMillan; and an entity owned and controlled by Mr. Schreiber.




	Our Relationship with KBS Capital Advisors. 


	Since our inception, our advisor has provided day-to-day management of our business. Among the services that are provided or have been provided by our advisor under the terms of the advisory agreement are the following:













	•






	finding, presenting and recommending to us real estate and real estate-related investment opportunities consistent with our investment policies and objectives;
















	•






	structuring the terms and conditions of our investments, sales and joint ventures;
















	•






	acquiring properties and other investments on our behalf in compliance with our investment objectives and policies;
















	•






	sourcing and structuring our loan originations and acquisitions;
















	•






	arranging for financing and refinancing of our properties and our other investments;
















	•






	entering into leases and service contracts for our properties;
















	•






	supervising and evaluating each property manager’s performance;
















	•






	reviewing and analyzing the properties’ operating and capital budgets;
















	•






	assisting us in obtaining insurance;
















	•






	generating an annual budget for us;
















	•






	reviewing and analyzing financial information for each of our assets and our overall portfolio;
















	•






	formulating and overseeing the implementation of strategies for the administration, promotion, management, operation, maintenance, improvement, financing and refinancing, marketing, leasing and disposition of our properties and other investments;
















	•






	performing investor-relations services;
















	•






	maintaining our accounting and other records and assisting us in filing all reports required to be filed with the SEC, the IRS and other regulatory agencies;
















	•






	engaging in and supervising the performance of our agents, including our registrar and transfer agent; and
















	•






	performing any other services reasonably requested by us.







	Our advisor is subject to the supervision of the board of directors and only has such authority as we may delegate to it as our agent. The advisory agreement has a one-year term expiring May 21, 2017, subject to an unlimited number of successive one-year renewals upon the mutual consent of the parties. From January 1, 2016 through the most recent date practicable, which was January 31, 2017, we compensated our advisor as set forth below.




	With respect to investments in real estate, we pay our advisor a monthly asset management fee equal to one-twelfth of 0.75% of the amount paid or allocated to acquire the investment, plus the cost of any subsequent development, construction or improvements to the property. This amount includes any portion of the investment that was debt financed and is inclusive of acquisition fees and expenses related thereto. In the case of investments made through joint ventures, the asset management fee is determined based on our proportionate share of the underlying investment. With respect to investments in loans and any investments other than real estate, we pay our advisor a monthly asset management fee calculated, each month, as one-twelfth of 0.75% of the lesser of (i) the amount paid or allocated to acquire or fund the loan or other investment (which amount includes any portion of the investment that was debt financed and is inclusive of acquisition or origination fees and expenses related thereto) and (ii) the outstanding principal amount of such loan or other investment, plus the acquisition or origination fees and expenses related to the acquisition or funding of such investment, as of the time of calculation. Asset management fees from January 1, 2016 through January 31, 2017 totaled approximately $12.8 million, all of which had been paid as of January 31, 2017.

	Table of Contents









	Under the advisory agreement, our advisor and its affiliates have the right to seek reimbursement from us for all costs and expenses they incur in connection with their provision of services to us, including our allocable share of our advisor’s overhead, such as rent, employee costs, utilities, accounting software and cybersecurity costs. We reimburse our advisor for our allocable portion of the salaries, benefits and overhead of internal audit department personnel providing services to us. In the future, our advisor may seek reimbursement for additional employee costs. However, we will not reimburse our advisor or its affiliates for employee costs in connection with services for which our advisor earns acquisition, origination or disposition fees (other than reimbursement of travel and communication expenses) or for the salaries and benefits our advisor or its affiliates may pay to our executive officers. From January 1, 2016 through January 31, 2017, we reimbursed our advisor for $300,000 of operating expenses, including $216,000 of employee costs.




	For substantial assistance in connection with the sale of properties or other investments, we pay our advisor or its affiliates 1.0% of the contract sales price of each property or other investment sold; provided, however, in no event may aggregate disposition fees paid to our advisor, its affiliates and unaffiliated third parties exceed 6.0% of the contract sales price. From January 1, 2016 through January 31, 2017, we incurred $0.4 million of disposition fees, all of which had been paid as of January 31, 2017.




	From January 1, 2016 through January 31, 2017, our advisor reimbursed us $0.1 million for a property insurance rebate and our advisor and/or our dealer manager reimbursed us $69,000 for legal and professional fees and travel reimbursements.




	The conflicts committee considers our relationship with our advisor during 2016 to be fair. The conflicts committee believes that the amounts payable to our advisor under the advisory agreement are similar to those paid by other publicly offered, unlisted, externally advised REITs and that this compensation is necessary in order for our advisor to provide the desired level of services to us and our stockholders.




	Our Relationship with KBS Capital Markets Group


	. We have entered into a fee reimbursement agreement (the “AIP Reimbursement Agreement”) with our dealer manager pursuant to which we agreed to reimburse our dealer manager for certain fees and expenses it incurs for administering our participation in the DTCC Alternative Investment Product Platform with respect to certain accounts of our stockholders serviced through the platform. From January 1, 2016 through January 31, 2017, we incurred and paid $92,000 of costs and expenses related to the AIP Reimbursement Agreement.




	The conflicts committee believes that this arrangement with KBS Capital Markets Group is fair.




	Our Relationship with other KBS-Affiliated Entities.


	  On January 6, 2014, we, together with KBS REIT I, KBS REIT III, KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT, KBS Legacy Partners Apartment REIT, KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II, our dealer manager, our advisor and other KBS-affiliated entities, entered into an errors and omissions and directors and officers liability insurance program where the lower tiers of such insurance coverage are shared. The cost of these lower tiers is allocated by our advisor and its insurance broker among each of the various entities covered by the program, and is billed directly to each entity. The allocation of these shared coverage costs is proportionate to the pricing by the insurance marketplace for the first tiers of directors and officers liability coverage purchased individually by each REIT. Our advisor’s and our dealer manager’s portion of the shared lower tiers’ cost is proportionate to the respective entities’ prior cost for the errors and omissions insurance. In June 2015, KBS Growth & Income REIT was added to the insurance program at terms similar to those described above. We have renewed our participation in the program, and the program is effective through June 30, 2017.




	The conflicts committee believes this arrangement is fair.




	During the year ended December 31, 2016 and from January 1, 2017 through January 31, 2017, no other transactions occurred between us and KBS REIT I, KBS REIT III, KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT, KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II, KBS Legacy Partners Apartment REIT and KBS Growth & Income REIT.




	The conflicts committee has determined that the policies set forth in this Report of the Conflicts Committee are in the best interests of our stockholders because they provide us with the highest likelihood of achieving our investment objectives.

	PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING FEES AND SERVICES







	Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm




	During the year ended December 31, 2016, Ernst & Young LLP served as our independent registered public accounting firm and provided certain tax and other services. Ernst & Young has served as our independent registered public accounting firm since our formation.




	Pre-Approval Policies




	In order to ensure that the provision of such services does not impair the auditors’ independence, the audit committee charter imposes a duty on the audit committee to pre-approve all auditing services performed for us by our independent auditors, as well as all permitted non-audit services. In determining whether or not to pre-approve services, the audit committee considers whether the service is a permissible service under the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC. The audit committee may, in its discretion, delegate to one or more of its members the authority to pre-approve any audit or non-audit services to be performed by our independent auditors, provided any such approval is presented to and approved by the full audit committee at its next scheduled meeting.




	For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, all services rendered by Ernst & Young were pre-approved in accordance with the policies and procedures described above.




	Principal Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Fees




	The audit committee reviewed the audit and non-audit services performed by Ernst & Young, as well as the fees charged by Ernst & Young for such services. In its review of the non-audit service fees, the audit committee considered whether the provision of such services is compatible with maintaining the independence of Ernst & Young. The aggregate fees billed to us for professional accounting services, including the audit of our annual financial statements by Ernst & Young for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, are set forth in the table below.

	For purposes of the preceding table, Ernst & Young’s professional fees are classified as follows:













	•






	Audit fees - These are fees for professional services performed for the audit of our annual financial statements and the required review of quarterly financial statements and other procedures performed by Ernst & Young in order for them to be able to form an opinion on our consolidated financial statements. These fees also cover services that are normally provided by independent auditors in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements.
















	•






	Audit-related fees - These are fees for assurance and related services that traditionally are performed by independent auditors that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of our financial statements, such as due diligence related to acquisitions and dispositions, attestation services that are not required by statute or regulation, internal control reviews and consultation concerning financial accounting and reporting standards.
















	•






	Tax fees - These are fees for all professional services performed by professional staff in our independent auditor’s tax division, except those services related to the audit of our financial statements. These include fees for tax compliance, tax planning and tax advice, including federal, state and local issues. Services may also include assistance with tax audits and appeals before the IRS and similar state and local agencies, as well as federal, state and local tax issues related to due diligence.
















	•






	All other fees - These are fees for any services not included in the above-described categories.

	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM




	The Board of Directors and Stockholders of




	KBS Real Estate Investment Trust II, Inc.









	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of KBS Real Estate Investment Trust II, Inc. (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule in Item 15(a), Schedule III–Real Estate Assets and Accumulated Depreciation and Amortization. These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.




	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.




	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of KBS Real Estate Investment Trust II, Inc. at December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule referred to above, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

	 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	December 31, 2016



























	1.






	ORGANIZATION







	KBS Real Estate Investment Trust II, Inc. (the “Company”) was formed on July 12, 2007 as a Maryland corporation that elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) beginning with the taxable year ended December 31, 2008. The Company conducts its business primarily through KBS Limited Partnership II, a Delaware limited partnership formed on August 23, 2007 (the “Operating Partnership”), and its subsidiaries. The Company is the sole general partner of and directly owns a


	0.1%


	 partnership interest in the Operating Partnership. The Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, KBS REIT Holdings II LLC, a Delaware limited liability company formed on August 23, 2007 (“KBS REIT Holdings II”), owns the remaining


	99.9%


	 partnership interest in the Operating Partnership and is its sole limited partner.




	The Company invested in a diverse portfolio of real estate and real estate-related investments. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, the Company owned


	11


	 real estate properties (consisting of


	10


	 office properties and an office campus consisting of


	eight


	 office buildings) and


	one


	 real estate loan receivable.




	Subject to certain restrictions and limitations, the business of the Company is managed by KBS Capital Advisors LLC (the “Advisor”), an affiliate of the Company, pursuant to an advisory agreement the Company renewed with the Advisor on May 21, 2016 (the “Advisory Agreement”). The Advisory Agreement may be renewed for an unlimited number of


	one


	-year periods upon the mutual consent of the Advisor and the Company. Either party may terminate the Advisory Agreement upon


	60


	 days’ written notice. The Advisor owns


	20,000


	 shares of the Company’s common stock.




	Upon commencing its initial public offering (the “Offering”), the Company retained KBS Capital Markets Group LLC (the “Dealer Manager”), an affiliate of the Advisor, to serve as the dealer manager of the Offering pursuant to a dealer manager agreement, as amended and restated on April 30, 2010 (the “Dealer Manager Agreement”). The Company ceased offering shares of common stock in its primary offering on December 31, 2010 and terminated its primary offering on March 22, 2011. The Company terminated its dividend reinvestment plan effective May 29, 2014.




	The Company sold


	182,681,633


	 shares of common stock in its primary offering for gross offering proceeds of


	$1.8 billion


	. The Company sold


	30,903,504


	 shares of common stock under its dividend reinvestment plan for gross offering proceeds of


	$298.2 million


	. Also as of


	December 31, 2016


	, the Company had redeemed


	24,885,185


	 shares sold in the Offering for


	$240.1 million


	.

	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES







	Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation




	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, KBS REIT Holdings II, the Operating Partnership, and their direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries.  All significant intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.




	The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) as contained within the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).




	Use of Estimates




	The preparation of the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates.




	Reclassifications




	Certain amounts in the Company’s prior period consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.  These reclassifications have not changed the results of operations of prior periods.  During the


	year


	 ended


	December 31, 2016


	, the Company sold


	one


	 office/flex property. As a result, certain assets and liabilities were reclassified to held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets for all periods presented.

	 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)




	December 31, 2016








	Revenue Recognition




	Real Estate




	The Company recognizes minimum rent, including rental abatements, lease incentives and contractual fixed increases attributable to operating leases, on a straight-line basis over the term of the related leases when collectibility is reasonably assured and records amounts expected to be received in later years as deferred rent receivable. If the lease provides for tenant improvements, the Company determines whether the tenant improvements, for accounting purposes, are owned by the tenant or the Company. When the Company is the owner of the tenant improvements, the tenant is not considered to have taken physical possession or have control of the physical use of the leased asset until the tenant improvements are substantially completed. When the tenant is the owner of the tenant improvements, any tenant improvement allowance (including amounts that a tenant can take in the form of cash or a credit against its rent) that is funded is treated as a lease incentive and amortized as a reduction of revenue over the lease term. Tenant improvement ownership is determined based on various factors including, but not limited to:













	•






	whether the lease stipulates how a tenant improvement allowance may be spent;
















	•






	whether the amount of a tenant improvement allowance is in excess of market rates;
















	•






	whether the tenant or landlord retains legal title to the improvements at the end of the lease term;
















	•






	whether the tenant improvements are unique to the tenant or general-purpose in nature; and
















	•






	whether the tenant improvements are expected to have any residual value at the end of the lease.







	The Company makes estimates of the collectibility of its tenant receivables related to base rents, including deferred rent receivable, expense reimbursements and other revenue or income. Management specifically analyzes accounts receivable, deferred rent receivable, historical bad debts, customer creditworthiness, current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. In addition, with respect to tenants in bankruptcy, management makes estimates of the expected recovery of pre-petition and post-petition claims in assessing the estimated collectibility of the related receivable. In some cases, the ultimate resolution of these claims can exceed one year. When a tenant is in bankruptcy, the Company will record a bad debt reserve for the tenant’s receivable balance and generally will not recognize subsequent rental revenue until cash is received or until the tenant is no longer in bankruptcy and has the ability to make rental payments.




	The Company recognizes a gain on sales of real estate upon the closing of a transaction with the purchaser. Gains on real estate sold are recognized using the full accrual method when collectibility of the sales price is reasonably assured, the Company is not obligated to perform additional activities that may be considered significant, the initial investment from the buyer is sufficient and other profit recognition criteria have been satisfied. Gain on sales of real estate may be deferred in whole or in part until the requirements for gain recognition have been met.




	Real Estate Loans Receivable




	Interest income on the Company’s real estate loan receivable is recognized on an accrual basis over the life of the investment using the interest method. Direct loan origination fees and origination or acquisition costs, as well as acquisition premiums or discounts, are amortized over the term of the loan as an adjustment to interest income. The Company will place a loan on nonaccrual status when any portion of principal or interest is 90 days past due, or earlier when concern exists as to the ultimate collection of principal or interest. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, the Company will reserve for any unpaid accrued interest and generally will not recognize subsequent interest income until the cash is received, or the loan returns to accrual status. The Company will resume the accrual of interest if it determines the collection of interest, according to the contractual terms of the loan, is probable.




	Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash




	The Company recognizes interest income on its cash and cash equivalents as it is earned and classifies such amounts as other interest income.




	As of


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	2015


	, the Company had a restricted cash balances of


	$0


	 and


	$0.1 million


	, respectively, which are included in prepaid expenses and other assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

	Real Estate




	Depreciation and Amortization




	Real estate costs related to the acquisition and improvement of properties are capitalized and amortized over the expected useful life of the asset on a straight-line basis. Repair and maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred and significant replacements and betterments are capitalized. Repair and maintenance costs include all costs that do not extend the useful life of the real estate asset. The Company considers the period of future benefit of an asset to determine its appropriate useful life. Expenditures for tenant improvements are capitalized and amortized over the shorter of the tenant’s lease term or expected useful life. The Company anticipates the estimated useful lives of its assets by class to be generally as follows:





















	Buildings






	25-40 years








	Building improvements






	10-25 years








	Tenant improvements






	Shorter of lease term or expected useful life









	Tenant origination and absorption costs






	Remaining term of related leases, including below-market renewal periods









	Impairment of Real Estate and Related Intangible Assets and Liabilities




	The Company continually monitors events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that the carrying amounts of its real estate and related intangible assets and liabilities may not be recoverable or realized. When indicators of potential impairment suggest that the carrying value of real estate and related intangible assets and liabilities may not be recoverable, the Company assesses the recoverability by estimating whether the Company will recover the carrying value of the real estate and related intangible assets and liabilities through its undiscounted future cash flows and its eventual disposition. If, based on this analysis, the Company does not believe that it will be able to recover the carrying value of the real estate and related intangible assets and liabilities, the Company would record an impairment loss to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the real estate and related intangible assets and liabilities.




	Real Estate Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations




	The Company generally considers real estate to be “held for sale” when the following criteria are met: (i) management commits to a plan to sell the property, (ii) the property is available for sale immediately, (iii) the property is actively being marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value, (iv) the sale of the property within one year is considered probable and (v) significant changes to the plan to sell are not expected. Real estate that is held for sale and its related assets are classified as “real estate held for sale” and “assets related to real estate held for sale,” respectively, for all periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Notes payable and other liabilities related to real estate held for sale are classified as “notes payable related to real estate held for sale” and “liabilities related to real estate held for sale,” respectively, for all periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Real estate classified as held for sale is no longer depreciated and is reported at the lower of its carrying value or its estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell. Additionally, with respect to properties that were classified as held for sale in financial statements prior to January 1, 2014, the Company records the operating results as discontinued operations for all periods presented if the operations have been or are expected to be eliminated and the Company will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the property following the sale. Operating results of properties that were disposed of or classified as held for sale in the ordinary course of business during the


	years


	 ended


	December 31, 2016


	,


	2015


	 and


	2014


	 that had not been classified as held for sale in financial statements prior to January 1, 2014 are included in continuing operations on the Company’s consolidated statements of operations.




	Change in a Plan to Sell




	When real estate is initially considered “held for sale” it is measured at the lower of its depreciated book value or estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell. Changes in the market may compel the Company to decide to reclassify a property that was designated as held for sale to held for investment.  A property that is reclassified from held for sale to held for investment is measured and recorded at the lower of (i) its carrying amount before the property was classified as held for sale, adjusted for any depreciation and amortization expense that would have been recognized had the property been continuously classified as held and used, or (ii) its fair value at the date of the subsequent decision not to sell. Any adjustment to the carrying amount of the property as a result of the reclassification is included in income from continuing operations as an impairment charge on real estate held for investment.

	KBS REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST II, INC.




	 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)




	December 31, 2016








	Real Estate Loan Receivable




	The Company’s real estate loan receivable is recorded at amortized cost, net of loan loss reserves (if any), and evaluated for impairment at each balance sheet date. The amortized cost of a real estate loan receivable is the outstanding unpaid principal balance, net of unamortized acquisition premiums or discounts and unamortized costs and fees directly associated with the origination or acquisition of the loan.




	As of


	December 31, 2016


	, there was


	no


	 loan loss reserve and the Company did not record any impairment losses related to the real estate loans receivable during the years ended


	December 31, 2016


	,


	2015


	 and


	2014


	. However, in the future, the Company may experience losses from its investments in loans receivable requiring the Company to record loan loss reserves. Realized losses on individual loans could be material and significantly exceed any recorded reserves.




	The reserve for loan losses is a valuation allowance that reflects management’s estimate of loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The reserve is adjusted through “Provision for loan losses” on the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and is decreased by charge-offs to specific loans when losses are confirmed. The Company considers a loan to be impaired when, based upon current information and events, it believes that it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement. The Company also considers a loan to be impaired if it grants the borrower a concession through a modification of the loan terms or if it expects to receive assets (including equity interests in the borrower) with fair values that are less than the carrying value of the loan in satisfaction of the loan. A reserve is established when the present value of payments expected to be received, observable market prices, the estimated fair value of the collateral (for loans that are dependent on the collateral for repayment) or amounts expected to be received in satisfaction of a loan are lower than the carrying value of that loan.




	Failure to recognize impairments would result in the overstatement of earnings and the carrying value of the Company’s real estate loans held for investment. Actual losses, if any, could differ significantly from estimated amounts.




	Marketable Securities




	The Company classifies its investments in marketable securities as available-for-sale, since the Company may sell them prior to their maturity but does not hold them principally for the purpose of making frequent investments and sales with the objective of generating profits on short-term differences in price. These investments are carried at estimated fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Estimated fair values are generally based on quoted market prices, when available, or on estimates provided by independent pricing sources or dealers who make markets in such securities. In certain circumstances, such as when the market for the securities becomes inactive, the Company may determine it is appropriate to perform an internal valuation of the securities. Upon the sale of a security, the previously recognized unrealized gain (loss) is reversed out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and the actual realized gain (loss) is recognized in earnings.




	On a quarterly basis, the Company evaluates its marketable securities for other-than-temporary impairment. The Company reviews the projected future cash flows from these securities for changes in assumptions due to prepayments, credit loss experience and other factors. If, based on the Company’s quarterly estimate of cash flows, there has been an adverse change in the estimated cash flows from the cash flows previously estimated, the present value of the revised cash flows is less than the present value previously estimated, and the fair value of the securities is less than their amortized cost basis, an other-than-temporary impairment is deemed to have occurred.




	The Company recognizes interest income on marketable securities that are beneficial interests in securitized financial assets and are rated “AA” and above on an accrual basis according to the contractual terms of the securities. Discounts or premiums are amortized to interest income over the life of the investment using the interest method.




	The Company recognizes interest income on marketable securities that are beneficial interests in securitized financial assets that are rated below “AA” using the effective yield method, which requires the Company to periodically project estimated cash flows related to these securities and recognize interest income at an interest rate equivalent to the estimated yield on the security, as calculated using the security’s estimated cash flows and amortized cost basis, or reference amount. Changes in the estimated cash flows are recognized through an adjustment to the yield on the security on a prospective basis. Projecting cash flows for these types of securities requires significant judgment, which may have a significant impact on the timing of revenue recognized on these investments.

	KBS REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST II, INC.




	 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)




	December 31, 2016








	The Company is required to distinguish between other-than-temporary impairments related to credit and other-than-temporary impairments related to other factors (e.g., market fluctuations) on its debt securities that it does not intend to sell and where it is not likely that the Company will be required to sell the security prior to the anticipated recovery of its amortized cost basis. The Company calculates the credit component of the other-than-temporary impairment as the difference between the amortized cost basis of the security and the present value of its estimated cash flows discounted at the yield used to recognize interest income. The credit component will be charged to earnings and the component related to other factors is recorded to other comprehensive income (loss).




	Cash and Cash Equivalents




	The Company considers all short-term (with an original maturity of three months or less), highly-liquid investments utilized as part of the Company’s cash-management activities to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents may include cash and short-term investments. Short-term investments are stated at cost, which approximates fair value.




	The Company’s cash and cash equivalents balance exceeds federally insurable limits as of


	December 31, 2016


	. The Company monitors the cash balances in its operating accounts and adjusts the cash balances as appropriate; however, these cash balances could be impacted if the underlying financial institutions fail or are subject to other adverse conditions in the financial markets. To date, the Company has experienced no loss or lack of access to cash in its operating accounts.




	Rents and Other Receivables




	The Company periodically evaluates the collectibility of amounts due from tenants and maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make required payments under lease agreements. In addition, the Company maintains an allowance for deferred rent receivable that arises from the straight-lining of rents. The Company exercises judgment in establishing these allowances and considers payment history and current credit status of its tenants in developing these estimates.




	Derivative Instruments




	The Company enters into derivative instruments for risk management purposes to hedge its exposure to cash flow variability caused by changing interest rates on its variable rate notes payable. The Company records these derivative instruments at fair value on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Derivative instruments designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows or other types of forecasted transactions are considered cash flow hedges. The change in fair value of the effective portion of a derivative instrument that is designated as a cash flow hedge is recorded as other comprehensive income (loss) in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) and consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity. The changes in fair value for derivative instruments that are not designated as a hedge or that do not meet the hedge accounting criteria are recorded as gain or loss on derivative instruments in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.




	The Company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk-management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. This process includes designating all derivative instruments that are part of a hedging relationship to specific forecasted transactions or recognized obligations on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company also assesses and documents, both at the hedging instrument’s inception and on a quarterly basis thereafter, whether the derivative instruments that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows associated with the respective hedged items. When the Company determines that a derivative instrument ceases to be highly effective as a hedge, or that it is probable the underlying forecasted transaction will not occur, the Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively and reclassifies amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings.




	The termination of a cash flow hedge prior to the maturity date may result in a net derivative instrument gain or loss that continues to be reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and is reclassified into earnings over the period of the original forecasted hedged transaction (i.e., LIBOR based debt service payments) unless it is probable that the original forecasted hedged transaction will not occur by the end of the originally specified time period (as documented at the inception of the hedging relationship) or within an additional two-month period of time thereafter. If it is probable that the hedged forecasted transaction will not occur either by the end of the originally specified time period or within the additional two-month period of time, that derivative instrument gain or loss reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) shall be reclassified into earnings immediately.

	Deferred Financing Costs




	Deferred financing costs represent commitment fees, loan fees, legal fees and other third-party costs associated with obtaining financing and are presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the associated debt liability. These costs are amortized over the terms of the respective financing agreements using the interest method. Unamortized deferred financing costs are generally expensed when the associated debt is refinanced or repaid before maturity unless specific rules are met that would allow for the carryover of such costs to the refinanced debt. Deferred financing costs incurred before an associated debt liability is recognized are included in prepaid and other assets on the balance sheet. Costs incurred in seeking financing transactions that do not close are expensed in the period in which it is determined that the financing will not close.




	Fair Value Measurements




	Under GAAP, the Company is required to measure certain financial instruments at fair value on a recurring basis. In addition, the Company is required to measure other non-financial and financial assets at fair value on a non-recurring basis (e.g., carrying value of impaired real estate loans receivable and long-lived assets). Fair value is defined as the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The GAAP fair value framework uses a three-tiered approach. Fair value measurements are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:













	•






	Level 1: unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities;
















	•






	Level 2: quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-derived valuations in which significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets; and
















	•






	Level 3: prices or valuation techniques where little or no market data is available that requires inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.







	When available, the Company utilizes quoted market prices from independent third-party sources to determine fair value and classifies such items in Level 1 or Level 2. In instances where the market for a financial instrument is not active, regardless of the availability of a nonbinding quoted market price, observable inputs might not be relevant and could require the Company to make a significant adjustment to derive a fair value measurement. Additionally, in an inactive market, a market price quoted from an independent third party may rely more on models with inputs based on information available only to that independent third party. When the Company determines the market for a financial instrument owned by the Company to be illiquid or when market transactions for similar instruments do not appear orderly, the Company uses several valuation sources (including internal valuations, discounted cash flow analysis and quoted market prices) and establishes a fair value by assigning weights to the various valuation sources. Additionally, when determining the fair value of liabilities in circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for an identical liability is not available, the Company measures fair value using (i) a valuation technique that uses the quoted price of the identical liability when traded as an asset or quoted prices for similar liabilities when traded as assets or (ii) another valuation technique that is consistent with the principles of fair value measurement, such as the income approach or the market approach.




	Changes in assumptions or estimation methodologies can have a material effect on these estimated fair values. In this regard, the derived fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and, in many cases, may not be realized in an immediate settlement of the instrument.

	The Company considers the following factors to be indicators of an inactive market: (i) there are few recent transactions, (ii) price quotations are not based on current information, (iii) price quotations vary substantially either over time or among market makers (for example, some brokered markets), (iv) indexes that previously were highly correlated with the fair values of the asset or liability are demonstrably uncorrelated with recent indications of fair value for that asset or liability, (v) there is a significant increase in implied liquidity risk premiums, yields, or performance indicators (such as delinquency rates or loss severities) for observed transactions or quoted prices when compared with the Company’s estimate of expected cash flows, considering all available market data about credit and other nonperformance risk for the asset or liability, (vi) there is a wide bid-ask spread or significant increase in the bid-ask spread, (vii) there is a significant decline or absence of a market for new issuances (that is, a primary market) for the asset or liability or similar assets or liabilities, and (viii) little information is released publicly (for example, a principal-to-principal market).




	The Company considers the following factors to be indicators of non-orderly transactions: (i) there was not adequate exposure to the market for a period before the measurement date to allow for marketing activities that are usual and customary for transactions involving such assets or liabilities under current market conditions, (ii) there was a usual and customary marketing period, but the seller marketed the asset or liability to a single market participant, (iii) the seller is in or near bankruptcy or receivership (that is, distressed), or the seller was required to sell to meet regulatory or legal requirements (that is, forced), and (iv) the transaction price is an outlier when compared with other recent transactions for the same or similar assets or liabilities.




	Dividend Reinvestment Plan




	The Company had a dividend reinvestment plan (the “DRP”) through which its stockholders were able to have their dividends and other distributions reinvested in additional shares of the Company’s common stock. In accordance with the DRP, at such time as the Company announced an updated estimated value per share, participants in the DRP were able to acquire shares of common stock under the plan at a price equal to


	95%


	 of the updated estimated value per share of the Company’s common stock. On December 18, 2013, the Company’s board of directors approved an estimated value per share of the Company’s common stock of


	$10.29


	 (unaudited) based on the estimated value of the Company’s assets less the estimated value of the Company’s liabilities, divided by the number of shares outstanding, as of September 30, 2013, with the exception of the Company’s real estate properties, which were appraised as of November 30, 2013. Commencing with the January 2, 2014 purchase date, the purchase price per share under the DRP was


	$9.78


	. On May 15, 2014, the Company’s board of directors approved the termination of the DRP, which termination was effective May 29, 2014.




	Redeemable Common Stock




	The Company has a share redemption program pursuant to which stockholders may sell their shares to the Company only in connection with a stockholder’s death, “qualifying disability” or “determination of incompetence” (each as defined in the share redemption program and, together with redemptions sought in connection with a stockholder’s death, “Special Redemptions”). Such redemptions are subject to an annual dollar limitation and are further subject to the other limitations described in the share redemption program document, including:













	•






	During each calendar year, Special Redemptions are limited to an annual dollar amount determined by the board of directors, which may be reviewed during the year and increased or decreased upon ten business days’ notice to the Company’s stockholders. The dollar limitation for calendar year 2016 was


	$10.0 million


	. On December 9, 2016, the Company’s board of directors approved the dollar amount limitation for Special Redemptions for calendar year 2017 of


	$10.0 million


	 in the aggregate, as may be reviewed and adjusted from time to time by the board of directors.
















	•






	During any calendar year, the Company may redeem no more than


	5%


	 of the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the prior calendar year.
















	•






	The Company has no obligation to redeem shares if the redemption would violate the restrictions on distributions under Maryland General Corporation Law, as amended from time to time, which prohibits distributions that would cause a corporation to fail to meet statutory tests of solvency.







	If the Company cannot repurchase all shares presented for redemption in any month because of the limitations on redemptions set forth in the Company’s share redemption program, then it will honor redemption requests on a pro rata basis, except that if a pro rata redemption would result in a stockholder owning less than the minimum purchase requirement described in the Company’s currently effective, or its most recently effective, registration statement as such registration statement has been amended or supplemented, then the Company would redeem all of such stockholder’s shares.

	Pursuant to the share redemption program, redemptions made in connection with Special Redemptions are made at a price per share equal to the most recent estimated value per share of the Company’s common stock as of the applicable redemption date. The Company does not currently expect to have funds available for ordinary redemptions in the future.




	On December 8, 2015, the Company’s board of directors approved an estimated value per share of the Company’s common stock of


	$5.62


	 (unaudited) based on the estimated value of the Company’s assets less the estimated value of the Company’s liabilities, divided by the number of shares outstanding, all as of September 30, 2015. The change in the redemption price became effective for the December 2015 redemption date, which was December 31, 2015, and was effective until the estimated value per share was updated on December 14, 2016.




	On December 14, 2016, the Company’s board of directors approved an estimated value per share of the Company’s common stock of


	$5.49


	 (unaudited) based on the estimated value of the Company’s assets less the estimated value of the Company’s liabilities, divided by the number of shares outstanding, all as of September 30, 2016. The change in the redemption price became effective for the December 2016 redemption date, which was December 30, 2016, and will be effective until the estimated value per share is updated.




	The estimated value per share was based upon the recommendation and valuation prepared by the Advisor and was performed in accordance with the provisions of and also to comply with Practice Guideline 2013-01, Valuations of Publicly Registered Non-Listed REITs, issued by the Investment Program Association (“IPA”) in April 2013 (the “IPA Valuation Guidelines”). As with any valuation methodology, the methodologies used are based upon a number of estimates and assumptions that may not be accurate or complete. Different parties using different assumptions and estimates could derive a different estimated value per share of the Company’s common stock and this difference could be significant. The estimated value per share is not audited and does not represent the fair value of the Company’s assets less the fair value of the Company’s liabilities according to GAAP, nor does it represent a liquidation value of the Company’s assets and liabilities or the price at which the Company’s shares of common stock would trade on a national securities exchange. The estimated value per share does not reflect a discount for the fact that the Company is externally managed, nor does it reflect a real estate portfolio premium/discount versus the sum of the individual property values. The estimated value per share also did not take into account estimated disposition costs and fees for real estate properties that were not under contract to sell, debt prepayment penalties or swap breakage fees that could apply upon the prepayment of certain of the Company’s debt obligations or termination of related swap agreements prior to expiration or the impact of restrictions on the assumption of debt.




	The value of the Company’s shares will fluctuate over time in response to developments related to individual assets in the portfolio and the management of those assets, in response to fluctuations in the real estate and finance markets and due to other factors. The Company currently expects to utilize the Advisor and/or an independent valuation firm to update the estimated value per share no later than December 2017.




	The Company’s board of directors may amend, suspend or terminate the share redemption program with


	30


	 days’ notice to its stockholders, provided that the Company may increase or decrease the funding available for the redemption of shares under the program upon


	ten


	 business days’ notice to stockholders. The Company may provide this notice by (a) including such information in a Current Report on Form 8-K or in the Company’s annual or quarterly reports, all publicly filed with the SEC or (b) a separate mailing to its stockholders.




	The Company records amounts that are redeemable under the share redemption program as redeemable common stock in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets because the shares are mandatorily redeemable at the option of the holder and therefore their redemption is outside the control of the Company. Pursuant to the share redemption program, effective for redemptions on or after June 18, 2014, the maximum amount redeemable under the Company’s share redemption program is limited to an annual dollar amount determined by Company’s board of directors, as described above. However, because the amounts that can be redeemed in future periods are determinable and only contingent on an event that is likely to occur (e.g., the passage of time), the Company presents the amounts available for future redemptions in future periods as redeemable common stock in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.




	The Company classifies financial instruments that represent a mandatory obligation of the Company to redeem shares as liabilities. The Company’s redeemable common shares are contingently redeemable at the option of the holder. When the Company determines it has a mandatory obligation to redeem shares under the share redemption program, it will reclassify such obligations from temporary equity to a liability based upon their respective settlement values.

	December 31, 2016








	For the


	year


	 ended


	December 31, 2016


	, the Company redeemed


	836,233


	 shares sold in the Offering for


	$4.7 million


	, which represented all redemption requests received in good order and eligible for redemption as Special Redemptions under the share redemption program through the December 2016 redemption date.




	Related Party Transactions




	The Company has entered into the Advisory Agreement with the Advisor. This agreement entitles the Advisor to specified fees upon the provision of certain services with regard to the management of the Company’s investments, among other services, and the disposition of investments, as well as reimbursement of certain costs incurred by the Advisor in providing services to the Company. In addition, the Advisor is entitled to certain other fees, including an incentive fee upon achieving certain performance goals, as detailed in the Advisory Agreement. The Company has entered into a fee reimbursement agreement (the “AIP Reimbursement Agreement”) with the Dealer Manager pursuant to which the Company agreed to reimburse the Dealer Manager for certain fees and expenses it incurs for administering the Company’s participation in the DTCC Alternative Investment Product Platform (“AIP Platform”) with respect to certain accounts of the Company’s investors serviced through the platform. The Advisor and Dealer Manager also serve as the advisor and dealer manager, respectively, for KBS Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc., KBS Real Estate Investment Trust III, Inc., KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT, Inc., KBS Legacy Partners Apartment REIT, Inc., KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II, Inc. and KBS Growth & Income REIT, Inc.




	The Company records all related party fees as incurred, subject to any limitations described in the Advisory Agreement.




	Operating Expenses




	Under the Advisory Agreement, the Advisor has the right to seek reimbursement from the Company for all costs and expenses it incurs in connection with the provision of services to the Company, including the Company’s allocable share of the Advisor’s overhead, such as rent, employee costs, accounting software and cybersecurity costs. Commencing July 1, 2010, the Company has reimbursed the Advisor for the Company’s allocable portion of the salaries, benefits and overhead of internal audit department personnel providing services to the Company. In the future, the Advisor may seek reimbursement for additional employee costs. The Company will not reimburse the Advisor for employee costs in connection with services for which the Advisor earns acquisition, origination or disposition fees (other than reimbursement of travel and communication expenses) or for the salaries and benefits the Advisor or its affiliates may pay to the Company’s executive officers.




	Asset Management Fee




	With respect to investments in real estate, the Company pays the Advisor a monthly asset management fee equal to one-twelfth of


	0.75%


	 of the amount paid or allocated to acquire the investment, plus the cost of any subsequent development, construction or improvements to the property. This amount includes any portion of the investment that was debt financed and is inclusive of acquisition fees and expenses related thereto. In the case of investments made through joint ventures, the asset management fee will be determined based on the Company’s proportionate share of the underlying investment.




	With respect to investments in loans and any investments other than real estate, the Company pays the Advisor a monthly fee calculated, each month, as one-twelfth of


	0.75%


	 of the lesser of (i) the amount paid or allocated to acquire or fund the loan or other investment (which amount includes any portion of the investment that was debt financed and is inclusive of acquisition or origination fees and expenses related thereto) and (ii) the outstanding principal amount of such loan or other investment, plus the acquisition or origination fees and expenses related to the acquisition or funding of such investment, as of the time of calculation.




	With respect to an investment that has suffered an impairment in value, reduction in cash flow or other negative circumstances, such investment may either be excluded from the calculation of the asset management fee described above or included in such calculation at a reduced value that is recommended by the Advisor and the Company’s management and then approved by a majority of the Company’s independent directors, and this change in the fee will be applicable to an investment upon the earlier to occur of the date on which (i) such investment is sold, (ii) such investment is surrendered to a person other than the Company, its direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary or a joint venture or partnership in which the Company has an interest, (iii) the Advisor determines that it will no longer pursue collection or other remedies related to such investment, or (iv) the Advisor recommends a revised fee arrangement with respect to such investment. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, the Company has not determined to calculate the asset management fee at an adjusted value for any investments or to exclude any investments from the calculation of the asset management fee.

	Disposition Fee




	For substantial assistance in connection with the sale of properties or other investments, the Company pays the Advisor or its affiliates


	1.0%


	 of the contract sales price of each property or other investment sold; provided, however, in no event may the disposition fees paid to Advisor, its affiliates and unaffiliated third parties exceed


	6.0%


	 of the contract sales price.




	Income Taxes




	The Company has elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. To continue to qualify as a REIT, the Company must meet certain organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute at least


	90%


	 of the Company’s annual REIT taxable income to stockholders (which is computed without regard to the dividends-paid deduction or net capital gain and which does not necessarily equal net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP). As a REIT, the Company generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income that it distributes as dividends to its stockholders. If the Company fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, it will be subject to federal income tax on its taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates and generally will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost, unless the Internal Revenue Service grants the Company relief under certain statutory provisions. Such an event could materially and adversely affect the Company’s net income and net cash available for distribution to stockholders. However, the Company believes that it is organized and operates in such a manner as to qualify for treatment as a REIT.




	The Company has concluded that there are no significant uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in its financial statements. Neither the Company nor its subsidiaries have been assessed interest or penalties by any major tax jurisdictions. The Company’s evaluations were performed for all open tax years through


	December 31, 2016


	. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, returns for the calendar years 2012 through 2015 remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions.




	Per Share Data




	Basic net income (loss) per share of common stock is calculated by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock issued and outstanding during such period. Diluted net income (loss) per share of common stock equals basic net income (loss) per share of common stock as there were no potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the


	years


	 ended


	December 31, 2016


	,


	2015


	 and


	2014


	, respectively.




	Distributions declared per common share were


	$0.281


	 and


	$0.293


	 in the aggregate for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Distributions per common share were based on a monthly record date for each month during the period commencing January 2015 through December 2016. Distributions declared per common share assumes each share was issued and outstanding each day that was a record date for distributions during this period.




	Distributions declared per common share were


	$5.066


	 in the aggregate for the year ended December 31, 2014. Distributions declared per common share were based on daily record dates for each day during the period commencing January 1, 2014 through August 31, 2014. Distributions declared per common share assumes each share was issued and outstanding each day during this period. For each day that was a record date for distributions during this period, distributions were calculated at a rate of


	$0.00178082


	 per share per day. For the period from September 2014 through December 2014, the Company’s board of directors declared monthly distributions based on a monthly record date for the months of September 2014 through December 2014. Additionally, the Company’s board of directors declared special distributions in the amounts of


	$3.75


	,


	$0.30


	 and


	$0.45


	 per share on the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock on July 8, 2014, August 5, 2014 and August 29, 2014, respectively, for an aggregate amount of


	$4.50


	 per share of common stock, all to stockholders of record as of the close of business on September 15, 2014.

	Segments




	The Company invested in core real estate properties and real estate-related investments with the goal of acquiring a portfolio of income-producing investments. The Company’s real estate properties exhibit similar long-term financial performance and have similar economic characteristics to each other. Beginning with the reporting period commencing on January 1, 2016, the Company aggregated its investments in real estate properties into


	one


	 reportable business segment. The Company considered both quantitative and qualitative thresholds and determined that its investment in a real estate loan receivable does not constitute a reportable segment. Prior to the reporting period commencing on January 1, 2016, the Company had identified


	two


	 reportable business segments based on its investment types: real estate and real estate-related. However, based on the Company’s current investment portfolio, the Company does not believe that its investment in a real estate-related investment is a reportable segment.




	Square Footage, Occupancy and Other Measures




	Square footage, occupancy, number of tenants and other similar measures, including annualized base rent and annualized base rent per square foot, used to describe real estate and real estate-related investments included in these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements are presented on an unaudited basis.




	Recently Issued Accounting Standards Update




	In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,


	Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)


	 (“ASU No. 2014-09”). ASU No. 2014-09 requires an entity to recognize the revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services.  ASU No. 2014-09 supersedes the revenue requirements in


	Revenue Recognition (Topic 605)


	 and most industry-specific guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Codification.  ASU No. 2014-09 does not apply to lease contracts within the scope of


	 Leases (Topic 840).


	ASU No. 2014-09 was to be effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016, and is to be applied retrospectively, with early application not permitted.  In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14,


	Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date


	(“ASU No. 2015-14”), which defers the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 by one year. Early adoption is permitted but not before the original effective date. As the primary source of revenue for the Company is generated through leasing arrangements, which are scoped out of this standard, the Company does not expect the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09 to have a significant impact on its financial statements.




	In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15,


	Presentation of Financial Statements (Subtopic 205-40)


	,


	Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern


	(“ASU No. 2014-15”). The amendments in ASU No. 2014-15 require management to evaluate, for each annual and interim reporting period, whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or are available to be issued when applicable) and, if so, provide related disclosures. ASU No. 2014-15 is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The adoption of ASU No. 2014-15 did not have a significant impact on the Company’s financial statements, although it could require additional disclosures in future periods if conditions or events exist that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.




	In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,


	Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities


	(“ASU No. 2016-01”).  The amendments in ASU No. 2016-01 address certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments.  ASU No. 2016-01 primarily affects accounting for equity investments and financial liabilities where the fair value option has been elected.  ASU No. 2016-01 also requires entities to present financial assets and financial liabilities separately, grouped by measurement category and form of financial asset in the balance sheet or in the accompanying notes to the financial statements.  ASU No. 2016-01 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early application is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued.  The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU No. 2016-01 to have a significant impact on its financial statements.

	Leases (Topic 842)


	 (“ASU No. 2016-02”). The amendments in ASU No. 2016-02 change the existing accounting standards for lease accounting, including requiring lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets and making targeted changes to lessor accounting. ASU No. 2016-02 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption of ASU No. 2016-02 as of its issuance is permitted.

	(“ASU No. 2016-13”).  ASU No. 2016-13 affects entities holding financial assets and net investments in leases that are not accounted for at fair value through net income.  The amendments in ASU No. 2016-13 require a financial asset (or a group of financial assets) measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected.  The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset(s) to present the net carrying value at the amount expected to be collected on the financial asset.  ASU No. 2016-13 also amends the impairment model for available-for-sale securities.  An entity will recognize an allowance for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities as a contra-account to the amortized cost basis rather than as a direct reduction of the amortized cost basis of the investment, as is currently required.   ASU No. 2016-13 also requires new disclosures.  For financial assets measured at amortized cost, an entity will be required to disclose information about how it developed its allowance for credit losses, including changes in the factors that influenced management’s estimate of expected credit losses and the reasons for those changes.  For financing receivables and net investments in leases measured at amortized cost, an entity will be required to further disaggregate the information it currently discloses about the credit quality of these assets by year of the asset’s origination for as many as five annual periods. For available for sale securities, an entity will be required to provide a roll-forward of the allowance for credit losses and an aging analysis for securities that are past due.  ASU No. 2016-13 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  The Company is still evaluating the impact of adopting ASU No. 2016-13 on its financial statements, but does not expect the adoption of ASU No. 2016-13 to have a material impact on its financial statements.




	In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,


	Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments


	 (“ASU No. 2016-15”).  ASU No. 2016-15 is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows.  The amendments in ASU No. 2016-15 provide guidance on eight specific cash flow issues, including the following that are or may be relevant to the Company: (a) Cash payments for debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs should be classified as cash outflows for financing activities; (b) Cash payments relating to contingent consideration made soon after an acquisition’s consummation date (i.e., approximately three months or less) should be classified as cash outflows for investing activities. Payments made thereafter should be classified as cash outflows for financing activities up to the amount of the original contingent consideration liability. Payments made in excess of the amount of the original contingent consideration liability should be classified as cash outflows for operating activities; (c) Cash payments received from the settlement of insurance claims should be classified on the basis of the nature of the loss (or each component loss, if an entity receives a lump-sum settlement); (d) In the absence of specific guidance, an entity should classify each separately identifiable cash source and use on the basis of the nature of the underlying cash flows. For cash flows with aspects of more than one class that cannot be separated, the classification should be based on the activity that is likely to be the predominant source or use of cash flow.  ASU No. 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period.  The Company is still evaluating the impact of adopting ASU No. 2016-15 on its financial statements, but does not expect the adoption of ASU No. 2016-15 to have a material impact to its financial statements.

	In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18,


	Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash


	 (“ASU No. 2016-18”). ASU No. 2016-18 requires that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents.  Therefore, amounts generally described as restricted cash should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning of period and end of period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows.  ASU No. 2016-18 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  The Company elected to early adopt ASU No. 2016-18 for the reporting period ended December 31, 2016 and it was applied retrospectively. As a result of the adoption of ASU No. 2016-18, the Company no longer presents the changes within restricted cash in the consolidated statements of cash flows.  




	In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01,


	Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business


	 (“ASU No. 2017-01”) to add guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses.  ASU No. 2017-01 provides a screen to determine when an integrated set of assets and activities (collectively referred to as a “set”) is not a business. The screen requires that when substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired (or disposed of) is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets, the set is not a business.  If the screen is not met, ASU No. 2017-01 (1) requires that to be considered a business, a set must include, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create output and (2) removes the evaluation of whether a market participant could replace missing elements.  ASU No. 2017-01 provides a framework to assist entities in evaluating whether both an input and a substantive process are present. The framework includes two sets of criteria to consider that depend on whether a set has outputs.  Although outputs are not required for a set to be a business, outputs generally are a key element of a business; therefore, the FASB has developed more stringent criteria for sets without outputs.  ASU No. 2017-01 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted.  The amendments can be applied to transactions occurring before the guidance was issued (January 5, 2017) as long as the applicable financial statements have not been issued.  The Company elected to early adopt ASU No. 2017-01 for the reporting period beginning January 1, 2017. As a result of the adoption of ASU No. 2017-01, the Company’s acquisitions of investment properties beginning January 1, 2017 could qualify as an asset acquisition (as opposed to a business combination).  Therefore, transaction costs associated with asset acquisitions will be capitalized, while these costs associated with business combinations will continue to be expensed as incurred.

	Operating Leases




	The Company’s real estate properties are leased to tenants under operating leases for which the terms and expirations vary. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, the leases had remaining terms, excluding options to extend, of up to


	14.8


	 years with a weighted-average remaining term of


	5.4


	 years. Some of the leases have provisions to extend the term of the leases, options for early termination for all or part of the leased premises after paying a specified penalty, rights of first refusal to purchase the property at competitive market rates, and other terms and conditions as negotiated. The Company retains substantially all of the risks and benefits of ownership of the real estate assets leased to tenants. Generally, upon the execution of a lease, the Company requires a security deposit from the tenant in the form of a cash deposit and/or a letter of credit. The amount required as a security deposit varies depending upon the terms of the respective lease and the creditworthiness of the tenant, but generally is not a significant amount. Therefore, exposure to credit risk exists to the extent that a receivable from a tenant exceeds the amount of its security deposit. Security deposits received in cash related to tenant leases are included in other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and totaled


	$2.5 million


	 and


	$2.4 million


	 as of


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	2015


	, respectively.




	During the


	years


	 ended


	December 31, 2016


	,


	2015


	 and


	2014


	, the Company recognized deferred rent from tenants, net of lease incentive amortization, of


	$6.5 million


	,


	$6.7 million


	 and


	$5.8 million


	, respectively. As of


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	2015


	, the cumulative deferred rent balance was


	$60.5 million


	 and


	$52.3 million


	, respectively, and is included in rents and other receivables on the accompanying balance sheets. The cumulative deferred rent balance included


	$11.0 million


	 and


	$11.9 million


	 of unamortized lease incentives as of


	December 31, 2016

	 options to extend the term of this lease for three, four, five, six or seven years per option term, provided that the combined renewal option terms do not exceed


	10


	 years. If Union Bank elects to exercise it extension options, it must extend the lease on (i) the entire office premise or (ii) no less than


	200,000


	 rentable square feet consisting of full floors only plus either all or none of both the retail and vault space.




	No other tenant accounted for more than 10% of annualized base rent.




	Geographic Concentration Risk




	As of


	December 31, 2016


	, the Company’s net investments in real estate in California and New Jersey represented


	33.8%


	 and


	22.1%


	 of the Company’s total assets, respectively.  As a result, the geographic concentration of the Company’s portfolio makes it particularly susceptible to adverse economic developments in the California and New Jersey real estate markets.  Any adverse economic or real estate developments in these markets, such as business layoffs or downsizing, industry slowdowns, relocations of businesses, changing demographics and other factors, or any decrease in demand for office space resulting from the local business climate, could adversely affect the Company’s operating results and its ability to make distributions to stockholders.




	Impairment of Real Estate




	The Company did not recognize any impairment charges during the


	year


	 ended


	December 31, 2016


	.




	During the


	year


	 ended


	December 31, 2015


	, the Company recorded impairment charges of


	$23.1 million


	, including an impairment charge of


	$18.6 million


	 to write-down the carrying value of the 100 & 200 Campus Drive Buildings, an office property located in Florham Park, New Jersey, to its estimated fair value as a result of changes in cash flow estimates. The decrease in cash flow projections was primarily due to (i) the lack of demand in the Florham Park office rental market resulting in slower rent growth and longer lease up periods and (ii) an increase in projected vacancy related to a tenant occupying


	199,024


	 rentable square feet, or approximately


	34%


	 of the 100 & 200 Campus Drive Buildings. This tenant’s lease expired in November 2016. The Company is currently concentrating its efforts to re-lease the vacated space. As a result, the Company revised its cash flow projections for longer lease up periods and additional tenant improvement costs and leasing concessions required to attract new tenants.




	In addition, during the


	year


	 ended


	December 31, 2015


	, the Company recorded impairment charges of


	$4.5 million


	 with respect to


	two


	 real estate properties that were reclassified from held for sale to held for investment. The impairment charges were recorded to adjust the carrying values of the properties for any depreciation and amortization expense that would have been recognized if the properties had always been classified as held for investment, which otherwise would have been recorded through depreciation and amortization expense.

	December 31, 2016








	During the


	year


	 ended


	December 31, 2014


	, the Company recorded impairment charges of


	$15.6 million


	, including


	$10.6 million


	 of impairments with respect to a real estate property held for investment and


	$3.9 million


	 of impairments with respect to


	two


	 real estate properties that were reclassified from held for sale to held for investment. The Company recognized an impairment charge during the


	year


	 ended


	December 31, 2014


	 to reduce the carrying value of the Company’s investment in the 300-600 Campus Drive Buildings to its estimated fair value.  The impairment was caused by the Company revising its cash flow projections and the estimated hold period of the investment due to longer than estimated lease-up periods and lower projected rental rates. The impairment charge with respect to


	two


	 real estate properties that were reclassified from held for sale to held for investment was recorded to adjust the carrying values of the properties for any depreciation and amortization expense that would have been recognized if the properties had always been classified as held for investment, which otherwise would have been recorded through depreciation and amortization expense and rental income (related to the amortization of above-market lease assets and below-market lease liabilities). See Note 6, “Real Estate Sales,” for information regarding the


	$1.1 million


	 of impairments of real estate assets sold in 2014.

	(3)



	 As of


	December 31, 2016


	, the Amended and Restated Portfolio Revolving Loan Facility was secured by Pierre Laclede Center. On May 17, 2016, in connection with the disposition of the 350 E. Plumeria Building, the Company repaid


	$22.8 million


	 of principal due under this loan and the 350 E. Plumeria Building was released as security from the Amended and Restated Portfolio Revolving Loan Facility.





	(4)



	 On September 23, 2016, the Company entered into a second modification agreement to the loan agreement with the lender to, among other changes, modify the initial maturity date from September 15, 2016 to March 15, 2017. The Company may extend the maturity date to September 15, 2017, subject to certain conditions set forth in the second modification agreement.  As of


	December 31, 2016


	,


	$105.0 million


	 of the Union Bank Plaza Mortgage Loan had been disbursed to the Company with the remaining loan balance of


	$14.3 million


	 available for future disbursements, subject to certain conditions set forth in the loan agreement.





	(5)



	As of


	December 31, 2016


	, Portfolio Mortgage Loan #1 was secured by Horizon Tech Center, Granite Tower and Gateway Corporate Center. Subsequent to December 31, 2016, the Company is in negotiations with the lender to extend the maturity date of Portfolio Mortgage Loan #1 and the lender has issued a letter agreement to the Company, stating that the Company is not in default under the loan.





	(6)



	 On March 1, 2016, the Company entered into a modification agreement with the lender to reduce the loan commitment amount to


	$70.0 million


	. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, the principal balance under Portfolio Mortgage Loan #3 consisted of the


	$42.0 million


	 non-revolving portion and


	$12.0 million


	 revolving portion. Also as of


	December 31, 2016


	,


	$16.0 million


	 of the total revolving capacity of


	$28.0 million


	 remained unfunded and available for future disbursements, subject to certain terms and conditions contained in the loan documents. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, Portfolio Mortgage Loan #3 was secured by the 100 & 200 Campus Drive Buildings and Willow Oaks Corporate Center. Subsequent to


	December 31, 2016


	, the Company exercised its second extension option with the lender to extend the maturity date of Portfolio Mortgage Loan #3 to March 1, 2018 and reduced the loan commitment to


	$54.0 million


	, of which


	$32.4 million


	 was non-revolving debt and


	$21.6 million


	 was revolving debt.





	(7)



	 Monthly payments are initially interest-only. Beginning on May 1, 2017,


	monthly


	 payments for the Corporate Technology Centre Mortgage Loan will include principal and interest with principal payments calculated using an amortization schedule of


	30


	 years for the balance of the loan term, with the remaining principal balance, all accrued and unpaid interest and any other amounts due at maturity.

	DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS







	The Company enters into derivative instruments for risk management purposes to hedge its exposure to cash flow variability caused by changing interest rates. The primary goal of the Company’s risk management practices related to interest rate risk is to prevent changes in interest rates from adversely impacting the Company’s ability to achieve its investment return objectives. The Company does not enter into derivatives for speculative purposes.




	The Company enters into interest rate swaps as a fixed rate payer to mitigate its exposure to rising interest rates on its variable rate notes payable. The value of interest rate swaps is primarily impacted by interest rates, market expectations about interest rates, and the remaining life of the instrument. In general, increases in interest rates, or anticipated increases in interest rates, will increase the value of the fixed rate payer position and decrease the value of the variable rate payer position. As the remaining life of the interest rate swap decreases, the value of both positions will generally move towards zero.




	The following table summarizes the notional amount and other information related to the Company’s interest rate swaps as of


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	2015


	. The notional amount is an indication of the extent of the Company’s involvement in each instrument at that time, but does not represent exposure to credit, interest rate or market risks (dollars in thousands):

	The change in fair value of the effective portion of a derivative instrument that is designated as a cash flow hedge is recorded as other comprehensive income (loss) in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) and as other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity. Amounts in other comprehensive income (loss) will be reclassified into earnings in the periods in which earnings are affected by the hedged cash flow.  The change in fair value of the ineffective portion is recognized directly in earnings. With respect to swap agreements that were terminated for which it remains probable that the original hedged forecasted transactions (i.e., LIBOR-based debt service payments) will occur, the loss related to the termination of these swap agreements is included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and is reclassified into earnings over the period of the original forecasted hedged transaction.

	 All of the Company’s interest rate swap agreements were initially designated as cash flow hedges.

	FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES







	Under GAAP, the Company is required to measure certain financial instruments at fair value on a recurring basis. In addition, the Company is required to measure other non-financial and financial assets at fair value on a non-recurring basis (e.g., carrying value of impaired real estate loans receivable and long-lived assets). Fair value is defined as the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The GAAP fair value framework uses a three-tiered approach. Fair value measurements are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:













	•






	Level 1: unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities;
















	•






	Level 2: quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-derived valuations in which significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets; and
















	•






	Level 3: prices or valuation techniques where little or no market data is available that requires inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.

	 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)




	December 31, 2016








	The fair value for certain financial instruments is derived using a combination of market quotes, pricing models and other valuation techniques that involve significant management judgment. The price transparency of financial instruments is a key determinant of the degree of judgment involved in determining the fair value of the Company’s financial instruments. Financial instruments for which actively quoted prices or pricing parameters are available and for which markets contain orderly transactions will generally have a higher degree of price transparency than financial instruments for which markets are inactive or consist of non-orderly trades. The Company evaluates several factors when determining if a market is inactive or when market transactions are not orderly. The following is a summary of the methods and assumptions used by management in estimating the fair value of each class of assets and liabilities for which it is practicable to estimate the fair value:




	Cash and cash equivalents, rent and other receivables, and accounts payable and accrued liabilities:


	 These balances approximate their fair values due to the short maturities of these items.




	Real estate loan receivable:


	 The Company’s real estate loan receivable is presented in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at its amortized cost net of recorded loan loss reserves (if applicable) and not at fair value. The fair value of the real estate loan receivable was estimated using an internal valuation model that considered the expected cash flows for the loan, underlying collateral value (for collateral-dependent loans) and estimated yield requirements of institutional investors for loans with similar characteristics, including remaining loan term, loan-to-value, type of collateral and other credit enhancements. The Company classifies these inputs as Level 3 inputs.




	Derivative instruments:


	 The Company’s derivative instruments are presented at fair value on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The valuation of these instruments is determined using a proprietary model that utilizes observable inputs. As such, the Company classifies these inputs as Level 2 inputs. The proprietary model uses the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, as well as observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and volatility. The fair values of interest rate swaps are estimated using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted fixed cash payments and the discounted expected variable cash receipts. The variable cash receipts are based on an expectation of interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate curves. In addition, credit valuation adjustments, which consider the impact of any credit risks to the contracts, are incorporated in the fair values to account for potential nonperformance risk.




	Notes payable:


	 The fair value of the Company’s notes payable is estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis based on management’s estimates of current market interest rates for instruments with similar characteristics, including remaining loan term, loan-to-value ratio, type of collateral and other credit enhancements. Additionally, when determining the fair value of liabilities in circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for an identical liability is not available, the Company measures fair value using (i) a valuation technique that uses the quoted price of the identical liability when traded as an asset or quoted prices for similar liabilities when traded as assets or (ii) another valuation technique that is consistent with the principles of fair value measurement, such as the income approach or the market approach.

	 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)




	December 31, 2016








	Disclosure of the fair values of financial instruments is based on pertinent information available to the Company as of the period end and requires a significant amount of judgment. Low levels of transaction volume for certain financial instruments have made the estimation of fair values difficult and, therefore, both the actual results and the Company’s estimate of value at a future date could be materially different.




	During the


	year


	 ended


	December 31, 2016

	RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS







	The Company has entered into the Advisory Agreement with the Advisor. This agreement entitles the Advisor to specified fees upon the provision of certain services with regard to the management of the Company’s investments, among other services, and the disposition of investments, as well as reimbursement of certain costs incurred by the Advisor in providing services to the Company. In addition, the Advisor is entitled to certain other fees, including an incentive fee upon achieving certain performance goals, as detailed in the Advisory Agreement. The Company has also entered into a fee reimbursement agreement with the Dealer Manager pursuant to which the Company agreed to reimburse the Dealer Manager for certain fees and expenses it incurs for administering the Company’s participation in the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation Alternative Investment Product Platform with respect to certain accounts of the Company’s investors serviced through the platform. The Advisor and Dealer Manager also serve as the advisor and dealer manager, respectively, for KBS Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc., KBS Real Estate Investment Trust III, Inc., KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT, Inc., KBS Legacy Partners Apartment REIT, Inc., KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II, Inc. and KBS Growth & Income REIT, Inc.




	On January 6, 2014, the Company, together with KBS Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc., KBS Real Estate Investment Trust III, Inc., KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT, Inc., KBS Legacy Partners Apartment REIT, Inc., KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II, Inc., the Dealer Manager, the Advisor and other KBS-affiliated entities, entered into an errors and omissions and directors and officers liability insurance program where the lower tiers of such insurance coverage are shared. The cost of these lower tiers is allocated by the Advisor and its insurance broker among each of the various entities covered by the program, and is billed directly to each entity. The allocation of these shared coverage costs is proportionate to the pricing by the insurance marketplace for the first tiers of directors and officers liability coverage purchased individually by each REIT. The Advisor’s and the Dealer Manager’s portion of the shared lower tiers’ cost is proportionate to the respective entities’ prior cost for the errors and omissions insurance. In June 2015, KBS Growth & Income REIT, Inc. was added to the insurance program at terms similar to those described above. The Company has renewed its participation in the program, and the program is effective through June 30, 2017.




	During the years ended


	December 31, 2016


	,


	2015


	 and


	2014


	, no other business transactions occurred between the Company and KBS Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc., KBS Real Estate Investment Trust III, Inc., KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT, Inc., KBS Legacy Partners Apartment REIT, Inc., KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II, Inc. and KBS Growth & Income REIT, Inc.

	COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES







	Economic Dependency




	The Company is dependent on the Advisor for certain services that are essential to the Company, including the disposition of real estate and real estate-related investments; management of the daily operations of the Company’s real estate and real estate-related investment portfolio; and other general and administrative responsibilities. In the event the Advisor is unable to provide any of these services, the Company will be required to obtain such services from other sources.




	Environmental




	As an owner of real estate, the Company is subject to various environmental laws of federal, state and local governments. Compliance with existing environmental laws is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations as of


	December 31, 2016


	.




	Legal Matters




	From time to time, the Company is party to legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of its business. Management is not aware of any legal proceedings of which the outcome is probable or reasonably possible to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations or financial condition, which would require accrual or disclosure of the contingency and possible range of loss. Additionally, the Company has not recorded any loss contingencies related to legal proceedings in which the potential loss is deemed to be remote.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
