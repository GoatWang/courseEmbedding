Tilly Levine, co-founder of Tillys and founder of Tilly’s Life Center poses with Dr. Tod Burnett, president of Saddleback College and board member for Tilly’s Life Center





By PRESS RELEASESOver the weekend, Tilly Levine, co-founder of Tillys clothing chain and founder of Tilly’s Life Center (TLC) delivered an empowering commencement speech at the 48th Graduation Ceremony for Saddleback College in Mission Viejo, California. Levine took this time to assure the graduating class of 2017 that with a positive mindset anything is possible. Levine shared a few powerful life lessons that have helped shape her into the successful, influential and positive business woman and philanthropist she is today: 1. Your thoughts create your reality, 2. You can’t control many things in life, but you can control how they affect you and 3. Shout your dreams.“Repeat after me, I am awesome, I am accomplished, I am powerful, I am talented, I am smart, I am a gift and I am a graduate,” said Tilly Levine, followed by the graduating class of 2017. Levine kicked-off her speech with an exercise performed regularly at Tilly’s Life Center — creating and repeating positive affirmations to train the mind to think positively.It was a full circle moment for Levine and TLC, when they learned that Viviana Camacho, one of TLC’s first-ever alumni from its pilot program at the Boys & Girls Clubs of Capistrano Valley, graduated this weekend from Saddleback College with an Associate in Arts in Sociology."TLC taught me how to be positive, especially in stressful and difficult times in high school. In college, the meditation practices that I learned from TLC helped me adapt and get through even harder times,” said Viviana Camacho.TLC is a youth-focused nonprofit empowerment program founded by Levine in 2012 with a mission “to inspire today’s youth to reach their full potential as productive, kind, happy, and responsible individuals.”More on: TillysTilly LevineTilly’s Life Center

We carry all the popular summer and winter styles in Tilley Hats, including bestselling summer hats such as the LTM5 and LTM6 Airflow styles, as well as the Winter TW2 and other Tilley winter hats in wool and wool blends.
Get Some Tech on Your Head!
Tilley Hats' high quality organic and synthetic materials never break down and keep your head temperature controlled, whether it's hot or cold.  Tilley Hats are light as a feather, buoyant and virtually indestructible.  They work hard developing and patenting materials which are ideal for the adventurer, and sailor Alex Tilley (the company's founder) frequently tests new Tilley Hats Styles on his schooner.
Lifetime Guaranteed
A unique guarantee for the hat industry, you get Tilley Hats' lifetime guarantee with every Tilley hat you purchase! If you wear out your Tilley Hat, you can get it replaced (but really, we've never seen this happen, even once!). Since Tilley hats float, tie-on, refuse to rip or wrinkle, and are washable and packable, there's scarcely anything you could try to hurt your Tilley Hat. That's why Tilley can offer this special "hat insurance."

Made in Canada
The Making of a Tilley Hat
Play











 






























Prepping & Cutting
Steps 1 to 6
It all starts with the fabric. After unravelling and spreading out yards of fabric, the cutting begins. Brim, binding and the crown are cut in small batches to ensure consistency. For the mesh style hats, the mesh is attached to the crown.







Sewing It Together
Steps 7 to 30
The hand cut materials, 15 separate pieces sewn together by talented artisans. From topstitching the brim, making the crown (seven steps alone!), to attaching the sweatband and inserting the brim wire; each step is meticulously followed – with 23 different sets of hands involved.







Finishing Touches
Steps 31 to 41
The finishing touches are added: windcords crown foam, owner’s manual. Only once every loose thread has been snipped and the Hats steamed are they ready to leave the factory.










Our Story
In 1980, frustrated that he couldn’t find a worthwhile sailing Hat, Alex Tilley decided to oversee the creation of some proper Hats for himself and other Toronto sailors, as a mid-winter’s hobby.
The Hat had to float, stay on, be unsinkable, last indefinitely and look attractive. Alex received design advice from milliner, information about materials from a sail-maker and then oversaw its manufacture.
Over the next few years, his hobby became a small business. In 1984, he established Tilley Endurables as a fledging mail order company in Toronto and began creating travel specific clothing along with Hats. Over 30 years later we continue our quest to make the best in the world, right here in Canada.
