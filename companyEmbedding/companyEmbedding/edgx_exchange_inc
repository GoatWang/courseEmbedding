History[edit]
The firm began in 1998 as an electronic communication network (ECN) under the name Attain. In 2005, the assets of Attain were purchased by Knight Capital Group and subsequently spun off two years later as the re-branded Direct Edge ECN. The spin-off brought in new management as well as new ownership—Citadel Derivatives Group and Goldman Sachs were brought in as partners alongside Knight. The partnership was further diluted when in 2008 the International Securities Exchange relinquished operational control of their stock exchange arm to Direct Edge in return for a 31.5% stake.[2]
On March 12, 2010, Direct Edge received official approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to convert both EDGA and EDGX ECN platforms into two newly established national securities exchanges.[3] In July 2010, Direct Edge successfully made the transition, decommissioning both ECN platforms and the ISE Stock Exchange, leaving what is now America’s newest stock exchange.[4] In November 2011 Direct Edge annunciated intention to open an stock exchange outside the United States, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in the last quarter of 2012.[5]
On January 31, 2014, BATS Global Markets and Direct Edge completed a merger, with the combined company using the BATS Global Markets name.[6]

In 2005, the assets of Attain were purchased by Knight Capital Group and subsequently spun off two years later as the re-branded Direct Edge ECN. The spin-off brought in new management as well as new ownership—Citadel Derivatives Group and Goldman Sachs were brought in as partners alongside Knight. The partnership was further diluted when in 2008 the International Securities Exchange relinquished operational control of their stock exchange arm to Direct Edge in return for a 31.5% stake.[2]
On March 12, 2010, Direct Edge received official approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to convert both EDGA and EDGX ECN platforms into two newly established national securities exchanges.[3] In July 2010, Direct Edge successfully made the transition, decommissioning both ECN platforms and the ISE Stock Exchange, leaving what is now America’s newest stock exchange.[4] In November 2011 Direct Edge annunciated intention to open an stock exchange outside the United States, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in the last quarter of 2012.[5]
On January 31, 2014, BATS Global Markets and Direct Edge completed a merger, with the combined company using the BATS Global Markets name.[6]

Management[edit]
Direct Edge was led by Chief Executive Officer William O’Brien. Bryan Harkins served as Chief Operating Officer.
Milestones[edit]

Direct Edge matches over 1 billion shares for the first time on February 10, 2009.[8]
Direct Edge captures all-time high 12.9% market share for the month of August 2009.[9]
March 2009, Direct Edge passes BATS Trading in monthly matched market share making it the third largest stock market operator in the United States, a position it held for 11 consecutive months.[10]
Direct Edge officially launches its two stock exchanges, EDGA and EDGX, on July 21, 2010.[11]
Direct Edge and BATS Global Markets complete their merger on January 31, 2014.[12]

The Exchange proposes to amend the market data section of its fee schedule to: (i) Establish a Digital Media Enterprise Fee for the BATS One Feed; and (ii) make a non-substantive change to the description of the BATS One Feed Enterprise fee.
The Commission recently approved a proposed rule change by the Exchange to establish a new market data product called the BATS One Feed [5] 
           as well as published proposed rule changes to establish related fees.[6] 
           The BATS One Feed is a data feed that disseminates, on a real-time basis, the aggregate best bid and offer (“BBO”) of all displayed orders for securities traded on EDGX and its affiliated exchanges [7] 
           and for which the BATS Exchanges report quotes under the Consolidated Tape Association (“CTA”) Plan or the Nasdaq/UTP Plan.[8] 
           The BATS One Feed also contains the individual last sale information for the BATS Exchanges (collectively with the aggregate BBO, the “BATS One Summary Feed”). In addition, the BATS One Feed contains optional functionality which enables recipients to receive aggregated two-sided quotations from the BATS Exchanges for up to five (5) price levels (“BATS One Premium Feed”).
BATS One Digital Media Enterprise Fee
The Exchange proposes to amend its fee schedule to establish a Digital Media Enterprise Fee of $15,000 per month for the BATS One Summary Feed and $25,000 per month for the BATS One Premium Feed. As an alternative to User fees,[9] 
           a recipient firm may purchase a monthly Digital Media Enterprise license to receive the BATS One Feed from an External Distributor [10] 
           to distribute to an unlimited number of Professional and Non-Professional Users [11] 
           for viewing via television, Web sites, and mobile devices for informational and non-trading purposes only without having to account for the extent of access to the data or the report the number of Users to the Exchange. The Digital Media Enterprise Fee would be in addition to the Data Consolidation Fee.[12]

Non-Substantive Change to the Description of the BATS One Enterprise Fee
The Exchange proposes a non-substantive change to the description of the BATS One Enterprise fee. The fee schedule currently states that, “[a]s an alternative to User fees, a recipient firm may purchase a monthly Enterprise Fee to receive the BATS One Feed from an External Distributor for an unlimited number of Professional and Non-Professional Users.” The Exchange proposes to amend this sentence in two ways. The first amendment is to state that a recipient firm may purchase a monthly Enterprise license, rather than Enterprise fee, as the term “license” is a more accurate description. The second is to specify that the recipient firm purchasing a monthly enterprise license does so to distribute the BATS One Feed to an unlimited number of Professional and Non-Professional Users.
2. Statutory Basis
BATS One Digital Media Enterprise Fee
The Exchange believes that the proposed Digital Media Enterprise Fee for the BATS One Feed is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act,[13] 
           in general, and Section 6(b)(4) of the Act,[14] 
           in particular, in that it provides for an equitable allocation of reasonable fees among recipients of the data and is not designed to permit unfair discrimination among customers, brokers, or dealers. The Exchange also believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 11(A) of the Act [15] 
           in that it supports (i) fair competition among brokers and dealers, among exchange markets, and between exchange markets and markets other than exchange markets and (ii) the availability to brokers, dealers, and investors of information with respect to quotations for and transactions in securities. Furthermore, the proposed rule change is consistent with Rule 603 of Regulation NMS,[16] 
           which provides that any national securities exchange that distributes information with respect to quotations for or transactions in an NMS stock do so on terms that are not unreasonably discriminatory. In adopting Regulation NMS, the Commission granted self-regulatory organizations and broker-dealers increased authority and flexibility to offer new and unique market data products to the public. It was believed that this authority would expand the amount of data available to consumers, and also spur innovation and competition for the provision of market data.
In addition, the proposed fee is equitable and not unfairly discriminatory because it will apply uniformly to market data vendors, television broadcasters, Web site and mobile service providers. The Exchange believes it is reasonable to establish a lower cost fee structure that is designed to facilitate broader media distribution of the BATS One Data Feed for informational purposes because it will benefit investors generally.
In establishing the Digital Media Enterprise Fee, the Exchange recognizes that there is demand for a more seamless and easier-to-administer data distribution mode that takes into account the expanded variety of media and communication devices that investors utilize today. The Exchange believes the Digital Media Enterprise Fee will be easy to administer because data recipients that purchase it would not be required to differentiate between Professional and Non-Professional Users, account for the extent of access to the data, or report the number of Users. This is a significant reduction on a recipient firm's administrative burdens and is a significant value to investors. For example, a television broadcaster could display the BATS One Feed data during market-related programming and on its Web site or allow viewers to view the data via their mobile devices, creating a more seamless distribution model that will allow investors more choice in how they receive and view market data, all without having to account for and/or measure who accesses the data and how often they do so.
The proposed Digital Media Enterprise Fee is equitable and reasonable because it will also enable recipient firms to more widely distribute data from the BATS One Feed to investors for informational purposes at a lower cost than is available today. For example, a recipient firm may purchase an Enterprise license in the amount of $50,000 per month for the BATS One Summary Feed and $100,000 per month for the BATS One Premium Feed to receive the BATS One Feed from an External Distributor for an unlimited number of Professional and Non-Professional Users, which is greater than the Digital Media Enterprise fee proposed herein. The Exchange also believes the amount of the Digital Enterprise [sic] is reasonable as compared to the existing Enterprise fees discussed above because the distribution of BATS One Feed data is limited to television, Web sites, and mobile devices for informational purposes only, while distribution of the BATS One Feed data pursuant to an Enterprise license contains no such limitation. The Exchange also believes that the proposed Digital Media Enterprise fee is equitable and reasonable because it is less than similar fees charged by other exchanges.[17] 

The Exchange has taken into consideration its affiliated relationship with EDGA, BYX, and BZX in proposing the Digital Media Enterprise fee to assure that vendors would be able to offer a similar product on the same terms as the Exchange from a cost perspective. While the BATS Exchanges are the exclusive distributors of the individual data feeds from which certain data elements may be taken to create the BATS One Feed, they are not the exclusive distributors of the aggregated and consolidated information that comprises the BATS One Feed. As discussed in in [sic] the BATS One Fee Proposal,[18] 
           any entity may separately purchase the individual underlying products, and if they so choose, perform a similar aggregation and consolidation function that the Exchange performs in creating the BATS One Feed, and offer a data feed with the same information included in the BATS One Feed to sell and distribute it to its clients with no greater cost than the Exchange.
To enable such competition, the Exchange is offering the Digital Media Enterprise license for the BATS One Feed on terms that a subscriber of the underlying feeds could offer a competing product if it so chooses. The BATS One Feed is comprised of data included in EDGX Depth, EDGA Depth, BYX Depth, and BZX Depth.[19] 
           Currently, an External Distributor could create a competing product to the BATS One Premium Feed [20] 

           by purchasing each of these depth of book products Start Printed Page 17806from the individual BATS Exchanges and then performing its own aggregation and consolidation functions. The combined External Distributor fees for these individual data feeds of the BATS Exchanges is $12,500 per month.[21] 
           An External Distributor that seeks to create a competing product to the BATS One Summary Feed could instead subscribe to the following data feeds: EDGX Top, EDGX Last Sale, EDGA Top, EDGA Last Sale, BZX Top, BZX Last Sale, BYX Top, and BYX Last Sale,[22] 
           and then perform their own aggregation and consolidation function. The combined External Distributor fees for these individual data feeds of the BATS Exchanges is $5,000 per month.[23] 
           The Exchange proposes to charge a Digital Media Enterprise Fee ($15,000 per month for the BATS One Summary Feed and $25,000 per month for the BATS One Premium Feed, plus the $1,000 per month Data Consolidation fee) that exceeds the combined External Distributor fees for each of the individual feeds listed above to ensure that vendors could compete with the Exchange by creating the same product as the BATS One Feed to sell to their clients at no greater cost than the Exchange.
The decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in NetCoalition v.  SEC, 615 F.3d 525 (D.C. Cir. 2010), upheld the Commission's reliance upon the existence of competitive market mechanisms to set reasonable and equitably allocated fees for proprietary market data.
In fact, the legislative history indicates that the Congress intended that the market system `evolve through the interplay of competitive forces as unnecessary regulatory restrictions are removed' and that the SEC wield its regulatory power `in those situations where competition may not be sufficient,' such as in the creation of a `consolidated transactional reporting system.'

Id. at 535 (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 94-229 at 92 (1975), as reprinted in 1975 U.S.C.C.A.N. 323). The court agreed with the Commission's conclusion that “Congress intended that `competitive forces should dictate the services and practices that constitute the U.S. national market system for trading equity securities.' ” [24] 

As explained below in the Exchange's Statement on Burden on Competition, the Exchange believes that there is substantial evidence of competition in the marketplace for data and that the Commission can rely upon such evidence in concluding that the fees established in this filing are the product of competition and therefore satisfy the relevant statutory standards.[25] 
           In addition, the existence of alternatives to the BATS One Feed, including real-time consolidated data, free delayed consolidated data, and proprietary last sale data from other sources, as described below, further ensures that the Exchange cannot set unreasonable fees, or fees that are unreasonably discriminatory, when vendors and users can elect such alternatives.
As the NetCoalition decision noted, the Commission is not required to undertake a cost-of-service or ratemaking approach, and the Exchange incorporates by reference into this proposed rule change its affiliate's analysis of this topic in another rule filing.[26] 

For these reasons, the Exchange believes that the proposed fees are reasonable, equitable, and not unfairly discriminatory.
Non-Substantive Change to the Description of the BATS One Enterprise Fee
The Exchange believes that the proposed change to the BATS One Enterprise Fee is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act,[27] 
           in general, and Section 6(b)(4) of the Act,[28] 
           in particular, in that it provides for an equitable allocation of reasonable fees among recipients of the data and is not designed to permit unfair discrimination among customers, brokers, or dealers. The proposal to amend the description of the Enterprise fee within the fee schedule is equitable and reasonable because the changes are designed to clarify the fee schedule and avoid potential investor confusion. The proposed changes do not amend the amount or application of the BATS One Enterprise fee. The proposed changes are also non-discriminatory as they would apply to all recipient firms uniformly.
B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition
The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act, as amended.
BATS One Digital Media Enterprise Fee
The BATS One Feed Digital Media Enterprise fee will enhance competition because it provides investors with an alternative option for receiving market data and competes directly with similar market data products currently offered by the NYSE and Nasdaq.[29] 
           The Exchange notes that there is already actual competition for products similar to the BATS One Feed. The NYSE offers BQT which provides BBO and last sale information for the NYSE, NYSE Arca Equities, Inc. and NYSE MKT LLC.[30] 
           Nasdaq offers Nasdaq Basic, a filed market data product, and through its affiliate, offers NLS Plus which provides a unified view of last sale information similar to the BATS One Feed.[31] 
           The existence of these competing data products demonstrates that there is ample, existing competition for products such as the BATS One Feed and the fees associated by such products is constrained by competition.
In establishing the proposed fees, the Exchange considered the competitiveness of the market for proprietary data and all of the implications of that competition. The Exchange believes that it has considered all relevant factors in order to establish Start Printed Page 17807fair, reasonable, and not unreasonably discriminatory fees and an equitable allocation of fees among all Users. The existence of alternatives to the BATS One Feed, including the existing underlying feeds, consolidated data, and proprietary data from other sources, ensures that the Exchange cannot set unreasonable fees, or fees that are unreasonably discriminatory, when vendors and subscribers can elect these alternatives or choose not to purchase a specific proprietary data product if its cost to purchase is not justified by the returns any particular vendor or subscriber would achieve through the purchase.
Finally, although the BATS Exchanges are the exclusive distributors of the individual data feeds from which certain data elements would be taken to create the BATS One Feed, the Exchange is not the exclusive distributor of the aggregated and consolidated information that would compose the BATS One Feed. The Exchange has taken into consideration its affiliated relationship with EDGA, BYX, and BZX in its design of the BATS One Feed to assure that vendors would be able to offer a similar product on the same terms as the Exchange from a cost perspective. While the BATS Exchanges are the exclusive distributors of the individual data feeds from which certain data elements may be taken to create the BATS One Feed, they are not the exclusive distributors of the aggregated and consolidated information that comprises the BATS One Feed. As discussed in in the BATS One Fee Proposal,[32] 
           any entity may separately purchase the individual underlying products, and if they so choose, perform a similar aggregation and consolidation function that the Exchange performs in creating the BATS One Feed, and offer a data feed with the same information included in the BATS One Feed to sell and distribute it to its clients with no greater cost than the Exchange.
To enable such competition, the amount of the proposed Digital Media Enterprise license compared to the cost of the individual data feeds from the BATS Exchanges would enable a vendor to receive the underlying data feeds and offer a similar product on a competitive basis and with no greater cost than the Exchange. The amount of the proposed Digital Media Enterprise license, coupled with the Data Consolidation Fee, is not lower than the cost to a vendor of receiving the underlying data feeds to create a competing product. Therefore, the amount of the proposed Digital Media Enterprise license the Exchange would charge clients for the BATS One Feed compared to the cost of the individual data feeds from the BATS Exchanges would enable a vendor to receive the underlying data feeds and offer a similar product on a competitive basis and with no greater cost than the Exchange.
Non-Substantive Change to the Description of the BATS One Enterprise Fee
The proposal to amend the description of the Enterprise fee within the fee schedule will not have any impact on completion [sic]. The proposed changes are designed to clarify the fee schedule and avoid potential investor confusion and do not amend the amount or application of the BATS One Enterprise fee.
C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others
The Exchange has neither solicited nor received written comments on the proposed rule change.
III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action
The foregoing rule change has become effective pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act [33] 
           and paragraph (f) of Rule 19b-4 thereunder.[34] 
           At any time within 60 days of the filing of the proposed rule change, the Commission summarily may temporarily suspend such rule change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.

Start Preamble
        
        
        
        August 17, 2015.
        Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Act”),[1] 
           and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,[2] 
           notice is hereby given that on August 7, 2015, EDGX Exchange, Inc. (the “Exchange” or “EDGX”) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) the proposed rule change as described in Items I and II below, which Items have been prepared by the Exchange. The Exchange has designated this proposal as a “non-controversial” proposed rule change pursuant to section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act [3] 
           and Rule 19b-4(f)(6)(iii) thereunder,[4] 
           which renders it effective upon filing with the Commission. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.
I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change
The Exchange filed a proposal to amend Rule 13.8 to describe a market data product known as EDGX Book Viewer.
The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Exchange's Web site at www.batstrading.com, at the principal office of the Exchange, and at the Commission's Public Reference Room.
II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change
In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant parts of such statements.
(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change
1. Purpose
The Exchange proposes to add language to Rule 13.8 describing a market data product known as EDGX Book Viewer. The proposal memorializes in the Exchange's rules a data feed that is currently available through the Exchange's public Web site free of charge. EDGX Book Viewer is a data feed that disseminates, on a real-time basis, the aggregated two-side quotations for up to five (5) price levels for all displayed orders for securities traded on the Exchange and for which the Exchanges reports quotes under the Consolidated Tape Association (“CTA”) Plan or the Nasdaq/UTP Plan. EDGX Book Viewer also contains the last ten (10) trades including time of trade, price and share quantity. Book Viewer is currently available via www.batstrading.com without charge. The Exchange will file a separate proposed rule change with the Commission proposing fees to be charged for certain types of access to EDGX Book Viewer as of September 1, 2015.[5] 

2. Statutory Basis
The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Start Printed Page 50897section 6(b) of the Act,[6] 
           in general, and furthers the objectives of section 6(b)(5) of the Act,[7] 
           in particular, in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system, and to protect investors and the public interest, and that it is not designed to permit unfair discrimination among customers, brokers, or dealers. This proposal is in keeping with those principles in that it promotes increased transparency through the dissemination of EDGX Book Viewer. The Exchange also believes this proposal is consistent with section 6(b)(5) of the Act because it protects investors and the public interest and promotes just and equitable principles of trade by providing investors with an alternative for receiving market data as requested by market data vendors and purchasers that expressed an interest in exchange-only data for instances where consolidated data is no longer required to be purchased and displayed. The proposed rule change would benefit investors by facilitating their prompt access to real-time depth-of-book information contained in EDGX Book Viewer. The proposed rule change also removes impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system by memorializing in the Exchange's rules a data feed that is currently available through the Exchange's public Web site free of charge.
The Exchange also believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with section 11(A) of the Act [8] 
           in that it supports (i) fair competition among brokers and dealers, among exchange markets, and between exchange markets and markets other than exchange markets and (ii) the availability to brokers, dealers, and investors of information with respect to quotations for and transactions in securities. Furthermore, the proposed rule change is consistent with Rule 603 of Regulation NMS,[9] 
           which provides that any national securities exchange that distributes information with respect to quotations for or transactions in an NMS stock do so on terms that are not unreasonably discriminatory. EDGX Book Viewer is accessed and subscribed to on a voluntary basis, in that neither the Exchange nor market data distributors are required by any rule or regulation to make this data available. Accordingly, distributors and subscribers can discontinue use at any time and for any reason.
In adopting Regulation NMS, the Commission granted self-regulatory organizations and broker-dealers increased authority and flexibility to offer new and unique market data to consumers of such data. It was believed that this authority would expand the amount of data available to users and consumers of such data and also spur innovation and competition for the provision of market data. The Exchange believes that the data products proposed herein are precisely the sort of market data products that the Commission envisioned when it adopted Regulation NMS. The Commission concluded that Regulation NMS—by lessening regulation of the market in proprietary data—would itself further the Act's goals of facilitating efficiency and competition:
[E]fficiency is promoted when broker-dealers who do not need the data beyond the prices, sizes, market center identifications of the NBBO and consolidated last sale information are not required to receive (and pay for) such data. The Commission also believes that efficiency is promoted when broker-dealers may choose to receive (and pay for) additional market data based on their own internal analysis of the need for such data.[10] 

By removing “unnecessary regulatory restrictions” on the ability of exchanges to sell their own data, Regulation NMS advanced the goals of the Act and the principles reflected in its legislative history.
In addition, EDGX Book Viewer removes impediments to and perfects the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system because EDGX Book Viewer provides investors with alternative market data and competes with similar market data product currently offered by the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (“NYSE”) and the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”).[11] 
           The provision of new options for investors to receive market data was a primary goal of the market data amendments adopted by Regulation NMS.[12] 
           EDGX Book Viewer is precisely the sort of market data product that the Commission envisioned when it adopted Regulation NMS.
(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition
The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. The proposal is not intended to address any competitive issues, but rather to memorialize in the Exchange's rules a data feed that is currently available through the Exchange's public Web site free of charge. Nonetheless, the Exchange believes that the proposal will promote competition by the Exchange offering a service similar to that offered by the NYSE and Nasdaq.[13] 
           Thus, the Exchange believes this proposed rule change is necessary to permit fair competition among national securities exchanges. Therefore, the Exchange does not believe the proposed rule change will result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.
(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants or Others
The Exchange has neither solicited nor received written comments on the proposed rule change.
III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action
The Exchange has designated this rule filing as non-controversial under section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act [14] 
           and paragraph (f)(6) of Rule 19b-4 thereunder.[15] 

           The proposed rule change effects a change that: (A) Does not significantly affect the protection of investors or the public interest; (B) does not impose any significant burden on competition; and (C) by its terms, does not become operative for 30 days after the date of the filing, or such shorter time as the Start Printed Page 50898Commission may designate if consistent with the protection of investors and the public interest; provided that the self-regulatory organization has given the Commission written notice of its intent to file the proposed rule change, along with a brief description and text of the proposed rule change, at least five business days prior to the date of filing of the proposed rule change, or such shorter time as designated by the Commission.[16] 

At any time within 60 days of the filing of the proposed rule change, the Commission summarily may temporarily suspend such rule change if it appears to the Commission that such action is: (i) Necessary or appropriate in the public interest; (ii) for the protection of investors; or (iii) otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. If the Commission takes such action, the Commission shall institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule should be approved or disapproved.
IV. Solicitation of Comments
Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing, including whether the proposal is consistent with the Act. Comments may be submitted by any of the following methods:

DEFINITION of 'EDGX'
A high-volume trading platform owned by Direct Edge ECN LLC, the third largest market center worldwide. EDGX is a type of electronic communication network (ECN) that allows traders to trade with one another directly on an exchange instead of having to go through a middleman. NYSE Arca, Nasdaq, and BATS are examples of other high-volume ECNs. In 2009, EDGX traded more than 2 billion shares of U.S. cash equity per day.      

BREAKING DOWN 'EDGX'
EDGX charges liquidity takers and rebates liquidity providers. As of 2009, EDGX provides a 0.0025 credit for adding liquidity. The charge for removing liquidity is 0.0028. This structure is appealing to limit traders. Direct Edge also has another ECN platform, EDGA, which does not charge to provide or take liquidity. These costs are important to the bottom line for active traders. In mid-2009, Direct Edge applied to the SEC to convert the EDGX and EDGA platforms into stock exchanges.
