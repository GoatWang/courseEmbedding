Vendor Terms & Conditions


November 1, 2012
The following standard terms and conditions shall apply to all purchase orders delivered by Continental Materials (CMI) to its vendors from and after 11/1/2012. These standard terms and conditions shall apply to all purchase orders with CMI.s vendors, except to the extent that CMI has entered into a separate written agreement with a particularly vendor. These terms and conditions are subject to change at any time and any such changes shall become effective upon their posting to our website. Please retain a copy of these terms and conditions for your files, unless otherwise notified by CMI to the contrary. For additional information or if you have any questions regarding our terms and conditions, please contact us at 215-884-4930 or This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it.
 

Purchase Orders. Orders for goods or products to be provided by Vendor (the "Products") to Continental Materials, Inc. ("CMI") require a written purchase order or other agreement setting forth the quantity, price and delivery terms for the Products (the "Order"). These terms and conditions are incorporated into all such Orders. CMI may place Orders by mail, email, facsimile or orally by telephone, provided that all such oral telephone Orders are promptly confirmed in writing by mail, email or facsimile. The Order may specify additional terms or conditions, and in the event of conflict the additional terms and conditions shall govern unless expressly agreed otherwise in writing by both parties.
Delivery. Time is of the essence in the performance of the Order. Delivery of Products will be in accordance with the instructions (place, time and manner) set forth on the Order. Any delivery not in conformity with the Order may at CMI.s discretion be returned to Vendor, who shall bear the related expenses and risks. In the event of non-conformity, CMI has the right to request immediate replacement or repair of the non-conforming Products, in addition to any other remedy described in this Agreement.
Invoices. All Vendor invoices shall be in a format reasonably acceptable to CMI, describing the Products which have been supplied. Invoices shall be sent to: Continental Materials, Inc., [1614 Old York Road, Abington, Pennsylvania 19001, Attn: Mark Brock]. All invoices are subject to verification. Payment of any invoice does not constitute inspection of Products and shall not operate as a waiver of CMI.s rights under these terms and conditions. Payment shall be made within [thirty (30)] days of receipt of invoice.
Termination. CMI may terminate any Order for cause by notice in writing if: (a) Vendor commits any material breach of any Order and does not take all necessary and reasonable steps to cure the breach within [ten (10)] days of written notice of default; (b) Vendor seeks relief, or its creditors bring action against it or its direct or indirect parent, under any bankruptcy or insolvency law; (c) Vendor ceases or suspends operation of its business; or (d) Vendor is a party to a merger, acquisition, or sale as a consequence of which substantially all of its business relating to the performance of the Products is transferred. If an Order is terminated for any reason, sections 5, 7 and 13 of these terms and conditions shall survive termination and shall remain in full force and effect.
Taxes. Sales tax, if due, must be separately specified on all invoices.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
