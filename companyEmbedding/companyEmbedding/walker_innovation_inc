Invention Philosophy:
Inside Our Inventive Force

“We are focused on solving problems located at the intersection of human behavior and large-scale digital networks.”

Learn more




 

Invention Philosophy
Beginning in 1994, Jay Walker and his invention team began focusing on solving problems located at the intersection of human behavior and large-scale digital networks.
Jay and his team recognized that although the world around us changes constantly, the world within us – how and why we behave the way we do – is fairly stable across time and context. They believed that a deep understanding of consumer needs and behaviors is essential to developing solutions that people embrace and value. In that sense, they are “behavior-focused” inventors in a world filled with new technologies. 




Innovating in a World of Repeatable Patterns
While it may be true that human nature has not changed much in the last 20 or 50 years, or even since the ancient Greeks first wrote tragedies and comedies, the tools we have to express our behaviors have changed radically. Today, digital devices and data-driven networks are all around us and we are constantly connected. The success of new networks inevitably creates unexpected new capabilities and opportunities, as history has shown time and again.



               The railroads, the electrical network and the interstate highway system are all examples of earlier networks that both connected us and transformed us. Each fundamentally changed the way people around the world lived, worked, traveled and interacted socially and commercially.            




The world is experiencing a recurrence of this pattern with today’s digital networks.
This new reality has forced a rethinking of every industry along the lines of its information flow. In the digital age, a large part of the commercial economy derives substantial value from creating, capturing, manipulating, storing, retrieving and moving information across networks — as opposed to more traditional activities such as forging steel or growing crops (both of which become more information-intensive every year).
The team’s focus on behavior and network thinking allowed them to address problems that are fundamentally multi-industry, something that makes the Walker Digital portfolio of inventions unique. As an example, the desire to be rewarded doesn’t change all that much whether we’re pumping gas, buying clothing at a retail store or making travel arrangements online. And, nowadays, most of these transactions take place at a digital point of access to a network.
"So…how might we create a new business system that satisfies our universal need to be rewarded and leverages low-cost, high-speed network capacity? How might the desire for privacy be balanced against our desire to receive valuable advertisements? How might our willingness to accept certain kinds of product uncertainty be traded for a lower price when shopping?"
These are the kinds of questions Jay Walker and the invention team at Walker Digital asked itself over the years. These are the questions that enabled them to unlock new ideas that have formed the basis of successful commercial business and partnerships, as well as the intellectual property assets owned by Walker Innovation.
The team’s focus on behavior and network thinking allowed them to address problems that are fundamentally multi-industry. 

            Forced rethinking makes us ask ourselves “How can we reinvent businesses given the unlimited nature of our new digital reality?"

    Walker Home  <  About Walker  <  What We Do  <  Walker Innovations




At Walker, innovation takes shape in many  ways. 
It may be a unique training exercise developed to help  employees become more engaged in customer initiatives. Or a technology tool  that seamlessly delivers customer insights to a mobile device. Or a framework  to better understand key growth strategies. Or even a methodology for  accurately determining what programs will have the most impact on customer  loyalty.
Whatever it may be, we never stop developing new and  creative ways to help companies earn more from their customer relationships.  Below is a sampling of innovations that are unique to Walker. Take a look and  contact us if you want to learn more about the many unique innovations we bring  to every client engagement.






Walker uses this framework for measuring loyalty and assessing the  stability of an organization's customer base. This versatile approach provides  businesses with a practical means to leverage the voice of the customer for  improved business performance.

This  app gives account managers the ability to instantly access  all the feedback from a company or individual contact, see which contacts have  responded to a survey, and send survey reminders via their mobile device.





This process helps an acquiring company's management team  before, during, and after a merger or acquisition, by providing additional,  objective information. The solution arms an acquiring company with  critical insights about the target's' customers to help accelerate value  creation and manage risks during a strategic acquisition.

Walker uses the latest tools to  collect and analyze unstructured comments from customers and turn them into relevant, actionable information.






Walker's social media capability enables companies to combine  unsolicited information about their brand, their competition, or a topic of  interest from social media sources with other sources of information including  solicited customer feedback, financial indicators, and operational metrics.

Walker has developed a solution to seamlessly integrate  customer feedback directly into SFDC – the CRM tool countless sales  professionals rely on daily – rendering it even more valuable in improving  customer relationships. Walker's unique integration application delivers  customer feedback and customized reports in a user-friendly format that promotes  action, follow up and positive results.

The Walker Index is a measure of the aggregate performance of the  stock of publicly-traded Walker clients. It was established to track how Walker  clients created shareholder value compared to the broader market indices.
Learn more





An online application that links busy account managers to feedback provided by the  customers they serve.





Scorecards pull together all the right information into a concise report that is  delivered on a timely basis. Walker works with our clients to help them  understand the specific needs each user is going to have, and then we deliver  it in a format where they can easily take action. We can tailor them to fit any  clients' needs from complex reports, or a high-level approach, such as  playbooks.





Walker creates online dashboards allowing easy access and  interaction with timely and dynamic information. These allow you to have full  drill-down capabilities, and tailored reporting, to understanding what is  behind all of the data.





A framework Walker uses to transform customer feedback into action and results. It includes  four essential elements – organization, process, communication, and motivation  and three organizational levels – corporate, business and functional, and  customer-facing.





A framework Walker  uses to determine what needs to happen to get employees engaged and supporting  customer relationship strategies in organizations.





This is an award winning interactive exercise to demonstrate  the concept and value of leveraging customer information. Entertaining and  informative, Face Value is appropriate for groups as small as five, or as large as 500.

Walker BI (Business  Intelligence) tools provide our clients with the most flexibility and capability when analyzing customer information. To do this,  Walker has invested in business Intelligence technology from the premier  providers.





Walker's online tool helps companies ensure they have a reliable method for closing the loop with customers – resolving problems as well as finding hidden sales opportunities.





Walker's single sign on allows clients to use  their existing login system to be integrated into Walker’s system. This  promotes efficiency and convenience of putting customer information into our  client’s tools and systems.

	WALKER INNOVATION
	ANNOUNCES FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2016 RESULTS




	 




	Records Realized
	Gain of Approximately $7.1 Million in Connection with Upside Share Sale




	 




	Completes Year
	with $10.3 Million of Cash and No Outstanding Debt on Balance Sheet



	 


	Stamford,
	CT – February 7, 2017 – Walker Innovation Inc. (OTCQB: WLKR) (“Walker Innovation” or
	the “Company”), an innovation services firm that seeks to help companies improve their internal product and
	business development efforts and also owns a portfolio of its own intellectual property, today announced fourth quarter and
	full year 2016 results.


	 



	Fourth Quarter
	2016 Highlights



	 







	·




	The Company recorded a realized gain of approximately $7.1 million
	in connection with its exercise and sale of 3.75 million shares associated with its warrant to acquire shares of The Upside Commerce
	Group, LLC (“Upside”), a new business travel service founded and launched by Jay Walker.










	·




	The Company recorded a non-cash, unrealized gain of approximately
	$7.6 million in connection with the ownership of its warrant to acquire shares of Upside. The Company still holds a warrant to
	purchase 12.65 million shares of Upside.










	·




	The Company recognized revenue of approximately $1.9 million during
	the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $2.0 million for the fourth quarter 2015.










	·




	The Company reported net income for the fourth quarter of 2016 of
	$15.4 million, or $0.43 per share on a diluted basis, compared to a net loss of $0.4 million, or a loss per share of $0.02, in
	the prior-year period.










	·




	As of December 31, 2016, Walker Innovation had $10.3 million in cash
	and no outstanding long-term debt on its consolidated balance sheet.





	 



	Jonathan Siegel Promoted to Chief Executive Officer




	 




	Given the
	recent launch of Upside and the potential value of the Upside warrant held by the Company, Jonathan Ellenthal has determined that
	devoting his full attention to Upside is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. Accordingly, Mr. Ellenthal
	has stepped down from his position as CEO to join the Upside team in a full-time capacity. Mr. Ellenthal

	will continue to
	serve the Company as Vice Chairman and a member of the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors.


	 


	The Company also announced today that its
	Board of Directors has promoted its President Jonathan Siegel to Chief Executive Officer, effective February 3, 2017.


	 


	“Walker Innovation is in a much stronger
	position than it was one year ago and with the recent launch of Upside, now is the right time for Jon Siegel to lead Walker Innovation
	as its CEO,” said Mr. Ellenthal. “This move will allow me to focus my full attention on working to make Upside an unqualified
	success, which will directly benefit Walker Innovation through the ownership of its warrant. While I will no longer be involved
	in the Company’s day-to-day operations, I remain enthusiastic about advising and helping determine Walker Innovation’s
	long-term strategy. Once I made the decision to step aside, it was clear that Jon was the right person to lead Walker Innovation
	into its next chapter.”


	 



	“I
	am excited about becoming CEO of Walker Innovation and want to thank the Board and Jon Ellenthal for this opportunity to lead the
	Company in a pivotal period,” said Mr. Siegel.

	“With a much stronger balance sheet and no outstanding debt,
	we are now well positioned to move forward with our efforts to acquire an operating business in order to create additional value
	for shareholders. We intend to continue developing a solid initial list of potential targets, and will take a disciplined approach
	conducting our due diligence to ensure that we identify an appropriate opportunity.”


	 






	 





	 




	 



	“For
	the fourth quarter, we significantly strengthened our cash position with the profitable sale of part of our ownership in Upside,
	while still retaining the majority of our warrant,” added Mr. Siegel. “With the successful launch of Upside last month,
	we remain optimistic that we will have an opportunity in the future to deliver additional shareholder value from the warrant.”



	 



	Fourth Quarter
	2016 Results



	 


	For the fourth
	quarter ended December 31, 2016, Walker Innovation reported total revenue of $1.9 million generated by licensing fees and custom
	revenue versus total revenue of $2.0 million in the prior-year period.


	 


	Management expects
	that the timing and results of patent prosecution and the Company’s enforcement proceedings relating to its intellectual
	property rights will fluctuate from period to period.


	 


	Total operating
	expenses for the fourth quarter 2016 were approximately $1.3 million versus $1.9 million in the prior-year period, primarily due
	to reduced overhead by eliminating positions and streamlining processes to conserve cash across its business.


	 


	During the fourth
	quarter, the Company recorded a realized gain of approximately $7.1 million in connection with its exercise and sale of 3.75 million
	shares associated with its warrant to acquire shares of Upside. The Company also recorded a non-cash, unrealized gain of approximately
	$7.6 million in connection with the ownership of its warrant to acquire shares of Upside. The Company still holds a warrant to
	purchase 12.65 million shares or approximately 11% of Upside on a fully diluted basis.


	 


	Net income for
	the fourth quarter of 2016 was $15.4 million compared to net loss of $0.4 million in the prior-year period. Basic net income per
	common share for the fourth quarter of 2016 was $0.74 and diluted net income per common share was $0.43 for the fourth quarter
	of 2016, compared to net loss per common share of $0.02 in the prior-year period.


	 



	Liquidity and Capital Resources



	 


	As of December
	31, 2016, Walker Innovation had $10.3 million in cash and no outstanding long-term debt on its consolidated balance sheet.
