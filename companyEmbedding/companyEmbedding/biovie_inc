ABOUT

BioVie (OTC PINK: BIVI) is pioneering an innovative therapeutic approach targeting ascites due to liver cirrhosis. Ascites, or the accumulation of fluid in the abdomen, is the most common complication of cirrhosis due to NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis), alcoholic liver disease and/or hepatitis C.  Ascites affects about 100,000 Americans and many times more worldwide, and contributes substantially to mortality. Our therapy BIV201 is based on a drug that is not yet available in the US but is approved in about 50 countries to treat related complications of liver cirrhosis.
The Company, formerly knows as NanoAntibiotics, Inc., recently acquired LAT Pharma LLC. This merger provided our lead development program, BIV201. Following a pre-investigational new drug meeting (“pre-IND”) with the FDA in early 2016, the Company is now assembling its IND package, and may commence a US clinical trial as early as 2017.

One Patient’s Perspective  “I developed ascites 9 months ago as a result of cirrhosis of the liver caused by hepatitis C. Since I stopped responding to diuretics, I have to have about 10 liters of ascites fluid drained by paracentesis every 2 weeks. I have an open prescription and can have paracentesis as often as needed. For me the point comes when the buildup of pressure and resulting pain in my abdomen becomes unbearable, and it becomes impossible to eat and I am forced to lie down. Although I feel tremendous relief after a paracentesis, losing about 15 lbs afterwards, the fluid returns rapidly and I regain the weight. After a week, the discomfort starts to build up and I feel miserable until the next paracentesis. Then the cycle starts all over again. I am fortunate because I have not had any complications (like infections) so far. I am hoping to be put on the liver transplant list soon, but I expect to spend another 6 months like this while I wait for a transplant.”

  BioVie Overview Presentation - April 2017   BIVI Non-conf Overview_Apr 2017
  
  Distinguished BioPharma Executive Hari Kumar Joins BioVie Board of Directors and Purchases Company Stock - May 10, 2017   BEVERLY, MA–(Marketwired – May 10, 2017) – BioVie Inc. (OTCQB: BIVI), a clinical-stage company focused on the discovery, development, and commercialization of innovative drug therapies for liver disease, today welcomed Dr. Hari Kumar, a highly accomplished biopharmaceutical industry executive, to its Board of Directors as an independent director. In addition, Dr. Kumar purchased common shares of BioVie stock through a private placement.
After earning a PhD in immunology in 1984, Dr. Kumar embarked upon a successful career in the biopharmaceutical industry. He held positions of increasing responsibility at Roche Pharma culminating in serving as Global Business Development Director, and in 2007 assumed the role of Chief Business Officer for Amira Pharmaceuticals. He led the sale of Amira to Bristol-Myers Squibb in 2011 for $475 million. He then served as Chief Executive Officer (CEO) for Panmira Pharmaceuticals LLC, which is developing anti-inflammatory compounds, and in 2013 became CEO for Adheron Therapeutics, which Roche Pharma acquired in 2015 for $580 million. Beyond his impressive track record, Dr. Kumar brings deep experience in fibrotic and liver diseases to the Company.
“We are very pleased that Hari is joining our team,” said BioVie CEO Jonathan Adams. “He has expertise in our therapeutic area and will contribute to planning the clinical development of our Orphan Drug candidate BIV201, which is about to enter a Phase 2 clinical trial. On a strategic level he will assist with seeking to build substantial company value. His enthusiasm for BioVie was apparent from our first discussion about four months ago.”
Dr. Kumar commented: “Speaking with the Company’s core team members, including their preeminent medical advisor Guadalupe Garcia-Tsao MD, reinforced my opinion that BIV201 has the potential to become an important medical breakthrough for patients at risk of life-threatening complications due to advanced liver cirrhosis. I look forward to working with the team at BioVie to pursue success for this potential new therapy and for the overall company.”
BIV201 is a continuous infusion of the peptide terlipressin, initially being developed by BioVie for the treatment of refractory ascites. It will soon commence a Phase 2a trial in 6 patients with liver cirrhosis and ascites refractory to, or intolerant of, diuretic therapy requiring large-volume paracentesis. Terlipressin, dosed differently, is approved in about 40 countries for other complications of liver cirrhosis arising from a similar disease pathway. Terlipressin is not available in the US and currently there are no FDA-approved drugs specifically for treating ascites. More information about the trial may be found at clinicaltrials.gov, identifier: NCT03107091.
About BioVie Inc.
BioVie Inc. is a clinical-stage company pursuing the discovery, development, and commercialization of innovative drug therapies. The Company is currently focused on developing and commercializing BIV201, a novel approach to the treatment of ascites due to chronic liver cirrhosis. In March 2017, BioVie received notification from the FDA that it could initiate a Phase 2a US clinical trial. BIV201 has the potential to improve the health of thousands of patients suffering from life-threatening complications of liver cirrhosis due to hepatitis, NASH, and alcoholism. It has Orphan Drug designation for the most common of these complications, ascites, which represents a significant unmet medical need. The FDA has never approved any drug specifically for treating ascites. For more information about BioVie and BIV201, please visit our website: www.biovieinc.com.
About Liver Cirrhosis and Ascites
More than 600,000 Americans and millions worldwide suffer from liver cirrhosis. Cirrhosis is the 12th-leading cause of death due to disease in the US, killing an estimated 40,000 people each year. The condition results primarily from hepatitis, alcoholism, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) linked to fatty liver disease and obesity. Ascites is a common complication of advanced liver cirrhosis. With no medications approved by the FDA specifically for treating ascites, an estimated 40% of patients die within two years of diagnosis. Certain drugs approved for other uses may provide initial relief, but patients often fail to respond to them as ascites worsens. In addition to patient suffering, US treatment costs for liver cirrhosis, including ascites and other complications, are estimated at more than $4 billion annually.

  BioVie Signs Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) to Conduct a Phase 2a Clinical Trial of BIV201 in Refractory Ascites Patients - April 25, 2017   
BEVERLY, MA–(Marketwired – April 25, 2017) – BioVie Inc. (OTCQB: BIVI), a clinical-stage company focused on the discovery, development, and commercialization of innovative drug therapies for liver disease, today announced the signing of a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) to conduct a Phase 2a clinical trial of BIV201 in patients with refractory or intractable ascites due to advanced liver cirrhosis. The study is titled: Safety and pharmacodynamic activity of low-dose terlipressin delivered by continuous intravenous infusion in patients with cirrhosis and refractory ascites requiring recurrent large volume paracentesis.”
BIV201 is a continuous infusion of the peptide terlipressin, initially being developed for the treatment of refractory ascites. Terlipressin, dosed differently, is approved in about 40 countries for other complications of liver cirrhosis arising from a similar disease pathway. Terlipressin is not available in the US and currently there are no FDA-approved drugs specifically for treating ascites. The Orphan drug candidate BIV201 represents a potential new treatment option for Americans suffering from refractory ascites, a life-threatening condition.
The study site Principal Investigator (PI) for the Phase 2a clinical trial is Jasmohan Bajaj, MD. Dr. Bajaj commented: “We are excited to participate in this initial clinical study of continuous low-dose infusion terlipressin in refractory ascites without major renal impairment. The results from our 6-patient trial will help to inform the remainder of the BIV201 clinical development program. It’s an important study for patients with advanced ascites who could benefit from this drug therapy if it is eventually approved.”
BioVie’s medical advisor, Guadalupe Garcia-Tsao, MD, one of the world’s leading experts in this field, will work closely with the clinical trial team as a consultant for the BIV201 clinical development program. Dr. Garcia-Tsao said: “Many US liver disease specialists are aware of terlipressin, which has a long track record of use in Europe and Asia for the treatment of two severe complications of cirrhosis, bleeding esophageal varices (BEV) and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). This trial represents a key step on the path to potentially making this agent available to US clinicians for a challenging new indication, the management of patients with ascites that fails to respond to diuretics.”
The Phase 2a trial is an open-label prospective study in a cohort of 6 patients with liver cirrhosis and ascites refractory to, or intolerant of, diuretic therapy requiring large-volume paracentesis. In addition to examining the safety of BIV201 therapy, the trial will evaluate the steady-state pharmacokinetics (PK) of terlipressin’s active metabolites and explore reduction in paracentesis procedures and ascites fluid generation as secondary outcome measures. More information about the trial may be found at clinicaltrials.gov, identifier: NCT03107091.

  BioVie Receives FDA Clearance for Phase 2a Clinical Trial and Attains Patent Allowance, Satisfies Conditions to Commence Funding Under the $12m Aspire Agreement - April 03, 2017   
BEVERLY, MA–(Marketwired – April 03, 2017) – BioVie Inc. (OTCQB: BIVI), a clinical-stage company focused on the discovery, development, and commercialization of innovative drug therapies for liver disease, is pleased to announce that it has received notice from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that the planned Phase 2a clinical trial of its new drug candidate BIV201 may be initiated. This was based on the Company’s Investigational New Drug Application (IND) to conduct a study in patients with refractory or intractable ascites due to advanced liver cirrhosis.
A second key milestone was achieved when BioVie was notified by the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) that its application for a core patent covering the use of BIV201 to reduce ascites formation in ambulatory patients has been allowed. This application was based on proprietary ascites patient data provided by the Company’s medical advisor Paolo Angeli, MD, a leading global expert in this field, and licensed from the University of Padova, Italy, where he practices medicine. The US patent is expected to issue within 45 days at which time more details will be reported. The Company continues to pursue patent issuances in Japan, China, and possibly European and other countries.
Additionally, BioVie is pleased to announce that it has met all of the conditions needed to commence the previously announced $12 million common stock purchase agreement with Aspire Capital Fund, LLC. Any funding received under the Aspire agreement will help to support the start of the Phase 2a clinical trial mentioned above and be used for general corporate purposes.
“These represent three major advances for the Company and strongly support the BIV201 clinical development program,” commented BioVie CEO Jonathan Adams. “They’re the culmination of many months of effort by our IND and management teams. We are excited about taking the next steps as our compound enters the clinic. Although the primary focus will be on safety and pharmacokinetics, we are also hoping to see signs of disease improvement in severely ill ascites patients.”
The Phase 2a clinical trial will consist of a small number of patients in an open-label study at a single US-based medical center, and is expected to take about 8 months. Eligible patients will have cirrhosis with ascites requiring large-volume paracentesis who are refractory to or unable to tolerate diuretic therapy. Pending the outcome of this first study, BioVie plans to follow with a larger placebo-controlled Phase 2 study.

She originally trained as a nurse and earned a Masters of Management at the J.L. Kellogg Graduate School of Management at Northwestern University. As a critical care nurse, Julie treated patients at risk of death due to complications caused by chronic liver cirrhosis, and deeply understands the unmet medical need targeted by BioVie.
“I’m looking forward to working with Julie again,” commented CEO Jonathan Adams. “Years ago I worked with her when she led global brand development for Celebrex at Searle. She has tremendous expertise in new drug and market development, underpinned by remarkable skills at devising and executing product commercialization strategies and programs. Combined with her first-hand experience in treating liver cirrhosis patients, she’s a perfect fit for helping BioVie advance BIV201 therapy.”
BioVie recently submitted a complete response to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), addressing the issues identified in the Investigational New Drug Application (IND) clinical hold letter received by the Company in January. If notified by the FDA that clinical development of BIV201 may proceed, BioVie expects to commence a mid-stage (Phase 1b) clinical trial in US ascites patients in the next few months.
About BioVie Inc.
BioVie Inc. is a development-stage company pursuing the discovery, development, and commercialization of innovative drug therapies.

About Liver Cirrhosis and Ascites
More than 600,000 Americans and millions worldwide suffer from liver cirrhosis. Cirrhosis is the 12th-leading cause of death due to disease in the US, killing an estimated 40,000 people each year. The condition results primarily from hepatitis, alcoholism, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) linked to fatty liver disease and obesity. Ascites is a common complication of advanced liver cirrhosis. With no medications approved by the FDA specifically for treating ascites, an estimated 40% of patients die within two years of diagnosis. Certain drugs approved for other uses may provide initial relief, but patients often fail to respond to them as ascites worsens. In addition to patient suffering, US treatment costs for liver cirrhosis, including ascites and other complications, are estimated at more than $4 billion annually.

  BioVie Enters Into A $12 Million Common Stock Purchase Agreement With Aspire Capital Fund - January 05, 2017   BEVERLY, MA–(Marketwired – January 05, 2017) – BioVie Inc. (OTC PINK: BIVI), a development-stage company focused on the discovery, development, and commercialization of innovative drug therapies for liver disease, is pleased to announce the completion of a Common Stock Purchase Agreement with Aspire Capital Fund, LLC, a Chicago-based institutional investor, to purchase up to $12 million of BioVie common stock over a 30-month period. Upon entering into the Agreement, Aspire made an initial purchase $200,000 of BioVie’s common stock at $0.20 per share and received warrants to purchase an additional 500,000 shares at a $0.50 exercise price within five years. After a registration statement related to the transaction has been filed and declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, BioVie will have the right to sell up to $11.8 million of additional common stock to Aspire over a 30-month period at the prevailing market prices at the time of each sale. By controlling the timing of each sale, BioVie will have the opportunity to raise capital efficiently while reducing shareholder dilution.
Proceeds from Aspire under the Agreement will be used by BioVie to pay for general corporate purposes, including preparing for the BIV201 clinical trial expected to begin this spring. BioVie recently received comments from the US Food and Drug Administration on its IND application and believes such comments can be addressed reasonably soon in 2017.
“This Agreement creates access to funding for critically important activities relating to our new drug candidate BIV201,” said Jonathan Adams, BioVie’s CEO. “It will accelerate the path to clinical studies required for FDA approval. We believe that BIV201 will become an important new therapeutic option for liver cirrhosis patients and their health care providers. We are pleased that the Aspire team has recognized this opportunity, and welcome them as a significant shareholder of the Company.”
Steven G. Martin, Managing Member of Aspire Capital, commented: “We have been following Mr. Adams’ work on BIV201 for some time now and are very pleased with the Company’s recent regulatory progress. We recognize the urgent need for a novel treatment for ascites, which we know to be predictive of poor outcomes in patients with liver cirrhosis, and are confident in BIV201 as a potential solution. Given the available efficacy data generated by independent investigators thus far and the widespread familiarity and usage of the active compound throughout Europe, we believe BIV201 is well positioned for clinical and regulatory success in the US. We are excited to enter this initial agreement with BioVie. We hope to provide BioVie with additional financial support as necessary and appropriate.”
Under the Agreement, Aspire has no rights to require any sales of shares at any time. The Agreement does not limit BioVie on the use of any of the proceeds. The Agreement does not contain any financial covenants, restrictions on future financings, rights of first refusal, participation rights or penalties whatsoever. BioVie can terminate the Agreement at any time without any cost or penalty.
This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities, nor will there be any sale of these securities in any state or other jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or other jurisdiction.
A complete and detailed description of the Agreement and related registration rights agreement is set forth in the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K, filed today with the SEC.

  BioVie Submits Investigational New Drug Application for BIV201 for Treating Refractory Ascites due to Liver Cirrhosis - November 29, 2016   Anticipates Initiation of US Clinical Trial in 2017

BEVERLY, MA–(Marketwired – November 29, 2016) – BioVie Inc. (OTC PINK: BIVI), a development-stage company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative drug therapies in liver disease, today announced the submission of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application for new drug candidate BIV201 to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). BIV201 has the potential to become the first drug approved by the FDA to treat ascites due to chronic liver cirrhosis, a life-threatening medical condition.
“Filing the IND represents a major milestone for BioVie,” commented CEO Jonathan Adams, “and is the culmination of many months of effort by our clinical development team. We are pleased to have completed this goal on schedule, and look forward to working with the FDA to advance BIV201 therapy.” The IND also involved a substantial investment of resources in formulation testing and to develop a proprietary bioanalytical methodology. The active agent in BIV201 has been investigated in humans with complications of liver cirrhosis in more than 40 studies outside the US.
BIV201 is designed to target ascites at its mechanistic source and improve effective blood volume, thereby interrupting the process of ascites fluid generation. This novel therapeutic approach was granted Orphan Drug designation by the FDA in September. Ascites affects approximately 100,000 Americans. US treatment costs for liver cirrhosis, including ascites and other complications, are estimated at more than $4 billion annually.
Once notified by the FDA that the trial may proceed, BioVie plans to commence a mid-stage (Phase 1b) clinical trial in US ascites patients in 2017. For more information about BioVie and BIV201, please visit our website www.biovieinc.com.

  BioVie Updates on Link Between NASH, Liver Cirrhosis, and Ascites - September 22, 2016   BEVERLY, MA–(Marketwired – September 22, 2016) – BioVie Inc. (OTC PINK: BIVI) (the “Company”), a development-stage company focused on the discovery, development, and commercialization of innovative drug therapies, announced that its scientific team has completed an assessment of the link between nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), chronic liver cirrhosis, and ascites. The Company’s new drug therapy BIV201 targets ascites, a common complication of liver cirrhosis.
The number of Americans afflicted with NASH due to fatty liver disease has skyrocketed to an estimated 16 to 30 million due to the obesity epidemic. With no FDA-approved therapy to halt progression of the disease, there is a significant unmet medical need for the estimated 1.3 million who will progress to advanced liver cirrhosis and its complications. According to a 2015 study by Wong et al., NASH is now the second-leading cause of liver disease among US adults awaiting liver transplantation, and is expected to become the leading cause within ten years. Additionally, patients with liver cirrhosis due to NASH, who are on the liver transplant waiting list, appear to have the lowest probability of survival compared to those having cirrhosis due to other causes.
Serious medical complications often occur in patients with advanced liver cirrhosis, the most common being the development of ascites, or fluid accumulation in the abdomen, a major contributor to patient mortality. BioVie is developing BIV201 as a new drug candidate for ascites due to liver cirrhosis as a result of NASH and other causes. Currently no drugs are available with a specific FDA approval for treating ascites.
BioVie CEO Jonathan Adams commented: “We are seeing impressive therapeutic advances in NASH, which is very gratifying. But it’s important to keep in mind the many patients who progress to advanced liver cirrhosis and suffer miserably as a result. The progression of liver cirrhosis should be viewed as a continuum, and effective therapeutic interventions are needed at every stage.”

About Liver Cirrhosis and Ascites
About one million Americans and millions worldwide suffer from liver cirrhosis. Cirrhosis is the 12th-leading cause of death due to disease in the US, killing an estimated 27,000 people each year. The condition results primarily from hepatitis, alcoholism, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) linked to fatty liver disease and obesity. Ascites is a common complication of advanced liver cirrhosis. With no medications approved by the FDA specifically for treating ascites, an estimated 40% of patients die within two years of diagnosis. Certain drugs approved for other uses may provide initial relief, but patients may fail to respond to treatment as ascites worsens. This unfavorable prognosis represents a critical unmet medical need. US treatment costs for liver cirrhosis, including ascites and other complications, are estimated at more than $4 billion annually.
About BioVie (formerly NanoAntibiotics)
BioVie Inc. is a development-stage company pursuing the discovery, development, and commercialization of innovative drug therapies. The Company is currently focused on commercializing BIV201, a novel approach to the treatment of ascites due to liver cirrhosis. In early 2016 the Company held a pre-investigational new drug (“pre-IND”) meeting with the FDA, which provided guidance for an IND submission. The Company’s new drug candidate could potentially commence a mid-stage (Phase 1b) US clinical trial in 2017.

  BioVie’s Lead Compound BIV201 Receives FDA Orphan-Drug Designation for the Treatment of Ascites - September 09, 2016   BEVERLY, MA–(Marketwired – September 09, 2016) – BioVie Inc. (OTC PINK: BIVI) (the “Company”), a development-stage company focused on the discovery, development, and commercialization of innovative drug therapies, announced today that the Food and Drug Administration’s Office of Orphan Products Development has granted orphan-drug designation for BIV201 for the treatment of ascites due to all etiologies except cancer. BIV201 is the Company’s new drug candidate being developed for ascites due to chronic liver cirrhosis.
“Orphan-drug designation represents a major milestone supporting the clinical development and eventual commercialization of BIV201 therapy. It recognizes the importance of pioneering a new therapeutic approach for this relatively small group of desperately ill patients,” commented Jonathan Adams, BioVie CEO. “Additionally, it can help to accelerate our clinical development program, opens the door to special funding opportunities and tax credits, and could provide seven years of market exclusivity.”
BioVie’s clinical development team, comprised of five highly experienced pharmaceutical industry veterans and advised by worldwide leaders in liver disease, is currently focused on completing an investigational new drug (IND) application for BIV201. If accepted by the FDA, our new drug candidate could commence a US clinical trial in 2017. Once this goal is accomplished, BioVie will begin to explore other potential applications for BIV201 therapy. The active ingredient in BIV201 is a potent vasoconstrictor and this mechanism of action yields the potential to treat an array of life-threatening diseases, including type 1 hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), esophageal variceal bleeds, and sepsis.

  NanoAntibiotics (BioVie) Files Global Patent Applications Covering CIPT Technology - July 07, 2016   BEVERLY, MA–(Marketwired – July 07, 2016) – NanoAntibiotics, Inc. (OTC PINK: NNAB) (the “Company,” soon to be known as BioVie Inc.), a development stage company focused on the discovery, development, and commercialization of innovative drug therapies, announced today the filing of US, Japanese and international (PCT) patent applications. The applications aim to achieve patent protection for the Company’s novel CIPT Technology being developed for the treatment of ascites due to liver cirrhosis. The PCT filing is an important step towards safeguarding the technology in Europe and potentially other countries.
The FDA has never approved any drugs specifically for the treatment of ascites, and CIPT Technology offers the potential for a new therapeutic option for patients with this life-threatening condition. “This is an important component of our plan to develop a unique and proprietary new therapy for ascites, and ultimately improve patient care at home and abroad,” commented Jonathan Adams, CEO of the Company.
The Company collaborated with its Italian advisor, Professor Paolo Angeli of the University of Padova, to generate data supporting the patent claims. Dr. Angeli is Head of the Unit of Hepatic Emergencies and Liver Transplantation at the University, and is a frequent speaker and widely published expert on liver disease. Penny Markham PhD, the Company’s Chief Scientific Officer, also made important contributions to the applications.
NanoAntibiotics (BioVie) recently launched a new website, www.nanoantibiotics.com. The Company’s goal is to commence a clinical trial program as early as 2017 upon FDA acceptance of an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application, currently in development.

TECHNOLOGY

BIV201 – A NEW THERAPEUTIC APPROACH
BioVie’s BIV201 could potentially yield a breakthrough approach to treating ascites due to liver cirrhosis, with the goal of directly targeting its “mechanistic source. ” The active agent in our technology is a potent vasoconstrictor and has shown efficacy for reducing portal hypertension in studies around the world. The goal is to interrupt the ascites disease pathway, thereby halting the “vicious cycle” of accelerating fluid generation.
Reducing ascites formation promises to improve patients’ quality of life and potentially avoid certain life-threatening complications. However unless the patient is able to regain liver function (for example, if an alcoholic quits drinking), he or she may eventually require a liver transplant.


BIV201 DEVELOPMENT STATUS
The Company held a pre-investigational new drug (“pre-IND”) meeting with the FDA regarding BIV201 in early 2016 and received guidance for an upcoming IND submission. The Company’s new drug candidate could potentially commence US clinical trials as early as 2017.
The active ingredient in BIV201 is a compound which many US physicians who specialize in liver disease are familiar with, even though it is not yet available in the US. It has been studied extensively overseas in related conditions and its efficacy and safety profile has been elucidated by hundreds of scientific publications. It is approved in about 50 countries to treat esophageal variceal bleeds, a frequent complication of liver cirrhosis, and in some countries for treating type 1 (hospitalized) hepatorenal syndrome. These conditions share a similar root cause – portal hypertension – and are often accompanied by ascites.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
BioVie relies on a combination of trade secrecy and patent strategy to protect our confidential information and seek market exclusivity for our products. The Company has submitted patent filings for BIV201 technology in the US and Japan as well as submitted a PCT in Europe. Additionally, BioVie has applied for US Orphan Drug Designation for its new drug candidate since the number of ascites patients (about 100,000 Americans) meets the required patient population size.


FUTURE POSSIBILITIES
Based on investigative studies around the world, BIV201 has the potential for future applications in other life-threatening conditions due to liver cirrhosis, such as those listed below. Securing marketing approvals for any of these new uses will require well-controlled clinical trials to satisfy the FDA and/or other countries’ regulatory requirements, none of which have commenced at this time.

Esophageal variceal bleed (EVB): The bursting of blood vessels lining the esophagus due to high blood pressure (“portal hypertension”) in the vein which supplies blood to the liver resulting as a result of advanced liver cirrhosis. This situation requires emergency treatment to avoid blood loss and death.
Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS): As their disease progresses liver cirrhosis patients’ kidneys may begin to fail, and this deadly condition may set in. It often occurs once a patient no longer responds to (off-label) drugs used to control ascites. The second stage is called “type 1 HRS” and requires hospitalization as multiple organ failure and death may occur.
Hyponatremia: This term refers to “low salt in the bloodstream,” another dangerous condition which can occur as a result of advanced liver cirrhosis.



POSSIBLE ACCESS TO EARLY-STAGE COMPOUNDS
The Company has an Agreement with PharmaIN Corporation (Bothell, WA) providing certain limited rights and information on their program to develop novel modified terlipressin compounds. Although at an early stage, these compounds hold the promise of simpler and potentially safer dosing for patients outside the hospital. If this program makes significant advances, BioVie may contact PharmaIN to explore a licensing opportunity. For more about PharmaIN’s innovative drug development program, visit: www.pharmaIN.com.


EFFLUX PUMP ANTIBIOTICS PROGRAM
The Company (formerly NanoAntibiotics, Inc.) was founded in 2013 to focus on the discovery and development of new classes of broad spectrum antibiotics for gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial infections,including some of the most difficult to treat multi-drug resistant bacteria, also called “Superbugs.”
Our antibiotic drug discovery platform is built upon a multi-pronged understanding of the interactions between drug candidates and their bacterial targets, and enables the engineering of antibiotics with enhanced characteristics to attack a drug resistant bacteria. Our novel compounds originated with Kard Scientific, Inc. (“Kard”), a preclinical contract research organization. Researchers at Kard synthesized these compounds and have conducted in vitro studies. In 2013 Kard assigned all of their rights, formulations, studies and data related to efflux pump antibiotics to the Company. These new drug candidates have been studied in cell-based assays (in-vitro), but have not yet been studied in small animals (in vivo) or in animals with drug resistant bacteria to assess their efficacy, efficiency, and toxicity. We own all development and marketing rights to this program. Since the Company is now exclusively focused on developing BIV201 for liver disease, we are seeking to contract research and development of the antibiotic program to a third party.

ABOUT

BioVie (OTC PINK: BIVI) is pioneering an innovative therapeutic approach targeting ascites due to liver cirrhosis. Ascites, or the accumulation of fluid in the abdomen, is the most common complication of cirrhosis due to NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis), alcoholic liver disease and/or hepatitis C.  Ascites affects about 100,000 Americans and many times more worldwide, and contributes substantially to mortality. Our therapy BIV201 is based on a drug that is not yet available in the US but is approved in about 50 countries to treat related complications of liver cirrhosis.
The Company, formerly knows as NanoAntibiotics, Inc., recently acquired LAT Pharma LLC. This merger provided our lead development program, BIV201. Following a pre-investigational new drug meeting (“pre-IND”) with the FDA in early 2016, the Company is now assembling its IND package, and may commence a US clinical trial as early as 2017.

DISEASE TARGET

ASCITES
Liver cirrhosis due to NASH, alcoholic liver disease and/or hepatitis is the 12th leading cause of death due to disease in the US, killing an estimated 27,000 people annually, and incurring treatment costs estimated at $4 billion annually. Ascites is liver cirrhosis’s most common complication and involves excessive accumulation of fluid in the abdomen, which can become life-threatening in patients with advanced liver cirrhosis. Patients with ascites suffer a miserable quality of life and frequent infections, as well as other complications requiring hospitalization that contribute to their decline.
LIVER CIRRHOSIS
Liver cirrhosis occurs when tissues inside the liver become damaged (“fibrotic”), which may be due to NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis), alcoholism, hepatitis, or other causes. As the internal damage accumulates, the liver begins to “clog up” which impedes blood flow and its ability to clean and purify the blood. About 1 million Americans are afflicted with liver cirrhosis.
This is an illustration of the progression of a healthy liver to liver cirrhosis:



SEVERE LIVER CIRRHOSIS COMPLICATIONS
Once liver damage becomes very substantial, which may take up to 10 years or more, ascites and/or other serious complications may occur. Ascites is the most common complication, involving kidney dysfunction and the accumulation of substantial amounts of fluid in the abdominal cavity. This causes much patient suffering and sometimes leads to malnutrition. Ascites often causes other life-threatening complications such as infection, sepsis, and circulatory dysfunction.


CURRENT DRUG THERAPIES
With no medications approved by the FDA specifically to treat ascites, the prognosis for these patients is very poor. Certain drugs which have been approved for other medical conditions (such as diuretics) combined with a salt-restricted diet usually provide symptomatic relief in the initial stages of the disease. But as the ascites worsens their efficacy often diminishes. BioVie is working on a solution to address this critical unmet medical need.


Most experts agree that ascites develops through a sequence of events illustrated by this diagram:
HOW DOES ASCITES DEVELOP? 

High blood pressure in the vein that supplies blood to the liver, called “portal hypertension,” occurs as increasing liver damage (fibrosis) impedes blood flow through the liver. This causes vasodilation and blood pooling in the central or “splanchnic” region of the body and low blood volume in the arteries. The decrease in effective blood volume activates a signaling pathway (“neurohormonal systems”) which tells the kidneys to retain large amounts of salt and water in an effort to increase blood volume. Ultimately the retention of excess sodium and water leads to the formation of ascites as these substances “weep” from the liver and lymph system and collect in the patient’s abdomen.
BIV201 is being developed by BioVie with the goal of alleviating the portal hypertension and correcting splanchnic vasodilation, thereby increasing effective blood volume and reducing the signals to the kidneys to retain excess salt and water.

One Patient’s Perspective  “I developed ascites 9 months ago as a result of cirrhosis of the liver caused by hepatitis C. Since I stopped responding to diuretics, I have to have about 10 liters of ascites fluid drained by paracentesis every 2 weeks. I have an open prescription and can have paracentesis as often as needed. For me the point comes when the buildup of pressure and resulting pain in my abdomen becomes unbearable, and it becomes impossible to eat and I am forced to lie down. Although I feel tremendous relief after a paracentesis, losing about 15 lbs afterwards, the fluid returns rapidly and I regain the weight. After a week, the discomfort starts to build up and I feel miserable until the next paracentesis. Then the cycle starts all over again. I am fortunate because I have not had any complications (like infections) so far. I am hoping to be put on the liver transplant list soon, but I expect to spend another 6 months like this while I wait for a transplant.”
