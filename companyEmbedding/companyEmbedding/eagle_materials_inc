    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.source> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11x1gf2m6>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

 Gypsum wallboard is a ubiquitous necessity in interior walls and ceilings 





Wallboard
Gypsum wallboard is a key component in the construction of walls and ceilings in residential and commercial buildings. Eagle Materials' gypsum wallboard division, American Gypsum Company, currently operates four manufacturing facilities in Colorado, New Mexico, Oklahoma and South Carolina. A companion facility in New Mexico has been idled awaiting recovery in the Arizona and Southern California construction markets. With annual wallboard production capacity of nearly 4 billion square feet, Eagle is the nation's fifth largest wallboard producer.
Much of American Gypsum's competitive advantage lies in its access to Republic Paperboard facing paper, in its modern efficient dryers and its energy efficient calciners. In addition, the company has improved the strength, reduced the weight, and improved the quality of its gypsum wallboard, while at the same time reducing the amount of waste generated. Because of attention to detail and focus on continuously improving the low-cost production of gypsum wallboard, American Gypsum has been able to remain profitable through cycles.

 Cement is the basic binding agent for concrete, a widely used, versatile construction material 





Cement
Eagle Materials' six cement manufacturing facilities are located in Illinois, Missouri, Nevada, Oklahoma, Texas* and Wyoming.
During fiscal 2007, Eagle expanded and modernized the Illinois Cement plant. The project expanded the plant's annual cement manufacturing capacity by 70 percent to 1.1 million tons, and lowered the plant's cost structure by 20 percent. All of the company's cement facility upgrades share common goals: to provide additional capacity to satisfy future demand growth, to facilitate substantial improvement in per unit production costs, and to advance our sustainability objectives of using less resources than others to produce the same products.
In November 2012, Eagle acquired two cement plants, one near Kansas City, Missouri and one in Tulsa, Oklahoma. These acquisitions increased company's cement capacity by roughly 60 percent. These represent key strategic moves for the company: the new plants are highly complementary geographically with Eagle's other assets, and together create a low-cost system for serving target heartland markets.
Eagle has an outstanding portfolio of cement assets with nearly five million tons of annual cement production capacity. Each of the cement plants are highly efficient and appropriately sized for the markets in which each plant competes.
*Eagle Material Inc.'s cement plant in Texas is operated through a 50/50 joint venture.

Eagle Materials Inc was first set up by Centex Corporation in the 1960s and its original name is Centex Construction Products. In 2004 Centex sold its 65% interest and Eagle Materials Inc became an independent company. In the 2000s Eagle Materials spent $65 million to purchase an Illinois Cement Company plant in LaSalle, IL. American Gypsum built a new plant near Georgetown, SC (2005-2008). Texas Lehigh Cement invested in Houston Cement Import Terminals.
In 2012 Eagle Materials acquired two Lafarge cement plants[5] for $446 million, which would increase Eagle Materials' cement production capacity by 1.6 million tons, or roughly 60 percent.[6]

Eagle mainly offers four kinds of products: Cement (limestone), Gypsum Wallboard, Recycled Paperboard (containerboard, lightweight packaging and industrial paperboard grades), and Concrete and Aggregates. The Company sells cement mainly in northern Nevada and California, the Chicago area, the Rocky Mountain region and Texas.[2][4]

        Eagle Materials, Inc. Cements Another Record for Revenue Thanks to an Acquisition
    


newsfeedback@fool.com (Matthew DiLallo)

3 hrs ago




























































































Eagle Materials (NYSE: EXP) started off its fiscal 2018 with strong first-quarter results. The company set a record for revenue thanks in part to its recent acquisition of the Fairborn cement plant from Cemex (NYSE: CX). That said, all its segments performed well during the quarter due to improving economic trends.Eagle Materials results: The raw numbersMetricFiscal Q1 2018Fiscal Q1 2017Year-Over-Year ChangeRevenue$366.1 million$297.5 million23.1%Net earnings$54.9 million$45.3 million21%EPS$1.13$0.9321.5%
Data source: Eagle Materials Inc.Image source: Getty Images.What happened with Eagle Materials this quarter? The Cemex deal took results up another level:Cement revenues surged 26% versus last year's fiscal first quarter to $182.9 million while operating earnings rose 37% to $43.2 million due to a 6% increase in prices and 21% higher volumes. That said, the Cemex deal drove the bulk of those gains since prices and volumes would have only risen 4% and 7%, respectively, without that acquisition.Concrete and aggregate sales jumped 26% to $43.5 million while operating profit came in at $6 million, which was 63% higher than the year-ago period thanks to improving volumes and prices.Gypsum wallboard and paperboard sales rose 9% to $153.9 million thanks to rising gypsum wallboard sales prices and volumes as well as higher paperboard sales prices. That said, operating earnings slid 4% to $48.8 million due to lower paperboard volumes as well as increased costs in running its paper mill as a result of an annual maintenance outage and higher recycled fiber costs.The oil and gas proppants segment continues to recover due to the uptick in oil and gas activities this year. Overall, sales rocketed 271% to $18.9 million thanks to higher volumes and prices. That said, the segment did report an operating loss of $2 million, though that was an improvement from last quarter's $2.9 million loss and mainly due to $7.6 million of depreciation, depletion, and amortization expenses.What management had to say On the company's fiscal first-quarter conference call, CEO Dave Powers offered his comments on the business conditions that drove its results. He said:Let me begin with a few observations about some of the things that stand out to me about the quarter. First, the opportunity to sell products across all of our businesses: Cement, Wallboard, profits, and concrete and aggregates continues to improve and we're taking advantages of these trends. The underlying drivers of our businesses are almost universally toggled in the up position and longer-term risk currently skew to the upside. Single-family housing starts, for example, continue to improve, and have substantial room for growth. Household formation trends, combined with an economic environment of low unemployment, healthy job growth, and low interest rates, are a powerful combination. Most areas of the U.S. are doing well especially in the markets that we operate. Infrastructure investment is growing and could grow even more in the years to come. 
As Powers notes, business is booming right now thanks to healthy economic growth. The company doesn't expect those trends to slow anytime soon given that there's ample room for continued housing growth and the expectation that infrastructure investment will pick up as a result of President Trump's desire to rebuild the country's infrastructure.Looking forward Given those trends, Powers provided the following forecast: 
Going forward, we would expect our cement volumes to grow at about a 3% to 5% rate. On Wallboard, we expect volumes to grow in the mid-single digits and our proppant volumes to grow around threefold this year, albeit from a relatively low comparable base. To the last point. We've continued to take advantage of the current general low on oilfield activity broadly across America to build our capabilities in the proppants business... I'm pleased to announce that we have signed a definitive agreement to acquire Wildcat Minerals, a well-established frack sand distribution company.Powers sees healthy growth ahead for all of Eagle's segments, especially in its frack sand business where it recently took advantage of improving market conditions to bolster its position so it can capture the upside as the market rebound takes hold. 10 stocks we like better than Eagle MaterialsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

        Eagle Materials, Inc. Cements Another Record for Revenue Thanks to an Acquisition
    


newsfeedback@fool.com (Matthew DiLallo)

Eagle Materials (NYSE: EXP) started off its fiscal 2018 with strong first-quarter results. The company set a record for revenue thanks in part to its recent acquisition of the Fairborn cement plant from Cemex (NYSE: CX). That said, all its segments performed well during the quarter due to improving economic trends.Eagle Materials results: The raw numbersMetricFiscal Q1 2018Fiscal Q1 2017Year-Over-Year ChangeRevenue$366.1 million$297.5 million23.1%Net earnings$54.9 million$45.3 million21%EPS$1.13$0.9321.5%
Data source: Eagle Materials Inc.Image source: Getty Images.What happened with Eagle Materials this quarter? The Cemex deal took results up another level:Cement revenues surged 26% versus last year's fiscal first quarter to $182.9 million while operating earnings rose 37% to $43.2 million due to a 6% increase in prices and 21% higher volumes. That said, the Cemex deal drove the bulk of those gains since prices and volumes would have only risen 4% and 7%, respectively, without that acquisition.Concrete and aggregate sales jumped 26% to $43.5 million while operating profit came in at $6 million, which was 63% higher than the year-ago period thanks to improving volumes and prices.Gypsum wallboard and paperboard sales rose 9% to $153.9 million thanks to rising gypsum wallboard sales prices and volumes as well as higher paperboard sales prices. That said, operating earnings slid 4% to $48.8 million due to lower paperboard volumes as well as increased costs in running its paper mill as a result of an annual maintenance outage and higher recycled fiber costs.The oil and gas proppants segment continues to recover due to the uptick in oil and gas activities this year. Overall, sales rocketed 271% to $18.9 million thanks to higher volumes and prices. That said, the segment did report an operating loss of $2 million, though that was an improvement from last quarter's $2.9 million loss and mainly due to $7.6 million of depreciation, depletion, and amortization expenses.What management had to say On the company's fiscal first-quarter conference call, CEO Dave Powers offered his comments on the business conditions that drove its results. He said:Let me begin with a few observations about some of the things that stand out to me about the quarter. First, the opportunity to sell products across all of our businesses: Cement, Wallboard, profits, and concrete and aggregates continues to improve and we're taking advantages of these trends. The underlying drivers of our businesses are almost universally toggled in the up position and longer-term risk currently skew to the upside. Single-family housing starts, for example, continue to improve, and have substantial room for growth. Household formation trends, combined with an economic environment of low unemployment, healthy job growth, and low interest rates, are a powerful combination. Most areas of the U.S. are doing well especially in the markets that we operate. Infrastructure investment is growing and could grow even more in the years to come. 
As Powers notes, business is booming right now thanks to healthy economic growth. The company doesn't expect those trends to slow anytime soon given that there's ample room for continued housing growth and the expectation that infrastructure investment will pick up as a result of President Trump's desire to rebuild the country's infrastructure.Looking forward Given those trends, Powers provided the following forecast: 
Going forward, we would expect our cement volumes to grow at about a 3% to 5% rate. On Wallboard, we expect volumes to grow in the mid-single digits and our proppant volumes to grow around threefold this year, albeit from a relatively low comparable base. To the last point. We've continued to take advantage of the current general low on oilfield activity broadly across America to build our capabilities in the proppants business... I'm pleased to announce that we have signed a definitive agreement to acquire Wildcat Minerals, a well-established frack sand distribution company.Powers sees healthy growth ahead for all of Eagle's segments, especially in its frack sand business where it recently took advantage of improving market conditions to bolster its position so it can capture the upside as the market rebound takes hold. 10 stocks we like better than Eagle MaterialsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.
