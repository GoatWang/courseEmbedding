Applicants' Representations
1. The Trust is a statutory trust formed under Delaware law and pursuant to a Declaration of Trust that MetLife signed as sponsor. As sponsor, MetLife is currently the sole beneficial owner of the Trust.[1] 
           MetLife, a Delaware corporation, is an insurance holding company that, through its subsidiaries and affiliates, offers life insurance, annuities, automobile and homeowners insurance, retail banking and other financial services to individuals, as well as group insurance and retirement and savings products and services to corporations and other institutions.[2] 

2. The Trust was formed for the purpose of funding the operations of MetLife or its Controlled Companies through the issuance of debt securities or non-voting preferred stock (the “Finance Subsidiary Securities”). The Trust has not yet begun operations.
3. MetLife currently contemplates that a MetLife Finance Subsidiary will offer Finance Subsidiary Securities in private placement transactions in reliance on an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or through public offerings that are registered under the Securities Act. Start Printed Page 1008Applicants propose to use the proceeds from any such offerings to finance the business operations of the MetLife Finance Subsidiary's Parent Company or a Controlled Company of the Parent Company.
4. A Parent Company will unconditionally guarantee in conformity with rule 3a-5, any debt securities constituting Finance Subsidiary Securities as to payment of principal, interest and premium, if any, and any non-voting preferred securities constituting Finance Subsidiary Securities as to the payment of dividends, liquidation preference and sinking fund payments, if any. The guarantee will provide that, in the event of a default by the MetLife Finance Subsidiary in payment of any such amount, the holders of Finance Subsidiary Securities may institute legal proceedings directly against the Parent Company that guaranteed the Finance Subsidiary Securities to enforce the guarantee without first proceeding against the MetLife Finance Subsidiary.
5. Any Finance Subsidiary Securities that are convertible or exchangeable will be convertible or exchangeable only for securities issued by the Parent Company that guaranteed the Finance Subsidiary Securities or for other securities issued by the MetLife Finance Subsidiary that meet the applicable requirements of rule 3a-5(a)(1) through (a)(3) of the Act. Each MetLife Finance Subsidiary, through loans or an investment, will transfer at least 85% of the proceeds from the sale of the Finance Subsidiary Securities to its Parent Company or a Controlled Company of the Parent Company as soon as practicable, but in no event later than six months after receipt of such proceeds.
Applicant's Legal Analysis
1. Applicants request an order under section 6(c) of the Act for an exemption from all provisions of the Act. Rule 3a-5 under the Act provides an exemption from the definition of investment company for certain companies organized primarily to finance the business operations of their parent companies or companies controlled by their parent companies.
2. Rule 3a-5(b)(2)(i) in relevant part defines a “parent company” to be any corporation, partnership, or joint venture that is not considered an investment company under section 3(a) of the Act or that is excepted or exempted by order from the definition of investment company by section 3(b) of the Act or by the rules or regulations under section 3(a) of the Act. Applicants state that while MetLife is not an investment company within the definition of section 3(a) of the Act, MetLife may in the future, choose to rely on section 3(c)(6) of the Act for an exclusion from the definition of an investment company. To the extent MetLife or another Parent Company derives its non-investment company status from section 3(c)(6) of the Act, MetLife would not qualify as an eligible parent company under rule 3a-5(b)(2)(i). Accordingly, applicants request exemptive relief to permit MetLife or another Parent Company that does not satisfy a portion of the definition of a “parent company” in rule 3a-5(b)(2)(i) solely because it is an “insurance company” or “bank” as defined in section 2(a) of the Act and is excepted from the definition of an investment company under sections 3(c)(3) or 3(c)(6) of the Act or a holding company primarily engaged in the business of an insurance company or a bank that is excepted from the definition of an investment company under section 3(c)(6) of the Act to guarantee Finance Subsidiary Securities issued by a MetLife Finance Subsidiary that is wholly-owned by the Parent Company or a Controlled Company of the Parent Company.
3. Rule 3a-5(b)(3)(i) in relevant part defines a “company controlled by the parent company” to be any corporation, partnership, or joint venture that is not considered an investment company under section 3(a) of the Act or that is excepted or exempted by order from the definition of investment company by section 3(b) of the Act or by the rules and regulations under section 3(a) of the Act. MetLife requests exemptive relief to permit a Controlled Company of the Parent Company that is excepted from the definition of an investment company under section 3(c)(2), 3(c)(3), 3(c)(4), 3(c)(5)(A), 3(c)(5)(B) or 3(c)(6) of the Act to receive funds from a MetLife Finance Subsidiary that is wholly owned by its Parent Company or a Controlled Company of the Parent Company.
4. Applicants state that the purpose of each MetLife Financing Subsidiary is to provide funds for the operations of its Parent Company or Controlled Company of the Parent Company. Applicants state that neither any Parent Company nor any Controlled Company of the Parent Company presents the potential for investment company activities.
5. Applicants seek exemptive relief that would include Parent Companies that have not been named as applicants to the application. Without the requested relief, a newly acquired MetLife insurance company or bank subsidiary that may seek (or such existing subsidiary that may determine in the future) to act as a “parent company” within the meaning of rule 3a-5 would have to submit another application seeking essentially the same relief as sought here. Such an application would not raise any significant issue that applicants have not already analyzed in the application.
6. Section 6(c) of the Act, in pertinent part, provides that the Commission, by order upon application, may conditionally or unconditionally exempt any person, security or transaction, or any class or classes of persons, securities or transactions, from any provision or provisions of the Act to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Applicants submit that the exemptive request meets the standards set forth in section 6(c) of the Act.
Applicants' Conditions
Applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions:
Applicants will comply with all of the provisions of rule 3a-5 under the Act, except that:
(1) A Parent Company may not meet the portion of the definition of a “parent company” in rule 3a-5(b)(2)(i) solely because it is excluded from the definition of an investment company under sections 3(c)(3) or 3(c)(6) of the Act; and
(2) a Controlled Company of the Parent Company may not meet the portion of the definition of a “company controlled by the parent company” in rule 3a-5(b)(3)(i) solely because it is excluded from the definition of an investment company under sections 3(c)(2), 3(c)(3), 3(c)(4), 3(c)(5)(A), 3(c)(5)(B) or 3(c)(6) of the Act;

provided that:

(a) any Controlled Company of the Parent Company excluded from the definition of investment company under section 3(c)(5) of the Act will fall within section 3(c)(5)(A) or section 3(c)(5)(B) solely by reason of its holdings of accounts receivable of either its own customers or the customers of another Controlled Company of the Parent Company, or by reason of loans made to its customers or the customers of another Controlled Company of the Parent Company; and
(b) any Parent Company or Controlled Company of a Parent Company excluded from the definition of investment company under section 3(c)(6) of the Act will not engage primarily, directly, or through majority-owned subsidiaries in one or more of the businesses described in section 3(c)(5) of the Act (except as permitted by (a) above).

1.
     If the Trust issues common securities, MetLife or a Controlled Company (defined below) will own all of the common securities issued by the Trust. MetLife, as sponsor, will at all times control the Trust in all material respects, including having the sole right to select, remove or replace the Trust administrators. A Controlled Company may be a wholly-owned or majority-owned subsidiary of MetLife through which MetLife conducts its insurance, banking and broker-dealer business, or an entity that is or would be, after giving effect to the requested order, “controlled by” MetLife within the meaning of paragraph (b)(3) of rule 3a-5 under the Act.

2.
     Applicants request that the order also apply to any existing or future company controlled by MetLife that is an insurance company or a bank (as defined in section 2(a) of the Act) or a holding company primarily engaged in the business of an insurance company or a bank, that relies on section 3(c)(3) and/or section 3(c)(6) of the Act, and that, except for its reliance on section 3(c)(3) and/or section 3(c)(6), acts as a “parent company” within the meaning of rule 3a-5 under the Act (such companies, together with MetLife, “Parent Companies” and each, individually, a “Parent Company”) and to certain finance subsidiaries wholly owned by a Parent Company or a controlled company of such Parent Company (“Controlled Company of the Parent Company”) that currently exist or that may be established or acquired in the future (such finance subsidiaries, together with the Trust, “MetLife Finance Subsidiaries”). The Trust is the only MetLife Finance Subsidiary that presently intends to rely on the requested order. Any MetLife entity that relies on the requested order in the future will comply with the terms and conditions of the application.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Rating Action: Moody's confirms MetLife's ratings (A3 senior); downgrades financial strength of Brighthouse subsidiaries to A3






                    Global Credit Research - 05 Oct 2016
                









New York, October 05, 2016 -- Moody's Investors Service today confirmed MetLife, Inc.'s 
(MetLife; NYSE: MET) long-term credit ratings (senior 
debt at A3) and the Aa3 insurance financial strength (IFS) ratings of 
Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (MLIC), General American Life 
Insurance Company and Metropolitan Tower Life Insurance Company (collectively 
called RemainCo). In the same rating action, Moody's 
downgraded the IFS ratings of MetLife Insurance Company USA and New England 
Life Insurance Company to A3 from Aa3. These two operating companies, 
along with First MetLife Investors Insurance Company (not rated), 
will separate from MetLife and reside under newly formed holding company, 
Brighthouse Financial, Inc. (Brighthouse, unrated) 
as disclosed in the SEC Form 10 statement Brighthouse filed today. 
The IFS rating of American Life Insurance Company (ALICO) was unaffected 
by this rating action. The outlook for the ratings is stable.




These actions conclude a review for downgrade of MetLife's ratings 
initiated on January 13, 2016, following MetLife's announcement 
that it intended to pursue the separation and potential disposition (through 
IPO, spin-off, or sale) of a substantial portion of 
its US Retail segment. The businesses transferred to Brighthouse, 
which totaled about $227 billion of assets as of December 31, 
2015, will contain the majority of MetLife's more capital intensive 
and volatile retail product lines such as variable annuities with guaranteed 
living benefits and universal life with secondary guarantees. The 
rating agency noted as of December 31, 2015, the new company 
would represent about 20% of the operating earnings of MetLife 
and 50% of the operating earnings of the US Retail segment. 
MetLife will continue to participate in all of its other segments: 
Group, Voluntary and Worksite Benefits, Corporate Benefit 
Funding, Asia, Latin America and Europe, the Middle 
East and Africa.


Please refer to the complete list of rating actions below.




RATINGS RATIONALE




MetLife's Remaining US Life Businesses


The confirmation of the Aa3 IFS ratings of MetLife's remaining US 
life businesses is based on their very strong market positions in the 
US with excellent brand recognition, significant operating scale 
in group insurance businesses, diversified and controlled distribution, 
as well as a substantial capital base. Although the separation 
of the majority of MetLife's US Retail business will reduce the 
company's overall market footprint, the remaining operations 
will still rank as one of the leading US Life operations, with top 
market positions in the US Life group insurance market and Corporate Benefit 
Funding (CBF, includes GICs and other institutional products). 
Prospective profitability is also expected to be less constrained than 
seen historically, due to the expected reduced levels of volatility 
and lower hedging costs as a result of the transfer of the majority of 
the US retail business to Brighthouse. These strengths are mitigated 
to some extent by remaining risk exposures related to managing a book 
of run-off legacy variable annuities, although this block 
is mostly without guarantees, as well as relatively large exposure 
to high-risk assets including alternative investments. Additionally, 
earnings and cash flow coverage ratios have historically been below rating 
level expectations, though the metrics have trended higher recently.




The following factors could lead to an upgrade of the IFS ratings of the 
operating entities of RemainCo: 1) high risk assets ratio as a percentage 
of shareholders' equity below 100% on a statutory accounting 
basis; 2) NAIC Combined RBC ratio of principal US life insurance 
subsidiaries consistently above 425% (company action level), 
after adjusting for captive reinsurers; 3) adjusted financial leverage 
(excluding AOCI) less than 20% range; and 4) earnings and 
cash flow coverage above 8x and 6x, respectively.


Conversely, the following factors could lead to a downgrade of the 
IFS ratings of the operating entities of RemainCo: 1) securities 
lending and institutional funding agreement-backed issuances growing 
disproportionately relative to the consolidated company; 2) NAIC 
Combined RBC ratio of principal US life insurance subsidiaries falling 
below 350% (company action level), after adjusting for captive 
reinsurers; 3) adjusted financial leverage (excluding AOCI) above 
30%; or 4) earnings and cash flow coverage below 6x and 4x, 
respectively.




MetLife, Inc.


Commenting on the confirmation, Moody's said that in addition 
to its US market leading positions discussed above, the company 
has leading positions in various international insurance markets within 
Latin America and Asia. Although MetLife will have a weaker business 
profile due to a diminished market position in the US retail life and 
annuity markets and reduced diversity of distribution and earnings, 
this will be more than offset by the company's reduced exposure to higher 
risk insurance products such as variable annuities with generous living 
benefit guarantees. Going forward, Moody's expects 
MetLife to maintain an adjusted financial leverage ratio (excluding AOCI) 
of less than 30% and holding company cash of at least 2x fixed 
charges following the separation of the Brighthouse subsidiaries. 
NAIC risk based capital at the operating entities is expected to be greater 
than 400% (company action level), after adjusting for captive 
reinsurers.




The A3 senior debt rating of MetLife is three notches lower than the average 
IFS rating of its principal US and non-US operating subsidiaries, 
which is standard for US holding companies.




The following factors could lead to an upgrade of MetLife's ratings: 
1) upgrade of MetLife's US subsidiaries or ALICO's stand-alone 
credit profile; 2) adjusted financial leverage (excluding AOCI) less 
than 20% range; and 3) earnings and cash flow coverage above 
8x and 6x times, respectively. Conversely, the following 
factors could lead to a downgrade of MetLife's ratings: 1) downgrade 
of MetLife's US subsidiaries or ALICO's stand-alone credit profile; 
2) adjusted financial leverage (excluding AOCI) above 30%; 
3) earnings and cash flow coverage below 6x and 4x, respectively; 
or 4) large acquisition in emerging markets whose operations have a significantly 
lower credit profile.




Brighthouse Insurance Subsidiaries


Moody's downgrade of the ratings of the operating subsidiaries that will 
be part of Brighthouse is largely driven by their materially weaker business 
profile. Notably, this business will contain the majority 
of MetLife's more capital intensive and volatile retail product lines, 
such as variable annuities with guaranteed living benefits and universal 
life with secondary guarantees. The rating agency recognizes the 
experience and strong track record the management team brings to the new 
franchise; however, the company will not have the benefits 
of being part of the larger MetLife organization. The new company 
has a smaller, less diversified product set, and will exhibit 
a more volatile credit profile relative to the credit profile of the businesses 
to be retained by MetLife. Commenting on the strengths, Moody's 
said that asset risk is expected to improve relative to the current level 
of MetLife, with modest amount of exposure to high-risk assets, 
namely below-investment grade securities and alternative investments 
(9% of total invested assets at year-end 2015). Moody's 
also noted that the company's capital adequacy, as measured by the 
NAIC RBC ratio at year-end 2015, was 689% (company 
action level), although the company maintains such a high level 
of RBC ratio in part to proactively manage the volatility and tail risk 
associated with the variable annuity block.




The following factors could lead to an upgrade of the IFS ratings of Brighthouse 
subsidiaries: 1) run-rate statutory capital generation in 
excess of $500 million; 2) shift in the business mix towards 
more protection-oriented products (e.g. life insurance); 
and 3) earnings and cash flow coverage above 6x and 4x, respectively. 
Conversely, the following factors could lead to a downgrade of the 
IFS ratings of Brighthouse subsidiaries: 1) organic capital generation 
diminishes and GAAP return on capital less than 5%; 2) earnings 
and cash flow coverage below 4x and 2x, respectively; or 3) 
adjusted financial leverage (excluding AOCI) above 30%.




The following ratings have been confirmed:


MetLife, Inc. - senior unsecured debt at A3; 
provisional senior debt shelf at (P)A3; provisional subordinated 
debt shelf at (P)Baa1; provisional preferred shelf at (P)Baa2;
