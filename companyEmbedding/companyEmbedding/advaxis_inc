Company Overview




Advaxis, Inc. is a late-stage biotechnology company developing the next generation of cancer immunotherapies.  Advaxis’ investigational immunotherapies are designed to capitalize on the body’s ability to recognize and attack bacterial infections. Our proprietary core platform – Lm Technology™ – alters a live, attenuated strain of Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) bacteria to stimulate cancer-fighting T-cells directed against cancer antigens and reduce factors that protect the tumor microenvironment from immunologic attack and contribute to tumor growth.
Advaxis’ lead Lm Technology™ immunotherapies, axalimogene filolisbac and ADXS-DUAL, target HPV-associated cancers and are in clinical trials for four potential indications, including phase 3 in high risk, local advanced cervical cancer, a registrational quality study in metastatic cervical cancer in combination with nivolumab, phase 2 in head and neck cancer, and phase 2 in anal cancer. The FDA has granted axalimogene filolisbac orphan drug designation for three of these clinical settings, as well as Fast Track designation for adjuvant therapy for HRLACC patients and a SPA for the phase 3 AIM2CERV trial in HRLACC patients. Axalimogene filolisbac has also been classified as an advanced therapy medicinal product for the treatment of cervical cancer by the EMA’s CAT.
Advaxis has two additional immunotherapy products: ADXS-PSA in prostate cancer and ADXS-HER2 in HER2 expressing solid tumors, in human clinical development. In addition, Advaxis and Amgen are developing ADXS-NEO, an investigational cancer immunotherapy treatment designed to activate a patient's immune system to respond against the unique mutations, or neoepitopes, contained in and identified from each individual patient's tumor, with plans to enter the clinic in 2017.
Advaxis is developing more than 20 distinct immunotherapies directly or in partnership with recognized cancer centers of excellence and with support from advocacy foundations such as: the Radiology Therapy Oncology Group Foundation, the GOG Foundation, the Children’s Oncology Group, Brown University Oncology Group, the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and others.  In addition, Advaxis has embraced strategic collaborations with other major biopharmaceutical companies such as Amgen, Bristol Myers Squibb, Merck and others.

Axalimogene Filolisbac Phase 2 Data and Investigational Mechanism of
      Action Featured by Oncology Researchers

    PRINCETON, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
      Advaxis,
      Inc. (NASDAQ:ADXS), a late-stage biotechnology company focused on
      the discovery, development and commercialization of immunotherapy
      products based on its proprietary Lm-based antigen delivery
      system, today announced presentation of clinical data and a publication
      reviewing the mechanism of action via two prestigious oncology forums
      for its lead immunotherapy candidate, axalimogene filolisbac.
    

The
      European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) has accepted an
      abstract for a poster presentation at its 2017 Congress, featuring data
      from Advaxis’ Phase 2 FAWCETT study in patients with advanced anal
      cancer. This poster, entitled “Phase 2 study of ADXS11-001 immunotherapy
      in patients with persistent/recurrent surgically unresectable
      locoregional, or metastatic squamous cell anal cancer,” will feature
      Stage 1 data from the trial, which shows promising activity with
      axalimogene filolisbac in patients with late-stage anal cancer. It will
      be presented by Principal Investigator Cathy Eng, MD, FACP, Professor
      and Associate Medical Director, colorectal cancer, Division of Cancer
      Medicine at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.
      Considered the most influential meeting for oncology professionals in
      Europe, the ESMO annual conference will take place in Madrid, September
      8-12 this year.
    

      The peer-reviewed journal Gynecologic Oncology Research and Practice (GORP)
      published a review article, entitled “Mechanistic
      insights into ADXS11-001 human papillomavirus-associated cancer
      immunotherapy” (DOI: 10.1186/s40661-017-0046-9), illustrating the
      mechanism of action of axalimogene filolisbac and the scientific
      validity of using Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) as an
      immunotherapeutic bacterial vector. Brett A. Miles, MD, of the Division
      of Head and Neck Cancer Surgery, Department of Otolaryngology at the
      Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai; Bradley J. Monk, MD, Professor,
      Gynecologic Oncology: University of Arizona and Creighton University;
      and Howard P. Safran, MD, of the Brown University Oncology Group,
      cowrote the article. According to Dr. Miles, the lead author,
      axalimogene filolisbac has shown a consistent safety profile and
      promising signs of anti-tumor activity in multiple clinical
      investigations, paving the way for registrational quality phase 3
      trials. In addition, a second article titled, “Therapeutic options for
      treatment of HPV-associated cancers – novel immunologic vaccines:
      ADXS11-001,” has also been accepted for publication in GORP. It will
      showcase the potential for widespread application of axalimogene
      filolisbac across various types of HPV-associated cancers, placing it
      among the promising immunotherapeutic tools currently in clinical
      development.
    

      “We are pleased to have our lead immunotherapy candidate receive
      recognition from the oncology community through these important
      scientific platforms,” says Anthony Lombardo, interim chief executive
      officer. “Advaxis is committed to pursuing the clinical potential of
      axalimogene filolisbac in HPV-associated cancers, to bring new treatment
      options to patients, and potentially extend lives.”

Advaxis Provides 2017 Business Outlook


 Download as PDF

January 09, 2017

PRINCETON, N.J., Jan.  09, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Advaxis, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADXS), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing cancer immunotherapies, today issued its 2017 business outlook to provide an overview of anticipated events and key milestones for the coming year, as well as a look back at clinical and business highlights from 2016.
Advaxis made significant strides in its clinical development programs and expanded its pipeline with additional preclinical assets in 2016. The company’s lead product candidate, axalimogene filolisbac, received Fast Track designation and a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) for the global Phase 3 AIM2CERV study, a randomized study of axalimogene filolisbac following chemoradiation in patients with high-risk, locally advanced cervical cancer (HRLACC). Also in 2016, axalimogene filolisbac was classified as an advanced therapy medicinal product (ATMP) for the treatment of cervical cancer by the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Committee for Advanced Therapies (CAT). Late in 2016, the company initiated AIM2CERV and announced positive, final data from the GOG-0265 Phase 2 trial that supports pursuing a second global Phase 3 study in a metastatic recurrent cervical cancer. Also in 2016, Advaxis entered into a collaboration with Amgen Inc. (Amgen) for the global development and commercialization of Advaxis’ preclinical neoantigen technology, ADXS-NEO, to create a personalized approach to cancer treatment. In 2016, Advaxis expanded its capabilities and added significant resources to support execution of two global registrational clinical trials and future commercialization of its immuno-oncology products. The company added close to $100 million in capital from proceeds from the Amgen collaboration, a direct placement and a state grant. Advaxis expanded its management team in 2016 with the appointment of Chris Duke as Chief Operating Officer, and added approximately 30 more employees in key areas, as the company grew its headcount to 80 over the course of the year.  In September, the company completed the buildout of its clinical manufacturing facility to produce clinical trial supplies and expanded its research laboratory facility. Also, the company began construction of its commercial manufacturing facility, all at its Princeton headquarters.   2017 OPERATIONAL MILESTONES Advaxis anticipates the following development milestones in 2017: Clinical Operations Axalimogene Filolisbac 
Present a detailed data analysis of the completed Phase 2 GOG-0265 trial, which was conducted by the GOG Foundation, Inc. (GOG, now part of NRG Oncology), evaluating patients with persistent or recurrent metastatic (squamous or non-squamous cell) carcinoma of the cervix (PRmCC), at a medical meeting in the first half of 2017. Top-line data released in 2016 showed a 12-month overall survival rate of 38 percent observed in 50 patients in the trial. This is a 52 percent improvement over the 12-month overall survival rate that was expected in the trial’s patient population based on prognostic factors.
Attend an end-of-Phase-2 meeting with respect to PRmCC with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to discuss the results of GOG-0265. 
Submit a marketing authorization application to the EMA for approval of axalimogene filolisbac to treat patients with metastatic cervical cancer in the second half of 2017.
Open approximately 150 clinical sites for the global, 450-patient Phase 3 AIM2CERV trial in patients with HRLACC, with a trial enrollment update to be issued at a medical meeting in the first half of 2017. There are 10 active trial sites in the United States as of this week.
Initiate a second global, registrational Phase 3 study in patients with metastatic cervical cancer in the second half of 2017.
Present updated clinical data from the Phase 1/2 combination trial with AstraZeneca’s investigational anti-PD-L1 inhibitor, durvalumab, in patients with recurrent, persistent or metastatic cervical cancer or HPV+ squamous cell cancer of the head and neck (HNSCC) at a medical meeting in the second half of 2017. 
Present additional data from the Phase 2 BrUOG trial in high-risk, locally advanced anal cancer, conducted in collaboration with Brown University’s Oncology Research Group, at a medical meeting in the first half of 2017.
Present additional data from the Phase 2 window of opportunity trial in HPV-positive head and neck cancers at a medical meeting in the first half of 2017.
With full enrollment achieved in Stage 1 of the FAWCETT Phase 2 trial in patients with persistent or recurrent metastatic anal cancer, the company plans to present a preliminary trial update at a medical meeting in the second half of 2017.
 ADXS-PSA Complete initial dosing of Part B of the Phase 1/2 trial evaluating ADXS-PSA in combination with KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) in advanced, metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) and present preliminary data at a medical meeting in 2017. Initiate and complete enrollment of the expansion cohort by year-end 2017.  ADXS-HER2 Initiate a study in pediatric osteosarcoma in collaboration with the Children’s Oncology Group in 2017. Expanding Pipeline ADXS-NEO Collaboration with Amgen 
Submit an Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the FDA in early 2017.
Initiate the first-in-human ADXS-NEO clinical trial.
Accelerate the discovery of personalized cancer immunotherapies derived from neoantigens as part of the TESLA (Tumor neoantigEn SeLection Alliance) with the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy and the Cancer Research Institute.
 ADXS-HOT Prepare and file an IND with the FDA for ADXS-HOT constructs that target tumor driver genes, so-called hotspot mutations or public mutations, found in various cancer types in the second half of 2017.                         Enhanced Manufacturing and Research Capabilities 
Increase capacity to include in-house clinical and commercial manufacturing capabilities, initially to manufacture clinical supplies for the ADXS-NEO program in 2017.
Reduce lead times and improve overall supply chain by operationalizing several technology transfers with its partners and by installing new innovative technologies.
 Corporate Development 
Pursue research, clinical and commercial partnerships to optimize the cancer immunotherapy portfolio, including to enable development of lead asset, axalimogene filolisbac, in combination with other novel cancer therapies and to support its registration and potential commercialization in the EU.
Explore the application of detoxified Listeriolysin O (dtLLO) technology and optimize the research and development as an adjuvant molecule in the development of vaccines.
 2016 REVIEW Advaxis achieved several regulatory, clinical, business and operational milestones in 2016: Clinical Milestones Axalimogene Filolisbac 
June: Presented preliminary data at American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) from stage 1 of the Phase 2 GOG-0265 clinical study showing a 6-month survival rate of 38.5 percent in 26 patients, which exceeds prior historical GOG trials in this patient population. Of particular note, a patient from this stage experienced a complete response following three doses which remains ongoing.
June: Dosed the first patient in the first stage of the Phase 2 FAWCETT trial in patients with persistent or recurrent metastatic anal cancer.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Advaxis is an American company devoted to the discovery, development and commercialization of immunotherapies based on a technology platform which uses engineered Listeria monocytogenes (aka Lm).[1]:1 The company is headquartered in Princeton, New Jersey and was incorporated in Delaware in 2006.[1]:1
The Lm-based platform on which the company's products are based involves the use of attenuated Lm which secrete antigen/adjuvant fusion proteins and stimulate a patient's immune system (specifically their T cells) to mount an immune response to the secreted antigen; if the antigen is specifically found on cancerous cells, then the result aims to be an effective immune response targeting and eliminating the cancer.[1]:1 Treatments developed using this paradigm are referred to as Lm-LLO immunotherapies.[1]:1
Today, the Company has over fifteen distinct constructs in various stages of development, directly developed by the Company and through strategic collaborations with recognized centers of excellence such as: the National Cancer Institute, Cancer Research – UK, the Wistar Institute, the University of Pennsylvania, and the Department of Homeland Security among others.
The Company also has a veterinary medicine program that is evaluating an Lm-LLO based immunotherapy in a Phase 1 study in canine osteosarcoma. Source: www.advaxis.com

Corporate history and governance[edit]
Beginnings[edit]
Advaxis was a Delaware corporation when it was acquired by a shell corporation (in the official SEC sense)[2] in November 2004.[1]:1 The acquiring company was Great Expectations, which was incorporated in Colorado in June 1987.[1]:1 The only operating company owned by Great Expectations was Advaxis and in 2004, a month after the acquisition, it changed its name to Advaxis, and 18 months after that it reincorporated as a Delaware corporation.[1]:1 The official 'date of inception' for the company is 1 March 2002.[1]:1
Corporate governance[edit]
As of December 2013[update], the COO of Advaxis was Gregory Mayes.[3]
Partnerships[edit]
In 2014, Advaxis entered a co-development and commercialization agreement with India's Biocon for the ADXS-HPV therapeutic in the Indian market, addressing HPV-associated cancers, including cervical cancer.[1]:2,[4]
Advaxis Technology[edit]
Advaxis immunotherapies are based on a novel platform technology using live attenuated Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) that are bio-engineered to secrete an antigen/adjuvant fusion protein. The vectors infect the key elements of the immune system and the secreted antigen/adjuvant fusion protein redirects the powerful immune response all human beings inherit to Lm against the cancer, itself. The adjuvant also reduces the cancer’s defense against this immune attack by 80%.[5]

The Company's novel platform technology is based on over twenty years of pre-clinical research by Yvonne Paterson, Professor of Microbiology, University of Pennsylvania, and Fellow of the American Academy for the Advancement of Science.

Clinical Development Program[edit]
ADXS-HPV is in Phase 2 trials for HPV-associated diseases (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), cervical cancer and HPV-associated head and neck cancer).
In 2009 Advaxis published the results of the first Phase 1 trial with the first Lm-LLO based immunotherapy, ADXS-HPV in Vaccine (19 June 2009 / Volume 27, Issue 30). This study assessed side effects associated with increasing doses of ADXS-HPV in patients with metastatic, refractory, recurrent cervical cancer. Vaccine (19 June 2009 / Volume 27, Issue 30)

This study demonstrated for the first time that a live-attenuated Lm-LLO based immunotherapy could be administered to human subjects.
ADXS-HPV was well-tolerated and a maximum tolerated dose was established.
4/13 evaluable patients experienced increased survival and tumor shrinkage that merited further investigation.

Veterinary Medicine Program[edit]

Advaxis signed a CRADA (Cooperative Research And Development Agreement) with the Department of Homeland Security. The DHS will initially conduct a pilot “proof-of-concept” study in cattle investigating the safety of proprietary/patented Advaxis immunotherapies.[6][7]
Advaxis has begun a Phase 1 study with the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine to evaluate an Lm-LLO based immunotherapy in a Phase 1 study in canine osteosarcoma.[8][9]

Intellectual Property[edit]
Advaxis’ intellectual property includes over 70 pending and issued patents. On May 18, 2010, Advaxis and the University of Pennsylvania signed an agreement granting Advaxis exclusive rights to 27 remaining patents held by the University of Pennsylvania.

Advaxis is an American company devoted to the discovery, development and commercialization of immunotherapies based on a technology platform which uses engineered Listeria monocytogenes (aka Lm).[1]:1 The company is headquartered in Princeton, New Jersey and was incorporated in Delaware in 2006.[1]:1
The Lm-based platform on which the company's products are based involves the use of attenuated Lm which secrete antigen/adjuvant fusion proteins and stimulate a patient's immune system (specifically their T cells) to mount an immune response to the secreted antigen; if the antigen is specifically found on cancerous cells, then the result aims to be an effective immune response targeting and eliminating the cancer.[1]:1 Treatments developed using this paradigm are referred to as Lm-LLO immunotherapies.[1]:1
Today, the Company has over fifteen distinct constructs in various stages of development, directly developed by the Company and through strategic collaborations with recognized centers of excellence such as: the National Cancer Institute, Cancer Research – UK, the Wistar Institute, the University of Pennsylvania, and the Department of Homeland Security among others.
The Company also has a veterinary medicine program that is evaluating an Lm-LLO based immunotherapy in a Phase 1 study in canine osteosarcoma. Source: www.advaxis.com

Corporate history and governance[edit]
Beginnings[edit]
Advaxis was a Delaware corporation when it was acquired by a shell corporation (in the official SEC sense)[2] in November 2004.[1]:1 The acquiring company was Great Expectations, which was incorporated in Colorado in June 1987.[1]:1 The only operating company owned by Great Expectations was Advaxis and in 2004, a month after the acquisition, it changed its name to Advaxis, and 18 months after that it reincorporated as a Delaware corporation.[1]:1 The official 'date of inception' for the company is 1 March 2002.[1]:1
Corporate governance[edit]
As of December 2013[update], the COO of Advaxis was Gregory Mayes.[3]
Partnerships[edit]
In 2014, Advaxis entered a co-development and commercialization agreement with India's Biocon for the ADXS-HPV therapeutic in the Indian market, addressing HPV-associated cancers, including cervical cancer.[1]:2,[4]
Advaxis Technology[edit]
Advaxis immunotherapies are based on a novel platform technology using live attenuated Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) that are bio-engineered to secrete an antigen/adjuvant fusion protein. The vectors infect the key elements of the immune system and the secreted antigen/adjuvant fusion protein redirects the powerful immune response all human beings inherit to Lm against the cancer, itself. The adjuvant also reduces the cancer’s defense against this immune attack by 80%.[5]

The Company's novel platform technology is based on over twenty years of pre-clinical research by Yvonne Paterson, Professor of Microbiology, University of Pennsylvania, and Fellow of the American Academy for the Advancement of Science.

Clinical Development Program[edit]
ADXS-HPV is in Phase 2 trials for HPV-associated diseases (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), cervical cancer and HPV-associated head and neck cancer).
In 2009 Advaxis published the results of the first Phase 1 trial with the first Lm-LLO based immunotherapy, ADXS-HPV in Vaccine (19 June 2009 / Volume 27, Issue 30). This study assessed side effects associated with increasing doses of ADXS-HPV in patients with metastatic, refractory, recurrent cervical cancer. Vaccine (19 June 2009 / Volume 27, Issue 30)

This study demonstrated for the first time that a live-attenuated Lm-LLO based immunotherapy could be administered to human subjects.
ADXS-HPV was well-tolerated and a maximum tolerated dose was established.
4/13 evaluable patients experienced increased survival and tumor shrinkage that merited further investigation.

Veterinary Medicine Program[edit]

Advaxis signed a CRADA (Cooperative Research And Development Agreement) with the Department of Homeland Security. The DHS will initially conduct a pilot “proof-of-concept” study in cattle investigating the safety of proprietary/patented Advaxis immunotherapies.[6][7]
Advaxis has begun a Phase 1 study with the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine to evaluate an Lm-LLO based immunotherapy in a Phase 1 study in canine osteosarcoma.[8][9]

Intellectual Property[edit]
Advaxis’ intellectual property includes over 70 pending and issued patents. On May 18, 2010, Advaxis and the University of Pennsylvania signed an agreement granting Advaxis exclusive rights to 27 remaining patents held by the University of Pennsylvania.

Immunotherapies for cancer


Website
www.advaxis.com


Advaxis is an American company devoted to the discovery, development and commercialization of immunotherapies based on a technology platform which uses engineered Listeria monocytogenes (aka Lm).[1]:1 The company is headquartered in Princeton, New Jersey and was incorporated in Delaware in 2006.[1]:1
The Lm-based platform on which the company's products are based involves the use of attenuated Lm which secrete antigen/adjuvant fusion proteins and stimulate a patient's immune system (specifically their T cells) to mount an immune response to the secreted antigen; if the antigen is specifically found on cancerous cells, then the result aims to be an effective immune response targeting and eliminating the cancer.[1]:1 Treatments developed using this paradigm are referred to as Lm-LLO immunotherapies.[1]:1
Today, the Company has over fifteen distinct constructs in various stages of development, directly developed by the Company and through strategic collaborations with recognized centers of excellence such as: the National Cancer Institute, Cancer Research – UK, the Wistar Institute, the University of Pennsylvania, and the Department of Homeland Security among others.
The Company also has a veterinary medicine program that is evaluating an Lm-LLO based immunotherapy in a Phase 1 study in canine osteosarcoma. Source: www.advaxis.com

Corporate history and governance[edit]
Beginnings[edit]
Advaxis was a Delaware corporation when it was acquired by a shell corporation (in the official SEC sense)[2] in November 2004.[1]:1 The acquiring company was Great Expectations, which was incorporated in Colorado in June 1987.[1]:1 The only operating company owned by Great Expectations was Advaxis and in 2004, a month after the acquisition, it changed its name to Advaxis, and 18 months after that it reincorporated as a Delaware corporation.[1]:1 The official 'date of inception' for the company is 1 March 2002.[1]:1
Corporate governance[edit]
As of December 2013[update], the COO of Advaxis was Gregory Mayes.[3]
Partnerships[edit]
In 2014, Advaxis entered a co-development and commercialization agreement with India's Biocon for the ADXS-HPV therapeutic in the Indian market, addressing HPV-associated cancers, including cervical cancer.[1]:2,[4]
Advaxis Technology[edit]
Advaxis immunotherapies are based on a novel platform technology using live attenuated Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) that are bio-engineered to secrete an antigen/adjuvant fusion protein. The vectors infect the key elements of the immune system and the secreted antigen/adjuvant fusion protein redirects the powerful immune response all human beings inherit to Lm against the cancer, itself. The adjuvant also reduces the cancer’s defense against this immune attack by 80%.[5]

The Company's novel platform technology is based on over twenty years of pre-clinical research by Yvonne Paterson, Professor of Microbiology, University of Pennsylvania, and Fellow of the American Academy for the Advancement of Science.

Clinical Development Program[edit]
ADXS-HPV is in Phase 2 trials for HPV-associated diseases (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), cervical cancer and HPV-associated head and neck cancer).
In 2009 Advaxis published the results of the first Phase 1 trial with the first Lm-LLO based immunotherapy, ADXS-HPV in Vaccine (19 June 2009 / Volume 27, Issue 30). This study assessed side effects associated with increasing doses of ADXS-HPV in patients with metastatic, refractory, recurrent cervical cancer. Vaccine (19 June 2009 / Volume 27, Issue 30)

This study demonstrated for the first time that a live-attenuated Lm-LLO based immunotherapy could be administered to human subjects.
ADXS-HPV was well-tolerated and a maximum tolerated dose was established.
4/13 evaluable patients experienced increased survival and tumor shrinkage that merited further investigation.

Veterinary Medicine Program[edit]

Advaxis signed a CRADA (Cooperative Research And Development Agreement) with the Department of Homeland Security. The DHS will initially conduct a pilot “proof-of-concept” study in cattle investigating the safety of proprietary/patented Advaxis immunotherapies.[6][7]
Advaxis has begun a Phase 1 study with the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine to evaluate an Lm-LLO based immunotherapy in a Phase 1 study in canine osteosarcoma.[8][9]

Intellectual Property[edit]
Advaxis’ intellectual property includes over 70 pending and issued patents. On May 18, 2010, Advaxis and the University of Pennsylvania signed an agreement granting Advaxis exclusive rights to 27 remaining patents held by the University of Pennsylvania.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
