Albert B Yost's Experience
Title: 
               Company: U.S. Department of Energy
Job Details
               The Department of Energy is establishing a hemispheric energy center at Florida International University. The center will coordinate projects that strengthen cooperation on policy, commercial, technical, infrastructure, and regulatory issues and enhance U.S. access to energy resources in the region. Venezuela has had a strong energy relationship with the United States for many decades. Unfortunately, Venezuela's recent political unrest has affected their ability to be a secure supplier in the recent past. We are encouraged to hear that production reportedly has recovered to about 2 to 2.5 million barrels per day, compared to a pre-strike production of about 3 million barrels per day.  U.S. firms are returning to full operation in Venezuela, and Venezuelan-owned CITGO continues to operate in the U.S. as a commercial entity. The benefits that these reciprocal energy investments bring to both parties, and to the relationship, are clear, and we hope to maintain a robust energy dialogue with Venezuela. In the Caribbean, Trinidad and Tobago is an important source of LNG to the United States. Trinidad provides about 15% of New England's gas needs and 40% of the East Coast's LNG imports. Trinidad is poised to help meet the energy needs of the Caribbean region.

Albert, originally from Pittsburgh, and his wife Catherine, from Brooklyn, decided to stay in the area and grow roots for themselves and their five children. With Albert’s knack for home repairs, opening a home improvement company was a natural choice.The Yosts quickly turned their home into company headquarters. During the early days, Albert oversaw projects while Catherine fielded calls and stayed on top of paperwork. It also wasn’t unusual for Catherine to prepare full course meals for the crew. Soon the Yost’s two sons Albert Jr. and George joined the company, eventually taking it over in 1983.Throughout the years, the Yost brand has expanded greatly. After finding the gutter products they were receiving from suppliers did not meet their standards of quality, Yost decided to become their own supplier. In 1981, they purchased machinery and established a second company, Yost Manufacturing and Supply. Today, every gutter, downspout and elbow Yost Home Improvements installs on a home is created by Yost Manufacturing and meets the highest level of craftsmanship.Yost has been an innovator in the gutter industry, with George designing and patenting a system to eliminate visible metal straps when gutters are attached to roofs. Since its inception, Yost Manufacturing has grown to distribute gutter machines and materials worldwide to customers in places as far reaching as Brazil, China and Australia.The Yost headquarters have also gone through several facelifts over the past five decades. In 1989, they purchased their current location on Hartford Turnpike in Waterford, the former site of the well known Ralph Strong Motorcycles. In 2002, with two businesses now operating under one roof and both requiring additional space, Yost transformed their building with a renovation that tripled its size.Albert Sr. passed away in 1987, but Catherine has continued to be involved with the business, impressively manufacturing elbows well into her late 70s. Although now retired, she still frequently visits the office and helps out where she can.Yost also continues to be a family affair. While Albert Jr. and George run the businesses, George’s wife Kathe oversees human resources as she’s done since 1976. Albert Jr.’s son and daughter and George’s three daughters have also all played integral roles in the company over the years.FIVE DECADES OF SERVICETestimonials I will without a doubt suggest to all my friends and family if they ever need work done, Yost is the way to go. Looking forward to the door. Thank you again for such a wonderful and professional job well done [read more] - Bill & Sharon             © 2013 Yost Home Improvements, Inc.
