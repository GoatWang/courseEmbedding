			Anthony L. Otten, 61, has served as a director since August 2015. In June 2017, Mr. Otten was appointed as our lead independent director. Mr. Otten has served as chief executive officer of Versar, Inc. since February 2010 and has served as a member of the board of directors of Versar, Inc. since 2008. Mr. Otten previously served as managing member of Stillwater, LLC from July 2009 to February 2010; operating partner of New Stream Asset Funding, LLC from 2007 to June 2009; managing member of Stillwater, LLC from 2004 to 2007 and principal of Grisanti, Galef and Goldress, Inc. from 2001 to 2004. Previously, Mr. Otten held senior management positions with Cabot Corporation and Marriott Corporation. We believe that Mr. Otten's experience as a chief executive officer of a public company, capital markets expertise and merger and acquisition experience qualify him for service as a director of our company. We further believe that Mr. Otten's leadership experience and contributions to our board qualify him to serve as our lead director. Our nominating and governance committee and our board have nominated Mr. Otten as a Class III (2016-2019) director in order to preserve our staggered board as a result of the restructuring of our board as described above. Accordingly, assuming he is elected, Mr. Otten's designation will change from Class II (2015-2018) to Class III (2016-2019) following the annual meeting.
