Product Description▼▲
Williams' original publication was, arguably, to concise and often left important elements aborted, while not treating others well. Yet, for the most part, the book contained excellent and readily accessible information with perhaps the best selection of textual examples available. Beckman's revision builds on this template, and has turned the original into perhaps the best concise second year Hebrew grammar available today. Highly recommended.

Product Description

God has given us ten simple rules to follow that we may have life and have it more abundantly. From the time He unveiled the Ten Commandments to the children of Israel at Mount Sinai until now, God’s people have been identified by the fact that they follow His commandments.
The Ten Commandments are the Christian’s code of conduct that separates us from the rest of the world and serves as a barometer of our allegiance to the Creator of the universe. Ten Commandments: The Christian Code of Conduct examines the commandments of God and how they apply to the Christian life. The book also addresses one of the most misunderstood commandments—the fourth commandment and the call to observe the biblical Sabbath. Many Christians differ on their interpretation of this commandment, but through a clear study of the Bible, this book points to the truth of the Sabbath and the importance for Christians to follow all ten commandments.
As the end of the world draws near, those who will be ready for Christ’s return are “those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus” (Rev. 14:12). May God’s followers be found keeping all ten of His commandments!
About the Author
John C. Williams resides in Mililani, Hawaii, on the island of Oahu, where he works for the U.S. Naval Computer Telecommunications Area Master Station in the Pacific.
John wrote this book in response to numerous objections/questions from different persons about validity of the Sabbath and the Ten Commandments after reading the book Ten Commandments, Twice Removed. In his spare time, John enjoys studying the Bible, leading out in small groups, writing for his blog, and comparing history with current world events.

Experienced Chicago Product Liability Attorneys
A number of attorneys at Williams Montgomery & John devote a substantial portion of their practice to defending product liability lawsuits.
The firm's product liability representations have been recognized by The National Law Journal as "Outstanding Defense Verdicts" in the United States, including the successful defense of Black & Decker in a lawsuit arising out of the alleged defective design of a power saw, Bill Kelley Athletic, Inc. in a lawsuit alleging the defective design of a football helmet, and Goodyear in a lawsuit alleging the defective design and manufacture of a tire which resulted in tread separation causing a vehicle rollover accident.  Our Chicago law firm has extensive experience with product liability lawsuits alleging manufacturing and design defects of airbags, seatbelts and other automobile components.  Our attorneys have represented Ford Motor Company in dozens of Ford Explorer cases involving tread separations of Firestone tires in federal and state courts in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Virginia, Pennsylvania and Florida.
Types of Cases We Have Litigated
The firm regularly defends manufacturers, distributors and retailers against product liability claims based on negligence, strict product liability and breach of warranty. Our attorneys have litigated cases involving an extensive array of products, including:

silicone breast implants, contact lens solution, pharmaceuticals and dietary supplements;
genetically engineered corn;
child safety restraints;
above-ground and in-ground swimming pools;
vehicle tires, axles, brakes, clutches and other components;
aircraft engines and components;
industrial and consumer power tools;
welding rods, conveyer systems and heat exchangers;
earth moving and farming equipment; and
asbestos and toxic chemicals.

In the aviation area, our attorneys have litigated cases involving catastrophic commercial airline, general aviation and helicopter accidents.  For example, we have represented Lycoming Engines and Textron in wrongful death suits arising from piston engine aircraft accidents, defended a class action product liability lawsuit seeking more than $60 million in damages for alleged defects in 5,000 reciprocating aircraft engines, and defended Bell Helicopter and Textron in wrongful death product liability suits involving helicopter accidents.
We’re Qualified to Defend Your Case
The Chicago product liability lawyers at Williams Montgomery & John are skilled at developing the factual and legal defenses and explaining to jurors the complex scientific and technical issues that often arise in these types of cases.
As a result of the firm's experience, our lawyers have been retained as national or regional trial counsel for more than 60 corporate clients, including Ford Motor Company, Fisher-Price (US) Inc., Black & Decker, General Electric, Goodyear Tire & Rubber, Cooper Tire & Rubber, Genentech, Inc., Muskin Pools, Kimberly-Clark, Eagle Picher and Standard Asbestos.
A list of representative matters can be found by clicking on the "Representative Matters" link above.
The firm's product liability practice is led by partner Barry Montgomery, a Fellow of the International Academy of Trial Lawyers who has been recognized by The National Law Journal as one of the "Top 10 Litigators in the United States." He is listed in Best Lawyers in America, has been selected by his peers for inclusion in Illinois Leading Lawyers for product liability defense and has been recognized in the International Who's Who of Product Liability Defense Lawyers. Several additional partners of the firm are listed in Illinois Leading Lawyers and Illinois Super Lawyers for product liability defense.
For more information about the firm's product liability practice, please contact Mr. Montgomery at 312.443.3242 or cbm@willmont.com.

Office of the President

John C. Williams, President and Chief Executive Officer
John C. Williams took office as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco on March 1, 2011. In this role, he serves on the Federal Open Market Committee, bringing the Fed’s Twelfth District’s perspective to monetary policy discussions in Washington.
Dr. Williams was previously the executive vice president and director of research for the San Francisco bank, which he joined in 2002. He began his career in 1994 as an economist at the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, following the completion of his PhD in economics at Stanford University. Prior to that, he earned a master’s of science from the London School of Economics, and an A.B. from the University of California at Berkeley.
Dr. Williams’ research focuses on topics including: monetary policy under uncertainty; innovation; and business cycles. Additionally, he served as senior economist at the White House Council of Economic Advisers and as a lecturer at Stanford University’s Graduate School of Business.
Dr. Williams, 55, is a native of Sacramento, California. He is married with two sons and resides in the San Francisco Bay Area.

Past Presidents


Presidents of the 12th District
The Federal Reserve Act provides that the president of a Federal Reserve Bank shall be the chief executive officer of the Bank, appointed by the board of directors of the Bank, with the approval of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, for a term of five years. Twelve individuals have led the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, ranging in terms of service from one year to 18 years. The first three leaders held the title “Governor.” The Banking Act of 1935 abolished the dual role of governor and agent and created a single leadership role – president. Many who served likely shared the sentiment of our current president, John C. Williams as expressed in the 2010 annual report: “As I take on this new role, I feel a keen sense of responsibility both to the Federal Reserve System and to the communities of the Twelfth Federal Reserve District, who rely on us to safeguard the financial system and set a prudent course on monetary policy.”
To learn more about Federal Reserve Bank Presidents throughout the System, visit the Federal Reserve Board of Governors site.

He has the ability to lead teams without being overbearing, by example and inspiration. 
     John is really a master at taking tremendously complex problems and breaking them into workable chunks, whether it is a leading edge hybrid vehicle project or a diverse and distributed international engineering team.
