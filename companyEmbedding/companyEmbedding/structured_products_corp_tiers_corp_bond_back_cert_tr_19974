Risks









Types













The range of corporate bonds issued each year allows investors to tailor a bond portfolio around their specific needs. The various types of corporate bonds offer different risk levels, as well as varying yields and payment schedules.
Fixed-rate coupons

The most common form of corporate bond is one that has a stated coupon that remains fixed throughout the bond’s life. It represents the annual interest rate, usually paid in two installments every six months, although some bonds pay annually, quarterly, or monthly. The payment amount is calculated as a percentage of the par value, regardless of the purchase price or current market value. With corporate bonds, one bond represents $1,000 par value, so a 5% fixed-rate coupon will pay $50 per bond annually ($1,000 × 5%). The payment cycle is not necessarily aligned to the calendar year; it begins on the "Dated Date," which is either on or soon after the bond’s issue date, and ends on the bond’s maturity date, when the final coupon and return of principal payment are paid.
Investment grade vs. non-investment grade (high yield)

Corporate bonds are generally rated by one or more of the three primary ratings agencies: Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s, and Fitch. These firms base their ratings on the bond issuer’s financial health and likely ability to make interest payments and return the bondholders’ principal. Rated bonds fall into one of two categories: investment grade or non-investment grade (also known as high yield). Investment grade bonds are considered to be lower risk and, therefore, generally pay lower interest rates than non-investment grade bonds, though some are more highly rated than others within the category. Non-investment grade bonds are considered to be higher risk or speculative investments. The higher yield reflects an increased risk of default. A company’s financial health can change, and when it does, its bonds’ ratings may change as well. So an investment grade bond could become non-investment grade over time and vice versa.
Zero-coupon

Zero-coupon corporate bonds are issued at a discount from face value (par), with the full value, including imputed interest, paid at maturity. Interest is taxable, even though no actual payments are made. Prices of zero-coupon bonds tend to be more volatile than bonds that make regular interest payments.
Floating-rate*

The coupon on a floating-rate corporate bond changes in relationship to a predetermined benchmark, such as the spread above the yield on a six-month Treasury or the price of a commodity. This reset can occur multiple times per year. The coupon and benchmark can also have an inverse relationship.
Variable- and adjustable-rate*

Variable- and adjustable-rate corporate bonds are similar to floating-rate bonds, except that coupons are tied to a long-term interest rate benchmark and are typically only reset annually.
Callable and puttable

The issuer of a callable corporate bond maintains the right to redeem the security on a set date prior to maturity and pay back the bond’s owner either par (full) value or a percentage of par value. The call schedule lists the precise call dates of when an issuer may choose to pay back the bonds and the price at which they will do so. The callable price is generally expressed as a percent of par value, but other all-price quotation methods exist.
With a puttable security, or put option, the investor has the right to put the security back to the issuer, again at a set date or a trigger event prior to maturity. A common example is the “survivor’s option,” whereby if the owner of the bond dies, the heirs have the ability to put back the bond to the issuer and typically receive par value in return.
Step-up*

Step-up corporate bonds pay a fixed rate of interest until the call date, at which time the coupon increases if the bond is not called.
Step-down*

Interest on step-down securities is paid at a fixed rate until the call date, at which time the coupon decreases if the bond is not called.
Convertible Bonds*

Convertible bonds can be exchanged for a specified amount of the common stock of the issuing company, although provisions generally restrict when a conversion can take place. While these bonds offer the potential for appreciation of the underlying security, prices may be susceptible to stock market fluctuations.

Features & Benefits














Choice

The range of corporate bonds issued each year allows investors to tailor a bond portfolio around specific needs. Investors should, however, consider that each issuer has its own unique risk profile.
Secondary market

An active secondary market exists for many corporate bonds, which creates liquidity for investors. Investors need to remember that some issues can be thinly traded, which may impact pricing and may pose a challenge when selling.
New issues

Customers are able to access new issue corporate bonds through the CorporateNotes ProgramSM. Each week a limited number of new issue corporate bonds are available for purchase at par, in minimum denominations of $1,000, without additional trading concessions.
Ratings

Most corporate bonds are rated by at least one of the major rating agencies. Fidelity offers both investment grade and non-investment grade bonds, which are classified according to their rating. When considering an investment in corporate bonds, remember that higher potential returns are typically associated with greater risk.
Yields

Corporate bonds are among the highest yielding fixed income securities. In fact, the yield differential over Treasuries may be great enough to outpace inflation over the long term. Because interest is fully taxable, buyers should evaluate their tax situations before investing.













Risks













When investing in corporate bonds, investors should remember that multiple risk factors can impact short- and long-term returns. Understanding these risks is an important first step towards managing them.
Credit and default risk

Corporate bonds are subject to credit risk. It’s important to pay attention to changes in the credit quality of the issuer, as less creditworthy issuers may be more likely to default on interest payments or principal repayment. If a bond issuer fails to make either a coupon or principal payment when they are due, or fails to meet some other provision of the bond indenture, it is said to be in default. One way to manage this risk is to diversify across different issuers and industry sectors.
Market risk

Price volatility of corporate bonds increases with the length of the maturity and decreases as the size of the coupon increases. Changes in credit rating can also affect prices. If one of the major rating services lowers its credit rating for a particular issue, the price of that security usually declines.
Event risk

A bond’s payments are dependent on the issuer’s ability to generate cash flow. Unforeseen events could impact their ability to meet those commitments.
Call risk

Many corporate bonds may have call provisions, which means they can be redeemed or paid off at the issuer’s discretion prior to maturity. Typically an issuer will call a bond when interest rates fall, potentially leaving investors with a capital loss or loss in income and less favorable reinvestment options. Prior to purchasing a corporate bond, determine whether call provisions exist.
Make-whole calls

Some bonds give the issuer the right to call a bond, but stipulate that redemptions occur at par plus a premium. This feature is referred to as a make-whole call. The amount of the premium is determined by the yield of a comparable mature Treasury security, plus additional basis points. Because the cost to the issuer can often be significant, make-whole calls are rarely invoked.
Sector risk

Corporate bond issuers fall into four main sectors: industrial, financial, utilities, and transportation. Bonds in these economic sectors can be affected by a range of factors, including corporate events, consumer demand, changes in the economic cycle, changes in regulation, interest rate and commodity volatility, changes in overseas economic conditions, and currency fluctuations. Understanding the degree to which each sector can be influenced by these factors is the first step toward building a diversified bond portfolio.
Interest rate risk

If interest rates rise, the price of existing bonds usually declines. That’s because new bonds are likely to be issued with higher yields as interest rates increase, making the old or outstanding bonds less attractive. If interest rates decline, however, bond prices usually increase, which means an investor can sometimes sell a bond for more than face value, since other investors are willing to pay a premium for a bond with a higher interest payment. The longer a bond’s maturity, the greater the impact a change in interest rates can have on its price. If you’re holding a bond until maturity, interest rate risk is not a concern.
Inflation risk

Like all bonds, corporate bonds are subject to inflation risk. Inflation may diminish the purchasing power of a bond’s interest and principal.
Foreign risk

In addition to the risks mentioned above, there are additional considerations for bonds issued by foreign governments and corporations. These bonds can experience greater volatility, due to increased political, regulatory, market, or economic risks. These risks are usually more pronounced in emerging markets, which may be subject to greater social, economic, regulatory, and political uncertainties.

Gain a deeper understanding of fixed income and bonds.


















          In general the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk, liquidity risk, call risk, and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties.

Core position



Uninvested cash

Uninvested cash in your account is held in what is known as a core position. Think of your core position as a place where money is held before you invest it or distribute it from your account. For the Fidelity Account®, you may choose one of many core positions:

Fidelity Government Money Market Fund (SPAXX), a taxable mutual fund normally investing at least 80% of assets in U.S. Government securities and related debt, and related repurchase/reverse repurchase agreements. Intended for investors seeking as high a level of current income as is consistent with the preservation of capital and liquidity.*
Fidelity Treasury Money Market Fund (FLTXX), a taxable mutual fund normally investing at least 80% of assets in U.S. Treasury securities and related repurchase/reverse repurchase agreements. Intended for investors seeking as high a level of current income as is consistent with the preservation of capital and liquidity.*



							
								*
							
							
								
					
You could lose money by investing in a money market fund. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Fidelity Investments and its affiliates, the fund’s sponsor, have no legal obligation to provide financial support to money market funds and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the fund at any time.


Fidelity’s government and U.S. Treasury money market funds will not impose a fee upon the sale of your shares, nor temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the fund's weekly liquid assets fall below 30% of its total assets because of market conditions or other factors.

Corporate Events Monitor
Each day there might be multiple changes in your data feeds. Some may be critical changes but others might be just be minor tweaks to your data – fixing a typo, reformatting an address, expanding an abbreviation, normalizing a legal form. These will all generate alerts you will need to review.
How do you quickly and reliably separate the actionable information from the noise?
Alacra’s Corporate Events Monitor, powered by software and analysts, tracks the changes to all the rated, regulated and listed entities in the Alacra Authority File and provides a summary of the “real” changes. You can quickly and easily see when a regulator has initiated regulation, when a ticker has changed, when a security has been delisted and when a company has actually moved (rather than just having its address reformatted in a vendor feed).
The table below summarizes the events that occurred in the last 7 days.

Alacra enables compliance by accurately and uniquely identifying clients, counterparties and vendors for effective Know Your Customer (KYC) due diligence, on-boarding and monitoring. Alacra matches together multiple data sources to create one clean, de-duped and consistently formatted legal entity data file. With almost 20 years of experience cross-referencing and mapping, we are truly the “Rosetta Stone” of entity data identifiers.
Alacra is pleased to provide free access to Resolve, our matching and cross-referencing engine, during this public beta period.
Enter the name of the entity or any of its public identifiers, such as CIK, FRN, GIIN, LEI or RSSD, in the search box below.
Resolve will search through almost 5 million legal entities in the Alacra Legal Entity Directory to identify the entity.

















To provide feedback about Resolve, or to explore commercial access to the product, please email us at resolve@alacra.com.

 Create a Central Data RepositoryMany organizations are on a path to centralize and optimize data management repositories to power disparate departments across the organization. Alacra can help reduce date silos by mapping together internal data sources, while supporting downstream business users. Learn moreSatisfy Regulatory ReportingWe can add LEIs (Legal Entity Identifiers), FACTA GIINs (Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act Global Intermediary Identification Number), credit ratings, and many other identifiers, to your counterparty information so you can generate the correct reports quickly and easily generate the reports needed for Basel II and III, Solvency II, EMIR, MiFID II and other regulations and directives.  Learn moreBuild Credit ModelsIf you are building internal credit default and/or ratings models for enhanced risk management, more refined credit exposure limits or better investment decision making, Alacra can help provide a clean, de-duped and cross-mapped file of entities with credit ratings and other credit-related pricing or default metrics. Learn moreKYC ComplianceBeing able to accurately and uniquely identify a client, counterparty or vendor is the foundation of effective Know Your Customer (KYC) due diligence, on-boarding and monitoring. Alacra maintains up-to-date list of rated, regulated and listed entities and is an expert in uniquely identifying the “right” entity. Learn moreCRM CleanupFor a CRM, client portal, or any form of research and analysis you need to be able to access all the information on a client or prospect. Sales teams need to know all the products that clients use before calling on them. Bad data can mean missed cross-selling opportunities, bad contact information or just general confusion and frustration. Learn moreSelected Data Partners

Risks









Types













The range of corporate bonds issued each year allows investors to tailor a bond portfolio around their specific needs. The various types of corporate bonds offer different risk levels, as well as varying yields and payment schedules.
Fixed-rate coupons

The most common form of corporate bond is one that has a stated coupon that remains fixed throughout the bond’s life. It represents the annual interest rate, usually paid in two installments every six months, although some bonds pay annually, quarterly, or monthly. The payment amount is calculated as a percentage of the par value, regardless of the purchase price or current market value. With corporate bonds, one bond represents $1,000 par value, so a 5% fixed-rate coupon will pay $50 per bond annually ($1,000 × 5%). The payment cycle is not necessarily aligned to the calendar year; it begins on the "Dated Date," which is either on or soon after the bond’s issue date, and ends on the bond’s maturity date, when the final coupon and return of principal payment are paid.
Investment grade vs. non-investment grade (high yield)

Corporate bonds are generally rated by one or more of the three primary ratings agencies: Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s, and Fitch. These firms base their ratings on the bond issuer’s financial health and likely ability to make interest payments and return the bondholders’ principal. Rated bonds fall into one of two categories: investment grade or non-investment grade (also known as high yield). Investment grade bonds are considered to be lower risk and, therefore, generally pay lower interest rates than non-investment grade bonds, though some are more highly rated than others within the category. Non-investment grade bonds are considered to be higher risk or speculative investments. The higher yield reflects an increased risk of default. A company’s financial health can change, and when it does, its bonds’ ratings may change as well. So an investment grade bond could become non-investment grade over time and vice versa.
Zero-coupon

Zero-coupon corporate bonds are issued at a discount from face value (par), with the full value, including imputed interest, paid at maturity. Interest is taxable, even though no actual payments are made. Prices of zero-coupon bonds tend to be more volatile than bonds that make regular interest payments.
Floating-rate*

The coupon on a floating-rate corporate bond changes in relationship to a predetermined benchmark, such as the spread above the yield on a six-month Treasury or the price of a commodity. This reset can occur multiple times per year. The coupon and benchmark can also have an inverse relationship.
Variable- and adjustable-rate*

Variable- and adjustable-rate corporate bonds are similar to floating-rate bonds, except that coupons are tied to a long-term interest rate benchmark and are typically only reset annually.
Callable and puttable

The issuer of a callable corporate bond maintains the right to redeem the security on a set date prior to maturity and pay back the bond’s owner either par (full) value or a percentage of par value. The call schedule lists the precise call dates of when an issuer may choose to pay back the bonds and the price at which they will do so. The callable price is generally expressed as a percent of par value, but other all-price quotation methods exist.
With a puttable security, or put option, the investor has the right to put the security back to the issuer, again at a set date or a trigger event prior to maturity. A common example is the “survivor’s option,” whereby if the owner of the bond dies, the heirs have the ability to put back the bond to the issuer and typically receive par value in return.
Step-up*

Step-up corporate bonds pay a fixed rate of interest until the call date, at which time the coupon increases if the bond is not called.
Step-down*

Interest on step-down securities is paid at a fixed rate until the call date, at which time the coupon decreases if the bond is not called.
Convertible Bonds*

Convertible bonds can be exchanged for a specified amount of the common stock of the issuing company, although provisions generally restrict when a conversion can take place. While these bonds offer the potential for appreciation of the underlying security, prices may be susceptible to stock market fluctuations.

Features & Benefits














Choice

The range of corporate bonds issued each year allows investors to tailor a bond portfolio around specific needs. Investors should, however, consider that each issuer has its own unique risk profile.
Secondary market

An active secondary market exists for many corporate bonds, which creates liquidity for investors. Investors need to remember that some issues can be thinly traded, which may impact pricing and may pose a challenge when selling.
New issues

Customers are able to access new issue corporate bonds through the CorporateNotes ProgramSM. Each week a limited number of new issue corporate bonds are available for purchase at par, in minimum denominations of $1,000, without additional trading concessions.
Ratings

Most corporate bonds are rated by at least one of the major rating agencies. Fidelity offers both investment grade and non-investment grade bonds, which are classified according to their rating. When considering an investment in corporate bonds, remember that higher potential returns are typically associated with greater risk.
Yields

Corporate bonds are among the highest yielding fixed income securities. In fact, the yield differential over Treasuries may be great enough to outpace inflation over the long term. Because interest is fully taxable, buyers should evaluate their tax situations before investing.













Risks













When investing in corporate bonds, investors should remember that multiple risk factors can impact short- and long-term returns. Understanding these risks is an important first step towards managing them.
Credit and default risk

Corporate bonds are subject to credit risk. It’s important to pay attention to changes in the credit quality of the issuer, as less creditworthy issuers may be more likely to default on interest payments or principal repayment. If a bond issuer fails to make either a coupon or principal payment when they are due, or fails to meet some other provision of the bond indenture, it is said to be in default. One way to manage this risk is to diversify across different issuers and industry sectors.
Market risk

Price volatility of corporate bonds increases with the length of the maturity and decreases as the size of the coupon increases. Changes in credit rating can also affect prices. If one of the major rating services lowers its credit rating for a particular issue, the price of that security usually declines.
Event risk

A bond’s payments are dependent on the issuer’s ability to generate cash flow. Unforeseen events could impact their ability to meet those commitments.
Call risk

Many corporate bonds may have call provisions, which means they can be redeemed or paid off at the issuer’s discretion prior to maturity. Typically an issuer will call a bond when interest rates fall, potentially leaving investors with a capital loss or loss in income and less favorable reinvestment options. Prior to purchasing a corporate bond, determine whether call provisions exist.
Make-whole calls

Some bonds give the issuer the right to call a bond, but stipulate that redemptions occur at par plus a premium. This feature is referred to as a make-whole call. The amount of the premium is determined by the yield of a comparable mature Treasury security, plus additional basis points. Because the cost to the issuer can often be significant, make-whole calls are rarely invoked.
Sector risk

Corporate bond issuers fall into four main sectors: industrial, financial, utilities, and transportation. Bonds in these economic sectors can be affected by a range of factors, including corporate events, consumer demand, changes in the economic cycle, changes in regulation, interest rate and commodity volatility, changes in overseas economic conditions, and currency fluctuations. Understanding the degree to which each sector can be influenced by these factors is the first step toward building a diversified bond portfolio.
Interest rate risk

If interest rates rise, the price of existing bonds usually declines. That’s because new bonds are likely to be issued with higher yields as interest rates increase, making the old or outstanding bonds less attractive. If interest rates decline, however, bond prices usually increase, which means an investor can sometimes sell a bond for more than face value, since other investors are willing to pay a premium for a bond with a higher interest payment. The longer a bond’s maturity, the greater the impact a change in interest rates can have on its price. If you’re holding a bond until maturity, interest rate risk is not a concern.
Inflation risk

Like all bonds, corporate bonds are subject to inflation risk. Inflation may diminish the purchasing power of a bond’s interest and principal.
Foreign risk

In addition to the risks mentioned above, there are additional considerations for bonds issued by foreign governments and corporations. These bonds can experience greater volatility, due to increased political, regulatory, market, or economic risks. These risks are usually more pronounced in emerging markets, which may be subject to greater social, economic, regulatory, and political uncertainties.

Gain a deeper understanding of fixed income and bonds.


















          In general the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk, liquidity risk, call risk, and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties.

Core position



Uninvested cash

Uninvested cash in your account is held in what is known as a core position. Think of your core position as a place where money is held before you invest it or distribute it from your account. For the Fidelity Account®, you may choose one of many core positions:

Fidelity Government Money Market Fund (SPAXX), a taxable mutual fund normally investing at least 80% of assets in U.S. Government securities and related debt, and related repurchase/reverse repurchase agreements. Intended for investors seeking as high a level of current income as is consistent with the preservation of capital and liquidity.*
Fidelity Treasury Money Market Fund (FLTXX), a taxable mutual fund normally investing at least 80% of assets in U.S. Treasury securities and related repurchase/reverse repurchase agreements. Intended for investors seeking as high a level of current income as is consistent with the preservation of capital and liquidity.*



							
								*
							
							
								
					
You could lose money by investing in a money market fund. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Fidelity Investments and its affiliates, the fund’s sponsor, have no legal obligation to provide financial support to money market funds and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the fund at any time.


Fidelity’s government and U.S. Treasury money market funds will not impose a fee upon the sale of your shares, nor temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the fund's weekly liquid assets fall below 30% of its total assets because of market conditions or other factors.
