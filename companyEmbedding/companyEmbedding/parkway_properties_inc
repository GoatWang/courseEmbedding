PKY OVERVIEW
Parkway is an independent, publicly traded, 
                self-managed real estate investment trust (“REIT”) that owns and 
                operates high-quality office properties located in attractive submarkets 
                in Houston, Texas. Our portfolio consists of five Class A assets 
                comprising 19 buildings and totaling approximately 8.7 million rentable 
                square feet in the Greenway, Galleria and Westchase submarkets of 
                Houston, providing geographic focus and significant operational 
                scale and efficiencies. We believe that the creation of a geographically 
                focused REIT with a strong balance sheet and targeted internal value-creation 
                opportunities will generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for 
                our stockholders while providing a platform for external growth 
                opportunities over the longer term.

                Our mission will be to own and operate high-quality office properties 
                located in attractive submarkets in Houston, with a primary focus 
                on unlocking value within our existing portfolio through implementing 
                active and creative leasing strategies, leveraging our scale to 
                increase pricing power in lease and vendor negotiations and targeting 
                redevelopment and asset repositioning opportunities. We expect to 
                maintain a conservative balance sheet with low leverage and ample 
                liquidity, which we expect will allow us to access multiple sources 
                of capital. We believe that this strategy will support both our 
                internal growth initiatives and our patient and disciplined approach 
                to pursuing new investment opportunities at the appropriate times. 
                We believe this strategy, combined with our highly experienced management 
                team that has a successful history of operating a publicly traded 
                REIT, significant expertise in the Houston, Texas office sector 
                and extensive relationships with industry participants, positions 
                us for long-term external and internal growth.
