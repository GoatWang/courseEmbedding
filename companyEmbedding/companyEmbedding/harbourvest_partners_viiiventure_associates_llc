2.                                      
Registration Rights
.  The Company covenants and
agrees as follows:

 

2.1                               
Demand Registration
.

 

(a)                                 
Form S-1 Demand
.  Beginning upon the date that
is one hundred eighty (180) days after the effective date of
the registration statement for the IPO, if the Company receives a
request from any Major Investor that the Company file a
Form S-1 registration statement with respect to at least
twenty percent (20%) of the Registrable Securities then outstanding
(or a lesser percent if the anticipated aggregate offering price,
net of Selling Expenses, would exceed $10 million), then the
Company shall (i) within ten (10) days after the date
such request is given, give notice thereof (the “ Demand
Notice ”) to all Holders other than the Initiating
Holders; and (ii) as soon as practicable, and in any event
within sixty (60) days after the date such request is given by
the Initiating Holders, file a Form S-1 registration statement
under the Securities Act covering all Registrable Securities that
the Initiating Holders requested to be registered and any
additional Registrable Securities requested to be included in such
registration by any other Holders, as specified by notice given by
each such Holder to the Company within twenty (20) days of the
date the Demand Notice is given, and in each case, subject to the
limitations of Section 2.1(c)  and
Section 2.3 .

 

(b)                                 
Form S-3 Demand
.  If at any time when it is
eligible to use a Form S-3 registration statement and the
Company receives a request from Holders of at least ten percent
(10%) of the Registrable Securities then outstanding (or a lesser
percent if the anticipated aggregate offering price, net of Selling
Expenses, would exceed $1.0 million) that the Company file a
Form S-3 registration statement with respect to outstanding
Registrable Securities of such Holders having an anticipated
aggregate offering price, net of Selling Expenses, of at least $1.0
million, then the Company shall (i) within ten (10) days
after the date such request is given, give a Demand Notice to all
Holders other than the Initiating Holders; and (ii) as soon as
practicable, and in any event within thirty (30) days after
the date such request is given by the Initiating Holders, file a
Form S-3 registration statement under the Securities Act
covering all Registrable Securities requested to be included in
such registration by any other Holders, as specified by notice
given by each such Holder to the Company within twenty
(20) days of the date the Demand Notice is given, and in each
case, subject to the limitations of Section 2.1(c)
 and Section 2.3 .

 

(c)                                  
Notwithstanding the foregoing
obligations, if the Company furnishes to Holders requesting a
registration pursuant to this Section 2.1 a certificate
signed by the Company’s chief executive officer stating that
in the good faith judgment of the Company’s Board of
Directors it would be materially detrimental to the Company and its
stockholders for such registration statement to either become
effective or remain effective for as long as such registration
statement otherwise would be required to remain effective, because
such action would (i) materially interfere with a significant
acquisition, corporate reorganization, or other similar transaction
involving the Company; (ii) require premature disclosure of
material information that the Company has a bona fide business
purpose for preserving as confidential; or (iii) render the
Company unable to comply with requirements under the Securities Act
or Exchange Act, then the Company shall have the right to defer
taking action with respect to such filing, and any time periods
with respect to filing or effectiveness thereof shall be tolled
correspondingly, for a period of not more than forty-five
(45) days after the request of the
 
5 






 
Initiating Holders is given; provided, however,
that the Company may not invoke this right more than once in any
twelve (12) month period; and provided further that the
Company shall not register any securities for its own account or
that of any other stockholder during such forty-five (45) day
period other than an Excluded Registration.
 

(d)                                 
The Company shall not be obligated
to effect, or to take any action to effect, any registration
pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(i)  during the period
that is sixty (60) days before the Company’s good faith
estimate of the date of filing of, and ending on a date that is one
hundred eighty (180) days after the effective date of, a
Company-initiated registration, provided, that the Company is
actively employing its good faith commercially reasonable efforts
to cause such registration statement to become effective; or
(ii) after the Company has effected two (2) registrations
pursuant to Section 2.1(a) .  The Company shall
not be obligated to effect, or to take any action to effect, any
registration pursuant to Section 2.1(b)
 (i) during the period that is thirty (30) days
before the Company’s good faith estimate of the date of
filing of, and ending on a date that is ninety (90) days after
the effective date of, a Company-initiated registration, provided,
that the Company is actively employing its good faith commercially
reasonable efforts to cause such registration statement to become
effective; or (ii) if the Company has effected two
(2) registrations pursuant to Section 2.1(b)
 within the twelve (12) month period immediately
preceding the date of such request.  A registration shall not
be counted as “effected” for purposes of this
Section 2.1(d)  until such time as the applicable
registration statement has been declared effective by the SEC,
unless the Initiating Holders withdraw their request for such
registration (other than as a result of a material adverse effect),
elect not to pay the registration expenses therefor, and forfeit
their right to one demand registration statement pursuant to
Section 2.6 , in which case such withdrawn registration
statement shall be counted as “effected” for purposes
of this Section 2.1(d) .

 

2.2                               
Company Registration
.  If the Company proposes to
register (including, for this purpose, a registration effected by
the Company for stockholders other than the Holders) any of its
securities under the Securities Act in connection with the public
offering of such securities solely for cash (other than in an
Excluded Registration), the Company shall, at such time, promptly
give each Holder notice of such registration.  Upon the
request of each Holder given within twenty (20) days after
such notice is given by the Company, the Company shall, subject to
the provisions of Section 2.3 , cause to be registered
all of the Registrable Securities that each such Holder has
requested to be included in such registration.  The Company
shall have the right to terminate or withdraw any registration
initiated by it under this Section 2.2 before the
effective date of such registration, whether or not any Holder has
elected to include Registrable Securities in such
registration.  The expenses (other than Selling Expenses) of
such withdrawn registration shall be borne by the Company in
accordance with Section 2.6 .

 

2.3                               
Underwriting
Requirements .

 

(a)                                 
If, pursuant to
Section 2.1 , the Initiating Holders intend to
distribute the Registrable Securities covered by their request by
means of an underwriting, they shall so advise the Company as a
part of their request made pursuant to Section 2.1 ,
and the Company shall include such information in the Demand
Notice.  The underwriter(s) will be selected by the
Company and shall be reasonably acceptable to at least a
majority-in-interest of Initiating Holders.  In such event,
the right of any Holder to include such Holder’s
Registrable
 
6 






 
Securities in such registration shall be
conditioned upon such Holder’s participation in such
underwriting and the inclusion of such Holder’s Registrable
Securities in the underwriting to the extent provided herein. 
All Holders proposing to distribute their securities through such
underwriting shall (together with the Company as provided in
Section 2.4(e) ) enter into an underwriting agreement
in customary form with the underwriter(s) selected for such
underwriting.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Section 2.3 , if the managing underwriter advises the
Initiating Holders in writing that marketing factors require a
limitation on the number of shares to be underwritten, then the
Initiating Holders shall so advise all Holders of Registrable
Securities that otherwise would be underwritten pursuant hereto,
and the number of Registrable Securities that may be included in
the underwriting shall be allocated among such Holders of
Registrable Securities, including the Initiating Holders, in
proportion (as nearly as practicable) to the number of Registrable
Securities owned by each Holder or in such other proportion as
shall mutually be agreed to by all such selling Holders;
provided, however , that the number of Registrable
Securities held by the Holders to be included in such underwriting
shall not be reduced unless all other securities are first entirely
excluded from the underwriting.  To facilitate the allocation
of shares in accordance with the above provisions, the Company or
the underwriters may round the number of shares allocated to any
Holder to the nearest 100 shares.
 

(b)                                 
In connection with any offering
involving an underwriting of shares pursuant to
Section 2.2 , the Company shall not be required to
include any of the Holders’ Registrable Securities in such
underwriting unless the Holders accept the terms of the
underwriting as agreed upon between the Company and its
underwriters, and then only in such quantity as the underwriters in
their sole discretion determine will not jeopardize the success of
the offering by the Company.  If the total number of
securities, including Registrable Securities, requested by
stockholders to be included in such offering exceeds the number of
securities to be sold (other than by the Company) that the
underwriters in their reasonable discretion determine is compatible
with the success of the offering, then the Company shall be
required to include in the offering only that number of such
securities, including Registrable Securities, which the
underwriters and the Company in their sole discretion determine
will not jeopardize the success of the offering.  If the
underwriters determine that less than all of the Registrable
Securities requested to be registered can be included in such
offering, then the Registrable Securities that are included in such
offering shall be allocated among the selling Holders in proportion
(as nearly as practicable to) the number of Registrable Securities
owned by each selling Holder or in such other proportions as shall
mutually be agreed to by all such selling Holders.  To
facilitate the allocation of shares in accordance with the above
provisions, the Company or the underwriters may round the number of
Units allocated to any Holder to the nearest 100 shares. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the number of
Registrable Securities included in the offering be reduced unless
all other securities (other than securities to be sold by the
Company) are first entirely excluded from the offering.  For
purposes of the provision in this Section 2.3(b)
 concerning apportionment, for any selling Holder that is a
partnership, limited liability company, or corporation, the
partners, members, retired partners, retired members, stockholders,
and Affiliates of such Holder, or the estates and Immediate Family
Members of any such partners, retired partners, members, and
retired members and any trusts for the benefit of any of the
foregoing Persons, shall be deemed to be a single “selling
Holder,” and any pro rata reduction with respect to such
“selling Holder” shall be based upon the aggregate
number of Registrable Securities owned by all Persons included in
such “selling Holder,” as defined in this
sentence.
 
7 





 

(c)                                  
For purposes of Section 2.1, a
registration shall not be counted as “effected” if, as
a result of an exercise of the underwriter’s cutback
provisions in Section 2.3(a), fewer than fifty percent (50%)
of the total number of Registrable Securities that Holders have
requested to be included in such registration statement are
actually included.

 

2.4                               
Obligations of the
Company . Whenever
required under this Section 2 to effect the registration of
any Registrable Securities, the Company shall, as expeditiously as
reasonably possible:

 

(a)                                 
prepare and file with the SEC a
registration statement with respect to such Registrable Securities
and use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such
registration statement to become effective and, upon the request of
the Holders of at least a majority of the Registrable Securities
registered thereunder, keep such registration statement effective
for a period of up to one hundred twenty (120) days or, if
earlier, until the distribution contemplated in the registration
statement has been completed; provided, however , that
(i) such one hundred twenty (120) day period shall be
extended for a period of time equal to the period the Holder
refrains, at the request of an underwriter of Common Stock (or
other securities) of the Company, from selling any securities
included in such registration, and (ii) in the case of any
registration of Registrable Securities on Form S-3 that are
intended to be offered on a continuous or delayed basis, subject to
compliance with applicable SEC rules, such one hundred twenty
(120) day period shall be extended for up to one hundred
eighty (180) days, if necessary, to keep the registration statement
effective until all such Registrable Securities are
sold;

 

(b)                                 
prepare and file with the SEC such
amendments and supplements to such registration statement, and the
prospectus used in connection with such registration statement, as
may be necessary to comply with the Securities Act in order to
enable the disposition of all securities covered by such
registration statement;

 

(c)                                  
furnish to the selling Holders such
numbers of copies of a prospectus, including a preliminary
prospectus, as required by the Securities Act, and such other
documents as the Holders may reasonably request in order to
facilitate their disposition of their Registrable
Securities;

 

(d)                                 
use its commercially reasonable
efforts to register and qualify the securities covered by such
registration statement under such other securities or blue-sky laws
of such jurisdictions as shall be reasonably requested by the
selling Holders; provided that the Company shall not be
required to qualify to do business or to file a general consent to
service of process in any such states or jurisdictions, unless the
Company is already subject to service in such jurisdiction and
except as may be required by the Securities Act;

 

(e)                                  
in the event of any underwritten
public offering, enter into and perform its obligations under an
underwriting agreement, in usual and customary form, with the
underwriter(s) of such offering;

 

(f)                                   
use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause all such Registrable Securities covered by such
registration statement to be listed on a national
securities
 
8 





 
exchange or trading system and each securities
exchange and trading system (if any) on which similar securities
issued by the Company are then listed;
 

(g)                                  
provide a transfer agent and
registrar for all Registrable Securities registered pursuant to
this Agreement and provide a CUSIP number for all such Registrable
Securities, in each case not later than the effective date of such
registration;

 

(h)                                 
promptly make available for
inspection by the selling Holders, any managing underwriter
participating in any disposition pursuant to such registration
statement, and any attorney or accountant or other agent retained
by any such underwriter or selected by the selling Holders, all
financial and other records, pertinent corporate documents, and
properties of the Company, and cause the Company’s officers,
managers, directors, employees, and independent accountants to
supply all information reasonably requested by any such seller,
underwriter, attorney, accountant, or agent, in each case, as
necessary or advisable to verify the accuracy of the information in
such registration statement and to conduct appropriate due
diligence in connection therewith;

 

(i)                                     
notify each selling Holder, promptly
after the Company receives notice thereof, of the time when such
registration statement has been declared effective or a supplement
to any prospectus forming a part of such registration statement has
been filed; and

 

(j)                                    
after such registration statement
becomes effective, notify each selling Holder of any request by the
SEC that the Company amend or supplement such registration
statement or prospectus.

 

In addition, the Company shall
ensure that, at all times after any registration statement covering
a public offering of securities of the Company under the Securities
Act shall have become effective, its insider trading policy shall
provide that the Company’s directors may implement a trading
program under Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act.

 

2.5                               
Furnish Information
.  It shall be a condition
precedent to the obligations of the Company to take any action
pursuant to this Section 2 with respect to the
Registrable Securities of any selling Holder that such Holder shall
furnish to the Company such information regarding itself, the
Registrable Securities held by it, and the intended method of
disposition of such securities as is reasonably required to effect
the registration of such Holder’s Registrable
Securities.

 

2.6                               
Expenses of
Registration .  All
expenses (other than Selling Expenses) incurred in connection with
registrations, filings, or qualifications pursuant to
Section 2 , including all registration, filing, and
qualification fees; printers’ and accounting fees; fees and
disbursements of counsel for the Company; and the reasonable fees
and disbursements, not to exceed $30,000, of one counsel for the
selling Holders (“ Selling Holder Counsel ”)
selected by the Holders of at least a majority of the Registrable
Securities, shall be borne and paid by the Company; provided,
however , that the Company shall not be required to pay for any
expenses of any registration proceeding begun pursuant to
Section 2.1 if the registration request is subsequently
withdrawn at the request of the Holders of at least a majority of
the Registrable Securities to be registered (in which case all
selling Holders shall bear such expenses pro rata
 
9 





 
based upon the number of Registrable Securities
that were to be included in the withdrawn registration), unless the
Holders of at least a majority of the Registrable Securities agree
to forfeit their right to one registration pursuant to
Section 2.1(a)  or Section 2.1(b), as
the case may be; provided further that if, at the time of
such withdrawal, the Holders have learned of a material adverse
change in the condition, business, or prospects of the Company from
that known to the Holders at the time of their request and have
withdrawn the request with reasonable promptness after learning of
such information, then the Holders shall not be required to pay any
of such expenses and shall not forfeit their right to one
registration pursuant to Section 2.1(a)  or
Section 2.1(b) .  All Selling Expenses relating to
Registrable Securities registered pursuant to this
Section 2 shall be borne and paid by the Holders pro
rata on the basis of the number of Registrable Securities
registered on their behalf.
 

2.7                               
Delay of Registration
.  No Holder shall have any
right to obtain or seek an injunction restraining or otherwise
delaying any registration pursuant to this Agreement as the result
of any controversy that might arise with respect to the
interpretation or implementation of this Section 2
.

 

2.8                               
Indemnification
.  If any Registrable
Securities are included in a registration statement under this
Section 2 :

 

(a)                                 
To the extent permitted by law, the
Company will indemnify and hold harmless each selling Holder, and
the partners, members, officers, directors, and stockholders of
each such Holder; legal counsel, investment advisers and
accountants for each such Holder; any underwriter (as defined in
the Securities Act) for each such Holder; and each Person, if any,
who controls such Holder or underwriter within the meaning of the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act, against any Damages, and the
Company will pay to each such Holder, underwriter, controlling
Person, or other aforementioned Person any legal or other expenses
reasonably incurred thereby in connection with investigating or
defending any claim or proceeding from which Damages may result, as
such expenses are incurred; provided, however , that the
indemnity agreement contained in this Section 2.8(a)
 shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such
claim or proceeding if such settlement is effected without the
consent of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, nor shall the Company be liable for any Damages to the
extent that they arise out of or are based upon actions or
omissions made in reliance upon and in conformity with written
information furnished by or on behalf of any such Holder,
underwriter, controlling Person, or other aforementioned Person
expressly for use in connection with such registration.

 

(b)                                 
To the extent permitted by law, each
selling Holder, severally and not jointly, will indemnify and hold
harmless the Company, and each of its managers or directors, as
applicable, each of its officers who has signed the registration
statement, each Person (if any), who controls the Company within
the meaning of the Securities Act, legal counsel and accountants
for the Company, any underwriter (as defined in the Securities
Act), any other Holder selling securities in such registration
statement, and any controlling Person of any such underwriter or
other Holder, against any Damages, in each case only to the extent
that such Damages arise out of or are based upon actions or
omissions made in reliance upon and in conformity with written
information furnished by or on behalf of such selling Holder
expressly for use in connection with such registration; and each
such selling Holder will pay to the
 
10 





 
Company and each other aforementioned Person any
legal or other expenses reasonably incurred thereby in connection
with investigating or defending any claim or proceeding from which
Damages may result, as such expenses are incurred; provided,
however , that the indemnity agreement contained in this
Section 2.8(b)  shall not apply to amounts paid in
settlement of any such claim or proceeding if such settlement is
effected without the consent of the Holder, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld; and provided further that in no
event shall the aggregate amounts payable by a Holder by way of
indemnity or contribution under this Section 2.8(b)
 exceed the proceeds from the offering received by such Holder
(net of any Selling Expenses paid by such Holder), except in the
case of fraud or willful misconduct by such Holder.
 

(c)                                  
Promptly after receipt by an
indemnified party under this Section 2.8 of notice of
the commencement of any action (including any governmental action)
for which a party may be entitled to indemnification hereunder,
such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be
made against any indemnifying party under this
Section 2.8 , give the indemnifying party notice of the
commencement thereof.  The indemnifying party shall have the
right to participate in such action and, to the extent the
indemnifying party so desires, participate jointly with any other
indemnifying party to which notice has been given, and to assume
the defense thereof with counsel mutually satisfactory to the
parties; provided, however , that an indemnified party
(together with all other indemnified parties that may be
represented without conflict by one counsel) shall have the right
to retain one separate counsel, with the fees and expenses to be
paid by the indemnifying party, if representation of such
indemnified party by the counsel retained by the indemnifying party
would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing
interests between such indemnified party and any other party
represented by such counsel in such action.  The failure to
give notice to the indemnifying party within a reasonable time of
the commencement of any such action shall relieve such indemnifying
party of any liability to the indemnified party under this
Section 2.8 , to the extent that such failure
materially prejudices the indemnifying party’s ability to
defend such action.  The failure to give notice to the
indemnifying party will not relieve it of any liability that it may
have to any indemnified party otherwise than under this
Section 2.8 .

 

(d)                                 
To provide for just and equitable
contribution to joint liability under the Securities Act in any
case in which either (i) any party otherwise entitled to
indemnification hereunder makes a claim for indemnification
pursuant to this Section 2.8 but it is judicially
determined (by the entry of a final judgment or decree by a court
of competent jurisdiction and the expiration of time to appeal or
the denial of the last right of appeal) that such indemnification
may not be enforced in such case, notwithstanding the fact that
this Section 2.8 provides for indemnification in such
case, or (ii) contribution under the Securities Act may be
required on the part of any party hereto for which indemnification
is provided under this Section 2.8 , then, and in each
such case, such parties will contribute to the aggregate losses,
claims, damages, liabilities, or expenses to which they may be
subject (after contribution from others) in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect the relative fault of each of the
indemnifying party and the indemnified party in connection with the
statements, omissions, or other actions that resulted in such loss,
claim, damage, liability, or expense, as well as to reflect any
other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative fault
of the indemnifying party and of the indemnified party shall be
determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue
or allegedly untrue statement of a material fact, or the omission
or alleged omission of a material fact, relates to information
supplied by the indemnifying party or by the indemnified
 
11 





 
party and the parties’ relative intent,
knowledge, access to information, and opportunity to correct or
prevent such statement or omission; provided, however ,
that, in any such case, (x) no Holder will be required to
contribute any amount in excess of the public offering price of all
such Registrable Securities offered and sold by such Holder
pursuant to such registration statement, and (y) no Person
guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of
Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) will be entitled to
contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation; and provided further that in no event
shall a Holder’s liability pursuant to this
Section 2.8(e) , when combined with the amounts paid or
payable by such Holder pursuant to Section 2.8(b) ,
exceed the proceeds from the offering received by such Holder (net
of any Selling Expenses paid by such Holder), except in the case of
willful misconduct or fraud by such Holder.
 

(e)                                  
Notwithstanding the foregoing, to
the extent that the provisions on indemnification and contribution
contained in the underwriting agreement entered into in connection
with the underwritten public offering are in conflict with the
foregoing provisions, the provisions in the underwriting agreement
shall control.  The Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to include provisions in the underwriting agreement that
are consistent with the foregoing provisions.

 

(f)                                   
Unless otherwise superseded by an
underwriting agreement entered into in connection with the
underwritten public offering, the obligations of the Company and
Holders under this Section 2.8 shall survive the
completion of any offering of Registrable Securities in a
registration under this Section 2 , and otherwise shall
survive the termination of this Agreement.

 

2.9                               
Reports Under Exchange
Act .  With a view
to making available to the Holders the benefits of SEC
Rule 144 and any other rule or regulation of the SEC that
may at any time permit a Holder to sell securities of the Company
to the public without registration or pursuant to a registration on
Form S-3, the Company shall:

 

(a)                                 
make and keep available adequate
current public information, as those terms are understood and
defined in SEC Rule 144, at all times after the effective date
of the registration statement filed by the Company for the
IPO;

 

(b)                                 
use commercially reasonable efforts
to file with the SEC in a timely manner all reports and other
documents required of the Company under the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act (at any time after the Company has become subject to
such reporting requirements); and

 

(c)                                  
furnish to any Holder, so long as
the Holder owns any Registrable Securities, forthwith upon request
(i) to the extent accurate, a written statement by the Company
that it has complied with the reporting requirements of SEC
Rule 144 (at any time after ninety (90) days after the
effective date of the registration statement filed by the Company
for the IPO), the Securities Act, and the Exchange Act (at any time
after the Company has become subject to such reporting
requirements), or that it qualifies as a registrant whose
securities may be resold pursuant to Form S-3 (at any time
after the Company so qualifies); (ii) a copy of the most
recent annual or quarterly report of the Company and such other
reports and documents so filed by the
 
12 





 
Company; and (iii) such other information
as may be reasonably requested in availing any Holder of any
rule or regulation of the SEC that permits the selling of any
such securities without registration (at any time after the Company
has become subject to the reporting requirements under the Exchange
Act) or pursuant to Form S-3 (at any time after the Company so
qualifies to use such form).
 

2.10                        
Limitations on Subsequent
Registration Rights .  From and after the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent
of the Holders of at least a majority of the Registrable Securities
then outstanding, enter into any agreement with any holder or
prospective holder of any securities of the Company that would
allow such holder or prospective holder (i) to include such
securities in any registration unless, under the terms of such
agreement, such holder or prospective holder may include such
securities in any such registration only to the extent that the
inclusion of such securities will not reduce the number of the
Registrable Securities of the Holders that are included or
(ii) to demand registration of any securities held by such
holder or prospective holder; provided that this limitation
shall not apply to any additional Investor who becomes a party to
this Agreement in accordance with Section 6.9
.

 

2.11                        
“Market Stand-off’
Agreement .  Each
Holder hereby agrees that it will not, without the prior written
consent of the managing underwriter, during the period commencing
on the date of the final prospectus relating to the registration by
the Company of the IPO, and ending on the date specified by the
Company and the managing underwriter (such period not to exceed one
hundred eighty (180) days, or such other period not to exceed
an additional fifteen days, but only as may be required by
applicable regulatory restrictions on (1) the publication or
other distribution of research reports, and (2) analyst
recommendations and opinions, including, but not limited to, the
restrictions contained in FINRA Rule 2711(f)(4) or NYSE
Rule 472(f)(4), or any successor provisions or amendments
thereto), (i) lend; offer; pledge; sell; contract to sell;
sell any option or contract to purchase; purchase any option or
contract to sell; grant any option, right, or warrant to purchase;
or otherwise transfer or dispose of, directly or indirectly, any
Common Stock, Incentive Units or any securities convertible
into or exercisable or exchangeable (directly or indirectly) for
Common Stock held immediately before the effective date of the
registration statement for such offering or (ii) enter into
any swap or other arrangement that transfers to another, in whole
or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of such
securities, whether any such transaction described in
clause (i) or (ii) above is to be settled by
delivery of Common Stock or other securities, in cash, or
otherwise.  The foregoing provisions of this
Section 2.11 shall apply only to the IPO, shall not
apply to the sale of any securities to an underwriter pursuant to
an underwriting agreement or to transactions involving broad-based
indices or baskets of securities (in each
