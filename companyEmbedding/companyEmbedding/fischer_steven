 One source of new-product ideas is competitors. Steven Fischer recently joined Frankie and Alex Specialty Products as a brand manager. His new boss told him, “We don’t have a budget for new-product development. We just monitor our competitors’ new-product introductions and offer knockoffs of any that look like they will be successful.” Does the AMA Statement of Ethics address this issue? Go to www. marketingpower.com and review the statement. Then, write a brief paragraph on what the AMA Statement of Ethics contains that relates to knockoff products.
