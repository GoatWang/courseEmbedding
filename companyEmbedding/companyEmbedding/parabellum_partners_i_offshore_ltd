Commonly referred to as admiralty law, maritime law is the body of laws
	 that govern activities in navigable waters and the open sea. Not only
	 does maritime law govern commercial activities, but it also affords legal
	 protection to maritime workers by protecting their right to compensation
	 in the event of an injury.

	Maritime law is used to protect the legal rights
	 of seaman injured while on the job.

If you or someone you love has been hurt while working offshore, you should
	 not hesitate to get the help you need from attorneys who you can trust.
	 Contact Arnold & Itkin LLP for the help that you deserve.

							Jones Act 
							Learn More





The Jones Act is a federal statute that provides legal protection to the
	 seamen who work offshore. Under this piece of legislation, also known
	 as the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, injured seamen have the right to take
	 legal action against the ship owner, manager, or fellow crewmember in
	 the event of an accident.

	Under the Jones Act, you may have the right
	 to pursue a claim for financial compensation.

For example, injured crew members may be able to file a claim for maintenance
	 and cure benefits, damages due to negligence, or even file a claim for
	 the unseaworthiness of a vessel.

							Maritime Piracy 
							Learn More





When most people think of "pirates," they think of a drunken
	 man with a peg leg. Modern day pirates, however, are highly dangerous
	 and may cause serious injury or death to crew members on vessels operating
	 in foreign waters. Our firm represents injured seamen in claims related
	 to pirate attacks and hijackings.
In 2013, more than 250 attacks occurred.
If you or someone you love has been affected by maritime piracy, you should
	 immediately get in touch with our firm. We understand what risks you face
	 in the maritime industry and can help you recover from them.

							Types of Injuries

What are common injuries sustained offshore?
Employed in one of the most dangerous industries, maritime workers can
	 sustain catastrophic and even life-threatening injuries while on the job.
	 This may include everything from a traumatic brain injury (TBI) to damage
	 to their spine, severe burn injuries, electric shock, or even Post-Traumatic
	 Stress Disorder (PTSD).
Because offshore work is so physically demanding and because they are exposed
	 to harsh weather, it is common for workers to become fatigued while on
	 the job. This can lead to life-altering and even fatal injuries. If you
	 or a loved one has been injured, do not hesitate to get the professional
	 legal help of our firm.

							Harbor Workers 
							Learn More





Harbor workers are employed in the construction, conversion, overhaul,
	 repair, alteration, dry docking, or outfitting of a ship. These individuals
	 may be known as a ship repairer, shipbuilder, or shipbreaker.
Injured harbor workers can recover compensation under the LHWCA.
Harbor workers can receive both job-injury and occupational-disease protection
	 under the Longshore and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Act (LHWCA)
	 if they were employed on navigable waters or adjoining shore installations
	 such as wharves, terminals, and dry docks. If you or someone you love
	 was injured in the capacity of this job, do not hesitate to contact our
	 firm and request a free, confidential case consultation.

							Oil Spill Claims 
							Learn More





Were you negatively affected by an oil spill?
When oil spills from an offshore rig, more than the workers aboard the
	 ship are affected. This is a serious incident that can negatively impact
	 local businesses, residents, and entire communities. Coastal cities that
	 rely on tourism revenue may suffer serious economic setbacks when traveling
	 families go elsewhere.
If you were impacted as a homeowner, business owner, or even a worker,
	 you should get in touch with our oil spill attorneys as soon as possible.
	 We can help you to pursue a claim for financial compensation that can
	 cover everything from medical bills to property damage to the economic
	 impact of a business closure.

							Wrongful Death 
							Learn More





Have you lost someone that you love?
Offshore work is important work, but it is dangerous work. From the physical
	 exertion to hazardous weather conditions, it is unfortunately all too
	 common for offshore workers to become involved in traumatic accidents
	 while on the job. These can leave them with life-threatening and even
	 fatal injuries.
If someone you love was killed during maritime work, we encourage you to
	 reach out to our legal team. We can help represent the best interests
	 of you and your family during the course of your claim. With our assistance,
	 you can recover compensation for everything from funeral costs to loss
	 of companionship.

Protecting the Victims of Maritime Injuries
Often referred to as admiralty law, maritime law is a body of U.S. laws
		 and regulations that govern offshore activities in navigable waters or
		 in the open sea. Activities that are traditionally governed by maritime
		 law include carriage of goods, marine salvaging, injuries to passengers
		 / workers, and more. Perhaps one of the most important accepts of maritime
		 injury law is the rights that it affords to offshore workers who have
		 suffered injury or illness during the course of their work—including
		 the right to recover just financial compensation. Our law firm can help
		 you in the recovery of that compensation.

The Basics Of Maritime Injury Law





The Jones Act
The Jones Act, also known as the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, provides certain legal rights to seaman that protect their health and livelihood. Under the Jones Act, a seaman who has been injured would have the ability to pursue a case against the ship owner, captain, or other members of their crew. The law, however, is strict on who qualifies as a Jones Act seaman and who is eligible to recover compensation. It is therefore crucial that you talk to lawyers about your case.





Longshore & Harbor Workers' Compensation Act
Commonly referred to as the Longshore Act or LHWCA, the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act is a statutory workers' compensation scheme enacted in 1927 to provide protection to maritime workers who are not protected by the Jones Act. Currently, the LHWCA provides benefits to more than 500,000 workers for work-related injuries and occupational diseases. This act also provides benefits to the widow, widower, or eligible survivors if an injury or illness leads to a death.





Death on the High Seas Act
In 1920, the Death on the High Seas Act (DOHSA) was enacted by Congress to protect the families of seaman injured while working offshore. Under this law, spouses, children, and other dependents are given the ability to pursue legal action if the loss of their loved one could be linked to the negligence of another. For example, family could pursue a claim if the accident was caused by the unseaworthiness of a vessel or careless actions of an employer or crewmember.





General Maritime Law
Maritime law is often categorized into two types. The first is the compilation of federal statutes passed over the years (such as the Jones Act); the second is vaguer and consists of "common law," which has developed naturally by major court decisions. One major component of general maritime law is the doctrine of "maintenance and cure," which is what provides living expenses, lost wages, and medical care to seamen if they become injured or ill while working offshore.











Involving a Maritime Accident Attorney from Arnold & Itkin

	Maritime law is a highly-complex area of the law—and not every statute
	 will apply to every case. For this reason, it is crucial that no time
	 is wasted in contacting a maritime injury lawyer who will be able to provide
	 you access to a wealth of knowledge. If you or someone you love has been
	 hurt, we encourage you to contact our team today. We proudly serve clients
	 throughout the Gulf, including
	Texas,
	Louisiana,
	Mississippi, and
	Alabama.

Arnold & Itkin is proud to offer a confidential and free consultation.

				With Arnold & Itkin

					 you work with an attorney who has an in-depth understanding of how it
					 works and who has proven themselves in similar cases before.
