It helps us to improve our services, content and marketing. We also use the personal information we collect from your visits to our website to develop, deliver, and improve our products, services, content, marketing, and website. 
If you do not want your information tracked, please disable cookies when visiting our website. 
Disclosure to third parties 
We do not disclose personal information collected from your visits to our website to third parties, other than to service providers in accordance with our privacy notice issued to you pursuant to Regulation S-P, 17 CFR Part 248, et seq. 
Third party sites and services 
Our website may contain links to third-party websites, products, and services. Information collected by third parties, which may include such things as personal information, is governed by the third parties privacy practices. You should review the privacy practices of any third party whose website you visit via a link on our website to understand their policies and privacy practices. Personal information we collect based on your visit to our website is not disclosed to any third party sites you link to from our website. 
Changes to our privacy policy 
From time to time we may update or revise our web privacy policy. To the extent we make any material changes to our policy, we will notify you the next time you visit our site. 
Official privacy practices notice
We are committed to protecting the privacy of our potential, current, and former customers. To provide the products and services you request, we must collect personal information about you. We do not sell your personal information to third parties. We collect your personal information and share it with third parties as necessary to provide you with the products or services you request and to administer your business with us. This notice describes our current privacy practices. While your relationship with us continues, we will update and send our privacy practices notice as required by law. Even after that relationship ends, we will continue to protect your personal information. You do not need to take any action because of this notice.

Information we may collect and use
We collect personal information about you to help us identify you as our potential, current, or former customer; to process your requests and transactions; to offer investment services to you; or to tell you about our products or services we believe you may want to use. The type of personal information we collect depends on the products or services you request and may include the following:


Information from you: When you submit your application or other forms or request information on our products (online or otherwise), you give us information such as your name, address, Social Security number, and your financial history.
Information about your transactions: We keep information about your transactions with us, such as the products you buy from us; the amount you paid for those products; your investment activity; and your account balances. 
Information from your employer: In connection with administering your retirement plan, we may obtain information about you from your employer.
Information received from third parties: In order to verify your identity or to prevent fraud, we may obtain information about you from third parties.

How we use your personal information
We do not disclose nonpublic personal information about our potential, current, and former customers unless allowed or required by law. We may share your personal information within our companies and with certain service providers. They use this information to process transactions you have requested; provide customer service; and inform you of products or services we offer that you may find useful. Our service providers may or may not be affiliated with us. They include financial service providers (for example, third-party administrators; broker/dealers; and other financial services companies with whom we have joint marketing agreements). Our service providers also include nonfinancial companies and individuals (for example, consultants; information services vendors; and companies that perform mailing or marketing services on our behalf). Information obtained from a report prepared by a service provider may be kept by the service provider and shared with other persons; however, we require our service providers to protect your personal information and to use or disclose it only for the work they are performing for us, or as permitted by law.

We also may provide information to regulatory authorities, law enforcement officials, and others to prevent fraud or when we believe in good faith that the law requires disclosure. In the event of a sale of all or part of our businesses, we may share customer information as part of the sale. We do not sell or share your information with outside marketers who may want to offer you their own products and services. 
Security of information
Keeping your information safe is one of our most important responsibilities. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect your information. Our employees are authorized to access your information only when they need it to provide you with products and services or to maintain your accounts. Employees who have access to your personal information are required to keep it strictly confidential. We provide training to our employees about the importance of protecting the privacy of your information.

Dear Shareholder:                                                               

In January, Lincoln National Corporation (NYSE: LNC) announced that it had      
entered into an agreement to acquire the business of Voyageur Fund Managers,    
Inc.("Voyageur Fund Managers"). If the agreement is consummated, Lincoln        
National Corporation will control Voyageur Fund Managers. LNC also controls     
Delaware Management Company, Inc., which with its affiliates acts as investment 
advisor to the Delaware Group of Funds.                                         

Because this acquisition affects the Funds' investment manager, shareholders of 
most Funds are being asked to approve a new investment management agreement.    
Shareholders of a few Funds (Voyageur National Tax Free, Voyageur National      
Insured Tax Free, Voyageur National Limited Term Tax Free, and Voyageur         
International Equity Funds) are being asked to approve liquidation of their     
Funds. If you are a shareholder of one of these Funds, you will have the        
opportunity to invest your liquidation proceeds at net asset value into any of  
the open-end Delaware Funds. Shareholders of the Voyageur Growth and Income Fund
are being asked to approve the reorganization of their Fund. The Voyageur Growth
and Income Fund is not a part of the LNC acquisition and the reorganization is  
required to separate that Fund (which is a series of a corporation containing a 
number of Funds) from Funds that are part of the acquisition. Segall Bryant and 
Hamill is expected to continue as sub-advisor to the Growth and Income Fund.    

With the enclosed proxy statement, we have included a question and answer       
section, intended to address some of the more commonly asked questions about the
proposed acquisition and the future management of your Voyageur Funds. If you   
have additional questions, we encourage you to contact Shareholder              
Communications Corporation, a professional proxy solicitation firm retained by  
Voyageur Fund Managers, Inc. and Lincoln National Corporation to assist in      
answering shareholders questions about the proxy vote. You may call Shareholder 
Communications Corporation at 800.733.8481 extension 438 on Monday through      
Friday from 9 a.m. to 11 p.m. (Eastern Standard Time).                          

We believe shareholders in the Voyageur Funds will benefit from this            
transaction. When Voyageur's mutual funds are added to Delaware's existing line 
of mutual funds (16 open end funds consisting of 48 separate portfolios and two 
closed end funds), Voyageur Fund shareholders will have access to a wider       
variety of investment options. Delaware Management Company has a conservative,  
long-term investment philosophy that is consistent with and similar to that of  
Voyageur Fund Managers. Your Fund Board has unanimously approved the proposals  
and recommends that shareholders vote in favor of all of the items on the       
enclosed proxy card(s).                                                         

Your vote is important. Please review the proxy statement then take a moment to 
complete, sign and mail your proxy card(s). A postage-paid envelope is enclosed 
for your convenience. If the date of the meeting approaches and we have not     
received your vote, you may receive a telephone call from a representative of   
Shareholder Communications Corporation reminding you to vote your shares.       

We appreciate your prompt attention to this very important matter.              

Sincerely,                                                                      

John G. Taft                                                                    
President                                                                       

Q&A ABOUT THE VOYAGEUR FUND MANAGERS ACQUISITION                                
ON JANUARY 15, LINCOLN NATIONAL CORPORATION, ANNOUNCED IT WOULD ACQUIRE VOYAGEUR
FUND MANAGERS. IN RESPONSE TO THIS ACQUISITION, WE CREATED THIS QUESTION AND    
ANSWER SECTION TO ADDRESS ANY CONCERNS YOU MAY HAVE. IF YOU REQUIRE ADDITIONAL  
INFORMATION ABOUT THE PROXY OR TRANSACTION, PLEASE CONTACT SHAREHOLDER          
COMMUNICATIONS AT 800.733.8481 EXTENSION 438. A REPRESENTATIVE WILL BE AVAILABLE
TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS FROM MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY FROM 9 A.M. TO 11 P.M.      
(EASTERN STANDARD TIME).                                                        

Q.  How will the acquisition of Voyageur Fund Managers impact my investments?   
A.  We believe this acquisition will be very positive for our fund shareholders.
 Delaware Management Company -- an indirect subsidiary of Lincoln National
 Corporation -- currently offers a broad variety of retail open-end mutual
    funds and two closed-end funds with assets under management of approximately
   $10.3 billion. Shareholders should benefit from this extended product line,
    which will allow choices (through exchanges at net asset value) from a wider
variety of mutual funds. Also by combining the assets of these two fund 
   families, it is anticipated that certain efficiencies may be gained through
the coordination of administrative, marketing and trading functions.    

Q.  Will the investment advisory fees stay the same?                            
A.  Yes, under the terms of the proposed investment advisory agreements, the    
   investment management fees paid by your Fund will remain the same. However,
certain expense limitation provisions contained in your current advisory
agreements have not been included in the proposed agreements. Delaware  
   Management Company has nevertheless agreed to comply with these limitations
for two years.                                                          

Q.  Will the management of my Voyageur Fund investments change dramatically?    
A.  No. For most Voyageur Funds, the portfolio managers will remain the same. A 
 number of Voyageur employees have entered into employment agreements with
Lincoln National Corporation. This includes two of Voyageur's senior    
 portfolio managers, Elizabeth H. Howell and Andrew M. McCullagh, who will
 continue to manage the majority of the Voyageur tax free funds from their
  offices in Minneapolis and Denver. For certain funds, experienced Delaware
personnel will provide investment advice in a manner that is generally  
 consistent with prior management. Delaware Management has a conservative,
long-term investment philosophy consistent with that of Voyageur.       

Some of the changes to the management of Voyageur's Funds are summarized as     
follows:                                                                        

   *    It is proposed that Voyageur National Tax Free, National Insured Tax
          Free, National Limited Term Tax Free and Voyageur International Equity
       Funds be liquidated. If the liquidations are approved, shareholders
     will have the opportunity to move their assets at net asset value
         (NAV) into any of the Delaware funds, including funds with comparable
 investment objectives, for a period of one year following the
liquidation.                                                

*    It is proposed that Growth and Income Fund approve a plan of     
          reorganization which would in essence cause it to become a series of a
different corporate entity. Growth and Income Fund is not   
        participating in the acquisition, and the reorganization is required
    to separate Growth and Income Fund from the other Funds that are
series of the same corporation and are participating in the 
        acquisition. The reorganization will not result in any other changes
          to Growth and Income Fund shareholders; management of the Fund through
Segall Bryant and Hamill will remain essentially unchanged. 

   *    Voyageur Florida Tax Free, Florida Insured Tax Free, Florida Limited
      Term Tax Free, National High Yield Municipal Bond and New York Tax
        Free Funds will be co-managed by Delaware Vice Presidents and Senior
   Portfolio Managers, Mitchell L. Conery and Patrick P. Coyne and
   Voyageur Vice President and Senior Portfolio Manager, Andrew M.
    McCullagh, will assist with the management of the Florida Funds.

*    Senior Voyageur Portfolio Manager Elizabeth H. Howell will assume
      portfolio management responsibility for the Voyageur Wisconsin Tax
Free and Voyageur Iowa Tax Free Funds.                      

  *    For the Voyageur Growth Stock Fund, Delaware Management will retain
        the services of James C. King, the Fund's current portfolio manager,
through a sub-advisory arrangement.                         

    *    Aggressive Growth Fund will be co-managed by Delaware Vice Presidents
        and Senior Portfolio Managers, Edward N. Antoian and Gerald S. Frey.

Q.  Why is a shareholder vote necessary?                                        
A.  The Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, generally requires that     
    shareholders approve a new investment advisory agreement whenever there is a
    change in control of the investment adviser. The proposed acquisition of the
 holding company of Voyageur Fund Managers by Lincoln National Corporation
    will result in a change in control of Voyageur Fund Managers and, therefore,
   requires a shareholder vote on a new investment advisory agreement for each
Fund (other than those being asked to liquidate or reorganize).         

Q.  Is the Fund board changing?                                                 
A.  The current Voyageur Fund board of directors has nominated a slate of       
  directors which includes one current Voyageur Fund board member, Thomas F.
    Madison, the six members of the current board of the Delaware Group of Funds
and one additional individual from Lincoln National Corporation. The    
Delaware Fund, board currently contains five independent directors.     

Q.  Who will pay for the cost associated with the acquisition, the shareholder  
meeting and this proxy solicitation?                                    
A.  Lincoln National Corporation -- not the Funds -- will bear the costs        
associated with consideration of the proposals being presented to       
   shareholders, including the costs of the joint meetings of shareholders and
the proxy solicitation.                                                 

Q.  How do the Fund Board members suggest I vote?                               
A.  After careful consideration, the board members of the Voyageur Funds        
unanimously recommend that you vote "FOR" all the items on the enclosed 
proxy card.                                                             

Q.  Who should I contact about this proxy vote?                                 
A.  Shareholder Communications Corporation at 800.733.8481 extension 438. They  
are a professional proxy solicitation firm retained by Voyageur Fund    
Managers and Delaware Management Holdings to assist in answering        
shareholders questions about the proxy vote and soliciting shareholder  
votes.                                                                  

Q.  Who will answer questions about my Voyageur Fund investments?               
A.  During this transition period, it will be business as usual; shareholders   
  should call Voyageur Client Services at 800.545.3863 to obtain information
about their Voyageur Fund investments.                                  

Q.  Are all of the Voyageur Funds covered by the enclosed proxy statement?      
A.  No. All of the Voyageur Funds are affected by the proposed acquisition.     
  However, because different Funds are affected differently, there are three
    separate proxy statements. As a result, depending on which Voyageur Fund you
own, you may receive more than one proxy statement.

         Equity Fund, National Insured Tax Free Fund, National
          Limited Term Tax Free Fund, National Tax Free Fund and

          Growth and Income Fund ("New Growth and Income Fund"),
     and whereby shareholders of the Fund would become
          shareholders of New Growth and Income Fund.  A vote in
           favor of the Plan will be considered a vote in favor of
             an amendment to the articles of incorporation of Voyageur
 Mutual Funds III required to effect the Plan.

 SPECIAL JOINT MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS--APRIL 11, 1997

       The enclosed proxy is solicited by the Board of Directors or Trustees
(hereafter referred to as "Board of Directors") of each open-end investment     
company listed above (individually a "Company" and collectively the "Companies")
in connection with a special joint meeting of shareholders of each Company to be
held on April 11, 1997, and any adjournments thereof (the "Meeting"). The series
of the Companies (individually a "Fund" and collectively the "Funds") are set   
forth in the table below. The costs of solicitation, including the cost of      
preparing and mailing the Notice of Meeting of Shareholders and this Proxy      
Statement, will be borne by Lincoln National Corporation ("LNC") and will not be
an expense of the Funds, and the mailing will take place on approximately       
February 24, 1997. Representatives of Voyageur Fund Managers, Inc. ("VFM"), the 
current investment adviser of each Fund, may, without cost to the Funds, solicit
proxies on behalf of management of the Funds by means of mail, telephone or     
personal calls. The address of VFM is that of the Companies as listed above. VFM
has engaged Shareholder Communications Corporation ("SCC") to assist in the     
solicitation. Representatives of SCC may telephone shareholders who have not    
voted, encouraging them to vote. The estimated cost of engaging SCC, all of     
which will be paid by LNC and not by your Fund, is $50,000.                     

       A proxy may be revoked before the Meeting by giving written notice of
revocation to the Secretary of the applicable Company, or at the Meeting prior  
to voting. Unless revoked, properly executed proxies in which choices are not   
specified by the shareholders will be voted "for" each item for which no choice 
is specified, in accordance with the recommendation of the applicable Company's 
Board of Directors. In instances where choices are specified by the shareholders
in the proxy, those proxies will be voted or the vote will be withheld in       
accordance with the shareholder's choice. With regard to the election of        
directors, votes may be cast in favor or withheld. Abstentions may be specified 
on all proposals other than the election of directors. Abstentions and votes    
withheld with respect to the election of directors will be counted as present   
for purposes of determining whether a quorum of sharesis present at the Meeting 
with respect to the item on which the abstention is noted, and will have the    
same effect as a vote "against" such item. Under the Rules of the New York Stock
Exchange, if a proposal is considered "non-discretionary," then brokers who hold
Fund shares in street name for customers are not authorized to vote on such     
proposal on behalf of their customers who have not furnished the broker specific
voting instructions. If a broker returns a "non-vote" proxy, indicating a lack  
of authority to vote on a proposal, then the shares covered by such non-vote    
shall not be counted as present for purposes of calculating the vote with       
respect to such proposal. So far as the Board of Directors is aware, no matter  
other than those described in this Proxy Statement will be acted upon at the    
Meeting. Should any other matters properly come before the Meeting calling for a
vote of shareholders, it is the intention of the persons named as proxies in the
enclosed proxy to act upon such matters according to their best judgment.       

         Only shareholders of record of each Fund on February 10, 1997, may vote
at the Meeting or any adjournment thereof. As of that date, there were issued   
and outstanding common shares of each Fund (shares of beneficial interest with  
respect to series of Voyageur Investment Trust and Voyageur Investment Trust II)
as follows:

Each shareholder of a Fund is entitled to one vote for each share held. None of 
the matters to be presented at the Meeting will entitle any shareholder to      
cumulative voting or appraisal rights. A list of those persons who, to the      
knowledge of Fund management, beneficially owned more than 5% of the voting     
shares of any class of any of the Funds as of February 10, 1997, is set forth in
Schedule 1 to this Proxy Statement.                                             

         In the event that sufficient votes are not received for the adoption of
any proposal, an adjournment or adjournments of the Meeting may be sought. Any  
adjournment would require a vote in favor of the adjournment by the holders of a
majority of the shares present at the Meeting (or any adjournment thereof) in   
person or by proxy. In such circumstances, the persons named as proxies will    
vote in favor of any proposed adjournment.                                      

      COPIES OF EACH FUND'S MOST RECENT ANNUAL AND SEMI-ANNUAL REPORTS ARE

BACKGROUND
INTRODUCTION                                                                    

    The Meeting has been called as a result of the proposed Merger, as
defined and discussed in greater detail below under "The Proposed Merger." The  
proposed Merger involves the parent company of VFM and a newly formed subsidiary
of LNC. The Merger, which is expected to occur on or about April 30, 1997, will 
result in LNC having ultimate ownership and control of VFM, the Funds'          
investment adviser. This change in control will result in the automatic         
termination of the investment advisory agreements between the Funds and VFM.    
Thus, shareholders of each Fund (other than International Equity Fund, National 
Insured Tax Free Fund, National Limited Term Tax Free Fund, National Tax Free   
Fund and Growth and Income Fund) are being asked to approve new investment      
advisory agreements. Shareholders of Growth Stock Fund are also being asked to  
approve a sub-advisory agreement with a new limited liability company owned by  
the current owners of VFM, whereby the limited liability company will continue  
to utilize James C. King, the Fund's current portfolio manager, to provide      
day-to-day portfolio management services to the Fund.                           

      Shareholders of International Equity Fund, National Insured Tax Free
Fund, National Limited Term Tax Free Fund and National Tax Free Fund are being  
asked to approve the liquidation of their Funds in connection with the Merger.  
Shareholders of Growth and Income Fund are being asked to approve the           
reorganization of their Fund into a series of a different corporate entity. As a
result of this reorganization, Growth and Income Fund would be advised by a new 
limited liability company owned by the current owners of VFM, rather than by an 
entity controlled by LNC.                                                       

       In addition, shareholders of all Funds are being asked to elect eight
members to each Company's Board of Directors, including one director from the   
current Boards who has been nominated for reelection. The remaining members of  
the current Boards are expected to resign immediately prior to closing of the   
Merger. Shareholders of the Funds that are being asked to approve liquidation or
reorganization proposals are being asked to elect directors because they were   
record holders of their respective Company's shares on the record date for the  
Meeting and are therefore required to be included among shareholders entitled to
vote. Such shareholders will not be affected by the election of directors,      
however, if the liquidation or reorganization of their respective Fund is       
approved.                                                                       

     All of the proposals on which shareholders are being asked to vote,
other than the reorganization of Growth and Income Fund, are contingent upon    
consummation of the Merger. If the Merger is not consummated, the current Boards
of Directors will remain in office, the current investment advisory agreements  
and any current sub- advisory agreements will remain in effect, and             
International Equity Fund, National Insured Tax Free Fund, National Limited Term
Tax Free Fund and National Tax Free Fund will not be liquidated.                

THE PROPOSED MERGER 

 VFM currently serves as the investment adviser to each Fund and
provides the Funds with administrative, accounting, transfer agency and dividend
disbursing services. Voyageur Fund Distributors, Inc. ("VFD"), a wholly owned   
subsidiary of VFM, acts as the distributor of each Fund's shares. VFM is an     
indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Dougherty Financial Group, Inc. ("DFG"),    
which is owned 49.83% by Michael E. Dougherty and 49.83% equally by James O.    
Pohlad, Robert C. Pohlad and William M. Pohlad (the "Pohlads").                 

         On January 15, 1997, DFG, Mr. Dougherty and the Pohlads entered into an
Agreement and Plan of Merger with LNC (the "Merger Agreement"). The Merger      
Agreement provides that a wholly owned subsidiary of LNC will be merged with and
into DFG, causing DFG to become a wholly owned subsidiary of LNC. This          
transaction is referred to herein as the "Merger." Prior to the closing date of 
the Merger (the "Closing Date") a reorganization will be completed (the         
"Reorganization") whereby certain assets of DFG and its subsidiaries, including 
all of the assets of VFM used solely or primarily in the private accounts       
investment advisory business of VFM, will be sold by DFG to certain newly       
organized limited liability companies. Thus, these assets will not be acquired  
by LNC in connection with the Merger.                                           

 LNC, with headquarters in Fort Wayne, Indiana, is a diversified
organization with operations in many aspects of the financial services industry,
including insurance and investment management. Delaware Management Company, Inc.
("DMC"), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of LNC, and its affiliate, Delaware
International Advisers Ltd., serve as the investment advisers to the investment 
companies in the Delaware Group of Investment Companies (the "Delaware Group"), 
which currently includes 16 open-end funds and two closed-end funds (comprising 
48 separate investment portfolios). Delaware Distributors, L.P. ("Delaware      
Distributors"), also an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of LNC, serves as the  
national distributor for each open-end fund in the Delaware Group. DMC through  
its Delaware Investment Advisers division, Delaware International Advisers Ltd. 
and certain other subsidiaries of Delaware Management Holdings, Inc. ("DMH")    
also provides investment advice with respect to separately managed accounts of  
institutional and other clients. DMH, through its subsidiaries, is responsible  
for the management of approximately $32 billion.                                

      Under the Merger Agreement, holders of DFG common stock will receive
LNC common stock with a value of approximately $69 million. This amount is      
subject to certain adjustments, including a downward adjustment in the event    
that the aggregate net assets of the Funds, other than those Funds for which    
liquidation has been proposed, and certain other investment companies managed by
VFM (collectively, the "Voyageur Funds") as of the Closing Date is less than 90%
but equal to or greater than 80% of the aggregate net assets of the Voyageur    
Funds as of January 14, 1997. In connection with the Reorganization, all issued 
and outstanding shares of DFG common stock other than those owned by Mr.        
Dougherty and the Pohlads will be redeemed and all outstanding options (other   
than those held by certain optionholders receiving compensation under the Merger
Agreement) will be canceled. As a result, immediately prior to consummation of  
the Merger, the issued and outstanding shares of DFG will be owned 50% by       
Michael E. Dougherty, 16 2/3% by James O. Pohlad, 16 2/3% by Robert C. Pohlad   
and 16 2/3% by William M. Pohlad.                                               

     The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") is subject to a number of
conditions, including a condition that Voyageur Funds which collectively        
represent at least 90% of the aggregate net assets of the Voyageur Funds as of  
the Closing Date will, by shareholder vote, have approved new investment        
advisory agreements and, with respect to the open-end Voyageur Funds, the Boards
of Directors of such Funds shall have approved new distribution agreements. In  
addition, the aggregate net assets of the Voyageur Funds as of the Closing Date 
shall not be less than 80% of the aggregate net assets of the Voyageur Funds as 
of January 14, 1997, and the net assets of each of Minnesota Insured Fund,      
Minnesota Tax Free Fund, Florida Insured Tax Free Fund, Colorado Tax Free Fund  
and Arizona Insured Tax Free Fund as of the Closing Date shall not be less than 
80% of their net assets as of January 14, 1997.                                 

CONSUMMATION OF THE MERGER                                                      

  If the Merger is consummated, LNC will own indirectly all of the
outstanding voting securities of VFM, which in turn will own all of the         
outstanding voting securities of VFD. Such new ownership will constitute a      
change in control of VFM and VFD and will cause the current investment advisory 
agreements and distribution agreements of each Fund to terminate automatically  
in accordance with their terms, as required by the Investment Company Act of    
1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"). Such terminations will necessitate adoption  
of new agreements for the provision of investment advisory and distribution     
services. Shareholder approvals of the new investment advisory agreements are   
required under the 1940 Act and are proposed and described below under "Proposal
Two--Proposal to Approve New Investment Advisory Agreements."                   

        Shareholder approvals of new distribution agreements are not required.
However, such agreements have been approved by the Board of Directors of each   
Company, effective as of such approval. Each Company, on behalf of the Funds in 
such Company, will enter into new distribution agreements with both VFD and     
Delaware Distributors that will be identical in all material respects to such   
Company's current distribution agreement. Delaware Distributors and VFD will act
as the co-principal distributors of the Funds' shares. Delaware Distributors, an
indirect wholly owned subsidiary of LNC, is the national distributor for all of 
the mutual funds in the Delaware Group. Under their distribution agreements, VFD
and Delaware Distributors will receive payments pursuant to the Funds' Rule     
12b-1 Plans of Distribution. The Plans of Distribution, including the Rule 12b-1
fees payable thereunder, will not change as a result of the Merger.             

         Following the Merger, it is possible that the businesses of VFM and DMC
will be combined to consolidate all investment management activities of the     
Delaware Group and the Voyageur Funds into one company, and that the businesses 
of VFD and Delaware Distributors will be combined to consolidate distribution   
activities for the two groups into one company. In the event that such          
combinations take place, no change in ultimate control or management of VFM or  
VFD would occur.                                                                

         Each Company has also entered into an administrative services agreement
with VFM which, pursuant to its terms, will terminate automatically upon        
consummation of the Merger. Under the administrative services agreements, VFM   
acts as the Funds' dividend disbursing, transfer, administrative and accounting 
services agent to perform dividend-paying functions, to calculate each Fund's   
daily share price, to maintain shareholder records and to perform certain       
regulatory and compliance related services for the Funds. Following consummation
of the Merger, each Company will enter into a shareholder services agreement    
with Delaware Service Company, Inc. ("Delaware Service") pursuant to which      
Delaware Service will serve as the shareholder servicing, dividend disbursing   
and transfer agent for each Fund and a fund accounting agreement with Delaware  
Service pursuant to which Delaware Service will serve as the accounting agent   
for each Fund. Delaware Service is an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of LNC. 

      In order to provide continuity in the provision of these services to
the Funds, the Merger Agreement requires Dougherty Financial Group LLC ("DFG    
LLC"), one of the limited liability companies to be formed in the Reorganization
discussed above, to provide certain transition services to LNC or one of its    
subsidiaries after Closing. Accordingly, upon Closing, DFG LLC will enter into a
Transition Services Agreement with DMH, an indirect parent company of Delaware  
Service and a wholly owned subsidiary of LNC, pursuant to which, for a period of
up to two years following the Closing Date, DFG LLC shall provide to DMH certain
specified services which may include the following: (a) human resources,        
supervision, general administrative, accounting and employee benefits; (b) fund 
accounting; (c) transfer agency; (d) legal, tax and compliance; (e) support     
services for brokers, wholesalers, marketing, customer support, fulfillment,    
securities trading, investment management, the unit investment trust business   
and the closed-end funds businesses; (f) hardware and software systems and      
maintenance; and (g) third-party vendor relationships. Payments under the       
Transition Services Agreement will be the responsibility of DMH and not of the  
Funds.                                                                          

   To provide continuity of management of the Funds, LNC has offered
employment contracts to Andrew M. McCullagh, Jr. and Elizabeth H. Howell, which 
have been accepted. Either Mr. McCullagh or Ms. Howell currently acts as the    
portfolio manager for each of the Funds that is being asked to approve a new    
investment advisory agreement other than the following: Florida Limited Term Tax
Free Fund, Florida Insured Tax Free Fund, Florida Tax Free Fund, Iowa Tax Free  
Fund, New York Tax Free Fund, Wisconsin Tax Free Fund, National High Yield      
Municipal Bond Fund, Growth Stock Fund and Aggressive Growth Fund. LNC has also 
offered employment to and received acceptances from others involved in the      
investment process with Mr. McCullagh and Ms. Howell, including assistant       
portfolio managers and research analysts. In addition, Frank C. Tonnemaker,     
current president of VFD, and other marketing personnel have accepted employment
contracts with LNC. Mr. Tonnemaker is expected to serve in a senior marketing   
role with responsibility for overseeing the transition of the Funds' management 
and distribution.                                                               

PROPOSAL ONE

* Denotes directors who will be considered to be "interested persons" (as       
defined by the 1940 Act) of the Companies upon closing of the Merger.       

         As of January 31, 1997, the current officers and directors of each Fund
as a group beneficially owned less than 1% of each class of outstanding shares  
of such Fund, except for John G. Taft who owns beneficially approximately 2% of 
Voyageur Aggressive Growth Fund's Class A shares and 4% of International Equity 
Fund's Class A shares.                                                          

 The Board of Directors of each Company has established an Audit
Committee which consists of each of the current directors. If the nominees named
above are elected and the Merger is consummated, it is expected that the Audit  
Committee will be reconstituted at the first meeting of the Boards of Directors 
following the Closing. The Audit Committee met two times during the most        
recently ended fiscal year for each Company. The Companies do not have          
nominating or compensation committees.                                          

       The functions to be performed by the Audit Committee are to recommend
annually to the Board a firm of independent certified public accountants to     
audit the books and records of each Company for the ensuing year; to monitor    
that firm's performance; to review with the firm the scope and results of each  
audit and determine the need, if any, to extend audit procedures; to confer with
the firm and representatives of each Company on matters concerning the Funds'   
financial statements and reports including the appropriateness of its accounting
practices and of its financial controls and procedures; to evaluate the         
independence of the firm; to review procedures to safeguard portfolio           
securities; to review the purchase by each Company from the firm of non-audit   
services; to review all fees paid to the firm; and to facilitate communications 
between the firm and each Company's officers and directors.                     

     For the most recently ended fiscal year of each Company, there were
five meetings of the Board of Directors. The only nominee for director at this  
Meeting, Mr. Madison, attended all meetings of the Board of Directors and of    
committees of which he was a member that were held while he was serving on the  
Board of Directors or on such committee.                                        

   No compensation is paid by any Company or Fund to its officers or
directors, except that each director who is not an employee of VFM or any of its
affiliates currently receives an annual fee of $26,000 for serving as a director
of all of the open-end and closed-end investment companies for which VFM acts as
investment adviser, plus a $500 fee for each special in-person meeting attended 
by such director. Set forth below is the compensation received by each current  
director from each Company for its most recently ended fiscal year and the      
aggregate compensation received by each such director from all closed-end and   
open-end investment companies managed by VFM during the calendar year ended     
December 31, 1996.

OF SUCH COMPANY. The vote of a majority of shares of each Company represented at
the meeting and entitled to vote, provided at least a quorum is represented in  
person or by proxy, is sufficient for the election of the above nominees. Unless
otherwise instructed, the proxies will vote for the above nominees. In the event
any of the above nominees are not candidates for election at the meeting, the

PROPOSAL TWO
PROPOSAL TO APPROVE NEW INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENTS
INTRODUCTION                                                                    

  As discussed above, the Merger will cause the current investment
advisory agreement of each Fund (individually a "Current Agreement" and         
collectively the "Current Agreements") to terminate automatically in accordance 
with its terms, as required by the 1940 Act. Such terminations will necessitate 
adoption by each Fund of a new investment advisory agreement for the provision  
of such services (individually a "New Agreement" and collectively the "New      
Agreements"). Under the 1940 Act, each Fund's New Agreement must be approved by 
the Fund's shareholders.                                                        

    Shareholders of the following Funds are being asked to approve New
Agreements with VFM:                                                            

Arizona Fund                    Minnesota Insured Fund        
Arizona Insured Fund            Minnesota Limited Term Fund   
California Fund                 Missouri Insured Fund         
California Insured Fund         New Mexico Fund               
Colorado Fund                   North Dakota Fund             
Idaho Fund                      Oregon Insured Fund           
Iowa Fund                       Utah Tax Free Fund            
Kansas Fund                     Washington Insured Fund       
Minnesota Fund                  Wisconsin Fund                
Minnesota High Yield Fund                                     

   For each such Fund (other than Iowa Fund and Wisconsin Fund), the
principal portfolio manager, either Andrew M. McCullagh, Jr. or Elizabeth H.    
Howell, will remain unchanged. For Iowa Fund and Wisconsin Fund, VFM will       
continue as investment adviser, but the portfolio manager will be changed from  
Steven P. Eldredge to Ms. Howell. Biographical information on Mr. McCullagh and 
Ms. Howell can be found below under "Executive Officers of Voyageur Funds."     

    Shareholders of the following Funds are being asked to approve New
Agreements with DMC:                                          

Aggressive Growth Fund          Growth Stock Fund             
Florida Fund                    National High Yield Fund      
Florida Insured Fund            New York Fund                 
Florida Limited Term Fund                                     

       DMC is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of LNC. Portfolio managers
of the Funds managed by DMC will be individuals currently employed by DMC,      
except as discussed below. Biographical information for the individuals who are 
expected to manage the Funds after consummation of the Merger can be found below
under "Executive Officers of Voyageur Funds."                                   

       After the Merger, Aggressive Growth Fund will be managed by Edward N.
Antoian and Gerald S. Frey. Florida Insured Fund, Florida Limited Term Fund,    
Florida Fund, National High Yield Fund and New York Fund will be managed by     
Patrick P. Coyne and Mitchell L. Conery. Mr. McCullagh will assist Messrs. Coyne
and Conery in the management of Florida Insured Fund, Florida Limited Term Fund 
and Florida Fund. Growth Stock Fund will continue to be managed by James C. King
pursuant to a sub-advisory agreement with VAM Asset Management LLC. See Proposal
Three below.                                                                    

BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDATION                                               

      The Boards of Directors of each Company, including the disinterested
directors, voted to approve the New Agreements. For information about each      
Board's deliberations and the reasons for its recommendation, please see        
"Evaluation of the Merger by the Boards of Directors" near the end of this      
Proposal Two.                                                                   

       The Boards of Directors recommend that shareholders of each Fund vote
FOR approval of such Fund's New Agreement.                                      

COMPARISON OF NEW AGREEMENTS AND CURRENT AGREEMENTS 

    The material differences between the Funds' New Agreements and the
Funds' Current Agreements are discussed below. A form of New Agreement is       
attached to this Proxy Statement as Exhibit A. The following discussion is      
qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of such New Agreement. If    
approved by shareholders, the New Agreements will take effect upon consummation 
of the Merger.                                                                  

        ADVISORY SERVICES. Pursuant to both the Current Agreements and the New
Agreements, either VFM or DMC, as the case may be (sometimes referred to        
hereinafter as the "Adviser"), has the sole and exclusive responsibility for the
management of the respective Fund's portfolio and the making and execution of   
all investment decisions for the Fund subject to the objectives and investment  
policies and restrictions of the Fund and subject to the supervision of the     
Company's Board of Directors; provided that under the New Agreements the Adviser
may retain one or more sub-advisers. See "Ability to Retain a Sub-Adviser"      
below. Under the Current Agreements and the New Agreements the Adviser is       
required to furnish, at its own expense, office facilities, equipment and       
personnel for servicing the investments of each Fund. In addition, the Adviser  
is required, if a Company so requests, to arrange for its officers and employees
to serve without compensation from the Funds as directors, officers or employees
of the Companies if duly elected to such positions by the shareholders or       
directors of the Companies.                                                     

       COMPENSATION. Investment advisory fees payable by each Fund under its
Current Agreement are identical to fees which will be payable under its New     
Agreement except that, as described in the following paragraph, under certain   
Current Agreements, VFM is contractually obligated to waive its advisory fee if 
total Fund operating expenses exceed a certain level. As compensation for the   
Adviser's services, each Fund is obligated to pay to the Adviser a monthly      
investment advisory fee in the amount set forth in the table on page 13, below. 
The fee is based on the average daily value of each Fund's net assets at the    
close of business of each business day.                                         

         FEE AND EXPENSE LIMITATIONS. Under each Fund's Current Agreement (other
than the Current Agreements of Growth Fund, Aggressive Growth Fund and Growth   
and Income Fund), VFM is contractually obligated to waive its advisory fee if   
and to the extent that aggregate Fund operating expenses exceed 1% of the Fund's
average daily net assets. Fund operating expenses are defined to include, among 
other expenses, the advisory fee paid to VFM under the Current Agreement, the   
administrative services fee paid to VFM under the Fund's Administrative Services
Agreement and deferred organizational costs, but to exclude interest, taxes,    
brokerage fees and commissions, insurance premiums on portfolio securities (with
respect to those Funds that invest in insured municipal bonds) and Rule 12b-1   
plan fees. The Current Agreements of Growth Fund, Aggressive Growth Fund and    
Growth and Income Fund do not include contractual expense limitation provisions.

        The New Agreements will not include any contractual expense limitation
provisions. However, DMC has committed, for a period of two years following the 
date of Closing, to voluntarily waive fees and/or pay Fund expenses to the same 
extent, if any, as would have been necessary to comply with such contractual    
provisions.                                                                     

         Under both the Current Agreements and the New Agreements, all costs and
expenses incurred in the operation of the Funds, to the extent not specifically 
assumed by the Adviser or the Funds' distributor, are the responsibility of the 
Funds.                                                                          

ABILITY TO RETAIN A SUB-ADVISER. The Current Agreements provide that
VFM shall have the sole and exclusive responsibility for the management of each 
Fund's investment portfolio and for making and executing all investment         
decisions for each Fund. Each New Agreement authorizes the Adviser, at its      
expense, to retain a sub-adviser or sub-advisers to perform some or all of the  
services for which the Adviser is responsible under the New Agreement. Any      
retention of a sub-adviser is subject to approval by the Board of Directors and 
the shareholders of the respective Fund.                                        

     STANDARD OF CARE. The Current Agreements do not contain an explicit
standard of care. The New Agreements provide that, unless there is willful      
misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or a reckless disregard by the Adviser 
of its duties, the Adviser shall not be liable to the Funds or their            
shareholders for any action or omission in the course of, or connected with,    
rendering services under the New Agreements or for any losses that may be       
sustained in the purchase, holding or sale of any security, or otherwise.       

PORTFOLIO TRANSACTIONS AND ALLOCATION OF BROKERAGE. The New Agreements
each provide that, subject to the primary objective of obtaining the best       
available prices and execution, the Adviser may place orders with brokers or    
dealers who provide brokerage and research services to the Adviser or its       
advisory clients. The New Agreements also provide that, to the extent consistent
with the Rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the National       
Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., these orders may be placed with brokers
who sell shares of the Funds to which the Adviser provides advisory services.   
The services which may be provided to the Adviser include advice, either        
directly or through publications or writings, as to the value of securities, the
advisability of investing in, purchasing or selling securities, and the         
availability of securities or purchasers or sellers of securities; furnishing of
analyses and reports concerning issuers, securities or industries; providing    
information on economic factors and trends; assisting in determining portfolio  
strategy; providing computer software and hardware used in security analyses;   
and providing portfolio performance evaluation and technical market analyses.   
Such services will be used by the Adviser in connection with its investment     
decision-making process with respect to one or more Funds and accounts that it  
manages, and need not be used, or used exclusively, with respect to the Fund or 
account generating the brokerage. The New Agreements also provide that higher   
commissions are permitted to be paid to broker/dealers who provide brokerage and
research services than to broker/dealers who do not provide such services if    
such higher commissions are deemed reasonable in relation to the value of the   
brokerage and research services provided. There are no provisions in the Current
Agreements addressing these issues. Disclosure in each Fund's current Prospectus
and Statement of Additional Information provides, however, that the Adviser may 
engage in such practices.                                                       

   TERM. If approved by shareholders, the New Agreements will become
effective upon consummation of the Merger and will have initial terms of two    
years. Thereafter, as is also the case with the Current Agreements, each Fund's 
New Agreement will continue from year to year only if approved annually (a) by  
the Fund's Board of Directors or by the vote of a majority of the outstanding   
voting securities of the Fund and (b) by the vote of a majority of the directors
of the Fund who are not parties to the Agreement or interested persons (as      
defined in the 1940 Act) of any such party, cast in person at a meeting of the  
Board of Directors of the Fund called for the purpose of voting on such         
approval. In the case of both the New Agreements and the Current Agreements,    
each Agreement may be terminated by the Fund or by the Adviser on 60 days'      
notice to the other party, and terminates automatically upon its assignment.

FEES AND EXPENSES                                                               

    As discussed above, certain Current Agreements contain contractual
expense limitations. The New Agreements will not contain any such limitations.  
However, DMC has committed for a period of two years following the date of the  
Closing of the Merger to voluntarily waive fees and/or pay Fund expenses to the 
same extent, if any, as would have been necessary had such contractual expense  
limitations ("Contractual Limitations") remained in place. VFM also committed in
the current Prospectuses for certain of the Funds to voluntarily waive fees or  
reimburse Fund expenses in such a manner as would result in each such Fund being
charged fees and expenses that would approximate those set forth in the Fees and
Expenses tables appearing in those Prospectuses ("Prospectus Waivers").         

   In addition to the Contractual Limitations and Prospectus Waivers
described above, VFM and VFD have, on a voluntary basis, waived additional fees 
and reimbursed additional Fund expenses for certain Funds. The amount of such   
additional voluntary fee waivers and expense reimbursements has varied from year
to year depending on VFM's and VFD's assessment of market conditions. Senior    
management of VFM and VFD have reviewed with senior management of DMC, Delaware 
Distributors and Delaware Service the amount of such additional fees and        
expenses that VFM and VFD expected to voluntarily waive or reimburse during 1997
and the expected total expense ratios for each Fund for 1997, after taking into 
account such additional voluntary fee waivers and expense reimbursements.       

         In addition to adhering to the Contractual Limitations for the two-year
period after Closing, DMC has committed to adhere to all Prospectus Waivers for 
so long as specified in the current Fund Prospectuses and, through December 31,
1997, has committed to waive fees and/or pay Fund expenses to the extent        
necessary to cause the total expense ratio for Class A shares of each Fund to   
equal the expense ratio that senior management of VFM and VFD projected to      
maintain for such class of each such Fund during 1997. Expense ratios for Class 
B and Class C of each Fund are expected to vary from the expense ratio for Class
A by the amount of the difference in the Rule 12b-1 plan fees payable for each  
class. The expense ratios projected to be maintained by senior management of VFM
and VFD for 1997 are not higher than the expense ratios set forth in the Fees   
and Expenses tables in the above-referenced Prospectuses, after taking into     
account the Prospectus Waivers.                                                 

 In accordance with DMC's standard process, it is expected that,
commencing in 1998, the voluntary fee waivers and expense limitations described 
in this paragraph will be reviewed on a semi-annual basis and may be adjusted or
eliminated from time to time based on factors determined by DMC, Delaware       
Distributors and Delaware Service to be relevant. Notwithstanding any possible  
adjustment or elimination of voluntary fee waivers or expense limitations, fees 
paid to VFM or DMC for investment management services after the Closing will not
exceed those set forth in the New Agreements being considered for approval at   
the Meeting unless shareholder approval is obtained. In addition, Rule 12b-1    
Plan payments for each class of the Fund will not exceed the levels set forth in
the Funds' existing Rule 12b-1 Plans without shareholder approval.              

EVALUATION OF THE MERGER BY THE BOARDS OF DIRECTORS 

    On January 15, 1997, the Boards of Directors of the Companies were
informed by VFM that DFG had entered into the Merger Agreement. After such      
notification, the Boards were advised by counsel to the Funds regarding their   
fiduciary obligations and the nature and extent of the information that they    
should consider requesting in order to evaluate the New Agreements and the      
potential impact of the Merger on the Funds and their shareholders. A special   
meeting of the Boards was held on January 28, 1997, at which meeting the Boards 
met with various executive officers of LNC, DMC, Delaware Distributors and      
Delaware Service ("DMH representatives"). These individuals presented to Board  
members background information on LNC, information on DMC, including its        
experience in municipal bond fund, fixed income fund and equity fund management,
and the structure of and rationale behind the proposed Merger. They also        
discussed with Board members the organizational continuity that would follow the
Merger, noting in particular that the majority of the Funds would continue to be
managed by their current portfolio managers. They also discussed the            
capabilities of Delaware Distributors and Delaware Service and described the    
Transition Services Agreement referred to above that was designed to help       
provide continuity with respect to shareholder servicing, fund accounting and   
dividend disbursing and transfer agency services. DMH representatives summarized
other benefits that the Merger, in their opinion, could bring to Fund           
shareholders, including benefits in the areas of customer service and fund      
accounting, improved distribution as a result of the strength of Delaware       
Distributors, and access through a net asset value exchange privilege to all    
open-end mutual funds in the Delaware Group.                                    

     At the meeting, the Boards appointed a special committee made up of
disinterested directors (the "Special Committee") to further consider and make  
recommendations to the Boards as to the appropriateness of the proposed         
transactions. Those directors who are members of the Special Committee are James
W. Nelson and Thomas F. Madison. On February 5, 1997, the Special Committee     
traveled to DMH's headquarters and met with senior management representatives of
DMC, Delaware Distributors and Delaware Service to review various aspects of the
proposed Merger, the background of DMC and its affiliates, DMC's operational    
capabilities and compliance functions and future plans for the Funds. The       
Special Committee also met with outside counsel to the funds in the Delaware    
Group, a representative of Ernst & Young LLP ("Ernst & Young"), the independent 
public accountants to the funds in the Delaware Group, proposed portfolio       
managers for some of the Funds and with certain nominees to the Funds' Boards.  

        At a meeting on February 7, 1997, the Boards of Directors of the Funds
met to review with the Special Committee the findings of such committee. The    
Boards also met with senior management representatives of DMC, Delaware         
Distributors and Delaware Service and reviewed substantial additional           
information, including information regarding the following points: (a) the      
structure of the Merger; (b) the performance and abilities of DMC, including    
performance information for funds in the Delaware Group; (c) benefits of the    
Merger to Fund shareholders; (d) Fund expenses following the transaction; (e)   
proposed staffing and personnel relative to the Funds; (f) organizational style;
(g) the financial condition of LNC and its affiliates; (h) the fact that        
consolidations of the Funds currently are not being considered; (i) anticipated 
changes in Fund officers and counsel; (j) the compliance philosophy and record  
of DMC and its affiliates; (k) distribution, shareholder servicing and fund     
accounting; and (l) pro forma profitability information (in connection with     
providing advisory, distribution and other services to the Funds) for DMC,      
Delaware Distributors and Delaware Service, assuming consummation of the Merger.
The Boards were also informed at such meeting that DMC anticipates that it will 
recommend, at some point after consummation of the Merger, that Ernst & Young be
appointed as the independent public accountants for the Companies.              

     A final meeting of the Boards was held on February 14, 1997 for the
purpose of approving the Funds' New Agreements. At such meeting, each Company's 
Board recommended that the shareholders of each Fund that is a series of such   
Company approve the Fund's New Agreement, to become effective as of the closing 
of the Merger. During its deliberations the Boards noted, in particular, the    
following:                                                                      

    *        Each Fund's New Agreement contains substantially the same
                material terms and conditions as are contained in the Fund's
              Current Agreement except that, as discussed above, the New
            Agreements do not contain contractual expense limitation
            provisions, they allow the Adviser to retain one or more
             sub-advisers and they contain explicit standards of care.

     *        DMC has committed, for a period of two years following the
              date of Closing, to voluntarily waive fees and/or pay Fund
           expenses to the same extent, if any, as would have been
                necessary to comply with the contractual expense limitations
in the Current Agreements.                  

      *        The Funds will not bear any costs or expenses in connection
      with the Merger, including the costs of this proxy
solicitation.                               

       *        No change in any Fund's investment objectives or fundamental
              policies are currently contemplated in connection with the
Merger.                                     

      *        The Merger is expected to result in a number of benefits to
            shareholders, including access through a net asset value
                 exchange privilege to all of the open-end mutual funds in the
Delaware Group.                             

*        The Merger is not expected to cause any change in the
            investment personnel managing the majority of the Funds.

    The Board also considered Section 15(f) of the 1940 Act during its
deliberations. Section 15(f) provides a "safe harbor" from the 1971 case of     
ROSENFELD V. BLACK, in which the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit   
held that an investment adviser is prohibited from benefitting financially in   
connection with the sale or assignment of its advisory office to another        
investment adviser. Under the ROSENFELD analysis, any compensation received by  
an investment adviser or an affiliate thereof in connection with the transfer or
assignment of an investment advisory agreement arguably would be prohibited if  
all or any portion of such compensation constitutes consideration for the       
assistance by such investment adviser or affiliate thereof in facilitating the  
transfer of the investment advisory office to the successor adviser. The Section
15(f) safe harbor is available if two conditions are met. First, for a period of
three years after the transaction at least 75% of the board members of the      
investment company must not be "interested persons" (within the meaning of the  
1940 Act) of the new or predecessor investment adviser. The Board of Directors  
which shareholders are being asked to elect in Proposal One, above, consists of 
eight directors, two of whom, Jeffrey J. Nick and Wayne A. Stork, are interested
persons of LNC, and none of whom are interested persons of VFM. Accordingly, the
composition of the proposed Board of Directors would be in compliance with this 
provision of Section 15(f). Second, an "unfair burden" must not be imposed upon 
the investment company as a result of such transaction or any express or implied
terms, conditions or understandings applicable thereto. The term "unfair burden"
is defined in Section 15(f) to include any arrangement during a two-year period 
after the transaction whereby the investment adviser, or any interested person  
of any such adviser, receives or is entitled to receive any compensation,       
directly or indirectly, from the investment company or its shareholders (other  
than fees for bona fide investment advisory or other services) or from any      
person in connection with the purchase or sale of securities or other property  
to, from or on behalf of the investment company (other than bona fide ordinary  
compensation as principal underwriter for such investment company). In          
connection therewith, LNC represented to the Board that it will use its best    
efforts to assure that the Funds do not execute any portfolio transactions      
through an affiliate of LNC for a period of at least two years following        
consummation of the Merger.                                                     

         LNC has represented in the Merger Agreement that neither LNC nor any of
its affiliates has any express or implied understanding or arrangement which    
would impose an unfair burden on any of the Funds or would in any way violate   
Section 15(f) of the 1940 Act as a result of the transactions contemplated by   
the Merger Agreement.                                                           

VOTE REQUIRED                                                                   
       THE BOARDS OF DIRECTORS RECOMMEND THAT SHAREHOLDERS OF EACH FUND VOTE
IN FAVOR OF APPROVAL OF SUCH FUND'S NEW AGREEMENT. Approval of the proposal for 
a Fund requires the favorable vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of   
such Fund, as defined in the 1940 Act, which means the lesser of the vote of (a)
67% of the shares of the Fund present at a meeting where more than 50% of the   
outstanding shares are present in person or by proxy, or (b) more than 50% of   
the outstanding shares of the Fund. Unless otherwise instructed, the proxies    
will vote to approve the New Agreements.                                        

PROPOSAL THREE
PROPOSAL TO APPROVE A SUB-ADVISORY AGREEMENT
 PURSUANT TO WHICH VOYAGEUR ASSET MANAGEMENT LLC
WOULD MANAGE THE ASSETS OF GROWTH STOCK FUND
THE PROPOSED SUB-ADVISORY AGREEMENT                                             

     As set forth in Proposal Two, shareholders of Growth Stock Fund are
being asked to approve a new investment advisory agreement with DMC. DMC        
proposed that the Board of Directors approve a sub-advisory agreement (the      
"Sub-Advisory Agreement") between DMC and Voyageur Asset Management LLC ("VAM   
LLC"). It is expected that VAM LLC will be a wholly owned subsidiary of DFG LLC 
formed as a part of the Reorganization. See "Background." After the Merger, VAM 
LLC is expected to conduct the private account investment advisory business     
formerly conducted by VFM. The current portfolio manager for Growth Stock Fund, 
James C. King, will be an employee of VAM LLC following the Merger and, if the  
proposed Sub-Advisory Agreement is approved, will continue to act as Growth     
Stock Fund's portfolio manager after the Merger. Mr. King was a director of VFM 
and VFD from 1993 through 1995 and has been a Senior Equity Portfolio Manager of
VFD since 1990. He has over 30 years of investment experience. The Board of     
Directors of Growth Stock Fund has approved, and recommends that Growth Stock   
Fund shareholders approve, the Sub-Advisory Agreement. If approved by           
shareholders, the Sub-Advisory Agreement would be effective upon closing of the 
Merger.                                                                         

     DMC believes that it has the capacity among its existing investment
personnel to manage Growth Stock Fund without the assistance of a sub-adviser   
but has at this point determined to utilize a sub-adviser to enhance the        
continuity in the provision of investment management services for existing      
Growth Stock Fund shareholders. In fact, DMC under the proposed investment      
management agreement intends to be actively involved in the management of Growth
Stock Fund. At such time as DMC determines that it would be prudent to manage   
the Growth Stock Fund without the assistance of a sub-adviser, it may,          
consistent with the terms of the Sub-Advisory Agreement, terminate such         
agreement.                                                                      

     The form of Sub-Advisory Agreement is attached as Exhibit B to this
Proxy Statement. The following discussion is qualified in its entirety by       
reference to the text of the Sub-Advisory Agreement.                            

   Under the terms of the Sub-Advisory Agreement, and subject to the
supervision of DMC, VAM LLC will direct the investment of Growth Stock Fund's   
assets and will be responsible for the formulation and implementation of a      
continuing program for the management of the Fund's assets and resources. VAM   
LLC will make all determinations with respect to the investment of the assets of
Growth Stock Fund and will take such steps as may be necessary to implement the 
determinations, including the placement of purchase and sale orders on behalf of
the Fund.                                                                       

  The Sub-Advisory Agreement provides that DMC shall pay VAM LLC a
monthly management fee at an annual rate of .50% of Growth Stock Fund's average 
daily net assets during each month (provided that, to the extent that DMC       
undertakes in Growth Stock Fund's Registration Statement or elsewhere to waive  
its investment advisory fee, VAM LLC has agreed to proportionately waive its    
sub-advisory fee). VAM LLC's sub-advisory fee will be paid by DMC, not by       
Growth Stock Fund.                                                              

    As is the case with the proposed investment advisory agreement for
Growth Stock Fund, the Sub-Advisory Agreement provides that, subject to the     
primary objective of obtaining the best available prices and execution, VAM LLC 
may place orders with brokers or dealers who provide brokerage and research     
services to VAM LLC or its advisory clients. See "Proposal Two--Comparison of
New Agreements and Current Agreements--Portfolio Transactions and Allocation of
Brokerage."                                                                     

         The Sub-Advisory Agreement will terminate automatically in the event of
its assignment. In addition, the Sub-Advisory Agreement is terminable at any    
time, without penalty, by the Board of Directors of Growth Stock Fund or by a   
vote of a majority of the Fund's outstanding voting securities on 60 days'      
written notice to DMC and VAM LLC, by DMC on 60 days' written notice to VAM LLC,
or by VAM LLC on 60 days' written notice to the DMC. The Sub-Advisory Agreement 
shall have an initial term of two years and thereafter shall continue in effect 
only so long as such continuance is specifically approved at least annually by  
either the Board of Directors of Growth Stock Fund, or by a vote of a majority  
(as defined in the 1940 Act) of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund,  
provided that, in either event, such continuance is also approved by a vote of a
majority of the directors who are not parties to such Agreement, or interested  
persons of such parties, cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of  
voting on such approval.                                                        

THE BOARD'S CONSIDERATIONS                                                      

    The Sub-Advisory Agreement was approved by the Growth Stock Fund's
Board of Directors, subject to shareholder approval, at a meeting called for the
purpose of voting on the Sub-Advisory Agreement held February 14, 1997. Prior to
approving the Sub-Advisory Agreement, the Board considered a variety of         
factors, including: (a) the historical performance of Growth Stock Fund under   
current management; (b) the nature, quality and extent of the services proposed 
to be provided by VAM LLC pursuant to the Sub-Advisory Agreement; (c) DMC's     
role in supervising VAM LLC in its capacity as sub-adviser to DMC; and (d) the  
reasonableness of the proposed fee allocation between DMC and VAM LLC in light  
of the reduced investment role but continued overall responsibility of DMC.     

VOTE REQUIRED                                                                   
 THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF GROWTH STOCK FUND RECOMMENDS THAT THE
SHAREHOLDERS OF THE FUND VOTE TO APPROVE THE PROPOSED SUB-ADVISORY AGREEMENT.   
Adoption of the proposal requires the favorable vote of a majority of the       
outstanding shares of the Fund, as defined in the 1940 Act, which means the     
lesser of the vote of (a) 67% of the shares of the Fund present at a meeting    
where more than 50% of the outstanding shares are present in person or by proxy,
or (b) more than 50% of the outstanding shares of the Fund. Unless otherwise    
instructed, the proxies will vote for the approval of the proposed Sub-Advisory 
Agreement.                                                                      

 PROPOSAL FOUR
PROPOSAL TO APPROVE THE LIQUIDATION OF
INTERNATIONAL EQUITY FUND, NATIONAL INSURED TAX FREE FUND,
 NATIONAL LIMITED TERM TAX FREE FUND
AND NATIONAL TAX FREE FUND
INTRODUCTION                                                                    

      On February 7, 1997, the Boards of Directors of International Equity
Fund, National Insured Tax Free Fund, National Limited Term Tax Free Fund and   
National Tax Free Fund (individually a "Liquidating Fund" and collectively the  
"Liquidating Funds") considered the recommendation of VFM that such Funds be    
liquidated and terminated. A Plan of Liquidation and Termination for each such  
Fund (individually a "Liquidation Plan" and collectively the "Liquidation       
Plans") was subsequently adopted by the Boards on February 14, 1997, subject to 
shareholder approval. A copy of the form of Liquidation Plan is attached as     
Exhibit C to this Proxy Statement. If the Liquidation Plan is approved by a     
Liquidating Fund's shareholders, the portfolio securities and other assets of   
such Fund will be sold, creditors will be paid or reserves for such payments    
established, and the net proceeds of such sales will be distributed to          
shareholders in cash, pro rata in accordance with their shareholdings. With     
respect to each Fund, approval of the Liquidation Plan will be considered       
approval of an amendment to the articles of incorporation of such Fund's Company
required to effect the Liquidation Plan.                                        

BACKGROUND 

        In connection with the Merger described at the beginning of this Proxy
Statement under "Background," LNC and VFM determined that neither VFM nor DMC   
would act as investment adviser to the Liquidating Funds after consummation of  
the Merger. LNC's and VFM's determination was based primarily upon the small    
size of each of the Liquidating Funds, the fact that each of the Liquidating    
Funds is duplicative of a fund offered within the Delaware Group, and the cost  
of and amount of time available to complete a merger of each Liquidating Fund   
into its corresponding Delaware Group fund prior to or at the time of Closing.  
The Liquidating Funds had the following net asset values as of December 31,
1996:                                                                           

           Fund                                             Net Assets
           ----                                             ----------

  International Equity Fund                                $   2,560,777
  National Insured Tax Free Fund                           $  32,030,258
  National Limited Term Tax Free Fund                      $   1,184,425
  National Tax Free Fund                                   $   3,737,821

        Shareholders of the Liquidating Funds will be given the opportunity to
invest their redemption or liquidation proceeds in Class A shares of any        
open-end mutual fund in the Delaware Group (including the Voyageur Funds that   
become members of the Delaware Group as a result of the Merger) at net asset    
value, without the imposition of any front-end sales charge, for a period of one
year following the liquidation of the shareholder's Fund.                       

THE BOARDS' CONSIDERATIONS                                                      

         At the meeting of the Boards of Directors held on February 7, 1997, VFM
reviewed LNC's conclusion with the Boards. VFM noted that VAM LLC has decided   
that it will not manage the Liquidating Funds after the Merger on a continuing  
basis, since VAM LLC intends to retain generally only those assets related to   
the management of private accounts and certain non-retail mutual funds. VFM also
expressed its opinion that, given the small size of each of the Liquidating     
Funds, it would be difficult to find an alternative investment adviser          
interested in managing such Funds. VFM then reviewed the tax consequences of a  
liquidation with the Boards, explaining that the payment of liquidation         
distributions will be a taxable event to shareholders. Finally, VFM informed the
Boards that shareholders of the Liquidating Funds would be given the opportunity
to invest their redemption or liquidation proceeds in Class A shares of any     
open-end mutual fund in the Delaware Group (including the Voyageur Funds that   
become members of the Delaware Group) at net asset value, without the imposition
of any front-end sales charge.                                                  

     On February 14, 1997, the Boards of Directors, including all of the
independent directors, unanimously approved for each Liquidating Fund its       
Liquidation Plan and determined to recommend that shareholders of each          
Liquidating Fund approve its respective Liquidation Plan.                       

    If shareholders of a Fund do not approve liquidation, the Board of
Directors will meet to determine an alternative course of action. Liquidation of
the Funds is contingent upon consummation of the Merger.                        

SUMMARY OF THE LIQUIDATION PLANS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS                       

     For each Liquidating Fund, such Fund's Liquidation Plan will become
effective upon consummation of the Merger (the "Effective Date"). From the      
Effective Date through the completion of liquidation, VAM LLC will act on an    
interim basis as the investment adviser for each Liquidating Fund. As soon as   
practicable after the Effective Date of a Liquidating Fund's Liquidation Plan,  
such Fund will complete the sale of its portfolio securities in order to convert
its assets to cash. After the Effective Date, such Fund will not engage in any  
business activity except for the purpose of winding up its business and affairs,
preserving the value of its assets and distributing such assets to shareholders 
after the payment to (or reservation of assets for payment to) all creditors of 
the Fund. All contracts entered into by or on behalf of a Liquidating Fund will 
terminate upon consummation of the transactions contemplated by such Fund's     
Liquidation Plan. After the Effective Date of a Liquidating Fund's Liquidation  
Plan, and in any event within 60 days thereafter, such Fund will mail to each   
shareholder of record who has not redeemed such shareholder's shares a          
liquidating distribution equal to the shareholder's proportionate interest in   
the remaining assets of the Fund and information concerning the sources of the  
liquidating distribution. Shareholders of the Liquidating Funds may reinvest    
their redemption proceeds or the proceeds of their liquidating distributions in 
Class A shares of any of the mutual funds in the Delaware Group at net asset    
value without the imposition of any front-end sales charge for a period of one  
year following liquidation of the shareholder's Fund.                           

         After the distribution of assets to shareholders, each Liquidating Fund
will be terminated in accordance with its Liquidation Plan and applicable       
provisions under Minnesota law. The Liquidation Plans provide that the Boards of
Directors may authorize such variations from, or amendments to, the provisions  
of the Liquidation Plans as may be necessary or appropriate to effect the       
complete liquidation and termination of the Liquidating Funds in accordance with
the purposes to be accomplished by the Liquidation Plans.                       

     The adoption of the Liquidation Plan by a Liquidating Fund will not
affect the right of shareholders of such Fund to redeem shares of such Fund at  
their then current net asset value per share any day prior to the day the       
liquidating distribution is made.                                               

FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES                                                 
PAYMENT BY A LIQUIDATING FUND OF LIQUIDATION DISTRIBUTIONS TO 
SHAREHOLDERS WILL BE A TAXABLE EVENT. BECAUSE THE INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES FOR A 
PARTICULAR SHAREHOLDER MAY VARY DEPENDING ON INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCES, EACH     
SHAREHOLDER IS URGED TO CONSULT HIS OR HER OWN TAX ADVISER CONCERNING THE       
FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL TAX CONSEQUENCES OF RECEIPT OF A LIQUIDATING           
DISTRIBUTION.                                                                   

       Each Liquidating Fund currently qualifies, and intends to continue to
qualify through the end of the liquidation period, for treatment as a regulated 
investment company under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, so that 
it will be relieved of federal income tax on any investment company taxable     
income or net capital gain (the excess of net long-term capital gain over net   
short-term capital loss) from the sale of its assets. The payment of liquidation
distributions will be a taxable event to shareholders. Each shareholder will be 
viewed as having sold his or her Fund shares for an amount equal to the         
liquidation distribution(s) he or she receives. Each shareholder will recognize 
gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between (a) the shareholder's 
adjusted basis in the Fund shares, and (b) such liquidation distribution(s). The
gain or loss will be capital gain or loss to the shareholder if the Fund shares 
were capital assets in the shareholder's hands and generally will be long-term  
if the Fund shares were held for more than one year before the liquidation      
distribution is received.                                                       

       Immediately prior to declaring the liquidating distribution, National
Insured Tax Free Fund, National Limited Term Tax Free Fund and National Tax Free
Fund will declare a dividend of all current but undistributed tax-exempt        
interest income. Shareholders will be entitled to treat this amount as an       
exempt-interest dividend, I.E., as tax-exempt interest income in their hands.   
This tax-exempt dividend will be paid at the same time as the liquidating       
distribution, and shareholders will be notified of the portion of the total     
distribution that constitutes the tax-exempt interest dividend. The balance of  
the liquidating distribution will be treated as an amount realized from the sale
of Fund shares, as discussed above.                                             

         Each Liquidating Fund generally will be required to withhold tax at the
rate of 31% with respect to any liquidation distribution paid to individuals and
certain other non-corporate shareholders who fail to certify to the Fund that   
their social security number or taxpayer identification number provided to the  
Fund is correct and that the shareholder is not subject to backup withholding.  

    The foregoing summary is generally limited to the material federal
income tax consequences to shareholders who are individual United States        
citizens and who hold shares as capital assets. It does not address the federal 
income tax consequences to shareholders who are corporations, trusts, estates,  
tax-exempt organizations, pension plans, Individual Retirement Accounts or      
non-resident aliens. This summary does not address state or local tax           
consequences. Shareholders are urged to consult their own tax advisers to       
determine the extent of the federal income tax liability they would incur as a  
result of receiving a liquidation distribution, as well as any tax consequences 
under any applicable state, local or foreign laws.                              

VOTE REQUIRED                                                                   
        EACH LIQUIDATING FUND'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT
SHAREHOLDERS VOTE IN FAVOR OF APPROVAL OF SUCH FUND'S LIQUIDATION PLAN. For each
Liquidating Fund, the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares  
of the Fund is required to approve the Liquidation Plan.                        

 PROPOSAL FIVE
 PROPOSAL FOR GROWTH AND INCOME FUND
TO APPROVE AN AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION
INTRODUCTION                                                                    

       Shareholders of Growth and Income Fund (for purposes of this Proposal
Five, the "Fund") are being asked to consider and vote upon an Agreement and    
Plan of Reorganization, dated as of February 14, 1997 (the "Reorganization
Plan"), by and between Voyageur Mutual Funds III, Inc. ("Voyageur III"), on     
behalf of the Fund, and VAM Institutional Funds, Inc. ("VAM Funds"), on behalf  
of a newly formed series of VAM Funds which is also called Growth and Income    
Fund (the "New Fund"). Pursuant to the Reorganization Plan, all of the assets of
the Fund would be acquired by New Fund (which, prior to such time, would have no
assets) and shareholders of the Fund would become shareholders of New Fund and  
would receive shares in New Fund equal to the value of their holdings in the    
Fund on the date of such transaction (the transactions described above are      
referred to as the "Fund Reorganization"). The shares to be issued by New Fund  
pursuant to the Fund Reorganization ("New Fund Shares") will be issued at net   
asset value without a sales charge. Each Fund shareholder will receive New Fund 
shares that are of the same class as such shareholder's Fund shares (i.e., Class
A, Class B or Class C). A vote in favor of the Reorganization Plan will be      
considered a vote in favor of an amendment to the articles of incorporation of  
Voyageur III required to effect the Fund Reorganization as contemplated by the  
Reorganization Plan. The Fund Reorganization is not contingent upon consummation
of the Merger.                                                                  

BACKGROUND 

         The Fund is currently a series of Voyageur III. Aggressive Growth Fund,
Growth Stock Fund and International Equity Fund are also series of Voyageur III.
As described above, in connection with the Merger, shareholders of Aggressive   
Growth Fund and Growth Stock Fund are being asked to approve new investment     
advisory agreements with DMC, and shareholders of International Equity Fund are 
being asked to approve such Fund's liquidation. In addition, shareholders of    
each series of Voyageur III (including the Fund) are being asked to approve a   
new Board of Directors for Voyageur III that will consist principally of        
individuals who currently serve on the Board of Directors of the investment     
companies in the Delaware Group.                                                

   In negotiating the terms of the Merger, the owners of VFM and DFG
determined that they would prefer to maintain any current rights their companies
have to provide investment advisory or distribution services to the Fund.       
However, in order to do this the Fund must be separated out of the corporate    
entity of which Aggressive Growth Fund, Growth Stock Fund and International     
Equity Fund are series. In order to accomplish this, the Fund Reorganization is 
being recommended. If the Reorganization Plan is approved, it will in essence   
cause the Fund to become, as the New Fund, a series of a different corporate    
entity, VAM Funds. However, this corporate entity will, like Voyageur III, be a 
Minnesota corporation, and will have the same Board of Directors as Voyageur    
III. The provisions of the articles of incorporation of VAM Funds, and the      
rights of shareholders determined thereunder, are substantially the same as     
those of Voyageur III and its shareholders. The Reorganization Plan will not    
result in any other material changes to shareholders. Management of the Fund    
will remain essentially unchanged because VAM LLC (the successor to this portion
of VFM's operations) will continue to manage the Fund and utilize Segall Bryant 
& Hamill ("Segall Bryant") as sub-adviser. See "Comparison of Fund and New
Fund."

THE REORGANIZATION PLAN 

       The terms and conditions under which the Fund Reorganization would be
consummated are set forth in the Reorganization Plan and are summarized below.  
This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Reorganization    
Plan, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit D to this Proxy Statement.         

         The Reorganization Plan provides that (a) the Fund will transfer all of
its assets, including portfolio securities, cash, cash equivalents, securities, 
commodities, futures and interest receivables, to New Fund at the Closing Time  
in exchange for the assumption by New Fund of all of the Fund's liabilities,    
including all expenses, costs, charges and reserves, as reflected on an         
unaudited statement of assets and liabilities of the Fund prepared by the       
Treasurer of Voyageur III as of the Valuation Date in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles consistently applied from the prior audited      
period, and the delivery of New Fund Shares; and (b) such New Fund Shares will  
be distributed to the shareholders of the Fund at the Closing Time or as soon as
practicable thereafter and outstanding Fund shares will be canceled and retired.
The distribution of New Fund Shares and the cancellation and retirement of      
outstanding Fund shares is to be accomplished under the Reorganization Plan by  
amending the articles of incorporation of Voyageur III in the manner provided in
the amendment set forth in Exhibit 1 to the Reorganization Plan.                

  For technical reasons, certain of the Fund's existing investment
limitations may be deemed to preclude the Fund from consummating the Fund       
Reorganization to the extent that the Fund Reorganization would involve the Fund
holding all of its assets as shares of New Fund until such shares are           
distributed to the Fund's shareholders. By approving the Reorganization Plan,   
the Fund's shareholders will be deemed to have agreed to waive each of these    
limitations.                                                                    

        The number of New Fund Shares to be delivered to the Fund will have an
aggregate net asset value equal to the value of the Fund assets acquired by New 
Fund (net of the liabilities assumed by New Fund); these values will be         
calculated as of the close of business of the New York Stock Exchange on a      
business day not later than the fifth business day following the receipt of the 
requisite approval of the Reorganization Plan by the shareholders of the Fund or
at such other time as the Fund and New Fund may agree (the "Valuation Date").   
These New Fund Shares will be distributed to the former Fund shareholders, with 
each such shareholder receiving New Fund Shares of the same class as and with a 
value equal to the value of their Fund shares.                                  

 New Fund will cause its transfer agent to credit and confirm an
appropriate number of New Fund Shares to each Fund shareholder. Neither the Fund
nor New Fund issues stock certificates.                                         

         The Reorganization Plan provides that no sales charges will be incurred
by Fund shareholders in connection with the acquisition by them of New Fund     
shares pursuant to the Reorganization Plan. The Reorganization Plan also        
provides that former holders of Fund shares will receive credit for the period  
they held such shares in determining any contingent deferred sales charge       
applicable upon redemption of their New Fund Shares and in determining the date 
upon which New Fund Class B Shares convert to New Fund Class A Shares.          

    The Closing Time will be 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on the Valuation
Date, or at such other time as the Fund and New Fund may agree. The consummation
of the Fund Reorganization is contingent upon the approval of the Reorganization
Plan by the shareholders of the Fund and the receipt of the other opinions and  
certificates set forth in Sections 6, 7 and 8 of the Reorganization Plan and the
occurrence of the events described in those Sections, certain of which may be   
waived by the Fund or New Fund. The Reorganization Plan may be amended in any   
mutually agreeable manner, except that no amendment may be made subsequent to   
the Meeting which would detrimentally affect the value of the New Fund Shares to
be distributed. LNC will bear all direct costs associated with preparation,     
printing, filing and proxy solicitation expenses incurred in connection with    
obtaining requisite shareholder approval of the Fund Reorganization. In         
addition, VFM will pay any unamortized organizational expenses on the books of  
the Fund immediately prior to the Fund Reorganization.                          

       The Reorganization Plan may be terminated and the Fund Reorganization
abandoned at any time, before or after approval by the Fund's shareholders, by  
mutual consent of the Fund and New Fund. In addition, either party may terminate
the Reorganization Plan upon the occurrence of a material breach of the         
Reorganization Plan by the other party or if, by July 1, 1997, any condition set
forth in the Reorganization Plan has not been fulfilled or waived by the party  
entitled to its benefits.                                                       

   Shareholders of the Fund will continue to be able to redeem their
shares at net asset value next determined after receipt of the redemption       
request until the close of business on the business day next preceding the      
Closing Date. Redemption requests received by the Fund thereafter will be       
treated as requests for redemption of shares of New Fund.                       

TAX ASPECTS OF THE REORGANIZATION                                               

      It is intended that the Fund Reorganization will qualify for federal
income tax purposes as a tax-free reorganization under Section 368(a)(1)(F) of  
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and that, for       
federal income tax purposes, no income, gain or loss will be recognized by the  
Fund's shareholders. The Fund has not asked, nor does it plan to ask, the       
Internal Revenue Service to rule on the tax consequences of the Fund            
Reorganization.                                                                 

         As a condition to the closing of the Fund Reorganization, the two funds
will receive an opinion from Dorsey & Whitney LLP, counsel to the funds, based  
in part on certain representations to be furnished by each fund, substantially  
to the effect that the federal income tax consequences of the Fund              
Reorganization will be as follows:                                              

                (i) the Fund Reorganization will constitute a reorganization
      within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(F) of the Code, and New Fund
      and the Fund each will qualify as a party to the Fund Reorganization
under Section 368(b) of the Code;                             

                 (ii) Fund shareholders will recognize no income, gain or loss
        upon receipt, pursuant to the Fund Reorganization, of New Fund shares.
  Fund shareholders subject to taxation will recognize income upon
       receipt of any net investment income or net capital gains of the Fund
     which are distributed by the Fund prior to the Fund Reorganization;

                (iii) the tax basis of New Fund shares received by each Fund
      shareholder pursuant to the Fund Reorganization will be equal to the
tax basis of the Fund shares exchanged therefor;              

               (iv) the holding period of New Fund shares received by each
       Fund shareholder pursuant to the Fund Reorganization will include the
         period during which the Fund shareholder held the Fund shares exchanged
         therefor, provided that the Fund shares were held as a capital asset on
the date of the Fund Reorganization;                          

          (v) the Fund will recognize no income, gain or loss by
reason of the Fund Reorganization;                            

           (vi) New Fund will recognize no income, gain or loss by
reason of the Fund Reorganization;                            

          (vii) the tax basis of the assets received by the Fund
      pursuant to the Fund Reorganization will be the same as the basis of
     those assets in the hands of the Fund immediately prior to the Fund
Reorganization;                                               

                (viii) the holding period of the assets received by New Fund
    pursuant to the Fund Reorganization will include the period during
which such assets were held by the Fund; and                  

           (ix) New Fund will succeed to and take into account the
       earnings and profits, or deficit in earnings and profits, of the Fund
immediately prior to the Fund Reorganization.                 

    The foregoing advice is based in part upon certain representations
furnished by the Fund, VFM and certain 5% shareholders of the Fund, of which two
principal ones are: (a) immediately following consummation of the Fund          
Reorganization, the shareholders of the Fund will own all of the outstanding    
stock of the New Fund and will own such stock solely by reason of their         
ownership of stock of the Fund immediately prior to the Fund Reorganization; and
(b) there is no plan or intention on the part of shareholders of the Fund who   
own 5% or more of the shares of the Fund and, to the best knowledge of          
management of the Fund, there is no plan or intention on the part of the        
remaining shareholders of the Fund to sell, exchange or otherwise dispose of any
of the shares of the New Fund stock received in the Fund Reorganization.        

      SHAREHOLDERS OF THE FUND SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS REGARDING
THE EFFECT, IF ANY, OF THE PROPOSED FUND REORGANIZATION IN LIGHT OF THEIR       
INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCES. SINCE THE FOREGOING DISCUSSION RELATES ONLY TO THE    
FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE FUND REORGANIZATION, SHAREHOLDERS OF THE 
FUND SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS AS TO STATE AND LOCAL TAX CONSEQUENCES,  
IF ANY, OF THE FUND REORGANIZATION.                                             
DISSENTERS' RIGHTS                                                              

      Pursuant to Sections 302A.471 and 302A.473 of the Minnesota Business
Corporation Act (the "MBCA Sections"), record holders of Fund shares are        
entitled to assert dissenters' rights in connection with the Fund Reorganization
and obtain payment of the "fair value" of their shares, provided such           
shareholders comply with the requirements of the MBCA Sections. NOTWITHSTANDING 
THE PROVISIONS OF THE MBCA SECTIONS, THE DIVISION OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT OF   
THE COMMISSION HAS TAKEN THE POSITION THAT ADHERENCE TO STATE APPRAISAL         
PROCEDURES BY A REGISTERED INVESTMENT COMPANY ISSUING REDEEMABLE SECURITIES     
WOULD CONSTITUTE A VIOLATION OF RULE 22C-1 UNDER THE 1940 ACT. THIS RULE        
PROVIDES THAT NO OPEN-END INVESTMENT COMPANY MAY REDEEM ITS SHARES OTHER THAN AT
NET ASSET VALUE NEXT COMPUTED AFTER RECEIPT OF A TENDER OF SUCH SECURITY FOR    
REDEMPTION. IT IS THE VIEW OF THE DIVISION OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT THAT RULE   
22C-1 PREEMPTS APPRAISAL PROVISIONS IN STATE STATUTES.                          

      It should be emphasized that, as usual, Fund shareholders may redeem
their shares at net asset value at any time prior to the Closing Date in        
accordance with the redemption procedures set forth in the Fund's Prospectus.   

DESCRIPTION OF SHARES                                                           

     Shares of New Fund to be issued pursuant to the Reorganization Plan
will, when issued, be fully paid and nonassessable by New Fund and transferable 
without restrictions and will have no preemptive or conversion rights.          

COMPARISON OF FUND AND NEW FUND 

      INVESTMENT ADVISER AND SUB-ADVISER. VAM, on behalf of New Fund, will
enter into an investment advisory agreement with VAM LLC. The terms of such     
advisory agreement will be substantially identical to the terms of the Fund's   
current investment advisory agreement with VFM. As described above, prior to the
Merger DFG will complete a reorganization whereby certain assets of DFG and its 
subsidiaries, including certain assets of VFM, will be sold by DFG to certain   
newly organized limited liability companies, including VAM LLC. These limited   
liability companies will not be acquired by LNC in the Merger. The ultimate     
ownership and control of VAM LLC will remain with the same individuals who      
currently control VFM, namely, Michael E. Dougherty, James O. Pohlad, Robert C. 
Pohlad and William M. Pohlad. It is expected that those individuals who         
currently serve as the principal executive officer and the directors of VFM     
will, with the exception of Frank C. Tonnemaker, serve in similar capacities    
with VAM LLC after the merger. See "Supplemental Information about Voyageur Fund
Managers, Inc." VAM LLC in turn will enter into a sub-advisory agreement with   
Segall Bryant, the Fund's current sub-adviser, containing substantially         
identical terms to the current sub-advisory agreement between VFM and Segall    
Bryant. Ralph Segall, Managing Director of Segall Bryant, who is primarily      
responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund's portfolio, will continue
to act in such capacity for New Fund. A vote in favor of the Fund Reorganization
will be deemed a vote to authorize the Fund (as the sole shareholder of New Fund
Shares on the date of the Fund Reorganization) to vote in favor of both a new   
advisory agreement between the New Fund and VAM LLC and a new sub-advisory      
agreement between VAM LLC and Segall Bryant.                                    

    The Fund Reorganization is not contingent upon consummation of the
Merger. Thus, in the event shareholders approve the Fund Reorganization and the 
Merger is not consummated, the Fund may enter into an advisory agreement with   
VFM, rather than VAM LLC, which would in turn enter into a sub-advisory         
agreement with Segall Bryant.                                                   

  INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES, POLICIES AND RESTRICTIONS. The investment
objectives, policies and restrictions of New Fund will be identical to those of 
the Fund.                                                                       

        DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS. As mentioned above, the Directors of
VAM Funds are the same as the current Directors of Voyageur III. The officers of
VAM Funds are the same individuals as listed below under "Executive Officers of
Voyageur Funds." However, Mr. McCullagh and Ms. Howell will resign as officers  
of VAM Funds immediately prior to the Merger.                                   

       PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION; PRINCIPAL UNDERWRITER. The Plan of Distribution
for New Fund will be substantially identical to the Fund's current Plan of      
Distribution. VFD acts as the principal underwriter of the Fund's shares.       
Dougherty Dawkins LLC, one of the limited liability companies to be formed in   
the reorganization of DFG, will act as the principal underwriter of New Fund's  
shares.                                                                         

    DIVIDEND DISBURSING, TRANSFER, ADMINISTRATIVE AND ACCOUNT SERVICES
AGENT. VFM acts as the Fund's dividend disbursing, transfer, administrative and 
account services agent pursuant to an administrative services agreement. VAM LLC
will act in such capacities for New Fund pursuant to an administrative services 
agreement that will have substantially identical terms to the current agreement 
between VFM and the Fund. VAM LLC may contract with third parties to provide    
some of these services.                                                         

THE BOARD'S CONSIDERATIONS                                                      

         At a meeting of the Board of Directors of Voyageur III held on February
7, 1997, VFM reviewed the proposed Reorganization Plan with the Board. In       
reviewing the Reorganization Plan the Board considered the various factors      
discussed above, including the following:                                       

                 (a) The Fund is currently a series of a corporate entity that
        will become a part of the Delaware Group, whereas the Fund will not be
advised by DMC or its affiliates;                             

                  (b) The Reorganization Plan will result in no material changes
      to shareholders other than a change in the corporate entity of which
       their fund is a series, and will allow their fund to be a series of a
corporate entity that will be advised by VAM LLC;             

                (c) The Board of Directors of VAM Funds will not change as a
result of the Merger and will continue to consist of the same 
       individuals who currently serve on the Board of Directors of Voyageur
III;                                                          

           (d) It is anticipated that the Fund Reorganization will
       constitute a tax-free reorganization for federal income tax purposes,
        and no gain or loss will be recognized by the Fund or its shareholders
         for federal income tax purposes as a result of the Fund Reorganization.

     Based on the foregoing, at a meeting held on February 14, 1997, the
Board determined that the Fund Reorganization is in the best interests of the   
shareholders of the Fund and that the interests of Fund shareholders will not be
diluted as a result thereof, and therefore approved the Reorganization Plan.    

VOTE REQUIRED                                                                   
         THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF VOYAGEUR III UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT FUND
SHAREHOLDERS VOTE IN FAVOR OF APPROVAL OF THE REORGANIZATION PLAN. The          
affirmative vote of a majority of the Fund shares entitled to vote is required  
to approve the Reorganization Plan.

 SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS

As series of Minnesota corporations (or, in some instances,   
Massachusetts business trusts), the Funds are not required to hold annual       
shareholder meetings. Since the Funds do not hold regular meetings of           
shareholders, the anticipated date of the next shareholder meeting cannot be    
provided. Any shareholder proposal which may properly be included in the proxy  
solicitation material for a special shareholder meeting must be received by the 
Fund no later than four months prior to the date proxy materials are mailed to  
shareholders.

 INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT

               This Agreement, made this ___ day of ________, 1997, by and
between ___________ Funds, Inc., a Minnesota corporation (the "Company"), on    
behalf of each Fund represented by a series of shares of common stock of the    
Fund that adopts this Agreement (each a "Fund" and, collectively, the "Funds")  
(the Funds, together with the date each Fund adopts this Agreement, are set     
forth in Exhibit A hereto, which shall be updated from time to time to reflect  
additions, deletions or other changes thereto), and [Voyageur Fund Managers,    
Inc.] [Delaware Management Company, Inc.], a _________ corporation ("Adviser"), 

WITNESSETH:                                 
1.  INVESTMENT ADVISORY SERVICES.           

                  (a) The Company hereby engages Adviser on behalf of the Funds,
and Adviser hereby agrees to act, as investment adviser for, and to manage the  
investment of the assets of, the Funds.                                         

              (b) The investment of the assets of each Fund shall at all
times be subject to the applicable provisions of the Articles of Incorporation, 
the Bylaws, the Registration Statement, and the current Prospectus and the      
Statement of Additional Information, if any, of the Company and each Fund and   
shall conform to the policies and purposes of each Fund as set forth in such    
documents and as interpreted from time to time by the Board of Directors of the 
Company. Within the framework of the investment policies of each Fund, and      
subject to such other limitations and directions as the Board of Directors may  
from time to time prescribe, Adviser shall have the sole and exclusive          
responsibility for the management of each Fund's assets and the making and      
execution of all investment decisions for each Fund, except as set forth in the 
following paragraph. Adviser shall report to the Board of Directors regularly at
such times and in such detail as the Board may from time to time determine      
appropriate, in order to permit the Board to determine the adherence of Adviser 
to the investment policies of the Funds.                                        

                 (c) Adviser may, at its expense, select and contract with one
or more registered investment advisers ("Sub-Adviser") for any of the Funds to  
perform some or all of the services for such Funds. Such Sub-Adviser shall be   
responsible for executing orders for the purchase and sale of portfolio         
securities. Adviser will compensate any Sub-Adviser for its services to the     
Funds. Adviser may terminate the services of any Sub-Adviser at any time in its 
sole discretion, and shall at such time assume the responsibilities of such     
Sub-Adviser unless and until a successor Sub-Adviser is selected.               

             (d) Adviser shall, at its own expense, furnish all office
facilities, equipment and personnel necessary to discharge its responsibilities 
and duties hereunder. Adviser shall arrange, if requested by the Company, for   
officers or employees of Adviser to serve without compensation from any Fund as 
directors, officers, or employees of the Company if duly elected to such        
positions by the shareholders or directors of the Company (as required by law). 

                  (e) Adviser hereby acknowledges that all records pertaining to
each Fund's investments are the property of the Company, and in the event that a
transfer of investment advisory services to someone other than Adviser should   
ever occur, Adviser will promptly, and at its own cost, take all steps necessary
to segregate such records and deliver them to the Company.                      

              (f) Subject to the primary objective of obtaining the best
available prices and execution, Adviser will place orders for the purchase and  
sale of portfolio securities with such broker/dealers who provide statistical,  
factual and financial information and services to the Funds, Adviser or to any  
other fund for which Adviser provides investment advisory services and/or with  
broker/dealers who sell shares of the Funds or who sell shares of any other fund
for which Adviser provides investment advisory services. Broker/dealers who sell
shares of the funds of which Adviser is investment manager, shall only receive  
orders for the purchase or sale of portfolio securities to the extent that the  
placing of such orders is in compliance with the Rules of the Securities and    
Exchange Commission and the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.    

                 (g) Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (f) above,
and subject to such policies and procedures as may be adopted by the Board of   
Directors and officers of the Company, Adviser may ask the Funds and the Funds  
may agree to pay a member of an exchange, broker or dealer an amount of         
commission for effecting a securities transaction in excess of the amount of    
commission another member of an exchange, broker or dealer would have charged   
for effecting that transaction, in such instances where it and Adviser have     
determined in good faith that such amount of commission was reasonable in       
relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such   
member, broker or dealer, viewed in terms of either that particular transaction 
or Adviser's overall responsibilities with respect to the Funds and to other    
funds and other advisory accounts for which Adviser exercises investment        
discretion.                                                                     

2.  COMPENSATION FOR SERVICES.              

                  In payment for the investment advisory and management services
to be rendered by Adviser hereunder, each Fund shall pay to Adviser a monthly   
fee, which fee shall be paid to Adviser not later than the fifth business day of
the month following the month in which said services were rendered. The monthly 
fee payable by each Fund shall be as set forth in Exhibit A hereto, which may be
updated from time to time to reflect amendments, if any, to Exhibit A. The      
monthly fee payable by each Fund shall be based on the average of the net asset 
values of all of the issued and outstanding shares of the Fund as determined as 
of the close of each business day of the month pursuant to the Articles of      
Incorporation, Bylaws, and currently effective Prospectus and Statement of      
Additional Information of the Company and the Fund. For purposes of calculating 
each Fund's average daily net assets, as such term is used in this Agreement,   
each Fund's net assets shall equal its total assets minus (a) its total         
liabilities and (b) its net orders receivable from dealers.                     

3. ALLOCATION OF EXPENSES.                  

                  (a) In addition to the fee described in Section 2 hereof, each
Fund shall pay all its costs and expenses which are not assumed by Adviser.     
These Fund expenses include, by way of example, but not by way of limitation,   
all expenses incurred in the operation of the Fund and any public offering of   
its shares, including, among others, Rule 12b-1 plan of distribution fees (if   
any), interest, taxes, brokerage fees and commissions, fees of the directors who
are not employees of Adviser or the principal underwriter of the Fund's shares  
(the "Underwriter"), or any of their affiliates, expenses of directors' and     
shareholders' meetings, including the cost of printing and mailing proxies,     
expenses of insurance premiums for fidelity and other coverage, expenses of     
redemption of shares, expenses of issue and sale of shares (to the extent not   
borne by the Underwriter under its agreement with the Fund), expenses of        
printing and mailing stock certificates representing shares of the Fund,        
association membership dues, charges of custodians, transfer agents, dividend   
disbursing agents, accounting services agents, investor servicing agents, and   
bookkeeping, auditing, and legal expenses. Each Fund will also pay the fees and 
bear the expense of registering and maintaining the registration of the Fund and
its shares with the Securities and Exchange Commission and registering or       
qualifying its shares under state or other securities laws and the expense of   
preparing and mailing prospectuses and reports to shareholders.                 

                  (b) The Underwriter shall bear all advertising and promotional
expenses in connection with the distribution of each Fund's shares, including   
paying for prospectuses for new shareholders, except as provided in the         
following sentence. No Fund shall use any of its assets to finance costs        
incurred in connection with the distribution of its shares except pursuant to a 
Plan of Distribution, if any, adopted pursuant to Rule 12b-1 under the          
Investment Company Act of 1940 (as amended, the "1940 Act").                    

4.  FREEDOM TO DEAL WITH THIRD PARTIES.     

                 Adviser shall be free to render services to others similar to
those rendered under this Agreement or of a different nature except as such     
services may conflict with the services to be rendered or the duties to be      
assumed hereunder.                                                              

5.  REPORTS TO DIRECTORS OF THE FUND.       

                  Appropriate officers of Adviser shall provide the directors of
the Company with such information as is required by any plan of distribution    
adopted by the Company on behalf of any Fund pursuant to Rule 12b-1 under the   
1940 Act.                                                                       

6.  STANDARD OF CARE.                       

           In the absence of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross
negligence or a reckless disregard of the performance of duties of the Adviser  
to the Funds, the Adviser shall not be subject to liabilities of the Funds or to
any shareholders of the Funds for any action or omission in the course of, or   
connected with, rendering services hereunder or for any losses that may be      
sustained in the purchase, holding or sale of any security, or otherwise.       

              7.  EFFECTIVE DATE, DURATION AND TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT.

                 (a) The effective date of this Agreement with respect to each
Fund shall be the date set forth on Exhibit A hereto.                           

              (b) Unless sooner terminated as hereinafter provided, this
Agreement shall continue in effect with respect to each Fund for a period of two
years from the date of its execution, and thereafter shall continue in effect   
only so long as such continuance is specifically approved at least annually by  
(i) the Board of Directors of the Company or by the vote of a majority of the   
outstanding voting securities of the applicable Fund, and (ii) by the vote of a 
majority of the directors of the Company who are not parties to this Agreement  
or "interested persons", as defined in the 1940 Act, of Adviser or of the       
Company cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such    
approval.                                                                       

                 (c) This Agreement may be terminated with respect to any Fund
at any time, without the payment of any penalty, by the Board of Directors of   
the Company or by the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of
such Fund, or by Adviser, upon 60 days' written notice to the other party.      

                 (d) This agreement shall terminate automatically in the event
of its "assignment" (as defined in the 1940 Act).                               

              (e) No amendment to this Agreement shall be effective with
respect to any Fund until approved by the vote of: (i) a majority of the        
directors of the Company who are not parties to this Agreement or "interested   
persons" (as defined in the 1940 Act) of Adviser or of the Company cast in      
person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such approval; and (ii) 
a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the applicable Fund.         

           (f) Wherever referred to in this Agreement, the vote or
approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding voting securities or   
shares of a Fund shall mean the lesser of (i) the vote of 67% or more of the    
voting securities of such Fund present at a regular or special meeting of       
shareholders duly called, if more than 50% of the Fund's outstanding voting     
securities are present or represented by proxy, or (ii) the vote of more than   
50% of the outstanding voting securities of such Fund.                          

8.  NOTICES.

SUB-ADVISORY AGREEMENT

              Agreement, dated __________, 1997, by and between Delaware
Management Company, Inc. (the "Adviser"), a _______________________ corporation,
and Voyageur Asset Management LLC, a Minnesota limited liability company        
("Sub-Adviser").                                                                

         WHEREAS, Voyageur Mutual Funds III, Inc., a Minnesota
corporation (the"Company"), on behalf of its Growth Stock Fund, a separately    
managed series of the Company (the "Fund"), has appointed Adviser as the Fund's 
investment adviser pursuant to an Investment Advisory Agreement dated ________, 
1997 (the "Advisory Agreement"); and                                            

             WHEREAS, pursuant to the terms of the Advisory Agreement,
Adviser desires to appoint Sub-Adviser as its sub-adviser for the Fund, and     
Sub-Adviser is willing to act in such capacity upon the terms set forth herein; 
and                                                                             

                 WHEREAS, pursuant to the terms of the Advisory Agreement, the
Company has approved the appointment of Sub-Adviser as Sub-Adviser for the      
Fund.                                                                           

             NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements
herein made, Adviser and Sub-Adviser agree as follows:                          

                 1. Adviser hereby employs Sub-Adviser to serve as sub-adviser
for, and to manage the investment of the assets of, the Fund as set forth       
herein. Sub-Adviser hereby accepts such employment and agrees, for the          
compensation herein provided, to assume all obligations herein set forth and to 
bear all expenses of its performance of such obligations (but no other          
expenses). Sub-Adviser shall not be required to pay expenses of the Fund,       
including, but not limited to (a) brokerage and commission expenses; (b)        
federal, state, local and foreign taxes, including issue and transfer taxes     
incurred by or levied on the Fund; (c) interest charges on borrowings; (d) the  
Fund's organizational and offering expenses, whether or not advanced by Adviser;
(e) the cost of other personnel providing services to the Fund; (f) fees and    
expenses of registering or otherwise qualifying the shares of the Fund under    
applicable state securities laws; (g) expenses of printing and distributing     
reports to shareholders; (h) costs of shareholders' meetings and proxy          
solicitation; (i) charges and expenses of the Fund's custodian and registrar,   
transfer agent and dividend disbursing agent; (j) compensation of the Company's 
officers, directors and employees that are not Affiliated Persons or Interested 
Persons (as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Investment Company Act of 1940,  
as amended (the "1940 Act") and the rules, regulations and releases relating    
thereto) of Adviser; (k) legal and auditing expenses; (l) costs of certificates 
representing common shares of the Fund; (m) costs of stationery and supplies;   
(n) insurance expenses; (o) association membership dues; (p) the fees and       
expenses of registering the Fund and its shares with the Securities and Exchange
Commission; (q) travel expenses of officers and employees of Sub-Adviser to the 
extent such expenses relate to the attendance of such persons at meetings at the
request of the Board of Directors of the Company; and (r) all other charges and 
costs of the Fund's operation unless otherwise explicitly provided herein.      
Sub-Adviser shall for all purposes herein be deemed to be an independent        
contractor and shall, except as expressly provided or authorized (whether herein
or otherwise) have no authority to act for or on behalf of the Fund in any way  
or otherwise be deemed an agent of the Fund.                                    

         2. Sub-Adviser shall direct the Fund's investments in
accordance with applicable law and the investment objective, policies and       
restrictions set forth in the Fund's then-effective Registration Statement under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, including the Prospectus and Statement  
of Additional Information of the Fund contained therein, subject to the super   
vision of the Company, its officers and directors, and Adviser and in accordance
with the investment objectives, policies and restrictions from time to time     
prescribed by the Board of Directors of the Company and communicated by Adviser 
to Sub-Adviser and subject to such further limitations as Adviser may from time 
to time impose by written notice to Sub-Adviser.                                

             3. Sub-Adviser shall formulate and implement a continuing
program for managing the investment of the Fund's assets, and shall amend and   
update such program from time to time as financial and other economic conditions
warrant. Sub-Adviser shall make all determinations with respect to managing the 
investment of the Fund's assets and shall take such steps as may be necessary to
implement the same, including the placement of purchase and sale orders on      
behalf of the Fund.                                                             

           4. Sub-Adviser shall furnish such reports to Adviser as
Adviser may reasonably request for Adviser's use in discharging its obligations 
under the Advisory Agreement, which reports may be distributed by Adviser to the
Company's Board of Directors at periodic meetings of the Board of Directors and 
at such other times as may be reasonably requested by the Board of Directors.   
Copies of all such reports shall be furnished to Adviser for examination and    
review within a reasonable time prior to the presentation of such reports to    
Company's Board of Directors.                                                   

                 5. Sub-Adviser shall select the brokers and dealers that will
execute the purchases and sales of securities for the Fund and markets on or in 
which such transactions will be executed and shall place, in the name of the    
Fund or its nominee, all such orders.                                           

              (a) Subject to the primary objective of obtaining the best
                 available prices and execution, Sub-Adviser will place orders
               for the purchase and sale of portfolio securities with such
                 broker/dealers who provide statistical, factual and financial
               information and services to the Fund, Sub-Adviser or to any
                 other fund for which Sub-Adviser provides investment advisory
              services and/or with broker/dealers who sell shares of the
       Fund or who sell shares of any other fund for which
      Sub-Adviser provides investment advisory services.
         Broker/dealers who sell shares of the funds for which
                Sub-Adviser provides investment advisory services shall only
        receive orders for the purchase or sale of portfolio
                  securities to the extent that the placing of such orders is in
            compliance with the Rules of the Securities and Exchange
                  Commission and the National Association of Securities Dealers,
Inc.                                        

                 (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (a) above,
                 and subject to such policies and procedures as may be adopted
          by the Board of Directors and officers of the Company,
                Sub-Adviser may ask the Fund and the Fund may agree to pay a
        member of an exchange, broker or dealer an amount of
                  commission for effecting a securities transaction in excess of
                  the amount of commission another member of an exchange, broker
                or dealer would have charged for effecting that transaction,
              in such instances where Sub-Adviser has determined in good
          faith that such amount of commission was reasonable in
                relation to the value of the brokerage and research services
                 provided by such member, broker or dealer, viewed in terms of
               either that particular transaction or Sub-Adviser's overall
                responsibilities with respect to the Fund and to other funds
               and other advisory accounts for which Sub-Adviser exercises
investment discretion.                      

                  (c) It is understood that certain other clients of Sub-Adviser
          may have investment objectives and policies similar to
             those of the Fund, and that Sub-Adviser may, from time to
                  time, make recommendations that result in the purchase or sale
                of a particular security by its other clients simultaneously
             with the Fund. If transactions on behalf of more than one
         client during the same period increase the demand for
                securities being purchased or the supply of securities being
                 sold, there may be an adverse effect on price or quantity. In
   such event, Sub-Adviser shall allocate advisory
                 recommendations and the placing of orders in a manner that is
             deemed equitable by Sub-Adviser to the accounts involved,
          including the Fund. When two or more of the clients of
                  Sub-Adviser (including the Fund) are purchasing or selling the
                same security on a given day from the same broker or dealer,
  such transactions may be averaged as to price.

            (d) Sub-Adviser agrees that it will not purchase or sell
           securities for the Fund in any transaction in which it,
                 Adviser or any "affiliated person" of the Company, Adviser or
            Sub-Adviser or any affiliated person of such "affiliated
           person" is acting as principal; provided, however, that
              Sub-Adviser may effect transactions pursuant to Rule 17a-7
    under the 1940 Act in compliance with the Fund's
         then-effective policies concerning such transactions.

                 (e) Sub-Adviser agrees that it will not execute any portfolio
                transactions for the Fund with a broker or dealer or futures
              commission-merchant which is an "affiliated person" of the
                Company, Adviser or Sub-Adviser or an "affiliated person" of
                 such an "affiliated person" without the prior written consent
                 of Adviser. In effecting any such transactions with the prior
             written consent of Adviser, Sub-Adviser shall comply with
                 Section 17(e)(1) of the 1940 Act, other applicable provisions
            of the 1940 Act, if any, the then-effective Registration
              Statement of the Fund under the Securities Act of 1933, as
                  amended and the Fund's then-effective policies concerning such
transactions.                               

                 (f) Sub-Adviser shall promptly communicate to Adviser and, if
              requested by Adviser, to the Company's Board of Directors,
                  such information relating to portfolio transactions as Adviser
                may reasonably request. The parties understand that the Fund
               shall bear all brokerage commissions in connection with the
                purchases and sales of portfolio securities for the Fund and
               all ordinary and reasonable transaction costs in connection
               with purchases of such securities in private placements and
subsequent sales thereof.                   

             6. Sub-Adviser may (at its cost except as contemplated by
paragraph 5 of this Agreement) employ, retain or otherwise avail itself of the  
services and facilities of persons and entities within its own organization or  
any other organization for the purpose of providing Sub-Adviser, Adviser or the 
Fund with such information, advice or assistance, including but not limited to  
advice regarding economic factors and trends and advice as to transactions in   
specific securities, as Sub-Adviser may deem necessary, appropriate or          
convenient for the discharge of its obligations hereunder or otherwise helpful  
to Adviser or the Fund, or in the discharge of Sub-Adviser's overall            
responsibilities with respect to the other accounts for which it serves as      
investment manager or investment adviser.                                       

             7. Sub-Adviser shall cooperate with and make available to
Adviser, the Fund and any agents engaged by the Fund, Sub-Adviser's expertise   
relating to matters affecting the Fund.                                         

                8. For the services to be rendered under this Agreement, and
the facilities to be furnished for each fiscal year of the Fund, Adviser shall  
pay to Sub-Adviser a monthly management fee at the annual rate of .50% of the   
Fund's average daily net assets. This fee will be computed based on net assets  
at the beginning of each day and will be paid to Sub-Adviser monthly on or      
before the fifteenth day of the month next succeeding the month for which the   
fee is paid. The fee shall be prorated for any fraction of a fiscal year at the 
commencement and termination of this Agreement.                                 

                Pursuant to the Advisory Agreement, Adviser receives monthly
from the Fund compensation at the annual rate of 1.00% of the Fund's average    
daily net assets. If Adviser has undertaken in the Fund's Registration Statement
as filed under the 1940 Act or elsewhere to waive all or part of its fee under  
the Advisory Agreement or to reduce such fee upon order of the Board of         
Directors or the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the 
Fund, Sub-Adviser's fee payable under this Agreement will be proportionately    
waived.                                                                         

         9.  Sub-Adviser represents, warrants and agrees that:

                  (a) Sub-Adviser is registered as an "investment adviser" under
               the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Advisers Act") and is
              currently in compliance and shall at all times continue to
                comply with the requirements imposed upon it by Advisers Act
                 and other applicable laws and regulations. Sub-Adviser agrees
            to (i) supply Adviser with such documents as Adviser may
                reasonably request to document compliance with such laws and
          regulations and (ii) immediately notify Adviser of the
              occurrence of any event which would disqualify Sub-Adviser
                  from serving as an investment adviser of an investment company
 pursuant to any applicable law or regulation.

               (b) Sub-Adviser will maintain, keep current and preserve on
                  behalf of the Company all records required or permitted by the
            1940 Act in the manner provided by such Act. Sub-Adviser
                 agrees that such records are the property of the Company, and
             will be surrendered to the Company promptly upon request.

         (c) Sub-Adviser will complete such reports concerning
                purchases or sales of securities on behalf of Sub-Adviser as
                Adviser may from time to time require to document compliance
               with the 1940 Act, Advisers Act, the Internal Revenue Code,
                  applicable state securities laws and other applicable laws and
                 regulations or regulatory and taxing authorities in countries
other than the United States.               

                (d) After filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission
            any amendment to its Form ADV, Sub-Adviser will promptly
furnish a copy of such amendment to Adviser.

          (e) Sub-Adviser will immediately notify Adviser of the
              occurrence of any event which would disqualify Sub-Adviser
                  from serving as an investment adviser of an investment company
                 pursuant to Section 9 of the 1940 Act or any other applicable
statute or regulation.                      

      10.  Adviser represents, warrants and agrees that:

                (a) It has been duly authorized by the Board of Directors of
               the Company to delegate to Sub-Adviser the provision of the
services contemplated hereby.               

               (b) Adviser and the Company are currently in compliance and
               shall at all times continue to comply with the requirements
              imposed upon Adviser and the Company by applicable law and
regulations.                                

                11. Sub-Adviser will not be liable for any error of judgment
or mistake of law or for any loss suffered by the Fund or its shareholders in   
connection with the performance of its duties under this Agreement, except a    
loss resulting from willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence on its   
part in the performance of its duties or from reckless disregard by it of its   
duties under this Agreement.                                                    

                  12. This Agreement shall become effective as of the date first
set forth above. Wherever referred to in this Agreement, the vote or approval of
the holders of a majority of the outstanding voting securities or shares of the 
Fund shall mean the vote of 67% or more of such shares if the holders of more   
than 50% of such shares are present in person or by proxy or the vote of more   
than 50% of such shares, whichever is less.                                     

          Unless sooner terminated as hereinafter provided, this
Agreement shall continue in effect for a period of two years from the date of   
its execution, and thereafter shall continue in effect only so long as such     
continuance is specifically approved at least annually (a) by the Board of      
Directors of the Company or by the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting 
securities of the Fund, and (b) by the vote of a majority of the directors who  
are not parties to this Agreement or Interested Persons of Adviser, Sub-Adviser 
or the Company, cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on 
such approval.                                                                  

            This Agreement may be terminated at any time without the
payment of any penalty (a) by the vote of the Board of Directors of the Company 
or by the vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding voting securities
of the Fund, upon 60 days' written notice to Adviser and the Sub-Adviser, or (b)
by Adviser, upon 60 days' written notice to the Sub-Adviser; or (c) by the      
Sub-Adviser, upon 60 days' written notice to Adviser. This Agreement shall      
automatically terminate in the event of its assignment as defined in the 1940   
Act and the rules thereunder, provided, however, that such automatic termination
shall be prevented in a particular case by an order of exemption from the       
Securities and Exchange Commission or a no-action letter of the staff of the    
Commission to the effect that such assignment does not require termination as a 
statutory or regulatory matter. This Agreement shall automatically terminate    
upon completion of the dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Fund.      

                  13. No amendment to or modification of this Agreement shall be
effective unless and until approved by the vote of a majority of the outstanding
shares of the Fund.                                                             

              14. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure to the
benefit of, Adviser and Sub-Adviser, and their respective successors.           

                15. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held or made
invalid by a court decision, statute, rule or otherwise, the remainder of this  
Agreement shall not be affected thereby.                                        

            16. To the extent that state law is not preempted by the
provisions of any law of the United States heretofore or hereafter enacted, as  
the same may be amended from time to time, this Agreement shall be administered,
construed and enforced according to the laws of the State of Minnesota.         

           IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this
instrument to be executed by their officers thereunto duly authorized in

   The following Plan of Liquidation and Termination (the "Plan") of
________________ Fund (the "Fund"), one of ___ series of ________ Funds, Inc.   
(the "Company"), a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the     
state of Minnesota, which has operated as an open-end management investment     
company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the    
"Investment Company Act"), is intended to accomplish the complete liquidation   
and termination of the Fund in conformity with the provisions of the Company's  
Articles of Incorporation and ByLaws, and Minnesota law.                        

         WHEREAS, the Company's Board of Directors (the "Board") has deemed that
it is advisable and in the best interest of the Fund and its shareholders to    
liquidate and terminate the Fund, and the Board, on February 7 and February 14,
1997, considered the matter and determined to recommend the liquidation and     
termination of the Fund pursuant to this Plan;                                  

      NOW, THEREFORE, the liquidation and termination of the Fund shall be
carried out in the manner hereinafter set forth:                                

1. EFFECTIVE DATE OF PLAN. This Plan shall be effective upon  
consummation of the merger of a wholly owned subsidiary of Lincoln National     
Corporation ("LNC") with and into Dougherty Financial Group Inc. ("DFG")        
pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger by and among LNC, DFG, Michael E.

that the Plan has previously been adopted and approved at a meeting of          
shareholders of the Fund called for the purpose of voting upon the Plan, by a   
vote of holders of more than 50 percent of the outstanding shares of the Fund.  
The date of effectiveness of the Plan is hereinafter called the "Effective      
Date."                                                                          

       2. CESSATION OF BUSINESS. After the Effective Date, the Company shall
not engage in any business activities on behalf of the Fund except for the      
purpose of winding up the Fund's business and affairs, preserving the value of  
its assets and distributing its assets to shareholders in accordance with the   
provisions of this Plan after the payment to (or reservation of assets for      
payment to) all creditors of the Fund. After the Effective Date, the Fund shall 
not issue any new shares except in connection with the reinvestment of dividends
or distributions by existing shareholders. Notwithstanding the provisions of

to Fund shareholders, continue to honor requests for the redemption of Fund     
shares received up to and including 4:00 p.m. on the day before the Liquidation 
Record Date (as defined in Section 5 below).                                    

      3. LIQUIDATION OF ASSETS. As soon as practicable after the Effective
Date and consistent with the terms of the Plan, the Company shall cause the     
liquidation of the Fund's assets to cash form.

the Company shall determine and pay (or reserve sufficient amounts to pay) the  
amount of all known or reasonably ascertainable liabilities of the Fund incurred
or expected to be incurred prior to the date of the liquidating distribution    
provided in Section 5 below.                                                    

         5. LIQUIDATING DISTRIBUTION. As soon as practicable after the Effective
Date, and in any event within sixty (60) days thereafter, the Company will mail 
the following to each Fund shareholder of record who has not redeemed its       
shares: (i) a liquidating distribution equal to the shareholder's proportionate 
interest in the remaining assets of the Fund (after the payment and creation of 
the reserves contemplated by Section 4 above); and (ii) information concerning  
the sources of the liquidating distribution. On or before such mailing date the 
Company will compile the list of remaining shareholders of record entitled to   
receive a liquidation distribution. The day on which such list is determined    
shall be the "Liquidation Record Date." The payment of the liquidating          
distribution and the retirement and cancellation of Fund shares will be effected
pursuant to an amendment to the Articles of Incorporation of the Company in the 
form attached hereto as Exhibit 1 (the "Amendment").                            

      6. TERMINATION AND DISSOLUTION. As promptly as practicable after the

the Fund shall be terminated pursuant to the terms of this Plan and applicable  
provisions of Minnesota law.

of the Board, the officers of the Company, shall have authority to do or to     
authorize any or all acts and things as provided for in this Plan and any and   
all such further acts and things as they may consider necessary or desirable to 
carry out the purposes of this Plan, including without limitation, the execution

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION

       THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION ("Agreement") is made as of
the __ day of ______, 1997, by and between Voyageur Mutual Funds III, Inc.      
("Voyageur III"), on behalf of its series Growth and Income Fund, and VAM       
Institutional Funds, Inc. ("VAM Funds"), on behalf of its newly formed series   
Growth and Income Fund ("New Growth and Income Fund"). Voyageur III and VAM     
Funds are Minnesota corporations. As used in this Agreement, the terms "New     
Growth and Income Fund" and "Growth and Income Fund" shall be construed to mean,
respectively, "VAM Funds on behalf of New Growth and Income Fund" and "Voyageur 
III on behalf of Growth and Income Fund," where necessary to reflect the fact   
that a corporate series is generally considered the beneficiary of corporate    
level actions taken with respect to the series and is not itself recognized as a
person under law.                                                               

This Agreement is intended to be and is adopted as a "plan of 
reorganization," within the meaning of Treas. Reg. 1.368-2(g), for a            
reorganization under Section 368(a)(1)(F) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, 
as amended (the "Code"). The reorganization (the "Reorganization") will consist 
of the transfer to New Growth and Income Fund of all of the assets of Growth and
Income Fund in exchange for the assumption by New Growth and Income Fund of all 
liabilities of Growth and Income Fund and the issuance by New Growth and Income 
Fund of shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share ("New Growth and      
Income Fund Shares"), to be distributed, after the Closing Time hereinafter     
determined, to the shareholders of Growth and Income Fund in liquidation of     
Growth and Income Fund as provided herein, all upon the terms and conditions    
hereinafter set forth in this Agreement. The distribution of New Growth and     
Income Fund Shares to Growth and Income Fund shareholders and the retirement and
cancellation of Growth and Income Fund shares will be effected pursuant to an   
amendment to the Articles of Incorporation of Voyageur III in the form attached 
hereto as Exhibit 1 (the "Amendment"), to be adopted by Voyageur III in         
accordance with the Minnesota Business Corporation Act.                         

      In consideration of the premises and of the covenants and agreements
hereinafter set forth, the parties hereto covenant and agree as follows:        

1.       REORGANIZATION AND LIQUIDATION OF GROWTH AND INCOME FUND               

      1.1. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein and in the
Amendment and on the basis of the representations and warranties contained      
herein, Growth and Income Fund agrees to assign, deliver and otherwise transfer 
the Growth and Income Fund Assets (as defined in paragraph 1.2) to New Growth   
and Income Fund and New Growth and Income Fund agrees in exchange therefor to   
assume all liabilities of Growth and Income Fund at the Closing Time (as defined
in paragraph 3.1) as set forth in paragraph 1.3and to deliver to Growth and     
Income Fund Shareholders (as defined in paragraph 1.5) the number of New Growth 
and Income Fund Shares, including fractional New Growth and Income Fund Shares, 
determined in accordance with paragraph 2.2. Such transactions shall take place 
at the closing provided for in paragraph 3.1 (the "Closing").                   

         1.2. The "Growth and Income Fund Assets" shall consist of all property,
including, without limitation, all cash, cash equivalents, securities, futures  
and interest receivables owned by Growth and Income Fund, and any deferred or   
prepaid expenses shown as an asset on Growth and Income Fund's books, on the    
Valuation Date (as defined in paragraph 2.1).                                   

       1.3. New Growth and Income Fund will assume all liabilities of Growth
and Income Fund, which include, without limitation, all expenses, costs, charges
and reserves reflected on an unaudited Statement of Assets and Liabilities of   
Growth and Income Fund prepared by the Treasurer of Growth and Income Fund as of
the Valuation Date in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  
consistently applied from the prior audited period ("Valuation Date Statement").

         1.4. At the Closing Time or as soon as practicable thereafter, pursuant
to paragraph 1.1 hereof and the Amendment, Growth and Income Fund will          
distribute New Growth and Income Fund Shares received by Growth and Income Fund 
pro rata to its shareholders of record determined as of the close of business on
the Valuation Date ("Growth and Income Fund Shareholders"). Thereafter, no      
additional shares representing interests in Growth and Income Fund shall be     
issued. Such distribution will be accomplished by an instruction, signed by     
Growth and Income Fund's Secretary, to transfer New Growth and Income Fund      
Shares then credited to Growth and Income Fund's account on the books of New    
Growth and Income Fund to open accounts on the books of VAM Funds in the names  
of the Growth and Income Fund Shareholders and representing the respective pro  
rata number of New Growth and Income Fund Shares due each such Growth and Income
Fund Shareholder. All issued and outstanding shares of Growth and Income Fund   
simultaneously will be canceled on Growth and Income Fund's books.              

      1.5. Ownership of New Growth and Income Fund Shares will be shown on
the books of VAM Fund's transfer agent. New Growth and Income Fund Shares will  
be issued in the manner described in New Growth and Income Fund's then-current  
Prospectus and Statement of Additional Information, except no front-end sales   
charges will be incurred by Growth and Income Fund Shareholders in connection   
with New Growth and Income Fund Shares received in the Reorganization. Growth   
and Income Fund Shareholders shall receive New Growth and Income Fund shares    
that are of the same class as the Growth and Income Fund shares in exchange for 
which such New Growth and Income Fund shares are issued.                        

1.6 New Growth and Income Fund agrees that in determining any 
contingent deferred sales charges applicable to any shares distributed by it in 
the Reorganization, and in determining the date upon which any Class B shares   
distributed by it in the Reorganization convert to Class A shares, it shall give
credit for the period during which the holders thereof held Growth and Income   
Fund shares in exchange for which such New Growth and Income Fund shares were   
issued.

Fund Shares in a name other than the registered holder of Growth and Income Fund

Valuation Date shall, as a condition of such issuance and transfer, be paid by  
the person to whom New Growth and Income Fund Shares are to be issued and       
transferred.

shall remain the responsibility of Growth and Income Fund.

Fund will be delivered to New Growth and Income Fund and, after the Closing,

of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act").                                           

2.       VALUATION                                                              

      2.1. The "Valuation Date" shall be a business day not later than the
5th business day following the receipt of the requisite approval of this

set forth in Growth and Income Fund's then current Prospectus and Statement of  
Additional Information.                                                         

        2.2. The New Growth and Income Fund Shares to be issued hereunder will

3.       CLOSING AND CLOSING TIME

place simultaneously as of the Closing Time unless otherwise provided.

Income Fund, for the account of New Growth and Income Fund at or before the     
Closing Time in conformity with applicable custody provisions under the 1940 Act

good delivery thereof in accordance with the custom of brokers. The portfolio   
securities shall be accompanied by all necessary federal and state stock        
transfer stamps or a check for the appropriate purchase price of such stamps.   
Portfolio securities and instruments deposited with a securities depository (as 
defined in Rule 17f-4 under the 1940 Act) shall be delivered at or before the

Exchange shall be closed to trading or trading thereon shall be restricted or   
(b) trading or the reporting of trading on such Exchange or elsewhere shall be  
disrupted so that, in the judgment of both New Growth and Income Fund and Growth
and Income Fund, accurate appraisal of the value of the Growth and Income Fund  
Assets is impracticable, the Valuation Date shall be postponed until the first  
business day after the day when trading shall have been fully resumed without   
restriction or disruption and reporting shall have been restored.               

       3.4. At the Closing, each party shall deliver to the other such bills

  delivery and performance of this Agreement will not result in, a
   material violation of any provision of Voyageur III's Articles of
     Incorporation or Bylaws or of any agreement, indenture, instrument,
         contract, lease or other undertaking to which Growth and Income Fund is

              (f) No material litigation or administrative proceeding or

      would materially and adversely affect its financial condition or the

       that might form the basis for the institution of such proceedings and
        is not a party to or subject to the provisions of any order, decree or
 judgment of any court or governmental body which materially and
        adversely affects, or is reasonably likely to materially and adversely

herein contemplated.                                          

             (g) The Statement of Assets and Liabilities, Statement of
         Operations, Statement of Changes in Net Assets and Financial Highlights
      of Growth and Income Fund as of April 30, 1996 and for the year then
        ended, certified by KPMG Peat Marwick LLP, and the unaudited Statement
  of Assets and Liabilities, Statement of Operations, Statement of
     Changes in Net Assets and Financial Highlights of Growth and Income
       Fund as of October 30, 1996 and for the six months then ended, fairly
       present, in all material respects, Growth and Income Fund's financial
      condition as of such date, and its results of operations, changes in
       its net assets and financial highlights for such period in accordance
    with generally accepted accounting principles, and as of such date
       there were no known liabilities of Growth and Income Fund (contingent
or otherwise) not disclosed therein that would be required in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles to be
disclosed therein.                                            

             (h) Since the date of the most recent unaudited financial
      statements, there has not been any material adverse change in Growth
         and Income Fund's financial condition, assets, liabilities or business,
         other than changes occurring in the ordinary course of business, or any
         incurrence by Growth and Income Fund of indebtedness maturing more than
  one year from the date such indebtedness was incurred, except as
      otherwise disclosed in writing to and acknowledged by New Growth and
  Income Fund prior to the date of this Agreement and prior to the
         Closing Time. All liabilities of Growth and Income Fund (contingent and
   otherwise) are reflected in the Valuation Date Statement. For the
   purpose of this subparagraph (h), neither a decline in Growth and
      Income Fund's net asset value per share nor a decrease in Growth and
 Income Fund's size due to redemptions by Growth and Income Fund
shareholders shall constitute a material adverse change.      

                 (i) Growth and Income Fund has no material contracts or other
      commitments (other than this Agreement) that will be terminated with
liability to it prior to the Closing Time.                    

              (j) All issued and outstanding shares of Growth and Income
        Fund are, and at the Closing Time will be, duly and validly issued and
      outstanding, fully paid and nonassessable with no personal liability
     attaching to the ownership thereof. Growth and Income Fund does not
         have outstanding any options, warrants or other rights to subscribe for
      or purchase any of its shares, nor is there outstanding any security
       convertible into any of its shares. All such shares will, at the time
   of Closing, be held by the persons and in the amounts recorded by
Growth and Income Fund's transfer agent.                      

                 (k) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement
 will have been duly authorized prior to the Closing Time by all
  necessary action on the part of Voyageur III and, subject to the
   approval of Growth and Income Fund's shareholders, this Agreement
      constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Growth and Income Fund
        enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject as to enforcement to
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent
      conveyance and other laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights
and to general equity principles.                             

                 (l) All material federal and other tax returns and reports of
     Growth and Income Fund required by law to be filed on or before the
        Closing Time shall have been filed and are correct and all federal and
         other taxes shown as due or required to be shown as due on said returns
       and reports have been paid or provision has been made for the payment
         thereof and, to the best of Growth and Income Fund's knowledge, no such
     return is currently under audit and no assessment has been asserted
        with respect to any such return and there are no facts that might form
the basis for such proceedings.                               

             (m) For each taxable year since its inception, Growth and
      Income Fund has met all the requirements of Subchapter M of the Code
         for qualification and treatment as a "regulated investment company" and
  neither the execution or delivery of, nor the performance of its
       obligations under, this Agreement will adversely affect, and no other
events, to the best of Growth and Income Fund's knowledge, are
       reasonably likely to occur which will adversely affect the ability of
Growth and Income Fund to continue to meet the requirements of
Subchapter M of the Code.                                     

                  (n) At the Closing Time, Growth and Income Fund will have good
     and valid title to the Growth and Income Fund Assets, subject to no
        liens (other than the obligation, if any, to pay the purchase price of
         portfolio securities purchased by Growth and Income Fund which have not
 settled prior to the Closing Time), security interests or other
      encumbrances, and full right, power and authority to assign, deliver
     and otherwise transfer such assets hereunder, and upon delivery and
       payment for such assets, New Growth and Income Fund will acquire good
      and marketable title thereto, subject to no restrictions on the full
       transfer thereof, including any restrictions as might arise under the
1933 Act.                                                     

              (o) At the time of the meeting of Growth and Income Fund's
    shareholders and at the Closing Time, the Proxy Materials will (i)
         comply in all material respects with the provisions of the 1934 Act and
      the 1940 Act and the regulations thereunder and (ii) not contain any
      untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
   required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
         therein not misleading. Neither Growth and Income Fund nor Voyageur III
   shall be construed to have made the foregoing representation with
        respect to portions of the Proxy Materials furnished by New Growth and
        Income Fund. Any other information furnished by Growth and Income Fund
      for use in any other manner that may be necessary in connection with
         the transactions contemplated hereby shall be accurate and complete and
   shall comply in all material respects with the applicable federal
securities and other laws and regulations thereunder.         

                 (p) Growth and Income Fund has maintained or has caused to be
  maintained on its behalf all books and accounts as required of a
      registered investment company in compliance with the requirements of
Section 31 of the 1940 Act and the Rules thereunder.          

              (q) Growth and Income Fund is not acquiring New Growth and
         Income Fund Shares to be issued hereunder for the purpose of making any
      distribution thereof other than in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.

INCOME FUND AND GROWTH AND INCOME FUND.                       

     The obligations of Growth and Income Fund and New Growth and Income

Closing Time:

       8.3. All consents of other parties and all other consents, orders and
permits of federal, state and local regulatory authorities (including those of  
the Commission and of state blue sky and securities authorities, including      
"no-action" positions of and exemptive orders from such federal and state       
authorities) deemed necessary by New Growth and Income Fund or Growth and Income
Fund to permit consummation, in all material respects, of the transactions      
contemplated herein shall have been obtained, except where failure to obtain any
such consent, order or permit would not involve risk of a material adverse

for any capital loss carry-forward and computed without regard to any deduction 
for dividends paid) for the taxable year during which the Reorganization occurs.

    8.5. The parties shall have received an opinion of the law firm of
Dorsey & Whitney LLP (based on such representations as such law firm shall      
reasonably request), addressed to VAM Funds and Voyageur III, which opinion may 
be relied upon by the shareholders of Growth and Income Fund, substantially to  
the effect that the federal income tax consequences of the Reorganization will  
be as follows:                                                                  

         (i)      the Reorganization will constitute a reorganization within the
               meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(F) of the Code, and New Growth
                and Income Fund and Growth and Income Fund each will qualify
                as a party to the Reorganization under Section 368(b) of the
Code;                                       

        (ii)     Growth and Income Fund shareholders will recognize no income,
                 gain or loss upon receipt, pursuant to the Reorganization, of
             New Growth and Income Fund shares. Growth and Income Fund
               shareholders subject to taxation will recognize income upon
                receipt of any net investment income or net capital gains of
              Growth and Income Fund which are distributed by Growth and
Income Fund prior to the Reorganization;    

         (iii)    the tax basis of New Growth and Income Fund shares received by
           each Growth and Income Fund shareholder pursuant to the

Fund Shares and Class C Acquiring Fund Shares due each such shareholder pursuant
