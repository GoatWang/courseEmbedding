Announcement




Naturally Wholesome Products LLC is voluntarily recalling gallon and pint containers of Half & Half labeled under the brand name Wholesome Country Creamery due to the presence of Alkaline Phosphatase found in samples during routine testing. Naturally Wholesome Products LLC has received no reports of illnesses related to the affected product and is removing the product from the market out of the abundance of caution.All gallon and pint containers involved in this recall have a batch code of 4052917 or 2060517. Distribution of the affected product was limited in scope. No other Naturally Wholesome Products LLC products are affected by this recall.The company initiated this voluntary recall because, in routine testing, samples of the affected product were found to contain Alkaline Phosphatase, an enzyme naturally present in raw milk but not in milk that has been properly pasteurized. The North Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, during a follow-up investigation of the plant, identified 2 batches of Half & Half that were not pasteurized per the requirements of the Pasteurized Milk Ordinance.The recall involves 244 units of the affected product which was distributed only in North Carolina. The company is actively notifying customers and is in the process of retrieving the affected product.How to Identify The Recalled ProductThis recall includes only gallon and pint containers of Half & Half that carry the Wholesome Country Creamery brand name. The containers have a small white sticker reading: 4052917 or 2060517.No other Naturally Wholesome Products LLC products are included in this recall.Naturally Wholesome Products LLC has ceased distribution of the affected product and recovery is actively underway. Consumers who have this product should not consume it. They should discard it and may return the product container to the place of purchase for a full refund or exchange. Consumers with questions can contact the company at (336) 468-1520.Because the presence of Alkaline Phosphatase in milk suggests the milk may not have been pasteurized sufficiently, it is possible that pathogens present in the raw milk to begin with, including Salmonella, Campylobacter, Listeria, and/or E. coli, have survived and, if ingested, could cause gastrointestinal infection and its potential ensuing complications.

Instead of going with the traditional beige or white countertop, bring in a fun, entertaining vibe by opting for a green or blue countertop; even a wood countertop would add some warmth and color to an all-white room. When you’re picking your modern backsplash, think along the same lines. Tile comes in many vibrant colors, so it’s the perfect way to add a splash of red or yellow without overpowering the rest of the room. Even inexpensive items such as bright dish towels, toasters and tea kettles can help bring a stronger entertaining vibe to your space.United StatesUnited StatesUnited KingdomAustraliaDeutschlandFranceРоссия日本ItaliaEspañaDanmarkSverigeIrelandSingaporeNew ZealandIndiaCOMPANYAbout HouzzIn the NewsPress InfoCareersContact UsTerms & PrivacyCopyright & TrademarkEXPLORE HOUZZButtons & BadgesMobile AppsAdvertiseFor ProfessionalsSell on HouzzWrite a ReviewFAQsCONNECT WITH USHouzz BlogTwitterFacebookGoogle+YouTubeRSSUnited KingdomAustraliaDeutschlandFranceРоссия日本ItaliaEspañaDanmarkSverigeIrelandSingaporeNew ZealandIndia© 2017 Houzz Inc.

Our Mission



Palm Products LLC is a growing and dynamic ecommerce retailer. We track, analyze, and use our years of experience to manage, market and retail products for some of nation’s top manufacturers. We are committed to a mutual success between us and our brand partners-suppliers through versatility, adaptability, and most importantly…quality relationships.
 

 
 



Our Strategies



There is no such thing as a “one size fits all” approach…especially when it comes to ecommerce. Every product we take on deserves a different approach, tailored ultimately for the consumer seeking the purchase. With online shopping, there is no need for the old marketing methods of “broadcasting” in hopes to build a top-of-mind name recognition for when then consumer is ultimately making a buying decision. We focus on a “narrowcasting” approach that seeks to serve as an informational resource for consumers shopping for that product. This can be done through a mix of search engine optimization, keyword strategies, and channel distribution.
 

 
 



Our Insights



Our years of experience in online retailing have taught us a couple things. First, too many retailers use price as their sole marketing method, especially online. It becomes a race to the bottom with pricing by trying to gain a market share strictly through being the lowest price. This is the easy way to do it and takes the least amount of work, strategy, and know-how. We believe this will ultimately hurt the brand in both perception to consumer and bottom line of the income statement. Second, we “Narrowcast”. This is probably something you will hear us say a lot. When focusing on reaching consumers, we try and be as specific as possible. For instance, instead of building an advertising campaign focused on a generality like women, ages 25 to 40, we believe in building a more focused approach like women, ages 31 to 35, who live in the Northeast, and watch Grey’s...
 

 
 



Our Future



The future is bright! We are excited for the direction that our company is moving and the partnerships that we have built. The dynamics of today’s marketplace mean that we are constantly searching and refining what our strategies, focuses, and channels will be in the future.
