This microarray is more powerful, accurate, quality assurable and more cost effective than presently available microarrays. The PlexStation 2080™ utilizes an elegant and patented design of stacking a 2-D substrate, called a Plexcard™ to form a 3-D PlexStack™, to economically do large (and small) panels of biomarkers, antibodies, antigens, genes, and/or protein detection, on one instrument. The transformational methodology uses a very small fraction of the detection reagent used on current platforms (e.g., ELISA and other immunoassays), potentially saving laboratories millions in annual expense.Commercialization of PlexStation 2080™ instrument will initially be introduced into the clinical laboratory industry. The robust instrument has tremendous potential in animal/pet testing, clinical research/drug discovery and Point of Care as well.

Medovex: Riding A Major Investor To Success - Medovex Inc. (NASDAQ:MDVX) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Medovex: Riding A Major Investor To SuccessMay. 5.15 | About: Medovex Inc. (MDVX) Stone Fox Capital Long/short equity, growth at reasonable price, research analyst, Deep ValueStone Fox CapitalSummaryMedovex offers a compelling investment opportunity in the medical device sector.
        The company has the backing of a famed investor in Steve Gorlin that has produced several big gainers.
        The stock has traded down since a recent IPO suggesting the market isn't aware of the opportunity that exists in this small cap.
        Medovex faces intense competition so the investment isn't for everybody.
        The medical device space is a complex area to invest riddled with huge success and many failures. The stocks can generate outsized returns or completely fail causing an investor to lose all of their investment. In these situations, it always helps to have the "stamp of approval" from a prominent hedge fund investor or venture capitalists. Even with the backing of a valued investor, it still doesn't ensure success without the devices.
Medovex (NASDAQ:MDVX) is one of those medical device companies that meets the requirements of interesting products and a prominent investor. The company recently completed an IPO and is backed my famed investor Steve Gorlin. Medovex is looking to acquire medical and healthcare technologies to build a diversified portfolio of medical products to go along with the DenerveX device.
Considering the stock is trading down since the IPO, investors have time to get into this undiscovered company before the market finds out about it for the following reasons.
Recent IPO
Medovex completed an IPO back in December that raised $9.2 million. The company issued 1.6 million units that consisted of one share of common stock and one warrant, at a price of $5.75.
The stock didn't start trading under the current symbol until February 2 and has traded most sideways to down in the ensuing months. The stock currently sits near the lows below $4.


Famed Medical Device Investor
For anybody thinking about investing in this stock, the prime reason is the backing of a prominent investor with a history of developing small biotechs or medical device companies into large companies. Steve Gorlin is generally unknown by the investing public possibly providing an opportunity with the stock down from the IPO pricing.
The company was co-founded by Steve Gorlin that has had a successful career in developing other medical device and biotech companies by scouring research labs and discarded piles for promising technologies. The Wall Street Journal covered his expertise all the way back in 1998 in not only picking technologies to back, but also inserting the right scientists and managers to develop those products. Some of his big investments include Medivation (NASDAQ:MDVN), Medicis, EntreMed, and MiMedx (NASDAQ:MDXG). All four turned into billion dollar stocks.
The best example of his success is Medivation that had a meteoric rise in the last four years. The stock has soared from below $10 towards the end of 2011 all the way to above $125 now.

MDVN data by YCharts
Naturally, all of the stocks he has founded haven't had this level of success though others had big returns. Medicis was sold to Valeant Pharmaceuticals (NYSE:VRX) for a hefty price and MiMedx continues ramping up revenue with over 100% growth in the last quarter while the stock has jumped from around $1 starting 2012 to recently trade above $10.
Other stocks listed in his biography haven't been as successful including DARA Biosciences (DARA) and CytRx Corp. (NASDAQ:CYTR). DARA Biosciences is down significantly to below $1 now.
Is Medovex the next high-growth investment?
Shaping Up The Product Lineup

Medovex already controls two devices in DenerveX and Streamline IV Suspension System. Both items are intended to focus on improving the quality of patient care. DenerveX helps with pain relief associated with Facet Joint Syndrome (FJS). The Streamline product improves hospital patient transport.
The market opportunities are significant for each product. DenerveX meets a currently unmet need that is long lasting, as opposed to the mostly temporary solutions on the market or the high-cost spinal infusion option. The Streamline IV System improves the current patient IV transportation method and includes a target market of nearly 100,000 beds in the U.S. and involves millions of patient transports either within a hospital or intra-hospital.

Source: Medovex April presentation
A big key to the story is that Medovex will continue looking for other devices to own so the future isn't completely based off these products. Investors are really betting the management team backed and picked by Steve Gorlin will find other interesting products. In reality, the focus by next year could be a new device purchased by the company.
Regardless though, lets review the existing products.
Clinically Proven
The best part of the DenerveX product is that it offers a potential cost savings to a healthcare system already swamped with heavy expenses. FJS, a condition in which the joints in the back of the spine degenerate and subsequently cause back pain, impacts over 30% of the people with chronic back pain. In fact, the data from 2011 showed Medicare and Medicaid paying for 1.8 million of the temporary procedures including injections and RF ablation. Medovex suggests that one-time treatment with DenerveX costs less than the annual injections and substantially below the spinal infusion that costs over $100,000.

At the same time, the solution already has proof of concept data via a manual method trial. The trial included a two-step manual procedure that the DenerveX device will improve into a one-step process. The 174 patients in the trial have seen positive outcomes in roughly 70% of the cases. All of the research suggests no permanent solutions for positive outcomes (permanent pain relieve) for multiple-years exist outside of the costly spinal infusion.

Source: Medovex April presentation
Regardless, Medovex still needs to obtain FDA approval. The company intends to apply for 510(k) clearance for the device, but the FDA could require the PMA (pre-market approval) application requiring clinical trials. Medovex is forecasting that it has an easier path to obtain the CE mark approval in the European Union during 2015 allowing it market the device in Europe prior to an approval in the U.S.
New Product Addition
Streamline is a new addition into the product portfolio with the company having only completed the merger back at the end of March. Medovex issued roughly 1.88 million shares and paid around $1.33 million cash for the purchase.
The IV Suspension System provides an improvement over the current hospital bed IV transportation system. The product is already produced at a contract facility in North Dakota and doesn't require regulatory approval. Medovex plans on working out an agreement with a hospital bed manufacturer.
The integrated IV system pictured below offers a unique solution. It helps reduce the strain on nurses both physically and their valuable time. Investors can see a video on the system here.


Source: Medovex April presentation
Medovex recently announced an expansion of the product line to include seven new products. The company intends to take every acquired product and advance the capabilities by using medical experts and better financing to improve the products.
Intense Competition
Per the annual report, Medovex claims that the DenerveX device has a lot of competing products on the market, but it doesn't currently see anybody using the same innovative technologies. The concern is that several companies are developing technologies that could successfully compete against the DenerveX device including manufacturers with significantly more capital including Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK).
One prime device targeted at FJS made by Zyga is already in a clinical study. The Glyder Device involves a permanent implant via a minimally invasive procedure. Zyga confirms that no solutions exist for the FJS patients that it believes the Glyder resolves. More importantly if the DenerveX requires clinical trials, Zyga has a significant head start of getting this device onto the market.
The company must obtain FDA approval and widespread adoption from surgeons and obtain adequate insurance coverage for success, even if the device is proven effective.
With the Streamline bed system, the company has to convince hospitals to spend capital on new beds that compete with bed transportation products from larger organizations.
In addition, the company has to do this with limited financials. At year end, Medovex had cash of $6.7 million. The over allotment proceeds raised in January will off set the cash outlay to purchase Streamline. Considering the company had a net loss of $3 million in 2014, it would have enough cash to operate for two years. Medovex will likely ramp up expenses in the next year placing more pressure on requirements to eventually raise more funds. Fortunately for Medovex, the company has a significant investor to help with the fund raising.
Concerning Stock Promotion

While a lot of positives exist for this stock, one major red flag is an ongoing stock promotion listed by hotStocked.com. The information suggests a promotion took place a week ago, but the stock hasn't seen any reaction. The volume jumped over the next couple of trading days, but the stock ended in virtually the same spot.

Source: Yahoo! Finance
Nothing with this promotion suggests this is anything other than an attempt by certain individuals to make a short-term profit.
In addition to the connection with Steve Gorlin, the BOD includes famed orthopedic surgeon Dr. Andrews and Dr. Randal Betz that is the Chief of Staff at Shriners Hospitals for Children. Several other board members are equally well renown and respected.
Takeaway
Medovex has a couple of innovative products that offer some potential big gainers. More importantly though, the company has a founder and BOD member with a strong track record in the sector. The past success of Steve Gorlin makes this small cap stick out.
Large stock gains clearly aren't guaranteed due to the intense competitive pressures in the medical device segment and numerous competitors in the market with significantly more capital. In addition, the presence of Steve Gorlin is likely to fuel attention to the promises of the involved products that will only increase the resources allocated to competitive products.
Medovex faces an uphill battle, but the company is a better risk than most with a strong backing and diversification from multiple products. As with all small caps, the stock is only appropriate for a small portion of a diversified portfolio.

Steve Gorlin’s Golden Rules
 
**Accomplished People.  Those with a track record of success.  “Bet on the jockey, not the horse.”
**Products with High Barriers to Entry.  Strong patents, an FDA approval process that would appear to be lengthy and complicated, or other barriers that keeps competitors at bay.
**Long Product Life Cycles in Large Product Markets.  Pursue technologies with long product life cycles that offer sustainable competitive advantages in large markets.
**Large Profit Margins.  These solve the almost inevitable errors that even great managers make.
**High Societal Impact.  ­This criterion translates into extraordinary successes.  Investors give highest consideration to innovation that has exceptional societal impact.
**Ahead of Its Time.  Pursue “dreams of the future,” not only the present.  These often involve breakthroughs that render market sizes and societal impact almost impossible to calculate.  “Skim the crème before others know it’s crème.”
**Obviousness.  If the vision is immediately obvious, it’s value and odds of success are likely to be much higher than an innovation whose value is difficult to explain or understand.
