Description:
The world loves to sing. From barbershop groups to madrigal choirs to vocal rock bands, there are tens of thousands of vocal groups in America. The success of mainstream television programs such as Glee and The Sing-Off not only demonstrates the rising popularity of vocal music; it reflects how current trends inspire others to join in. In addition, through various online and on-the-ground vocal music societies, the “a cappella market” is well defined and well connected. Like singing itself, a cappella is a global phenomenon.

At the heart of every vocal group is the music it performs. This often means writing its own arrangements of popular or traditional songs. This book is the long-awaited definitive work on the subject, wide ranging both in its scope and in its target audience – which spans beginners, music students, and community groups to professional and semi-professional performers, vocal/instrumental songwriters, composers, and producers – providing genre-specific insight on a cappella writing.
The tone of the book is instructive and informative, yet conversational: it is intended to stand alongside any academic publication while remaining interesting and fun. A Cappella Arranging is a good textbook – and a “good read” – for every vocal arranger, whether amateur or professional; every vocal music classroom, and any professional recording studio.

Over 40 years of experience has taught us a few things about concrete.  The first thing is you cannot make the best concrete without the very best raw materials available.  Our rock and sand come from mines with great equipment and innovative processes.  We use only reprocessed flyash, which is far superior to virgin ash and far more consistent.  We use only the best cement suppliers.  Our admixtures are absolutely the best on the planet.The next thing is we realize we are not a gigantic company with hundreds of quality control technicians and lawyers running around to back us up.  Therefore, we want to make sure every load that leaves our facility is absolutely right.  We can design mixes to meet any specification.  We can also design mixes to tailor to your situation.  If you need 4500 PSI with an 8" slump, we can design a mix to do that.  We can design mixes that leave less voids or bugholes for an exposed wall.  We can manipulate set times for your jobsite conditions.Admixture technology has come a long way over the last few years and we have access to the best products and the most well trained experts in the world.  If you have a question about a product or a situation, give us a call.  If we don't know the answer, we will contact someone who does.

Effective Skin Care Products For All Seasons 


An article by Sharon Bell with 679 words and 1686 views
 









								   Some of beauty's best kept secrets are not secrets at all. More often than not, solutions to your skin problems are found right under your nose. You do not have to spend a lot on cosmetics if you know where to find the instant fix to the most common skin blues you are experiencing. You can take your cue by looking at what is inside the beauty bags carried by makeup artists and fashion celebrities.
Eye Drops
Pimples can be annoying, especially when you get one or half a dozen of them on the day of your prom or wedding. Well, you know that pimples are normal, but what can really test your patience is their need to be red and undisguised on your face. And there seems to be no instant solution that can conceal them from public view, except popping them out.
But did you know that a product made for your eyes can significantly reduce or even totally remove the redness of your pimples? Not a big deal you say, but eliminating that redness is your first step in keeping your pimples from being seen. Sure the swelling is still there; but at the very least, discerning them can be a lot harder.
To use eye drops on your pimples, all you have to do is squeeze a few drops on the affected area and wait for about five minutes before wiping off the excess fluid. Or you can also use cotton buds to apply the eye drop formula. Putting an ice cube on the affected area afterwards can help you reduce the swelling.
Self-tanning Lotions
Tan is in, and it will always be. You just look at your favorite Hollywood personalities, and you can see that nobody wants to be pale. But with the thinning ozone layer and all the findings about the sun's damaging effects on the skin, how do you think your adored celebrities got their tan?
Simple. They spray themselves with self-tanning lotion. And it does not matter even if the sun is out in winter! You can get a self-tanner from the nearby drugstore or grocery shop. But beware of using too much of this stuff, you may risk turning your skin into orange instead of a regular tan.
Hemorrhoid Ointment
It may be hard to believe, but many celebrities and fashion models make use of this product to deal with pesky eye bags and puffy cheeks. What was intended for your anus turns out to be a very effective skin firming application for your face. The secret is in the composition of a regular hemorrhoid ointment, which is largely made up of oil from sharks and yeast. These two ingredients are also present in most facial creams that can reinvigorate the skin.
A hemorrhoid is basically a swollen vein in the rectum area; hence, the perfect cure should allow the enlargement to reduce or shrink. And for years, beauty experts applied hemorrhoid cream to reduce all types of swelling and drooping in the face like eye bags and sagging jaw line.
Lemon Extracts
Toners are a mainstay in any beauty kit. But did you know that lemon extract or juice can do the same job as most expensive toners used by celebrities? In fact, fashion models in places like Paris or Hong Kong carry real lemons in their beauty kits to help them remove traces of makeup after a busy day's catwalk.
If you want a natural makeup remover and skin toner, you can always opt to use real lemons or 100% natural lemon juice being sold in convenience stores. By the way, lemons are also good for pimples.
Being beautiful has all its rewards, but many forget that it also entails a lot of sacrifices. Everybody knows that improving your appearance means eliminating all the unwanted appearances on the skin; flawless skin is the true measure of being beautiful. Some skin problems can be easily solved by using items found in the kitchen or medicine cabinet, but other growths on the skin should be dealt with using specially formulated products.

Strange Japanese Beauty Products 


An article by Sharon Bell with 606 words and 853 views
 









								   When it comes to innovation, nothing beats the Japanese. Our Asian friends often leave no stone unturned in their quest for beauty and perfection. That’s probably the reason why they’ve come up with lots of unusual – and sometimes silly – inventions.
To give you an idea of what I mean, here’s a brief overview of bizarre beauty products from the Land of the Rising Sun courtesy of UniqueDaily.com and 3yen.com. The products featured here are not guaranteed to work but I promise they’ll give you plenty of laughs.
Are you bothered by the size of your nose? Many Japanese women are and want to do something about their small, flat noses. The Hana Hana Nose Stretcher will change all that.
This beauty accessory is nothing more than an industrial-strength clothespin. Wear it for just a few minutes for a couple of days and it will supposedly make your nose bigger and longer. The manufacturer claims it stretches the nose cartilage to give the user a beautiful and balanced face - whatever the heck that means! At less than $7, this natural nose lift is a real bargain. Perfect for those who are afraid of plastic surgery!
Fans of the ax-wielding maniac Jason Vorhees in the Friday the 13th film series can now look like their favorite horror icon with the Face Slimmer. In Japan, a slim face is a mark of beauty. Put on this rubber mask and it supposedly massages and melts away fat from your face. No batteries required.
The Head Bath Cap looks like it was made especially for Marquis de Sade, the French aristocrat and writer of violent pornography. Put the cap over your head and fill it with water. The trapped water is said to be good for the scalp and will help you grow thicker and fuller hair. Since the cap covers the entire face and only has one opening on top, don’t wear it tightly or you could drown in the damned thing!
Want to look taller? Then the Neck Stretcher is for you! Just place this accordion-like device around your neck and fill it with air with the included hand pump. In minutes, it will stretch your neck and hopefully increase your height. Warning: overuse of this product can make you look like a giraffe!
The Slim Mouth Piece supposedly exercises the muscles around the mouth to help you lose fat. The manufacturer said it tones your face by expanding and contracting flaccid facial muscles. Use it for only 2-3 minutes a day to "sharpen your features.”
“Despite its misleading name, this gadget is supposed to make your mouth bigger, not smaller. Bigger? Yes, bigger. Who on earth would want this? Well, the theory is that if you widen your mouth, you will have the appearance of a small face, so prized by the Japanese,” said an unnamed English teacher in “Fungus Mungus’ Weird Stuff in Japan.”
Exercising the mouth sounds like a good idea. But if you ask me, that area gets all the exercise it needs from smiling, talking and eating. Still, the Slim Mouth Piece would make a good conversation piece. Get yours for $9.50.
If you’re looking for a natural way to eliminate fine lines and wrinkles without having to go through the pains of costly plastic surgery or cosmetic injections, don’t waste time going to Japan. The solution is right here with the Rejuvinol AM/PM Botox Alternative Age-Defying System. This powerful anti-aging formula consists of the Rejuvinol morning moisturizer that nourishes and strengthens the skin; and the Rejuvox night cream that relaxes tense, tired facial muscles.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
