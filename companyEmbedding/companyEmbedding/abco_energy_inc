ABCO Energy, Inc. (ABCE) Announces Backlog Of Solar Projects

Aug 27, 2015, 12:12 ET
		  		  					
						 from   ABCO Energy, Inc. 











 
















































 

 




















 


TUCSON, Ariz., Aug. 27, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- ABCO Energy, Inc. (OTCQB Markets – Symbol "ABCE") announces the highest backlog of commercial and residential solar installation work in the history of the Company.  With substantial commercial financing available, ABCO has been able to secure contracts that will carry the Company through the 2015 year with profitable work.
On July 2, 2015 ABCO signed a solar electric system installation contract to construct solar projects on four commercial locations in Arizona for an organization that owns several self-storage facilities in Arizona and California.  This contract totals $1,200,000 and is fully funded.  The installation work is just beginning and all projects should be completed before December 31, 2015.
On August 15, 2015 ABCO entered into a contract to build nine commercial solar electric facilities for a group of medical offices organized as a condominium association.  The solar arrays, to be installed on carport shade structures, will provide 100 % of the electric needs of the owner's offices for more than 25 years.  The combined sales price of the nine projects totals nearly $275,000.  For tax reasons, all of this project will be completed during 2015.
ABCO has several residential contracts signed and under construction totaling over $350,000 as of August 15, 2015.  This group of contracts is the remainder of more than $660,000 in residential contracts signed in the first six months of 2015.  These contracts will be completed in the remaining four months of this fiscal year.
"The total of the contracts currently signed is in excess of $1,825,000 and more projects have been submitted for financing.  This backlog exceeds our 2014 sales, and is expected to grow before our fiscal year ending this December 31st ," says Charles O'Dowd, President. "We believe we are on our way to a record year for ABCO Energy and this is especially rewarding since we have just recently been approved for trading on the OTCQB."
ABCO Energy Inc. is an Arizona licensed contractor for sales and installation of Photovoltaic Solar Systems, installation of LED and energy conservation lighting systems and a provider of electrical services in their markets. ABCO has offices in Tucson, Phoenix and Flagstaff, Arizona.  ABCO provides products and services to residential, commercial, government and non-profit entities in all of their markets.

Our story




Gu-ru / ‘goroō /
Noun:
1. A mentor, a teacher, one who helps you move forward.
2. A source of inspiration and good energy.


GURU
A Story of Organic Growth
Ever since the early days, GURU has always been driven by this idea of crafting the best natural energy drink out there. Founded in Montreal during the summer of 1999 by four college friends, the company marketed the world's first all-natural energy drink.
More than 15 years later, this vision is not only fulfilled but is also thriving and expanding worldwide. GURU has become the #1 Organic Energy Drink in Canada and the US in the Health Channel thanks to a strong network of distribution partnerships and a passionate sales team. 
With research & development at the forefront of our expansion, GURU now tackles a new market and adventure with the recent introduction of our Energy Waters. This new line of product arrives just in time to satisfy a growing demand for organic sugar and calorie-free energy beverages.
In short, GURU has and will always believe that energy should not come at the expense of health. That is what has brought our company a steady and organic growth.
Our Philosophy
Through its corporate philosophy and its beverages, GURU gives good energy for people to make great things, reminding that, with the right dose of will, inspiration and energy, achieving great results is within everyone's reach. 
People today define themselves less by what they have and more by what they do and contribute to the world. Resourcefulness, imagination, inventiveness is today’s new currency. Whether using technology, natural ingredients or just plain common sense, people who Make it Good are the ones who seek to make everything better. We call them Makers.
They are pioneers that never settle. Makers, not followers. Crafters not manufacturers. Some may call them obsessed, exceptional or extraordinary people. But these are men and women who are true innovators, thought leaders and doers in their respective communities. They make the impossible possible.

Luc Martin-Privat
Our Brew Master
Meet Luc our Brew Master. He is the brains behind GURU.  In fact, while he could have become your friendly neighborhood pharmacist, Luc had other dreams…
From the functional herbs he started playing with in his dad’s lab to his PhD in Pharmacology, Luc has mastered the art of blending botanicals, an art he is now applying to our beloved GURU.
Always on the lookout for smart organics from around the world, Luc is looking into the GURU recipe “Organically” to make it perfect everytime! And when he is not looking at new ways to craft our GURU, Luc is dreaming about new products!
