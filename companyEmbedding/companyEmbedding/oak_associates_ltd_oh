About

















Oak Associates, ltd. was founded by James D. Oelschlager, Margaret Ballinger, Donna Barton (retired 2014)  and Gloria Kline (retired) in 1985.  The investment philosophy in place today is the same strategy that has been used since inception.  Over the last 30 years, the firm’s products and staff have expanded, but the firm’s focus has always remained on its clients. From 1968 to 1984, Mr. Oelschlager served as the Director of the Pension Investments Department and Assistant Treasurer at Firestone.  When he joined Firestone, the pension plan had assets of $250 million and was underfunded by another $250 million.  Over the next fifteen years under their management, the fund's growth enabled Firestone to eliminate contributions and pay out $80 million per year to retirees.  By 1984, the pension fund was valued at $1.2 billion, with $330 million in surplus assets after allowing for required benefit payments.  At that time, Firestone decided to terminate the defined benefits plan and recaptured the excess assets.  It was then that Mr. Oelschlager chose to form Oak Associates ltd.  and manage the assets of Firestone as its first client.  Oak Associates has remained true to its investment style over the last 30 years.   And while the firm’s investment staff has expanded, the firm’s focus remains on its clients and implementing its successful long-term investment strategy.  About Oak AssociatesThis page was last updated: April 22, 2016Oak Associates, ltd.  3875 Embassy Parkway - Suite 250, Akron, Ohio 44333Main Tel: 330-668-1234 Fax: 330-668-2901 Oak Associates, ltd. is an independent investment advisor registered with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission.
