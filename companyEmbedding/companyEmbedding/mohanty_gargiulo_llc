	issuers on a variety of total return swap transactions and structured bonds. She spent 3 years on the corporate derivatives desk where she provided
	comprehensive risk management solutions to domestic corporate clients. Her work included performing asset liability analyses to determine the clients’

Our Process
Creating clear context for derivative and structured products within an entire portfolio of a particular enterprise is the goal of our process. As a result, we believe that each client should understand their current portfolio and the dynamics of this portfolio as a start. Using this context combined with the client’s financing objectives will provide a better foundation for analyzing the benefits and exposures of any potential product.
