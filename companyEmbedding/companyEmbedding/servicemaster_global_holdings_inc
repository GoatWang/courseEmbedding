    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

History[edit]
ServiceMaster was founded by Marion E. Wade, a minor league baseball player, as a moth-proofing company in Chicago, Illinois. It was incorporated in 1947 and expanded to franchised carpet cleaning in 1952.[2] Its movement into business services makes it a large outsourcing company.[3]
In the 1980s, the company experienced further expansion of the consumer segment of the business. During this time, ServiceMaster built on its original franchise business to form a network of branch and franchise-based service companies – including Terminix, TruGreen and Merry Maids – and other category-leading commercial and residential service brands, including American Home Shield. In 2001, ServiceMaster divested its management services businesses to focus more on its residential and commercial business.
In July 2007, a group of equity sponsors led by Clayton, Dubilier and Rice (CD&R) acquired ServiceMaster and took the company private. In the same year, the company moved its headquarters from Downers Grove, Ill., to Memphis, Tenn., to better enable the corporate staff to work with all of its business units. Robert J. Gillette was appointed chief executive officer in June 2013.[citation needed]
As of January 1, 2014, TruGreen is no longer a brand of ServiceMaster, opting instead to remain a privately held company. It became a part of Scotts Miracle-Gro in 2016.
On June 25, 2014, ServiceMaster Global Holdings, Inc., the parent of The ServiceMaster Company, LLC,[4] announced that it had priced an initial public offering of 35,900,000 shares of common stock at $17.00 per share. The shares began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on June 25, 2014 under the ticker symbol SERV. The Company continues to be majority owned by private equity firms Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, StepStone Group and Ridgemont Equity Partners, and JPMorgan Chase Funding.
In June 2016, ServiceMaster announced a relocation of their global headquarters from East Memphis to Peabody Place in Downtown Memphis. Completion is expected by the end of 2017.[5]

American Home Shield[edit]
American Home Shield, though its wholly owned subsidiaries, currently services more than 2 million customers across all 50 states and the District of Columbia.[citation needed] The company administers home warranties for major home systems and appliances and works through a network of over 11,000 independent home-service contractors -- the largest in the country.[citation needed] In 2013 American Home Shield received HomeWarrantyReviews.com's[7] 'Best in Service' Award.[8]
On July 24, 2007 a lawsuit was filed against American Home Shield alleging that "American Home Shield engaged in a pattern and practice of failing to fulfill its contractual obligation to its customers". In February 2008 American Home Shield announced a proposed settlement.[9]

ServiceMaster was founded by Marion E. Wade, a minor league baseball player, as a moth-proofing company in Chicago, Illinois. It was incorporated in 1947 and expanded to franchised carpet cleaning in 1952.[2] Its movement into business services makes it a large outsourcing company.[3]
In the 1980s, the company experienced further expansion of the consumer segment of the business. During this time, ServiceMaster built on its original franchise business to form a network of branch and franchise-based service companies – including Terminix, TruGreen and Merry Maids – and other category-leading commercial and residential service brands, including American Home Shield. In 2001, ServiceMaster divested its management services businesses to focus more on its residential and commercial business.
In July 2007, a group of equity sponsors led by Clayton, Dubilier and Rice (CD&R) acquired ServiceMaster and took the company private. In the same year, the company moved its headquarters from Downers Grove, Ill., to Memphis, Tenn., to better enable the corporate staff to work with all of its business units. Robert J. Gillette was appointed chief executive officer in June 2013.[citation needed]
As of January 1, 2014, TruGreen is no longer a brand of ServiceMaster, opting instead to remain a privately held company. It became a part of Scotts Miracle-Gro in 2016.
On June 25, 2014, ServiceMaster Global Holdings, Inc., the parent of The ServiceMaster Company, LLC,[4] announced that it had priced an initial public offering of 35,900,000 shares of common stock at $17.00 per share. The shares began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on June 25, 2014 under the ticker symbol SERV. The Company continues to be majority owned by private equity firms Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, StepStone Group and Ridgemont Equity Partners, and JPMorgan Chase Funding.
In June 2016, ServiceMaster announced a relocation of their global headquarters from East Memphis to Peabody Place in Downtown Memphis. Completion is expected by the end of 2017.[5]

American Home Shield[edit]
American Home Shield, though its wholly owned subsidiaries, currently services more than 2 million customers across all 50 states and the District of Columbia.[citation needed] The company administers home warranties for major home systems and appliances and works through a network of over 11,000 independent home-service contractors -- the largest in the country.[citation needed] In 2013 American Home Shield received HomeWarrantyReviews.com's[7] 'Best in Service' Award.[8]
On July 24, 2007 a lawsuit was filed against American Home Shield alleging that "American Home Shield engaged in a pattern and practice of failing to fulfill its contractual obligation to its customers". In February 2008 American Home Shield announced a proposed settlement.[9]

Ground Floor by ServiceMaster has arrived.
ServiceMaster Global Holdings Inc.’s innovation center — “Ground Floor” — located in the former Tower Records space in Peabody Place, officially opened Thursday, June 15.

The innovation center accounts for roughly 20,000 square feet of the more than 300,000-square-foot Peabody Place building and new world headquarters for ServiceMaster.
To see inside the new ServiceMaster space, click the slideshow.




Ground Floor is broken into an area for Service Master employees, a section for entrepreneurs and a shared space.
"For us, it is really the first step in the process of moving everyone down here,” said Robert Gillette, CEO of ServiceMaster. “It highlights the innovation center, but it also kind of gives you a feel for what the rest will look like. We also tried things architecturally or visually here, and said, 'Does that work?' and kind of modified it and developed a baseline for what we do."
FrontDoor, a real estate start-up that was previously based out of the Start Co. facility, was named the first non-ServiceMaster company that will take up residence in the innovation center.
Founded by Jessica Buffington in 2015, FrontDoor is an online platform that pairs homeowners with local, full-service real estate agents to sell their homes. The difference with FrontDoor is that homeowners pay a flat rate of $2,500 rather than a standard 3 percent commission.




 


Thursday will also mark the inaugural event at Ground Floor. A “Panel Discussion with Technology & Innovation Key Influencers" is scheduled for 2 p.m. Panelists for the event include: Jackson Giles, managing partner and co-founder of SoftMatch; Avi Goldberg, CEO of Dispatch; Andre Fowlkes, president of Start Co.; and Jamie Smith, chief information officer for ServiceMaster. ( Editor's note: MBJ reporter Meagan Nichols will serve as moderator of the panel discussion.)
Overall renovations to the building are expected to be finished near the end of 2017. Flintco Inc. is the overall general contractor on the project. Subcontractor bids for the remaining office space go out June 15.
The company’s current headquarters are on Ridge Lake Boulevard in East Memphis. Once the new building is completed, roughly 1,200 ServiceMaster employees will relocate to the Downtown space.
American Home Shield, AmeriSpec, Furniture Medic, Merry Maids, ServiceMaster Clean, ServiceMaster Restore and Terminix are all under the ServiceMaster Global Holdings umbrella.

We are confident the operational changes we are making will improve customer retention and result in solid growth in the future.”Consolidated Performance                                                                      Three Months Ended March 31,     $ millions     2017     2016     B/(W)     Revenue     $   643         $   608         $   35         YoY growth                       5.8     %     Gross Margin       297           284           13         % of revenue       46.2     %       46.7     %       (0.5   )   pts     SG&A       (186   )         (173   )         (13   )       % of revenue       28.9     %       28.5     %       (0.4   )   pts     Income from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes       62           62           —         % of revenue       9.6     %       10.2     %       (0.6   )   pts     Net Income       39           39           —         % of revenue       6.1     %       6.4     %       (0.3   )   pts     Adjusted Net Income(2)       46           47           (1   )       % of revenue       7.2     %       7.7     %       (0.5   )   pts     Adjusted EBITDA(1)       134           127           7         % of revenue       20.8     %       20.9     %       (0.1   )   pts     Net Cash Provided from Operating Activities from Continuing Operations       126           106           20         Free Cash Flow(3)       109           89           20                                          Segment PerformanceRevenue and Adjusted EBITDA for each reportable segment and Corporate were as follows:                                                                                                      Three Months Ended March 31,         Revenue       Adjusted EBITDA     $ millions     2017       B/(W) vs. PY       2017       B/(W) vs. PY     Terminix     $   365       $   1         $   81         $   (13   )       YoY growth / % of revenue               0.3   %         22.2   %         (3.6   )   pts     American Home Shield       227         33           31           12         YoY growth / % of revenue               17.0   %         13.7   %         3.9     pts     Franchise Services Group       50         1           21           3         YoY growth / % of revenue               2.0   %         42.0   %         5.3     pts     Corporate(4)         1           —               —               4               Total     $   643       $   35         $   134         $   7         YoY growth / % of revenue               5.8   %         20.8   %         (0.1   )   pts  Reconciliations of net income to adjusted net income and Adjusted EBITDA, as well as a reconciliation of net cash provided from operating activities from continuing operations to free cash flow, are set forth below in this press release.TerminixTerminix reported comparable revenue in the first-quarter of 2017 compared to the first-quarter of 2016, primarily driven by an increase in core termite, wildlife exclusion and attic insulation sales, offset, in part, by the expected decline in revenue associated with Alterra Pest Control, LLC (“Alterra”). Adjusted EBITDA decreased 14 percent, or $13 million, versus prior year, primarily reflecting a $5 million increase in production labor costs associated with the company’s effort to improve safety, customer service and retention, a $4 million increase in damage claims and a $7 million increase in sales and marketing costs, offset, in part, by $2 million from the conversion of higher revenue and a $1 million decrease in fuel costs.American Home ShieldAmerican Home Shield reported a 17 percent year-over-year revenue increase in the first-quarter of 2017 driven by an increase in new unit sales, improved price realization and the impact of the OneGuard and Landmark acquisitions in June and November 2016, respectively. AHS’s organic revenue growth was 8 percent in the first-quarter versus prior year. For the quarter, Adjusted EBITDA increased 63 percent, or $12 million, versus prior year, primarily reflecting a $10 million increase from the conversion of higher organic revenue, $3 million associated with the OneGuard and Landmark acquisitions and a $1 million decrease in other costs, offset, in part, by a $2 million increase in contractor claims costs. The increase in contractor claims costs was driven by normal inflationary pressure on the underlying costs of repairs.Franchise Services GroupThe Franchise Services Group reported a 2 percent year-over-year revenue increase in the first-quarter of 2017 primarily driven by higher fee revenue, offset, in part, by the impact of converting company-owned Merry Maids branches to franchises. Adjusted EBITDA increased 17 percent, or $3 million, versus prior year, primarily reflecting the conversion of higher fee revenue.Cash FlowFor the three months ended March 31, 2017, net cash provided from operating activities from continuing operations increased to $126 million from $106 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016.Net cash used for investing activities from continuing operations was $31 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $15 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016.Read MoreNet cash used for financing activities from continuing operations was $60 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $17 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016. In the three months ended March 31, 2017, we used $51 million to purchase 1.3 million shares of company stock.Free cash flow(3) was $109 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $89 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016.Other MattersFumigation Related MattersAs previously disclosed, on January 20, 2017, the company entered into a plea agreement in connection with the investigation initiated by the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) related to the U.S. Virgin Islands matter. Under the terms of the plea agreement we have agreed to pay fines, community service and government costs totaling up to $10 million. On March 23, 2017, we pled guilty to four misdemeanor charges. A sentencing hearing before the court is scheduled for July 27, 2017. The plea agreement is non-binding on the court. It is possible that the court could use its discretion to impose fines or other terms different than those in the plea agreement. If the plea agreement is approved by the court, it will resolve the federal criminal consequences associated with the DOJ investigation.Share Repurchase ProgramOn February 23, 2016, the company’s board of directors authorized a three-year share repurchase program, under which the company may purchase up to $300 million of outstanding shares of common stock. During the first-quarter 2017, the company purchased 1,338,426 shares of common stock at an average price paid per share of $38.04 for a total of $51 million. As of March 31, 2017, we have repurchased $111 million of outstanding shares under this program.Full-Year 2017 OutlookThe company continues to expect full-year 2017 revenue to range from $2,885 million to $2,915 million, or an increase of between 5 percent and 6 percent compared to 2016. Full-year 2017 Adjusted EBITDA is anticipated to range from $700 million to $715 million, or an increase of 5 percent to 7 percent compared to 2016. Our 2017 outlook excludes the impact of potential acquisitions.A reconciliation of the forward-looking 2017 Adjusted EBITDA outlook to net income is not being provided as the company does not currently have sufficient data to accurately estimate the variables and individual adjustments for such reconciliation.First-Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference CallThe company will discuss its first-quarter 2017 financial and operating results during a conference call at 8 a.m. central time (9 a.m. eastern time) today, April 27, 2017.

Non-GAAP measures should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP measures may not be calculated or comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. See non-GAAP reconciliations below in this press release for a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow are not measurements of the company’s financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations or any other performance or liquidity measures derived in accordance with GAAP. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate operating performance and liquidity comparisons, as applicable, from period to period. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful for investors, analysts and other interested parties as they facilitate company-to-company operating and liquidity performance comparisons, as applicable, by excluding potential differences caused by variations in capital structures, taxation, the age and book depreciation of facilities and equipment, restructuring initiatives and equity-based, long-term incentive plans._________________________________________________(1) Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income before: depreciation and amortization expense; fumigation related matters; non-cash stock-based compensation expense; restructuring charges; gain on sale of Merry Maids branches; non-cash impairment of software and other related costs; income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes; provision for income taxes; and interest expense. The company’s definition of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.(2) Adjusted net income is defined as net income before: amortization expense; fumigation related matters; restructuring charges; gain on sale of Merry Maids branches; impairment of software and other related costs; income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes; and the tax impact of the aforementioned adjustments. The company’s definition of adjusted net income may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Adjusted earnings per share is calculated as adjusted net income divided by the weighted-average diluted common shares outstanding.(3) Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided from operating activities from continuing operations less property additions.(4) Corporate includes The ServiceMaster Acceptance Company Limited Partnership (SMAC) and the unallocated expenses of our headquarters function.                           SERVICEMASTER GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC.
