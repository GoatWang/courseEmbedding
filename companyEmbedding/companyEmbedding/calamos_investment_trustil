Investment Management
Insights, Strategies and Solutions
Our experienced professionals have expertise in a broad spectrum of traditional, alternative and non-financial assets.  We can work with you to develop and manage a portfolio tailored to your needs.






Portfolio Consulting
A collaborative dialogue with your portfolio manager
Your portfolio manager is a key member of your U.S. Trust relationship team and serves as your personal "chief investment officer." He or she will work with you to create an Investment Policy Statement, which serves as a blueprint for your portfolio by documenting your:

Objectives
Risk tolerance
Cash flow needs
 Tax situation
Wealth aspirations

Your portfolio manager's ongoing role is to incorporate our best strategic and tactical thinking, most relevant research analysis, current market insights and appropriate investment solutions into your portfolio. He or she will regularly monitor your portfolio to make sure it conforms to your Investment Policy Statement, which will be updated whenever there are significant changes in your life or goals.
Asset management
A more complete approach to asset allocation1
We analyze a wide range of asset classes, including hedge and private equity funds2 and global investment opportunities, as potential components of an asset allocation. In addition, we believe that true diversification requires managing for cash flows across and within asset classes in various market environments — not simply allocating according to a grid.
Your asset allocation will be based on the long-term expectations established for each asset class by our most senior investment professionals. Over the shorter term, however, your portfolio manager can adjust your portfolio tactically in response to emerging opportunities and risks, and reflecting U.S. Trust insights about trends and themes relevant to you.
How you own your assets — personally or in trusts; in taxable or tax-exempt solutions — can have a material impact on the overall performance of your portfolio. At U.S. Trust we focus on this wealth structuring aspect of your portfolio in conjunction with managing the assets themselves.
Alternative Investments
SOPHISTICATED SOLUTIONS TO MEET YOUR NEEDS2
Alternative investments at U.S. Trust focus on non-traditional assets such as:

Hedge funds
Private equity
Real estate and tangible assets

Because performance is often differentiated from equity and fixed income markets, alternative investments may be an ideal complement to traditional investments. 
Through our access to the industry's premier managers, we are able to offer solutions that provide options for all client segments. And we support you every step of the way with knowledge built on our experience in alternatives, including industry-leading research, rigorous due diligence, and cutting-edge portfolio construction.
Drawing from the experience, resources and expertise of the firm, you and your portfolio manager can explore alternative investments that can help you pursue what matters most to you.
Specialty asset management
Expertise in nonfinancial assets3
Specialty asset management at U.S. Trust focuses on nonfinancial assets such as:

Farm and ranch land
Timberland
Oil and gas properties
Private businesses
Real estate

Our Specialty Asset Management team can work with your portfolio manager and wealth strategist, as appropriate, to integrate these real assets into your overall plan and portfolio.
We can help you realize your objectives with assets you already own, or help you acquire specific assets to take advantage of their capital growth and diversification potential — whether you own these assets outright or they are held in trust.
Our team of specialists can provide complete turnkey services including identifying and purchasing real property and providing ongoing management.
Capital markets
Sophisticated market-linked solutions4
Through our access to the resources of Merrill Lynch, one of the world's leading capital markets participants, we can tailor approaches to risks and opportunities in the foreign exchange, interest rate, commodity and equity markets. Derivative-based transactions target the risks you seek to hedge, and are designed to dovetail with your overall portfolio and wealth management strategies.

1 Asset allocation and diversification do not ensure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.
2 Alternative Investments such as derivatives, hedge funds, private equity funds, and funds of funds can result in higher return potential but also higher loss potential. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely affect your investments. Before you invest in alternative investments, you should consider your overall financial situation, how much money you have to invest, your need for liquidity, and your tolerance for risk. Alternative investments are speculative and involve a high degree of risk.
3 Nonfinancial assets, such as closely-held businesses, real estate, oil, gas and mineral properties, and timber, farm and ranch land, are complex in nature and involve risks including total loss of value.  Special risk considerations include natural events (for example, earthquakes or fires), complex tax considerations, and lack of liquidity.  Nonfinancial assets are not suitable for all investors.  Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager, and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax, or estate planning strategy.
4 Brokerage services are provided by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, a registered broker-dealer, Member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation.
Certain U.S. Trust associates are registered representatives with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated ("MLPF&S") and may assist you with investment products and services provided through MLPF&S and other nonbank investment affiliates. MLPF&S is a registered broker-dealer, member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation ("BofA Corp."). U.S. Trust operates through Bank of America, N.A., and other subsidiaries of BofA Corp.

Fulfill important philanthropic commitments

21-year, 3-year, 5-year, 10-year and since inception returns are as of 3/31/17. Average annual total return measures net investment income and capital gain or loss from portfolio investments as an annualized average. All performance shown assumes reinvestment of dividends and capital gains distributions. Performance shown reflects an expense reimbursement that improved results. Load-adjusted returns are adjusted for the maximum front-end sales load of 4.75% for Class A shares (3.75% for Total Return Bond Fund). Class B shares have a declining contingent deferred sales charge over six years, with a maximum of 5% in year one (3.50% for Total Return Bond Fund Class B shares). Class B shares automatically convert to A shares after eight years. There is a 1% contingent deferred sales charge for C shares on certain redemptions within the first year of purchase. Class B and C shares have been adjusted for the contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC). There are no contingent deferred sales charges or distribution or service fees with respect to Class I shares. The minimum initial investment required to purchase each Fund's Class I shares is $1 million. Class I shares are offered primarily for direct investment by investors through certain tax-exempt retirement plans (including 401(k) plans, 457 plans, employer-sponsored 403(b) plans, profit sharing and money purchase pension plans, defined benefit plans and non qualified deferred compensation plans) and by institutional clients, provided such plans or clients have assets of at least $1 million.

1 Current Annualized Distribution Rate is the Fund’s most recent distribution, expressed as an annualized percentage of the Fund’s current market price per share. 

The Convertible Opportunities & Income Fund’s (CHI) most recent distribution was $0.0950 per share. 
The Convertible & High Income Fund’s (CHY) most recent distribution was $0.1000 per share. 
The Global Dynamic Income Fund’s (CHW) most recent distribution was $0.0700 per share.

The Global Total Return Fund’s (CGO) most recent distribution was $0.1000 per share. 

Estimates are calculated on a tax basis rather than on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis, but should not be used for tax reporting purposes. Distributions are subject to  re-characterization for tax purposes after the end of the fiscal year. This information is not legal or tax advice. Consult a professional regarding your specific legal or tax matters. Under the Fund’s level rate distribution policy, distributions paid to common shareholders may include net investment income, net realized short-term capital gains and return of capital. When the net investment income and net realized short-term capital gains are not sufficient, a portion of the level rate distribution will be a return of capital. In addition, a limited number of distributions per calendar year may include net realized long-term capital gains. Distribution rate may vary.

Market Price is the price that the fund closed at on the primary listing exchange on the as of date referenced above.

NAV is the net asset value of the fund on the as of date referenced above and equals the value of all the fund's assets (less liabilities) divided by the number of shares outstanding.

Premium/Discount is the percentage difference between the net asset value of a fund and the market price.


Past Performance

Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. You can purchase or sell common shares daily. Like any other stock, market price will fluctuate with the market. Upon sale, your shares may have a market price that is above or below net asset value and may be worth more or less than your original investment. Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a market price that is below their net asset value.
Important Fund Information

The Global Total Return and Global Dynamic Income Funds may invest up to 100% of their assets in foreign securities and invest in an array of security types and market-cap sizes, each of which has a unique risk profile. As a result of political or economic instability in foreign countries, there can be special risks associated with investing in foreign securities. These include fluctuations in currency exchange rates, increased price volatility, and difficulty obtaining information.

Investments by the Funds in lower-rated securities involve substantial risk of loss and present greater risks than investments in higher-rated securities, including less liquidity and increased price sensitivity to changing interest rates and to a deteriorating economic environment.

There are certain risks associated with an investment in a convertible bond such as default risk--that the company issuing a convertible security may be unable to repay principal and interest--and interest rate risk--that the convertible may decrease in value if interest rates increase.

Fixed-income securities are subject to interest rate risk; as interest rates go up, the value of the debt securities in the Fund's portfolio generally will decline.

Global Total Return and Global Dynamic Income Funds may invest in derivative securities. The use of derivatives presents risks different from, and possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in traditional securities. There is no assurance that any derivative strategy used by the Funds will succeed. One of the risks associated with purchasing an option is that the Funds pay a premium whether or not an option is exercised.

Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a market price that is below their net asset value.

Leverage creates risks which may adversely affect return, including the likelihood of greater volatility of net asset value and market price of common shares; and fluctuations in dividend rates on any preferred shares.

 THE TRUST AND THE FUNDS

     The Trust was organized as a Massachusetts business trust on December 21,
1987. Each Fund is an open-end, diversified management investment company. Prior
to June 23, 1997, the name of the Trust was CFS Investment Trust. Market Neutral
Fund was named "Strategic Income Fund" prior to July 30, 1999. Prior to April 1,
2003, Growth and Income Fund was named "Convertible Growth and Income Fund" and 
Global Growth and Income Fund was named "Global Convertible Fund." Prior to     
December 1, 2003, the Value Fund was named "Mid Cap Value Fund."

 INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES

Each Fund's investment objective is shown below:                    

GROWTH FUND seeks long-term capital growth.                         

      BLUE CHIP FUND seeks long-term capital growth. Under normal circumstances,
the Blue Chip Fund will invest at least 80% of its net assets (plus borrowings) 
in "Blue Chip" companies.                                                       

VALUE FUND seeks long-term capital growth.                          

   GROWTH AND INCOME FUND seeks high long-term total return through growth
and current income. The Fund invests primarily in a diversified portfolio of    
convertible, fixed-income and equity securities.                                

   GLOBAL GROWTH AND INCOME FUND seeks high long-term total return through
capital appreciation and current income. The Fund invests primarily in a        
globally diversified portfolio of convertible, fixed-income and equity          
securities.                                                                     

HIGH YIELD FUND seeks the highest level of current income obtainable
consistent with reasonable risk. Its secondary objective is capital gain where  
consistent with its primary objective. Under normal circumstances, the High     
Yield Fund will invest at least 80% of its net assets (plus any borrowings) in  
high yield, fixed-income securities (junk bonds).                               

CONVERTIBLE FUND seeks current income with growth as its secondary  
objective. Under normal circumstances, the Convertible Fund will invest at least
80% of its net assets (plus any borrowings) in convertible securities.          

      MARKET NEUTRAL FUND seeks high current income consistent with stability of
principal. The Fund seeks to achieve its objective primarily through investment 
in convertible securities and employing short selling to enhance income and     
hedge against market risk.                                                      

The investment objectives of a Fund may not be changed without the  
approval of a "majority of outstanding" shares of that Fund, as defined in the  
Investment Company Act of 1940. Each of the Blue Chip Fund, Convertible Fund and
High Yield Fund will notify shareholders at least 60 days prior to any change in
its 80% policy.

INVESTMENT PRACTICES

 The prospectus contains information concerning each Fund's investment
objective and principal investment strategies and risks. This SAI provides      
additional information concerning certain securities and strategies used by the 
Funds and their associated risks.                                               

    In pursuing its investment objective, each Fund will invest as described
below and in the prospectus.                                                    

CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES                                                          

   Convertible securities include any corporate debt security or preferred
stock that may be converted into underlying shares of common stock. The common  
stock underlying convertible securities may be issued by a different entity than
the issuer of the convertible securities. Convertible securities entitle the    
holder to receive interest payments paid on corporate debt securities or the    
dividend preference on a preferred stock until such time as the convertible     
security matures or is redeemed or until the holder elects to exercise the      
conversion privilege. As a result of the conversion feature, however, the       
interest rate or dividend preference on a convertible security is generally less
than would be the case if the securities were issued in non-convertible form.   

  The value of convertible securities is influenced by both the yield of
non-convertible securities of comparable issuers and by the value of the        
underlying common stock. The value of a convertible security viewed without     
regard to its conversion feature (i.e., strictly on the basis of its yield) is  
sometimes referred to as its "investment value." The investment value of the    
convertible security typically will fluctuate inversely with changes in         
prevailing interest rates. However, at the same time, the convertible security  
will be influenced by its "conversion value," which is the market value of the  
underlying common stock that would be obtained if the convertible security were 
converted. Conversion value fluctuates directly with the price of the underlying
common stock.                                                                   

   If, because of a low price of the common stock, the conversion value is
substantially below the investment value of the convertible security, the price 
of the convertible security is governed principally by its investment value. If 
the conversion value of a convertible security increases to a point that        
approximates or exceeds its investment value, the value of the security will be 
principally influenced by its conversion value. A convertible security will sell
at a premium over its conversion value to the extent investors place value on   
the right to acquire the underlying common stock while holding a fixed income   
security. Holders of convertible securities have a claim on the assets of the   
issuer prior to the common stockholders, but may be subordinated to holders of  
similar non-convertible securities of the same issuer.                          

SYNTHETIC CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES 

      The Funds may create a "synthetic" convertible security by combining fixed
income securities with the right to acquire equity securities. In creating a    
synthetic security, the Fund may pool a basket of fixed-income securities and a 
basket of warrants or options that produce the economic characteristics similar 
to a convertible security. Within each basket of fixed-income                   

 3

P-->4976th�Page�of�75TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�6th
securities and warrants or options, different companies may issue the           
fixed-income and convertible components, which may be purchased separately and  
at different times.                                                             

   More flexibility is possible in the assembly of a synthetic convertible
security than in the purchase of a convertible security. Although synthetic     
convertible securities may be selected where the two components are issued by a 
single issuer, the character of a synthetic convertible security allows the     
combination of components representing distinct issuers, when management        
believes that such a combination would better promote the Fund's investment     
objective. A synthetic convertible security also is a more flexible investment  
in that its two components may be purchased separately. For example, the Fund   
may purchase a warrant for inclusion in a synthetic convertible security but    
temporarily hold short-term investments while postponing the purchase of a      
corresponding bond pending development of more favorable market conditions. The 
Convertible Fund's holdings of synthetic convertible securities are considered  
convertible securities for purposes of the Fund's policy to invest at least 80% 
of its net assets (plus any borrowings) in convertible securities.              

    A holder of a synthetic convertible security faces the risk of a decline
in the price of the security or the level of the index involved in the          
convertible component, causing a decline in the value of the call option or     
warrant purchased to create the synthetic convertible security. Should the price
of the stock fall below the exercise price and remain there throughout the      
exercise period, the entire amount paid for the call option or warrant would be 
lost. Because a synthetic convertible security includes the fixed-income        
component as well, the holder of a synthetic convertible security also faces the
risk that interest rates will rise, causing a decline in the value of the       
fixed-income instrument.                                                        

     The Funds may also purchase synthetic convertible securities manufactured
by other parties, including convertible structured notes. Convertible structured
notes are fixed income debentures linked to equity, and are typically issued by 
investment banks. Convertible structured notes have the attributes of a         
convertible security; however, the investment bank that issued the convertible  
note assumes the credit risk associated with the investment, rather than the    
issuer of the underlying common stock into which the note is convertible.       

DEBT SECURITIES                                                                 

     In pursuing its investment objective, each Fund may invest in convertible
and non-convertible debt securities, including lower-rated securities (i.e.,    
securities rated BB or lower by Standard & Poor's Corporation, a division of The
McGraw-Hill Companies ("S&P"), or Ba or lower by Moody's Investor Services, Inc.
("Moody's")) and securities that are not rated but are considered by the        
investment adviser to be of similar quality. There are no restrictions as to the
ratings of debt securities acquired by a Fund or the portion of a Fund's assets 
that may be invested in debt securities in a particular ratings category, except
that no Fund other than the High Yield Fund will acquire a security rated below 
C.                                                                              

     Securities rated BBB or Baa are considered to be medium grade and to have
speculative characteristics. Lower-rated debt securities are predominantly      
speculative with respect to the issuer's capacity to pay interest and repay     
principal. Investment in medium- or lower-quality debt securities involves      
greater investment risk, including the possibility of issuer default or         

 4

P-->4977th�Page�of�75TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�7th
bankruptcy. An economic downturn could severely disrupt the market for such     
securities and adversely affect the value of such securities. In addition,      
lower-quality bonds are less sensitive to interest rate changes than            
higher-quality instruments and generally are more sensitive to adverse economic 
changes or individual corporate developments. During a period of adverse        
economic changes, including a period of rising interest rates, issuers of such  
bonds may experience difficulty in servicing their principal and interest       
payment obligations.                                                            

Achievement by each Fund of its investment objective(s) will be more
dependent on the investment adviser's credit analysis than would be the case if 
the Fund were investing in higher-quality debt securities. Because the ratings  
of rating services (which evaluate the safety of principal and interest         
payments, not market risks) are used only as preliminary indicators of          
investment quality, the investment adviser employs its own credit research and  
analysis. These analyses may take into consideration such quantitative factors  
as an issuer's present and potential liquidity, profitability, internal         
capability to generate funds, debt/equity ratio and debt servicing capabilities,
and such qualitative factors as an assessment of management, industry           
characteristics, accounting methodology, and foreign business exposure.         

 Medium- and lower-quality debt securities may be less marketable than
higher-quality debt securities because the market for them is less broad. The   
market for unrated debt securities is even narrower. During periods of thin     
trading in these markets, the spread between bid and asked prices is likely to  
increase significantly, and the Fund may have greater difficulty selling its    
portfolio securities. The market value of these securities and their liquidity  
may be affected by adverse publicity and investor perceptions.                  

RULE 144A SECURITIES                                                            

      Each Fund may purchase securities that have been privately placed but that
are eligible for purchase and sale by certain qualified institutional buyers,   
such as the Funds, under Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933. The        
investment adviser, under the supervision of the Trust's board of trustees, will
consider whether securities purchased under Rule 144A are illiquid and thus     
subject to the Fund's restriction of investing no more than a specified         
percentage of its net assets in illiquid securities. A determination of whether 
a Rule 144A security is liquid or not is a question of fact. In making this     
determination, the investment adviser will consider the trading markets for the 
specific security, taking into account the unregistered nature of a Rule 144A   
security. In addition, the investment adviser may consider the (1) frequency of 
trades and quotes, (2) number of dealers and potential purchasers, (3) dealer   
undertakings to make a market and (4) nature of a security and of marketplace   
trades (e.g., the time needed to dispose of the security, the method of         
soliciting offers and the mechanics of transfer). The liquidity of Rule 144A    
securities will be monitored and, if as a result of changed conditions, it is   
determined that a Rule 144A security is no longer liquid, the Fund's holdings of
illiquid securities would be reviewed to determine what, if any, steps are      
required to assure that the Fund does not invest more than 10% (or 15% in the   
case of Global Growth and Income Fund) of its assets in illiquid securities.    
Investing in Rule 144A securities could have the effect of increasing the amount
of the Fund's assets invested in illiquid securities if qualified institutional 
buyers are unwilling to purchase such securities.

FOREIGN SECURITIES                                                              

    Global Growth and Income Fund may invest all of its net assets, and each
other Fund may invest up to 25% of its net assets, in securities of foreign     
issuers. For this purpose, foreign securities do not include American Depositary
Receipts (ADRs) or securities guaranteed by a United States person, but may     
include foreign securities in the form of European Depositary Receipts (EDRs),  
Global Depositary Receipts (GDRs) or other securities representing underlying   
shares of foreign issuers. Positions in those securities are not necessarily    
denominated in the same currency as the common stocks into which they may be    
converted. ADRs are receipts typically issued by an American bank or trust      
company evidencing ownership of the underlying securities. EDRs are European    
receipts listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange evidencing a similar           
arrangement. GDRs are U.S. dollar-denominated receipts issued by international  
banks evidencing ownership of foreign securities. Generally, ADRs, in registered
form, are designed for the U.S. securities markets and EDRs and GDRs, in bearer 
form, are designed for use in foreign securities markets. Each Fund may invest  
in sponsored or unsponsored ADRs. In the case of an unsponsored ADR, the Fund is
likely to bear its proportionate share of the expenses of the depository and it 
may have greater difficulty in receiving shareholder communications than it     
would have with a sponsored ADR.                                                

      To the extent positions in portfolio securities are denominated in foreign
currencies, a Fund's investment performance is affected by the relative strength
or weakness of the U.S. dollar against those currencies. For example, if the    
dollar falls in value relative to the Japanese yen, the dollar value of a       
Japanese stock held in the portfolio will rise even though the price of the     
stock remains unchanged. Conversely, if the dollar rises in value relative to   
the yen, the dollar value of the Japanese stock will fall. (See discussion of   
transaction hedging and portfolio hedging below under "Currency Exchange
Transactions.")                                                                 

    Investors should understand and consider carefully the risks involved in
foreign investing. Investing in foreign securities, which are generally         
denominated in foreign currencies, and utilization of forward foreign currency  
exchange contracts involve certain considerations comprising both risks and     
opportunities not typically associated with investing in U.S. securities. These 
considerations include: fluctuations in exchange rates of foreign currencies;   
possible imposition of exchange control regulation or currency restrictions that
would prevent cash from being brought back to the United States; less public    
information with respect to issuers of securities; less governmental supervision
of stock exchanges, securities brokers, and issuers of securities; lack of      
uniform accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards; lack of uniform 
settlement periods and trading practices; less liquidity and frequently greater 
price volatility in foreign markets than in the United States; possible         
imposition of foreign taxes; and sometimes less advantageous legal, operational 
and financial protections applicable to foreign sub-custodial arrangements.     

      Although the Funds intend to invest in companies and government securities
of countries having stable political environments, there is the possibility of  
expropriation or confiscatory taxation, seizure or nationalization of foreign   
bank deposits or other assets, establishment of exchange controls, the adoption 
of foreign government restrictions, or other adverse political, social or       
diplomatic developments that could affect investment in these nations.

P-->4979th�Page�of�75TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�9th
Each Fund other than Global Growth and Income Fund expects that     
substantially all of its foreign investments will be in developed nations.      
However, each Fund may invest in the securities of emerging countries. The      
securities markets of emerging countries are substantially smaller, less        
developed, less liquid and more volatile than the securities markets of the U.S.
and other more developed countries. Disclosure and regulatory standards in many 
respects are less stringent than in the U.S. and other major markets. There also
may be a lower level of monitoring and regulation of emerging markets and the   
activities of investors in such markets, and enforcement of existing regulations
has been extremely limited. Economies in individual emerging markets may differ 
favorably or unfavorably from the U.S. economy in such respects as growth of    
gross domestic product, rates of inflation, currency depreciation, capital      
reinvestment, resource self-sufficiency and balance of payments positions. Many 
emerging market countries have experienced high rates of inflation for many     
years, which has had and may continue to have very negative effects on the      
economies and securities markets of those countries.                            

CURRENCY EXCHANGE TRANSACTIONS 

   Currency exchange transactions may be conducted either on a spot (i.e.,
cash) basis at the spot rate for purchasing or selling currency prevailing in   
the foreign exchange market or through forward currency exchange contracts      
("forward contracts"). Forward contracts are contractual agreements to purchase 
or sell a specified currency at a specified future date (or within a specified  
time period) and price set at the time of the contract. Forward contracts are   
usually entered into with banks, foreign exchange dealers and broker-dealers,   
are not exchange traded, and are usually for less than one year, but may be     
renewed.                                                                        

Forward currency exchange transactions may involve currencies of the
different countries in which the Funds may invest and serve as hedges against   
possible variations in the exchange rate between these currencies. Currency     
exchange transactions are limited to transaction hedging and portfolio hedging  
involving either specific transactions or portfolio positions, except to the    
extent described below under "Synthetic Foreign Money Market Positions."        
Transaction hedging is the purchase or sale of forward contracts with respect to
specific receivables or payables of a Fund accruing in connection with the      
purchase and sale of its portfolio securities or the receipt of dividends or    
interest thereon. Portfolio hedging is the use of forward contracts with respect
to portfolio security positions denominated or quoted in a particular foreign   
currency. Portfolio hedging allows a Fund to limit or reduce its exposure in a  
foreign currency by entering into a forward contract to sell such foreign       
currency (or another foreign currency that acts as a proxy for that currency) at
a future date for a price payable in U.S. dollars so that the value of the      
foreign denominated portfolio securities can be approximately matched by a      
foreign denominated liability. A Fund may not engage in portfolio hedging with  
respect to the currency of a particular country to an extent greater than the   
aggregate market value (at the time of making such sale) of the securities held 
in its portfolio denominated or quoted in that particular currency, except that 
the Fund may hedge all or part of its foreign currency exposure through the use 
of a basket of currencies or a proxy currency where such currencies or currency 
act as an effective proxy for other currencies. In such a case, the Fund may    
enter into a forward contract where the amount of the foreign currency to be    
sold exceeds the value of the securities denominated in such currency. The use  
of this basket hedging technique may be more efficient                          

 7

P-->49710th�Page�of�75TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�10th
and economical than entering into separate forward contracts for each currency  
held in the Fund. No Fund may engage in "speculative" currency exchange         
transactions.                                                                   

If a Fund enters into a forward contract, the Fund's custodian will 
segregate liquid assets of the Fund having a value equal to the Fund's          
commitment under such forward contract. At the maturity of the forward contract 
to deliver a particular currency, the Fund may either sell the portfolio        
security related to the contract and make delivery of the currency, or it may   
retain the security and either acquire the currency on the spot market or       
terminate its contractual obligation to deliver the currency by purchasing an   
offsetting contract with the same currency trader obligating it to purchase on  
the same maturity date the same amount of the currency.                         

    It is impossible to forecast with absolute precision the market value of
portfolio securities at the expiration of a forward contract. Accordingly, it   
may be necessary for a Fund to purchase additional currency on the spot market  
(and bear the expense of such purchase) if the market value of the security is  
less than the amount of currency the Fund is obligated to deliver and if a      
decision is made to sell the security and make delivery of the currency.        
Conversely, it may be necessary to sell on the spot market some of the currency 
received upon the sale of the portfolio security if its market value exceeds the
amount of currency the Fund is obligated to deliver.                            

 If a Fund retains the portfolio security and engages in an offsetting
currency transaction, the Fund will incur a gain or a loss to the extent that   
there has been movement in forward contract prices. If the Fund engages in an   
offsetting currency transaction, it may subsequently enter into a new forward   
contract to sell the currency. Should forward prices decline during the period  
between the Fund's entering into a forward contract for the sale of a currency  
and the date it enters into an offsetting contract for the purchase of the      
currency, the Fund will realize a gain to the extent the price of the currency  
it has agreed to sell exceeds the price of the currency it has agreed to        
purchase. Should forward prices increase, the Fund will suffer a loss to the    
extent the price of the currency it has agreed to purchase exceeds the price of 
the currency it has agreed to sell. A default on the contract would deprive the 
Fund of unrealized profits or force the Fund to cover its commitments for       
purchase or sale of currency, if any, at the current market price.              

   Hedging against a decline in the value of a currency does not eliminate
fluctuations in the value of a portfolio security traded in that currency or    
prevent a loss if the value of the security declines. Hedging transactions also 
preclude the opportunity for gain if the value of the hedged currency should    
rise. Moreover, it may not be possible for a Fund to hedge against a devaluation
that is so generally anticipated that the Fund is not able to contract to sell  
the currency at a price above the devaluation level it anticipates. The cost to 
a Fund of engaging in currency exchange transactions varies with such factors as
the currency involved, the length of the contract period, and prevailing market 
conditions. Because currency exchange transactions are usually conducted on a   
principal basis, no fees or commissions are involved.                           

SYNTHETIC FOREIGN MONEY MARKET POSITIONS 

   Each Fund may invest in money market instruments denominated in foreign
currencies. In addition to, or in lieu of, such direct investment, a Fund may   
construct a synthetic foreign money market position by (a) purchasing a money   
market instrument denominated in one currency, generally U.S. dollars, and (b)  
concurrently entering into a forward contract to deliver                        

 8

P-->49711th�Page�of�75TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�11th
a corresponding amount of that currency in exchange for a different currency on 
a future date and at a specified rate of exchange. For example, a synthetic     
money market position in Japanese yen could be constructed by purchasing a U.S. 
dollar money market instrument, and entering concurrently into a forward        
contract to deliver a corresponding amount of U.S. dollars in exchange for      
Japanese yen on a specified date and at a specified rate of exchange. Because of
the availability of a variety of highly liquid short-term U.S. dollar money     
market instruments, a synthetic money market position utilizing such U.S. dollar
instruments may offer greater liquidity than direct investment in foreign       
currency and a concurrent construction of a synthetic position in such foreign  
currency, in terms of both income yield and gain or loss from changes in        
currency exchange rates, in general should be similar, but would not be         
identical because the components of the alternative investments would not be    
identical.                                                                      

SWAPS, CAPS, FLOORS AND COLLARS                                                 

   Each Fund may enter into interest rate, currency, index, credit default
and other swaps and the purchase or sale of related caps, floors and collars.   
Each Fund expects to enter into these transactions primarily to preserve a      
return or spread on a particular investment or portion of its portfolio, to     
protect against currency fluctuations, as a duration management technique or to 
protect against any increase in the price of securities the Fund anticipates    
purchasing at a later date. A Fund will not sell interest rate caps or floors   
where it does not own securities or other instruments providing the income      
stream the Fund may be obligated to pay. Interest rate swaps involve the        
exchange by a Fund with another party of their respective commitments to pay or 
receive interest, e.g., an exchange of floating rate payments for fixed rate    
payments with respect to a notional amount of principal. A currency swap is an  
agreement to exchange cash flows on a notional amount of two or more currencies 
based on the relative value differential among them and an index swap is an     
agreement to swap cash flows on a notional amount based on changes in the values
of the reference indices. A credit default swap is an agreement to transfer the 
credit exposure of fixed income products between parties. The purchase of a cap 
entitles the purchaser to receive payments on a notional principal amount from  
the party selling such cap to the extent that a specified index exceeds a       
predetermined interest rate or amount. The purchase of a floor entitles the     
purchaser to receive payments on a notional principal amount from the party     
selling such floor to the extent that a specified index falls below a           
predetermined interest rate or amount. A collar is a combination of a cap and a 
floor that preserves a certain return within a predetermined range of interest  
rates or values.                                                                

      A Fund will usually enter into swaps on a net basis, i.e., the two payment
streams are netted out in a cash settlement on the payment date or dates        
specified in the instrument, with the Fund receiving or paying, as the case may 
be, only the net amount of the two payments. Inasmuch as a Fund will segregate  
assets (or enter into offsetting positions) to cover its obligations under      
swaps, Calamos Advisors LLC ("Calamos Advisors") and the Trust believe such     
obligations do not constitute senior securities under the Investment Company Act
of 1940 and, accordingly, will not treat them as being subject to its borrowing 
restrictions. A Fund will not enter into any swap, cap, floor or collar         
transaction unless, at the time of entering into such transaction, the unsecured
long-term debt of the securities dealers, financial institutions or other       
parties with whom the Fund has entered into such a transaction                  
("Counterparties"), combined with any credit enhancements, is rated at least A  
by S&P or Moody's or has an equivalent rating from a NRSRO or is determined to  
be of equivalent credit quality by Calamos Advisors. If there                   

9 

P-->49712th�Page�of�75TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�12th
is a default by the Counterparty, the Fund may have contractual remedies        
pursuant to the agreements related to the transaction. The swap market has grown
substantially in recent years with a large number of banks and investment       
banking firms acting both as principals and as agents utilizing standardized    
swap documentation. As a result, the swap market has become relatively liquid,  
however, some swaps may be considered illiquid. Caps, floors and collars are    
more recent innovations for which standardized documentation has not yet been   
fully developed and, accordingly, they are less liquid than swaps.              

STRUCTURED PRODUCTS 

    Each Fund may invest in interests in entities organized and operated for
the purpose of restructuring the investment characteristics of certain other    
investments. This type of restructuring involves the deposit with or purchase by
an entity, such as a corporation or trust, of specified instruments and the     
issuance by that entity of one or more classes of securities ("structured
products") backed by, or representing interests in, the underlying instruments. 
The term "structured products" as used herein excludes synthetic convertibles.  
See "Investment Practices -- Synthetic Convertible Securities." The cash flow on
the underlying instruments may be apportioned among the newly issued structured 
products to create securities with different investment characteristics such as 
varying maturities, payment priorities and interest rate provisions, and the    
extent of the payments made with respect to structured products is dependent on 
the extent of the cash flow on the underlying instruments. A Fund may invest in 
structured products, which represent derived investment positions based on      
relationships among different markets or asset classes.                         

Each Fund may also invest in other types of structured products,    
including, among others, baskets of credit default swaps referencing a portfolio
of high-yield securities. A structured product may be considered to be leveraged
to the extent its interest rate varies by a magnitude that exceeds the magnitude
of the change in the index rate. Because they are linked to their underlying    
markets or securities, investments in structured products generally are subject 
to greater volatility than an investment directly in the underlying market or   
security. Total return on the structured product is derived by linking return to
one or more characteristics of the underlying instrument. Because certain       
structured products of the type in which a Fund may invest may involve no credit
enhancement, the credit risk of those structured products generally would be    
equivalent to that of the underlying instruments. A Fund may invest in a class  
of structured products that is either subordinated or unsubordinated to the     
right of payment of another class. Subordinated structured products typically   
have higher yields and present greater risks than unsubordinated structured     
products. Although a Fund's purchase of subordinated structured products would  
have similar economic effect to that of borrowing against the underlying        
securities, the purchase will not be deemed to be leverage for purposes of the  
Fund's limitations related to borrowing and leverage.                           

  Certain issuers of structured products may be deemed to be "investment
companies" as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940. As a result, the   
Fund's investments in these structured products may be limited by the           
restrictions contained in the Investment Company Act of 1940. Structured        
products are typically sold in private placement transactions, and there        
currently may not be active trading market for structured products. As a result,
certain structured products in which the Fund invests may be deemed illiquid.

LENDING OF PORTFOLIO SECURITIES                                                 

    Each Fund may lend its portfolio securities to broker-dealers and banks.
Any such loan must be continuously secured by collateral in cash or cash        
equivalents maintained on a current basis in an amount at least equal to the    
market value of the securities loaned by the Fund. The Fund would continue to   
receive the equivalent of the interest or dividends paid by the issuer on the   
securities loaned, and would also receive an additional return that may be in   
the form of a fixed fee or a percentage of the collateral. The Fund may pay     
reasonable fees to persons unaffiliated with the Fund for services in arranging 
these loans. The Fund would have the right to call the loan and obtain the      
securities loaned at any time on notice of not more than five business days. The
Fund would not have the right to vote the securities during the existence of the
loan but could call the loan to permit voting of the securities. In the event of
bankruptcy or other default of the borrower, the Fund could experience both     
delays in liquidating the loan collateral or recovering the loaned securities   
and losses, including (a) possible decline in the value of the collateral or in 
the value of the securities loaned during the period while the Fund seeks to    
enforce its rights thereto, (b) possible subnormal levels of income and lack of 
access to income during this period, and (c) expenses of enforcing its rights.  
In an effort to reduce these risks, the investment adviser will monitor the     
creditworthiness of the firms to which the Fund lends securities.               

REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS 

      Each Fund may invest in repurchase agreements, provided that Global Growth
and Income Fund may not invest more than 15%, and each other Fund may not invest
more than 10%, of its net assets in repurchase agreements maturing in more than 
seven days and any other illiquid securities. A repurchase agreement is a sale  
of securities to the Fund in which the seller agrees to repurchase the          
securities at a higher price, which includes an amount representing interest on 
the purchase price, within a specified time. In the event of bankruptcy of the  
seller, the Fund could experience both losses and delays in liquidating its     
collateral.                                                                     

OPTIONS ON SECURITIES, INDEXES AND CURRENCIES 

   Each Fund may purchase and sell (write) put options and call options on
securities, indexes or foreign currencies. A Fund may purchase agreements,      
sometimes called cash puts, that may accompany the purchase of a new issue of   
bonds from a dealer.                                                            

      A put option gives the purchaser of the option, upon payment of a premium,
the right to sell, and the writer the obligation to buy, the underlying         
security, commodity, index, currency or other instrument at the exercise price. 
For instance, a Fund's purchase of a put option on a security might be designed 
to protect its holdings in the underlying instrument (or, in some cases, a      
similar instrument) against a substantial decline in the market value by giving 
such Fund the right to sell such instrument at the option exercise price. A call
option, upon payment of a premium, gives the purchaser of the option the right  
to buy, and the seller the obligation to sell, the underlying instrument at the 
exercise price. A Fund's purchase of a call option on a security, financial     
future, index, currency or other instrument might be intended to protect a fund 
against an increase in the price of the underlying instrument that it intends to
purchase in the future by fixing the price at which it may purchase such        
instrument.                                                                     

11

P-->49714th�Page�of�75TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�14th
Each Fund is authorized to purchase and sell (write) exchange listed
options and over-the-counter options ("OTC options"). Exchange listed options   
are issued by a regulated intermediary such as the Options Clearing Corporation 
("OCC"), which guarantees the performance of the obligations of the parties to  
such options. The discussion below uses the OCC as an example, but is also      
applicable to other financial intermediaries.                                   

     With certain exceptions, OCC issued and exchange listed options generally
settle by physical delivery of the underlying security or currency, although in 
the future cash settlement may become available. Index options and Eurodollar   
instruments are cash settled for the net amount, if any, by which the option is 
"in-the-money" (i.e., where the value of the underlying instrument exceeds, in  
the case of a call option, or is less than, in the case of a put option, the    
exercise price of the option) at the time the option is exercised. Frequently,  
rather than taking or making delivery of the underlying instrument through the  
process of exercising the option, listed options are closed by entering into    
offsetting purchase or sale transactions that do not result in ownership of the 
new option.                                                                     

   OTC options are purchased from or sold to Counterparties through direct
bilateral agreement with the Counterparties. In contrast to exchange listed     
options, which generally have standardized terms and performance mechanics, all 
the terms of an OTC option, including such terms as method of settlement, term, 
exercise price, premium, guarantees and security, are set by negotiation of the 
parties. A Fund will only sell (write) OTC options (other than OTC currency     
options) that are subject to a buy-back provision permitting the Fund to require
the Counterparty to sell the option back to the Fund at a formula price within  
seven days. The Funds expect generally to enter into OTC options that have cash 
settlement provisions, although they are not required to do so. The staff of the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") currently takes the position that
OTC options purchased by a fund, and portfolio securities "covering" the amount 
of a fund's obligation pursuant to an OTC option sold by it (or the amount of   
assets equal to the formula price for the repurchase of the option, if any, less
the amount by which the option is "in the money") are illiquid, and are subject 
to a fund's limitation on investing no more than 10% of its net assets (or 15%  
in the case of Global Growth and Income Fund) in illiquid securities.           

      Each Fund may also purchase and sell (write) options on securities indices
and other financial indices. Options on securities indices and other financial  
indices are similar to options on a security or other instrument except that,   
rather than settling by physical delivery of the underlying instrument, they    
settle by cash settlement, i.e., an option or an index gives the holder the     
right to receive, upon exercise of the option, an amount of cash if the closing 
level of the index upon which the option is based exceeds, in the case of a     
call, or is less than, in the case of a put, the exercise price of the option   
(except if, in the case of an OTC option, physical delivery is specified). This 
amount of cash is equal to the excess of the closing price of the index over the
exercise price of the option, which also may be multiplied by a formula value.  
The seller of the option is obligated, in return for the premium received, to   
make delivery of this amount. The gain or loss on an option on an index depends 
on price movements in the instruments making upon the market, market segment,   
industry or other composite on which the underlying index is based, rather than 
price movements in individual securities, as is the case with respect to options
on securities.                                                                  

12

P-->49715th�Page�of�75TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�15th
  A Fund will sell (write) call options and put options only if they are
"covered." For example, a call option written by a Fund will require such Fund  
to hold the securities subject to the call (or securities convertible into the  
needed securities without additional consideration) or to segregate cash or     
liquid assets sufficient to purchase and deliver the securities if the call is  
exercised. A call option sold by a Fund on an index will require such Fund to   
own portfolio securities that correlate with the index or to segregate cash or  
liquid assets equal to the excess of the index value over the exercise price on 
a current basis. A put option written by a Fund requires such Fund to segregate 
cash or liquid assets equal to the exercise price.                              

 OTC options entered into by a Fund and OCC issued and exchange listed
index options will generally provide for cash settlement. As a result, when a   
Fund sells (writes) these instruments, it will only segregate an amount of cash 
or liquid assets equal to its accrued net obligations, as there is no           
requirement for payment or delivery of amounts in excess of the net amount.     
These amounts will equal 100% of the exercise price in the case of a non        
cash-settled put, the same as an OCC guaranteed listed option sold by a Fund, or
the "in-the-money" amount plus any sell-back formula amount in the case of a    
cash-settled put or call. In addition, when a Fund sells (writes) a call option 
on an index at a time when the in-the-money amount exceeds the exercise price,  
such Fund will segregate, until the option expires or is closed out, cash or    
cash equivalents equal in value to such excess. OCC issued and exchange listed  
options sold by a Fund other than those above generally settle with physical    
delivery, or with an election of either physical delivery or cash settlement and
such Fund will segregate an amount of cash or liquid assets equal to the full   
value of the option. OTC options settling with physical delivery, or with an    
election of either physical delivery or cash settlement, will be treated the    
same as other options settling with physical delivery.                          

     If an option written by a Fund expires, such Fund realizes a capital gain
equal to the premium received at the time the option was written. If an option  
purchased by a Fund expires, such Fund realizes a capital loss equal to the     
premium paid.                                                                   

     A Fund will realize a capital gain from a closing purchase transaction if
the cost of the closing option is less than the premium received from writing   
the option, or, if it is more, such Fund will realize a capital loss. If the    
premium received from a closing sale transaction is more than the premium paid  
to purchase the option, a Fund will realize a capital gain or, if it is less,   
such Fund will realize a capital loss. The principal factors affecting the      
market value of a put or a call option include supply and demand, interest      
rates, the current market price of the underlying security or index in relation 
to the exercise price of the option, the volatility of the underlying security  
or index, and the time remaining until the expiration date.                     

     A put or call option purchased by a Fund is an asset of such Fund, valued
initially at the premium paid for the option. The premium received for an option
written by a Fund is recorded as a deferred credit. The value of an option      
purchased or written is marked-to-market daily and is valued at the closing     
price on the exchange on which it is traded or, if not traded on an exchange or 
no closing price is available, at the mean between the last bid and asked       
prices.                                                                         

  RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OPTIONS. There are several risks associated with
transactions in options. For example, there are significant differences between 
the securities markets, the currency markets and the options markets that could 
result in an imperfect correlation among                                        

13

P-->49716th�Page�of�75TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�16th
these markets, causing a given transaction not to achieve its objectives. A     
decision as to whether, when and how to use options involves the exercise of    
skill and judgment, and even a well-conceived transaction may be unsuccessful to
some degree because of market behavior or unexpected events. The ability of a   
Fund to utilize options successfully will depend on the investment adviser's    
ability to predict pertinent market investments, which cannot be assured.       

A Fund's ability to close out its position as a purchaser or seller 
(writer) of an OCC or exchange listed put or call option is dependent, in part, 
upon the liquidity of the option market. Among the possible reasons for the     
absence of a liquid option market on an exchange are: (i) insufficient trading  
interest in certain options; (ii) restrictions on transactions imposed by an    
exchange; (iii) trading halts, suspensions or other restrictions imposed with   
respect to particular classes or series of options or underlying securities     
including reaching daily price limits; (iv) interruption of the normal          
operations of the OCC or an exchange; (v) inadequacy of the facilities of an    
exchange or OCC to handle current trading volume; or (vi) a decision by one or  
more exchanges to discontinue the trading of options (or a particular class or  
series of options), in which event the relevant market for that option on that  
exchange would cease to exist, although outstanding options on that exchange    
would generally continue to be exercisable in accordance with their terms. If a 
Fund were unable to close out an option that it has purchased on a security, it 
would have to exercise the option in order to realize any profit or the option  
would expire and become worthless. If a Fund were unable to close out a covered 
call option that it had written on a security, it would not be able to sell the 
underlying security until the option expired. As the writer of a covered call   
option on a security, a Fund foregoes, during the option's life, the opportunity
to profit from increases in the market value of the security covering the call  
option above the sum of the premium and the exercise price of the call. As the  
writer of a covered call option on a foreign currency, a Fund foregoes, during  
the option's life, the opportunity to profit from currency appreciation.        

   The hours of trading for listed options may not coincide with the hours
during which the underlying financial instruments are traded. To the extent that
the option markets close before the markets for the underlying financial        
instruments, significant price and rate movements can take place in the         
underlying markets that cannot be reflected in the option markets.              

Unless the parties provide for it, there is no central clearing or  
guaranty function in an OTC option. As a result, if the Counterparty (as        
described above under "Options on Securities, Indexes and Currencies") fails to 
make or take delivery of the security, currency or other instrument underlying  
an OTC option it has entered into with a Fund or fails to make a cash settlement
payment due in accordance with the terms of that option, a Fund will lose any   
premium it paid for the option as well as any anticipated benefit of the        
transaction. Accordingly, Calamos Advisors must assess the creditworthiness of  
each such Counterparty or any guarantor or credit enhancement of the            
Counterparty's credit to determine the likelihood that the terms of the OTC     
option will be satisfied.                                                       

      Each Fund may purchase and sell (write) call options on securities indices
and currencies. All calls sold by a Fund must be "covered." Even though a Fund  
will receive the option premium to help protect it against loss, a call sold by 
a Fund exposes such Fund during the term of the option to possible loss of      
opportunity to realize appreciation in the market price of the underlying       
security or instrument and may require a fund to hold a security or instrument  
that it                                                                         

14

P-->49717th�Page�of�75TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�17th
might otherwise have sold. Each Fund may purchase and sell (write) put options  
on securities indices and currencies. In selling (writing) put options, there is
a risk that a Fund may be required to buy the underlying security at a          
disadvantageous price above the market price.                                   

FUTURES CONTRACTS AND OPTIONS ON FUTURES CONTRACTS 

Each Fund may use interest rate futures contracts, index futures    
contracts, volatility index futures contracts and foreign currency futures      
contracts. An interest rate, index, volatility index or foreign currency futures
contract provides for the future sale by one party and purchase by another party
of a specified quantity of a financial instrument or the cash value of an       
index(1) at a specified price and time. A public market exists in futures       
contracts covering a number of indexes (including, but not limited to, the      
Standard & Poor's 500 Index, the Russell 2000 Index, the Value Line Composite   
Index, and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index) as well as financial    
instruments (including, but not limited to, U.S. Treasury bonds, U.S. Treasury  
notes, Eurodollar certificates of deposit and foreign currencies). Other index  
and financial instrument futures contracts are available and it is expected that
additional futures contracts will be developed and traded. Each Fund may enter  
into such contract if, in the investment adviser's opinion, such contract meets 
the investment parameters of the Fund.                                          

  Each Fund may purchase and write call and put futures options. Futures
options possess many of the same characteristics as options on securities,      
indexes and foreign currencies (discussed above). A futures option gives the    
holder the right, in return for the premium paid, to assume a long position     
(call) or short position (put) in a futures contract at a specified exercise    
price at any time during the period of the option. Upon exercise of a call      
option, the holder acquires a long position in the futures contract and the     
writer is assigned the opposite short position. In the case of a put option, the
opposite is true. The Fund might, for example, use futures contracts to hedge   
against or gain exposure to fluctuations in the general level of stock prices,  
anticipated changes in interest rates or currency fluctuations that might       
adversely affect either the value of the Fund's securities or the price of the  
securities that the Fund intends to purchase. Although other techniques could be
used to reduce or increase the Fund's exposure to stock price, interest rate and
currency fluctuations, the Fund may be able to achieve its desired exposure more
effectively and perhaps at a lower cost by using futures contracts and futures  
options.                                                                        

      A Fund will only enter into futures contracts and futures options that are
standardized and traded on an exchange, board of trade or similar entity, or    
quoted on an automated quotation system.                                        

    The success of any futures transaction depends on the investment adviser
correctly predicting changes in the level and direction of stock prices,        
interest rates, currency exchange rates and other factors. Should those         
predictions be incorrect, the Fund's return might have been better had the      
transaction not been attempted; however, in the absence of the ability to use   

----------                                                                      
(1)   A futures contract on an index is an agreement pursuant to which two      
    parties agree to take or make delivery of an amount of cash equal to the
      difference between the value of the index at the close of the last trading
day of the contract and the price at which the index contract was   
      originally written. Although the value of a securities index is a function
 of the value of certain specified securities, no physical delivery of
those securities is made.

futures contracts, the investment adviser might have taken portfolio actions in 
anticipation of the same market movements with similar investment results, but, 
presumably, at greater transaction costs.                                       

     When a purchase or sale of a futures contract is made by a Fund, the Fund
is required to deposit with its custodian (or broker, if legally permitted) a   
specified amount of cash or U.S. Government securities or other securities      
acceptable to the broker ("initial margin"). The margin required for a futures  
contract is set by the exchange on which the contract is traded and may be      
modified during the term of the contract, although a Fund's broker may require  
margin deposits in excess of the minimum required by the exchange. The initial  
margin is in the nature of a performance bond or good faith deposit on the      
futures contract, which is returned to the Fund upon termination of the         
contract, assuming all contractual obligations have been satisfied. The Fund    
expects to earn interest income on its initial margin deposits. A futures       
contract held by the Fund is valued daily at the official settlement price of   
the exchange on which it is traded. Each day the Fund pays or receives cash,    
called "variation margin," equal to the daily change in value of the futures    
contract. This process is known as "marking-to-market." Variation margin paid or
received by the Fund does not represent a borrowing or loan by the Fund but is  
instead settlement between the Fund and the broker of the amount one would owe  
the other if the futures contract had expired at the close of the previous day. 
In computing daily net asset value, the Fund will mark-to-market its open       
futures positions.                                                              

    The Fund is also required to deposit and maintain margin with respect to
put and call options on futures contracts written by it. Such margin deposits   
will vary depending on the nature of the underlying futures contract (and the   
related initial margin requirements), the current market value of the option and
other futures positions held by the Fund.                                       

     Although some futures contracts call for making or taking delivery of the
underlying securities, usually these obligations are closed out prior to        
delivery by offsetting purchases or sales of matching futures contracts (same   
exchange, underlying security or index, and delivery month). If an offsetting   
purchase price is less than the original sale price, the Fund engaging in the   
transaction realizes a capital gain, or if it is more, the Fund realizes a      
capital loss. Conversely, if an offsetting sale price is more than the original 
purchase price, the Fund engaging in the transaction realizes a capital gain, or
if it is less, the Fund realizes a capital loss. The transaction costs must also
be included in these calculations.                                              

      RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH FUTURES. There are several risks associated with the
use of futures contracts and futures options. A purchase or sale of a futures   
contract may result in losses in excess of the amount invested in the futures   
contract. In trying to increase or reduce market exposure, there can be no      
guarantee that there will be a correlation between price movements in the       
futures contract and in the portfolio exposure sought. In addition, there are   
significant differences between the securities and futures markets that could   
result in an imperfect correlation between the markets, causing a given         
transaction not to achieve its objectives. The degree of imperfection of        
correlation depends on circumstances such as: variations in speculative market  
demand for futures, futures options and the related securities, including       
technical influences in futures and futures options trading and differences     
between the securities markets and the securities underlying the standard       
contracts available for trading. For example, in the case of index futures      
contracts, the composition of the index, including the                          

16

P-->49719th�Page�of�75TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�19th
issuers and the weighing of each issue, may differ from the composition of the  
Fund's portfolio, and, in the case of interest rate futures contracts, the      
interest rate levels, maturities and creditworthiness of the issues underlying  
the futures contract may differ from the financial instruments held in the      
Fund's portfolio. A decision as to whether, when and how to use futures         
contracts involves the exercise of skill and judgment, and even a well-conceived
transaction may be unsuccessful to some degree because of market behavior or    
unexpected stock price or interest rate trends.                                 

      Futures exchanges may limit the amount of fluctuation permitted in certain
futures contract prices during a single trading day. The daily limit establishes
the maximum amount that the price of a futures contract may vary either up or   
down from the previous day's settlement price at the end of the current trading 
session. Once the daily limit has been reached in a futures contract subject to 
the limit, no more trades may be made on that day at a price beyond that limit. 
The daily limit governs only price movements during a particular trading day and
therefore does not limit potential losses because the limit may work to prevent 
the liquidation of unfavorable positions. For example, futures prices have      
occasionally moved to the daily limit for several consecutive trading days with 
little or no trading, thereby preventing prompt liquidation of positions and    
subjecting some holders of futures contracts to substantial losses. Stock index 
futures contracts are not normally subject to such daily price change           
limitations.                                                                    

      There can be no assurance that a liquid market will exist at a time when a
Fund seeks to close out a futures or futures option position. The Fund would be 
exposed to possible loss on the position during the interval of inability to    
close, and would continue to be required to meet margin requirements until the  
position is closed. In addition, many of the contracts discussed above are      
relatively new instruments without a significant trading history. As a result,  
there can be no assurance that an active secondary market will develop or       
continue to exist.                                                              

      LIMITATIONS ON OPTIONS AND FUTURES. If other options, futures contracts or
futures options of types other than those described herein are traded in the    
future, a Fund may also use those investment vehicles, provided the board of    
trustees determines that their use is consistent with the Fund's investment     
objective.                                                                      

A Fund will not enter into a futures contract or purchase an option 
thereon if, immediately thereafter, the initial margin deposits for futures     
contracts held by the Fund plus premiums paid by it for open futures option     
positions, less the amount by which any such positions are "in-the-money," (2)  
would exceed 5% of the Fund's total assets.                                     

----------                                                                      
(2)   A call option is "in-the-money" to the extent, if any, that the value of  
the futures contract that is the subject of the option exceeds the  
exercise price. A put option is "in-the-money" if the exercise price
exceeds the value of the futures contract that is the subject of the
option.                                                             

17

P-->49720th�Page�of�75TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�20th
   When purchasing a futures contract or writing a put option on a futures
contract, a Fund must maintain with its custodian (or broker, if legally        
permitted) cash or cash equivalents (including any margin) equal to the market  
value of such contract. When writing a call option on a futures contract, the   
Fund similarly will maintain with its custodian cash or cash equivalents        
(including any margin) equal to the amount by which such option is in-the-money 
until the option expires or is closed by the Fund.                              

   A Fund may not maintain open short positions in futures contracts, call
options written on futures contracts or call options written on indexes if, in  
the aggregate, the market value of all such open positions exceeds the current  
value of the securities in its portfolio, plus or minus unrealized gains and    
losses on the open positions, adjusted for the historical relative volatility of
the relationship between the portfolio and the positions. For this purpose, to  
the extent the Fund has written call options on specific securities in its      
portfolio, the value of those securities will be deducted from the current      
market value of the securities portfolio.                                       

 In order to comply with Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("CFTC")
Regulation 4.5 and thereby avoid being deemed a "commodity pool operator," a    
Fund may use commodity futures or commodity options contracts for either risk   
management or speculative purposes without any limitation on the notional value 
of such positions. The Funds have qualified for an exemption from registration  
as "commodity pool operators" pursuant to CFTC Regulation 4.5 and, therefore,   
are not subject to registration or regulation under the Commodity Exchange Act, 
as amended.                                                                     

     TAXATION OF OPTIONS AND FUTURES. If a Fund exercises a call or put option
that it holds, the premium paid for the option is added to the cost basis of the
security purchased (call) or deducted from the proceeds of the security sold    
(put). For cash settlement options and futures options exercised by the Fund,   
the difference between the cash received at exercise and the premium paid is a  
capital gain or loss.                                                           

  If a call or put option written by a Fund is exercised, the premium is
included in the proceeds of the sale of the underlying security (call) or       
reduces the cost basis of the security purchased (put). For cash settlement     
options and futures options written by the Fund, the difference between the cash
paid at exercise and the premium received is a capital gain or loss.            

    Entry into a closing purchase transaction will result in capital gain or
loss. If an option written by a Fund was in-the-money at the time it was written
and the security covering the option was held for more than the long-term       
holding period prior to the writing of the option, any loss realized as a result
of a closing purchase transaction will be long-term. The holding period of the  
securities covering an in-the-money option will not include the period of time  
the option is outstanding.                                                      

     If a Fund writes an equity call option(3) other than a "qualified covered
call option," as defined in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  
"Code"), any loss on such option                                                

----------                                                                      
(3)   An equity option is an option to buy or sell stock, and any other option  
  whose value is determined by reference to an index of stocks of a type
     that is ineligible to be traded on a commodity futures exchange (e.g., an
  option contract on a sub-index based on the price of nine hotel-casino
stocks). An option on a broad-based stock index (such as the S&P 500
index) is not an equity option.

transaction, to the extent it does not exceed the unrealized gains on the       
securities covering the option, may be subject to deferral until the securities 
covering the option have been sold.                                             

  A futures contract held until delivery results in capital gain or loss
equal to the difference between the price at which the futures contract was     
entered into and the settlement price on the earlier of delivery notice date or 
expiration date. If the Fund delivers securities under a futures contract, the  
Fund also realizes a capital gain or loss on those securities.                  

      For federal income tax purposes, a Fund generally is required to recognize
as income for each taxable year its net unrealized gains and losses as of the   
end of the year on futures, futures options and non-equity options positions    
("year-end mark-to-market"). Generally, any gain or loss recognized with respect
to such positions (either by year-end mark-to-market or by actual closing of the
positions) is considered to be 60% long-term and 40% short-term, without regard 
to the holding periods of the contracts. However, in the case of positions      
classified as part of a "mixed straddle," the recognition of losses on certain  
positions (including options, futures and futures options positions, the related
securities and certain successor positions thereto) may be deferred to a later  
taxable year. Sale of futures contracts or writing of call options (or futures  
call options) or buying put options (or futures put options) that are intended  
to hedge against a change in the value of securities held by the Fund: (1) will 
affect the holding period of the hedged securities; and (2) may cause unrealized
gain or loss on such securities to be recognized upon entry into the hedge.     

  If a Fund were to enter into a short index future, short index futures
option or short index option position and the Fund's portfolio were deemed to   
"mimic" the performance of the index underlying such contract, the option or    
futures contract position and the Fund's stock positions would be deemed to be  
positions in a mixed straddle, subject to the above-mentioned loss deferral     
rules.                                                                          

In order for a Fund to continue to qualify for federal income tax   
treatment as a regulated investment company, at least 90% of its gross income   
for a taxable year must be derived from qualifying income; i.e., dividends,     
interest, income derived from loans of securities and gains from the sale of    
securities or foreign currencies, or other income (including but not limited to 
gains from options, futures or forward contracts). Any net gain realized from   
futures (or futures options) contracts will be considered gain from the sale of 
securities and therefore be qualifying income for purposes of the 90%           
requirement.                                                                    

     Each Fund distributes to shareholders annually any net capital gains that
have been recognized for federal income tax purposes (including year-end        
mark-to-market gains) on options and futures transactions. Such distributions   
are combined with distributions of capital gains realized on the Fund's other   
investments, and shareholders are advised of the nature of the payments.        

WARRANTS                                                                        

     Each Fund may invest in warrants. A warrant is a right to purchase common
stock at a specific price (usually at a premium above the market value of the   
underlying common stock at time of issuance) during a specified period of time. 
A warrant may have a life ranging from less                                     

19

P-->49722nd�Page�of�75TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�22nd
than a year to twenty years or longer, but a warrant becomes worthless unless it
is exercised or sold before expiration. In addition, if the market price of the 
common stock does not exceed the warrant's exercise price during the life of the
warrant, the warrant will expire worthless. Warrants have no voting rights, pay 
no dividends and have no rights with respect to the assets of the corporation   
issuing them. The percentage increase or decrease in the value of a warrant may 
be greater than the percentage increase or decrease in the value of the         
underlying common stock.                                                        

PORTFOLIO TURNOVER                                                              

Although the Funds do not purchase securities with a view to rapid  
turnover, there are no limitations on the length of time that portfolio         
securities must be held. Portfolio turnover can occur for a number of reasons,  
including calls for redemption, general conditions in the securities markets,   
more favorable investment opportunities in other securities, or other factors   
relating to the desirability of holding or changing a portfolio investment. The 
portfolio turnover rates may vary greatly from year to year. A high rate of     
portfolio turnover in a Fund would result in increased transaction expense,     
which must be borne by that Fund. High portfolio turnover may also result in the
realization of capital gains or losses and, to the extent net short-term capital
gains are realized, any distributions resulting from such gains will be         
considered ordinary income for federal income tax purposes. Portfolio turnover  
for each Fund is shown under "Financial Highlights" in the prospectus.          

SHORT SALES                                                                     

    Each Fund may attempt to hedge against market risk and to enhance income
by selling short "against the box," that is: (1) entering into short sales of   
securities that it currently has the right to acquire through the conversion or 
exchange of other securities that it owns, or to a lesser extent, entering into 
short sales of securities that it currently owns; and (2) entering into         
arrangements with the broker-dealers through which such securities are sold     
short to receive income with respect to the proceeds of short sales during the  
period the Fund's short positions remain open. Each Fund other than Market      
Neutral Fund may make short sales of securities only if at all times when a     
short position is open the Fund owns an equal amount of such securities or      
securities convertible into or exchangeable for, without payment of any further 
consideration, securities of the same issue as, and equal in amount to, the     
securities sold short.                                                          

      In addition to selling short against the box, Market Neutral Fund may sell
short securities that it currently has the right to acquire upon payment of     
additional consideration, for instance, upon exercise of a warrant or option.   
Market Neutral Fund would use this technique to hedge against market risk in    
connection with a synthetic convertible security in the same way selling short  
against the box hedges against market risk in connection with a true convertible
security.                                                                       

In a short sale against the box, a Fund does not deliver from its   
portfolio the securities sold and does not receive immediately the proceeds from
the short sale. Instead, the Fund borrows the securities sold short from a      
broker-dealer through which the short sale is executed, and the broker-dealer   
delivers such securities, on behalf of the Fund, to the purchaser of such       
securities. Such broker-dealer is entitled to retain the proceeds from the short
sale until the Fund delivers to such broker-dealer the securities sold short. In
addition, the Fund is required to pay to the broker-dealer the amount of any    
dividends paid on shares sold short. Finally, to secure its                     

20

P-->49723rd�Page�of�75TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�23rd
obligation to deliver to such broker-dealer the securities sold short, the Fund 
must deposit and continuously maintain in a separate account with the Fund's    
custodian an equivalent amount of the securities sold short or securities       
convertible into or exchangeable for such securities without the payment of     
additional consideration. The Fund is said to have a short position in the      
securities sold until it delivers to the broker-dealer the securities sold, at  
which time the Fund receives the proceeds of the sale. Because the Fund         
ordinarily will want to continue to hold securities in its portfolio that are   
sold short, the Fund will normally close out a short position by purchasing on  
the open market and delivering to the broker-dealer an equal amount of the      
securities sold short, rather than by delivering portfolio securities.          

A short sale works the same way, except that the Fund places in the 
segregated account cash or U.S. government securities equal in value to the     
difference between (i) the market value of the securities sold short at the time
they were sold short and (ii) any cash or U.S. government securities required to
be deposited with the broker as collateral. In addition, so long as the short   
position is open, the Fund must adjust daily the value of the segregated account
so that the amount deposited in it, plus any amount deposited with the broker as
collateral, will equal the current market value of the security sold short.     
However, the value of the segregated account may not be reduced below the point 
at which the segregated account, plus any amount deposited with the broker, is  
equal to the market value of the securities sold short at the time they were    
sold short.                                                                     

     Market Neutral Fund will conduct its short sales so that no more than 10%
of the net assets of the Fund, when added together, will be (i) deposited with  
brokers as collateral, and (ii) allocated to segregated accounts in connection  
with short sales, at any time.                                                  

     Short sales may protect a Fund against the risk of losses in the value of
its portfolio securities because any unrealized losses with respect to such     
portfolio securities should be wholly or partially offset by a corresponding    
gain in the short position. However, any potential gains in such portfolio      
securities should be wholly or partially offset by a corresponding loss in the  
short position. The extent to which such gains or losses are offset will depend 
upon the amount of securities sold short relative to the amount the Fund owns,  
either directly or indirectly, and, in the case where the Fund owns convertible 
securities, changes in the conversion premium.                                  

         Short sale transactions of a Fund involve certain risks. In particular,
the imperfect correlation between the price movements of the convertible        
securities and the price movements of the underlying common stock being sold    
short creates the possibility that losses on the short sale hedge position may  
be greater than gains in the value of the portfolio securities being hedged. In 
addition, to the extent that a Fund pays a conversion premium for a convertible 
security, the Fund is generally unable to protect against a loss of such premium
pursuant to a short sale hedge. In determining the number of shares to be sold  
short against a Fund's position in the convertible securities, the anticipated  
fluctuation in the conversion premiums is considered. A Fund will also incur    
transaction costs in connection with short sales. Certain provisions of the Code
may limit the degree to which the Fund is able to enter into short sales, which 
limitations might impair the Fund's ability to achieve its investment objective.
See "Taxation."

    In addition to enabling a Fund to hedge against market risk, short sales
may afford a Fund an opportunity to earn additional current income to the extent
the Fund is able to enter into arrangements with broker-dealers through which   
the short sales are executed to receive income with respect to the proceeds of  
the short sales during the period the Fund's short positions remain open.       

The Code imposes constructive sale treatment for federal income tax 
purposes on certain hedging strategies with respect to appreciated securities.  
Under these rules taxpayers will recognize gain, but not loss, with respect to  
securities if they enter into short sales or "offsetting notional principal     
contracts" (as defined by the Act), or futures or "forward contracts" (as       
defined by the Act) with respect to the same or substantially identical         
property, or if they enter into such transactions and then acquire the same or  
substantially identical property. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to
promulgate regulations that will treat as constructive sales certain            
transactions that have substantially the same effect as short sales.            

"WHEN-ISSUED" AND DELAYED DELIVERY SECURITIES AND REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS 

  Each Fund may purchase securities on a when-issued or delayed-delivery
basis. Although the payment and interest terms of these securities are          
established at the time the Fund enters into the commitment, the securities may 
be delivered and paid for a month or more after the date of purchase, when their
value may have changed. The Fund makes such commitments only with the intention 
of actually acquiring the securities, but may sell the securities before        
settlement date if Calamos Advisors deems it advisable for investment reasons.  
The Fund may utilize spot and forward foreign currency exchange transactions to 
reduce the risk inherent in fluctuations in the exchange rate between one       
currency and another when securities are purchased or sold on a when-issued or  
delayed-delivery basis.                                                         

 Each Fund may enter into reverse repurchase agreements with banks and
securities dealers. A reverse repurchase agreement is a repurchase agreement in 
which the Fund is the seller of, rather than the investor in, securities and    
agrees to repurchase them at an agreed-upon time and price. Use of a reverse    
repurchase agreement may be preferable to a regular sale and later repurchase of
securities because it avoids certain market risks and transaction costs.        

At the time when a Fund enters into a binding obligation to purchase
securities on a when-issued basis or enters into a reverse repurchase agreement,
liquid assets (cash, U.S. Government securities or other "high-grade" debt      
obligations) of the Fund having a value at least as great as the purchase price 
of the securities to be purchased will be segregated on the books of the Fund   
and held by the custodian throughout the period of the obligation. The use of   
these investment strategies, as well as borrowing under a line of credit as     
described below, may increase net asset value fluctuation.                      

ILLIQUID SECURITIES                                                             

   Global Growth and Income Fund may invest up to 15% of its total assets,
and each other Fund may invest up to 10% of its total assets, taken at market   
value, in illiquid securities, including any securities that are not readily    
marketable either because they are restricted securities or for other reasons.  
Restricted securities are securities that are subject to restrictions           

22

P-->49725th�Page�of�75TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�25th
on resale because they have not been registered for sale under the Securities   
Act of 1933. A position in restricted securities might adversely affect the     
liquidity and marketability of a portion of the Fund's portfolio, and the Fund  
might not be able to dispose of its holdings in such securities promptly or at  
reasonable prices. In those instances where a Fund is required to have          
restricted securities held by it registered prior to sale by the Fund and the   
Fund does not have a contractual commitment from the issuer or seller to pay the
costs of such registration, the gross proceeds from the sale of securities would
be reduced by the registration costs and underwriting discounts. Any such       
registration costs are not included in the percentage limitation on a Fund's    
investment in restricted securities.                                            

TEMPORARY INVESTMENTS                                                           

Each Fund may make temporary investments without limitation when the
investment adviser determines that a defensive position is warranted. Such      
investments may be in money market instruments, consisting of obligations of, or
guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the U.S. Government or its agencies 
or instrumentalities; certificates of deposit, bankers' acceptances and other   
obligations of domestic banks having total assets of at least $500 million and  
that are regulated by the U.S. Government, its agencies or instrumentalities;   
commercial paper rated in the highest category by a recognized rating agency;   
and repurchase agreements.                                                      

REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS 

   As part of its strategy for the temporary investment of cash, each Fund
may enter into "repurchase agreements" pertaining to U.S. Government securities 
with member banks of the Federal Reserve System or primary dealers (as          
designated by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York) in such securities. A       
repurchase agreement arises when a Fund purchases a security and simultaneously 
agrees to resell it to the vendor at an agreed upon future date. The resale     
price is greater than the purchase price, reflecting an agreed upon market rate 
of return that is effective for the period of time the Fund holds the security  
and that is not related to the coupon rate on the purchased security. Such      
agreements generally have maturities of no more than seven days and could be    
used to permit a Fund to earn interest on assets awaiting long term investment. 
The Funds require continuous maintenance by the custodian for the Fund's account
in the Federal Reserve/Treasury Book Entry System of collateral in an amount    
equal to, or in excess of, the market value of the securities that are the      
subject of a repurchase agreement. Repurchase agreements maturing in more than  
seven days are considered illiquid securities. In the event of a bankruptcy or  
other default of a seller of a repurchase agreement, the Fund could experience  
both delays in liquidating the underlying security and losses, including: (a)   
possible decline in the value of the underlying security during the period while
the Fund seeks to enforce its rights thereto; (b) possible subnormal levels of  
income and lack of access to income during this period; and (c) expenses of     
enforcing its rights.                                                           

 INVESTMENT RESTRICTIONS

Each Fund has elected to be classified as a diversified, open-end   
management investment company.                                                  

23

P-->49726th�Page�of�75TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�26th
     Unless otherwise noted, each Fund operates under the following investment
restrictions. A Fund may not:                                                   

(i)   (for Blue Chip Fund, Value Fund, Global Growth and Income Fund and High   
Yield Fund only) make any investment inconsistent with the Fund's   
   classification as a diversified investment company under the Investment
     Company Act of 1940 if the Fund is classified as a diversified investment
company;                                                            

      (for each of the other Funds) as to 75% of its assets, invest more than 5%
  of its total assets, taken at market value at the time of a particular
purchase, in the securities of any one issuer, except that this     
restriction does not apply to securities issued or guaranteed by the
United States Government or its agencies or instrumentalities;      

(ii)  acquire more than 10%, taken at the time of a particular purchase, of the 
outstanding voting securities of any one issuer;                    

(iii) act as an underwriter of securities, except insofar as it may be deemed an
    underwriter for purposes of the Securities Act of 1933 on disposition of
securities acquired subject to legal or contractual restrictions on 
resale;                                                             

(iv)  (for each Fund other than Blue Chip Fund, Value Fund, Global Growth and   
   Income Fund and High Yield Fund) invest more than 10% of the Fund's net
   assets (taken at market value at the time of each purchase) in illiquid
   securities, including repurchase agreements maturing in more than seven
days;                                                               

(v)   (for Blue Chip Fund, Value Fund, Global Growth and Income Fund and High   
   Yield Fund only) purchase or sell real estate (although it may purchase
 securities secured by real estate or interests therein, or securities
 issued by companies that invest in real estate or interests therein),
     commodities or commodity contracts, except that a Fund may (a) enter into
  futures, options and options on futures, (b) forward contracts and (c)
other financial transactions not requiring the delivery of physical 
commodities;                                                        

   (for each of the other Funds) purchase or sell real estate (although it
   may purchase securities secured by real estate or interests therein, or
  securities issued by companies that invest in real estate or interests
therein), commodities or commodity contracts;                       

(vi)  make loans, but this restriction shall not prevent the Fund from (a)      
    investing in debt obligations, (b) investing in repurchase agreements or
(c) lending portfolio securities;                                   

(vii) (for Blue Chip Fund, Value Fund, Global Growth and Income Fund and High   
  Yield Fund only) borrow, except from banks, other affiliated Funds and
      other entities to the extent permitted under the Investment Company Act of
1940;                                                               

     (for each of the other Funds) borrow, except that the Fund may (a) borrow
    up to 10% of its total assets, taken at market value at the time of such
      borrowing, as a temporary measure for extraordinary or emergency purposes,
 but not to increase portfolio income (the total of reverse repurchase
agreements and such borrowings will not exceed 10% of               

24

P-->49727th�Page�of�75TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�27th
total assets, and the Fund will not purchase securities when its    
    borrowings exceed 5% of total assets) and (b) enter into transactions in
options;                                                            

(viii)invest in a security if more than 25% of its total assets (taken at       
   market value at the time of a particular purchase) would be invested in
  the securities of issuers in any particular industry, except that this
     restriction does not apply to securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S.
Government or its agencies or instrumentalities; or                 

(ix)  (for Blue Chip Fund, Value Fund, Global Growth and Income Fund and High   
      Yield Fund only) issue any senior security, except to the extent permitted
under the Investment Company Act of 1940;                           

    (for each of the other Funds) issue any senior security, except that the
Market Neutral Fund may sell securities short.                      

  The above restrictions are fundamental policies and may not be changed
with respect to a Fund without the approval of a "majority" of the outstanding  
shares of that Fund, which for this purpose means the approval of the lesser of 
(a) more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of that Fund or (b) 67%  
or more of the outstanding shares if the holders of more than 50% of the        
outstanding shares of that Fund are present or represented at the meeting by    
proxy.                                                                          

   Currently under the Investment Company Act of 1940, a "senior security"
does not include any promissory note or evidence of indebtedness where such loan
is for temporary purposes only and in an amount not exceeding 5% of the value of
the total assets of the issuer at the time the loan is made. A loan is presumed 
to be for temporary purposes if it is repaid within sixty days and is not       
extended or renewed.                                                            

In addition to the fundamental restrictions listed above, and as a  
non-fundamental policy, no Fund may (except as indicated):                      

    (a)   invest in shares of other open-end investment companies, except as
permitted by the Investment Company Act of 1940;                                

(b)   invest in companies for the purpose of exercising control or  
management;                                                                     

  (c)   purchase securities on margin (except for use of such short-term
credits as are necessary for the clearance of transactions, including           
transactions in options, futures and options on futures), or participate on a   
joint or a joint and several basis in any trading account in securities, except 
in connection with transactions in options, futures and options on futures;     

   (d)   make short sales of securities, except that a Fund may make short
sales of securities (i) if the Fund owns an equal amount of such securities, or 
owns securities that are convertible or exchangeable, without payment of further
consideration, into an equal amount of such securities and (ii) Market Neutral  
Fund may make short sales of securities other than those described in clause    
(i), provided that no more than 10% of its net assets would, when added         
together, be deposited with brokers as collateral or allocated to segregated    
accounts in connection with short sales other than those described in clause    
(i);                                                                            

25

P-->49728th�Page�of�75TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�28th
     (e)   invest more than 25% of its net assets (valued at time of purchase)
in securities of foreign issuers (other than securities represented by ADRs and 
securities guaranteed by a U.S. person), except that Global Growth and Income   
Fund may invest all of its assets in securities of foreign issuers.             

    (f)   (for Blue Chip Fund, Value Fund, Global Growth and Income Fund and
High Yield Fund only) invest more than 10% (or 15% in the case of Global Growth 
and Income Fund) of the Fund's net assets (taken at market value at the time of 
each purchase) in illiquid securities, including repurchase agreements maturing 
in more than seven days;                                                        

   The non-fundamental investment restrictions above may be changed by the
board of trustees without shareholder approval.                                 

      Notwithstanding the foregoing investment restrictions, a Fund may purchase
securities pursuant to the exercise of subscription rights, subject to the      
condition that such purchase will not result in the Fund's ceasing to be a      
diversified investment company. Far Eastern and European corporations frequently
issue additional capital stock by means of subscription rights offerings to     
existing shareholders at a price substantially below the market price of the    
shares. The failure to exercise such rights would result in the Fund's interest 
in the issuing company being diluted. The market for such rights is not well    
developed in all cases and, accordingly, the Fund may not always realize full   
value on the sale of rights. The exception applies in cases where the limits set
forth in the investment restrictions would otherwise be exceeded by exercising  
rights or would have already been exceeded as a result of fluctuations in the   
market value of the Fund's portfolio securities with the result that the Fund   
would be forced either to sell securities at a time when it might not otherwise 
have done so, to forego exercising the rights.                                  

MANAGEMENT
TRUSTEES AND OFFICERS                                                           

The management of the Trust, including general supervision of the duties        
performed for each Fund under the Investment Management Agreement, is the       
responsibility of its board of trustees. Each trustee elected will hold office  
for the lifetime of the Trust or until such trustee's earlier resignation, death
or removal; however, each trustee who is not an interested person of the Trust  
shall retire as a trustee at the end of the calendar year in which the trustee  
attains the age of 72 years.                                                    

The following table sets forth each trustee's position(s) with the Trust, age,  
principal occupation during the past five years, number of portfolios overseen, 
other directorships, and the date on which such trustee first became a trustee  
of the Trust. Each trustee oversees each Fund of the Trust.

COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES. The Trust's board of trustees  
currently has three standing committees:                                        

Executive Committee. Messrs. John Calamos and Nick Calamos are members of the   
executive committee, which has authority during intervals between meetings of   
the board of trustees to exercise the powers of the board, with certain         
exceptions. Both John Calamos and Nick Calamos are interested trustees of the   
Trust.                                                                          

Audit Committee. Messrs. Hanauer, Marsh, Neal, Rybak and Timbers serve on the   
audit committee. The audit committee operates under a written charter adopted   
and approved by the board. The audit committee selects independent auditors,    
approves services to be rendered by the auditors, monitors the auditors'        
performance, reviews the results of the Trust's audit, determines whether to    
recommend to the board that the Trust's audited financial statements be included
in the Trust's annual report and responds to other matters deemed appropriate by
the board. All members of the audit committee are independent trustees of the   
Trust.                                                                          

Governance Committee. Messrs. Hanauer, Marsh, Neal, Rybak and Timbers serve on  
the governance committee. The governance committee operates under a written     
charter adopted and approved by the board. The governance committee oversees the
independence and effective functioning of the board of trustees and endeavors to
be informed about good practices for

mutual fund boards. The governance committee also functions as a nominating     
committee by making recommendations to the board of trustees regarding          
candidates for election as non-interested trustees. In making such              
recommendations, the governance committee considers a number of factors,        
including a candidate's background, integrity, knowledge and relevant           
experience. These factors are set forth in an appendix to the written charter.  
Any prospective candidate is interviewed by the trustees, and references are    
checked. The governance committee does not have a policy to consider shareholder
recommendations regarding candidates for election as trustees. The committee    
determined that it is appropriate not to have a policy to consider shareholder  
recommendations because the current process of identifying and recommending     
potential candidates is sufficient to ensure a knowledgeable and independent    
board. All members of the governance committee are independent trustees of the  
Trust.                                                                          

In addition to the above committees, there is a pricing committee, appointed by 
the board of trustees, comprised of officers of the Trust and employees of      
Calamos Advisors.                                                               

During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004, the Trust's board of trustees held 
five meetings, the executive committee held one meeting, the audit committee    
held five meetings, and the governance committee held five meetings. All of the 
trustees and committee members then serving attended at least 75% of the        
meetings of the board of trustees and applicable committees held during each    
such fiscal year.

The Trust has adopted a deferred compensation plan (the "Plan"). Under the Plan,
a trustee who is not an "interested person" of Calamos Advisors and has elected 
to participate in the Plan (a "participating trustee") may defer receipt of all 
or a portion of his compensation from the Trust to defer payment of income taxes
or for other reasons. The deferred compensation payable to the participating    
trustee is credited to the trustee's deferral account as of the business day    
such compensation would have been paid to the trustee. The value of a trustee's 
deferred compensation account at any time is equal to what would be the value if
the amounts credited to the account had instead been invested in shares of one  
or more of the Funds of the Trust as designated by the trustee. Thus, the value 
of the account increases with contributions to the account or with increases in 
the value of the measuring shares, and the value of the account decreases with  
withdrawals from the account or with declines in the value of the measuring     
shares. If a participating trustee retires, the trustee may elect to receive    
payments under the plan in a lump sum or in equal annual installments over a    
period of five years. If a participating trustee dies, any amount payable under 
the Plan will be paid to the trustee's beneficiaries. Each Fund's obligation to 
make payments under the Plan is a general obligation of that Fund. No Fund is   
liable for any other Fund's obligations to make payments under the Plan.        

  CODE OF ETHICS. Employees of Calamos Advisors and CFS are permitted to
make personal securities transactions, including transactions in securities that
the Trust may purchase, sell or hold, subject to requirements and restrictions  
set forth in the Code of Ethics of the Trust, Calamos Advisors and CFS. The Code
of Ethics contains provisions and requirements designed to identify and address 
certain conflicts of interest between personal investment activities of Calamos 
Advisors and CFS employees and the interests of investment advisory clients such
as the Trust. Among other things, the Code of Ethics prohibits certain types of 
transactions absent prior approval, imposes time periods during which personal  
transactions may not be made in certain securities, and requires the submission 
of duplicate broker confirmations and statements and quarterly reporting of     
securities transactions. Additional restrictions apply to portfolio managers,   
traders, research analysts and others involved in the investment advisory       
process. Exceptions to these and other provisions of the Code of Ethics may be  
granted in particular circumstances after review by appropriate personnel.      

PROXY VOTING PROCEDURES. Each Fund has delegated proxy voting       
responsibilities to Calamos Advisors, subject to the board of trustees' general 
oversight. Each Fund expects Calamos Advisors to vote proxies related to that   
Fund's portfolio securities for which the Fund has voting authority consistent  
with the Fund's best economic interests. Calamos Advisors has adopted its own   
Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures ("Policies"). The Policies address, among  
other things, conflicts of interest that may arise between the interests of the 
Funds, and the interests of the adviser and its affiliates.                     

  The following is a summary of the Policies used by Calamos Advisors in
voting proxies.                                                                 

To assist it in voting proxies, Calamos Advisors has established a  
Committee comprised of members of its Portfolio Management and Research         
Departments. The Committee and/or its members will vote proxies using the       
following guidelines.                                                           

    In general, if Calamos Advisors believes that a company's management and
board have interests sufficiently aligned with the Fund's interest, Calamos     
Advisors will vote in favor of                                                  

30

P-->49733rd�Page�of�75TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�33rd
proposals recommended by a company's board. More specifically, Calamos Advisors 
seeks to ensure that the board of directors of a company is sufficiently aligned
with security holders' interests and provides proper oversight of the company's 
management. In many cases this may be best accomplished by having a majority of 
independent board members. Although Calamos Advisors will examine board member  
elections on a case-by-case basis, it will generally vote for the election of   
directors that would result in a board comprised of a majority of independent   
directors.                                                                      

   Because of the enormous variety and complexity of transactions that are
presented to shareholders, such as mergers, acquisitions, reincorporations,     
adoptions of anti-takeover measures (including adoption of a shareholder rights 
plan, requiring supermajority voting on particular issues, adoption of fair     
price provisions, issuance of blank check preferred stocks and the creation of a
separate class of stock with unequal voting rights), changes to capital         
structures (including authorizing additional shares, repurchasing stock or      
approving a stock split), executive compensation and option plans, that occur in
a variety of industries, companies and market cycles, it is extremely difficult 
to foresee exactly what would be in the best interests of the Fund in all       
circumstances. Moreover, voting on such proposals involves considerations unique
to each transaction. Accordingly, Calamos Advisors will vote on a case-by-case  
basis on proposals presenting these transactions.                               

Finally, Calamos Advisors has established procedures to help resolve
conflicts of interests that might arise when voting proxies for the Funds. These
procedures provide that the Committee, along with Calamos Advisors' Legal and   
Compliance Departments, will examine conflicts of interests with the Fund of    
which Calamos Advisors is aware and seek to resolve such conflicts in the best  
interests of the Fund, irrespective of any such conflict. If a member of the    
Committee has a personal conflict of interest, that member will refrain from    
voting and the remainder of the Committee will determine how to vote the proxy  
solely on the investment merits of any proposal. The Committee will then        
memorialize the conflict and the procedures used to address the conflict.

---------------------                                                           

(1) Blue Chip Fund commenced operations on December 1, 2003.                    

(2) Value Fund commenced operations on January 2, 2002.                         

    The Agreement continues in effect with respect to each Fund from year to
year so long as such continuation is approved at least annually by (1) the board
of trustees or the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of   
the Fund, and (2) a majority of the trustees who are not interested persons of  
any party to the Agreement, cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose  
of voting on such approval. At a meeting of the board of trustees of the Trust  
held on July 7, 2004, called in part for the purpose of voting on the renewal of
the Agreement, the Agreement was renewed through July 31, 2005 by the unanimous 
vote of the trustees present at the meeting, and the unanimous vote of the      
"non-interested" trustees of the Trust voting separately.                       

     In evaluating the Agreement, the trustees reviewed materials furnished by
Calamos Advisors, including information regarding Calamos Advisors, its         
affiliates and their personnel, operations and financial condition. The trustees
discussed with representatives of Calamos Advisors each Fund's operations and   
Calamos Advisors' ability to provide advisory and other services to the Funds.  
The trustees also reviewed, among other things:                                 

 -     the investment performance of other Calamos Advisors funds with
similar investment strategies;                          

    -     the proposed fees to be charged by Calamos Advisors for investment
management services;                                    

-     each Fund's projected total operating expenses;               

   -     the investment performance, fees and total expenses of investment
         companies with similar objectives and strategies managed by other
investment advisers; and                                

-     the experience of the investment advisory and other personnel 
         providing services to the Funds and the historical quality of the
services provided by Calamos Advisors.                  

The trustees considered the following as relevant to their          
recommendations: (1) the favorable history, reputation, qualification,          
investment process and background of Calamos                                    

34

P-->49737th�Page�of�75TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�37th
Advisors, as well as the qualifications of its personnel, resources available   
and its financial condition; (2) the magnitude of Calamos Advisors' fees and the
expense ratio of each Fund in relation to the nature and quality of services    
expected to be provided and the fees and expense ratios of comparable investment
companies; (3) the performance of each fund in relation to the results of other 
comparable investment companies managed by other advisers and unmanaged indices 
over various periods; (4) the ability of Calamos Advisors to receive research   
products and services from brokers in connection with brokerage transactions    
executed for the Funds and other accounts managed by Calamos Advisors; (5) the  
profitability of Calamos Advisors' relationship with the Funds; and (6) other   
factors that the trustees deemed relevant. The trustees deemed each of these    
factors to be relevant to their consideration of the Agreement, and concluded   
that the terms of the Agreement and the services to be provided were reasonable 
and appropriate, and that renewal of the Agreement was in the best interests of 
the Funds. The Agreement may be terminated as to a Fund at any time, without    
penalty, by either the Trust or Calamos Advisors upon 60 days' written notice,  
and is automatically terminated in the event of its assignment as defined in the
Investment Company Act of 1940.                                                 

      The use of the name "Calamos" in the name of the Trust and in the names of
the Funds are pursuant to licenses granted by Calamos Advisors, and the Trust   
has agreed to change the names to remove those references if Calamos Advisors   
ceases to act as investment adviser to the Funds.                               

As of March 30, 2004, the Trust and Calamos Advisors entered into a 
Financial Accounting Services Agreement pursuant to which Calamos Advisors shall
provide the following financial accounting services to the Funds: management of 
expenses and expense payment processing; monitor the calculation of expense     
accrual amounts for any Fund and make any necessary modifications; coordinate   
any expense reimbursement calculations and payment; calculate yields on the     
Funds in accordance with rules and regulations of the SEC; calculate net        
investment income dividends and capital gains distributions; calculate track and
report tax adjustments on all assets of each Fund, including but not limited to 
contingent debt and preferred trust obligations; prepare excise tax and fiscal  
year distributions schedules; prepare tax information required for financial    
statement footnotes; prepare state and federal income tax returns; prepare      
specialized calculations of amortization on convertible securities; prepare     
year-end dividend disclosure information; monitor trustee deferred compensation 
plan accruals and valuations; and prepare Form 1099 information statements for  
the trustees and service providers.                                             

    For providing those financial accounting services, Calamos Advisors will
receive a fee payable monthly at the annual rate of 0.0175% on the first $1     
billion of combined assets of the Funds (the "Combined Assets"); 0.0150% on the 
next $1 billion of Combined Assets; and 0.0110% on Combined Assets above $2     
billion ("financial accounting service fee"). Each Fund will pay its pro rata   
share of the financial accounting service fee payable to Calamos Advisors based 
on relative net assets of each Fund.                                            

EXPENSES 

 Subject to the expense limitations described below, the Funds pay all
their own operating expenses that are not specifically assumed by Calamos       
Advisors, including (i) fees of the investment adviser; (ii) interest, taxes and
any governmental filing fees; (iii) compensation and                            

35

P-->49738th�Page�of�75TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�38th
expenses of the trustees, other than those who are interested persons of the    
Trust, the investment adviser or the distributor; (iv) legal, audit, custodial  
and transfer agency fees and expenses; (v) fees and expenses related to the     
organization of the Funds and registration and qualification of the Funds and   
their shares under federal and state securities laws; (vi) expenses of printing 
and mailing reports, notices and proxy material to shareholders, and expenses   
incidental to meetings of shareholders; (vii) expenses of preparing prospectuses
and of printing and distributing them to existing shareholders; (viii) insurance
premiums; (ix) litigation and indemnification expenses and other extraordinary  
expenses not incurred in the normal course of the business of the Trust; (x)    
distribution expenses pursuant to the Funds' Distribution Plans; and (xi)       
brokerage commissions and other transaction-related costs.                      

Calamos Advisors has contractually undertaken to limit the annual   
operating expenses of each class of shares of each Fund through August 31, 2005 
in excess of certain limits as described in the prospectus under " - Who Manages
the Funds?"

DISTRIBUTION PLAN 

    The Trust has adopted a plan pursuant to rule 12b-1 under the Investment
Company Act of 1940 (the "Plan"), whereby Class A shares, Class B shares and    
Class C shares of each Fund pay to CFS, service and distribution fees as        
described in the prospectus.                                                    

    The board of trustees of the Trust has determined that a continuous cash
flow resulting from the sale of new Class A shares, Class B shares and Class C  
shares is necessary and appropriate to meet redemptions and to take advantage of
buying opportunities without having to make unwarranted liquidations of         
portfolio securities. The board also considered that continuing growth in the   
size of the Funds would be in the best interests of shareholders because        
increased size would allow the Funds to realize certain economies of scale in   
their operations and would likely reduce the proportionate share of expenses    
borne by each shareholder. The board of trustees therefore determined that it   
would benefit each of the Funds to have monies available for the direct         
distribution and service activities of CFS, as the Funds' distributor, in       
promoting the continuous sale of the Funds' shares. The board of trustees,      
including the non-interested trustees, concluded, in the exercise of their      
reasonable business judgment and in light of their fiduciary duties, that there 
is a reasonable likelihood that the Plans will benefit the Funds and their      
shareholders.                                                                   

     The Plan has been approved by the board of trustees, including all of the
trustees who are non-interested persons as defined in the Investment Company Act
of 1940. The substance of the Plan has also been approved by the vote of a      
majority of the outstanding shares of each of the Funds. The Plan must be       
reviewed annually and may be continued from year to year by vote of the board of
trustees, including a majority of the trustees who are non-interested persons of
the Funds and who have no direct or indirect financial interest in the operation
of the Plan ("non-interested trustees"), cast in person at a meeting called for 
that purpose. It is also required that the selection and nomination of          
non-interested trustees be done by non-interested trustees. The Plan may be     
terminated at any time, without any penalty, by such trustees, by any act that  
terminates the distribution agreement between the Trust and CFS, or, as to any  
Fund, by vote of a majority of that Fund's outstanding shares.                  

36

P-->49739th�Page�of�75TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�39th
   The Plan may not be amended to increase materially the amount spent for
distribution or service expenses or in any other material way without approval  
by a majority of the outstanding shares of the affected Fund, and all such      
material amendments to the Plan must also be approved by the non-interested     
trustees, in person, at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on any such  
amendment.                                                                      

  CFS is required to report in writing to the board of trustees at least
quarterly on the amounts and purpose of any payments made under the Plan and any
distribution or service agreement, as well as to furnish the board with such    
other information as may reasonably be requested to enable the board to make an 
informed determination of whether the Plan should be continued.                 

      During the period ended March 31, 2004, each of the Funds made payments to
CFS pursuant to the Plan in the following amounts:

 OTHER COMPENSATION TO DEALERS

CFS or its affiliates, at its expense, currently provides additional
compensation to certain investment dealers, banks or other intermediaries,      
including third party administrators of qualified plans ("Intermediaries").     
These payments may be made, at the discretion of CFS or its affiliates, to      
Intermediaries who have sold shares of the Funds. The level of payments made to 
a qualifying Intermediary in any given year will vary and in no case would      
exceed the sum of (a) 0.25% of the prior twelve month period's fund sales by    
that Intermediary and (b) 0.12% of assets attributable to that Intermediary. A  
number of factors will be considered in determining payments, including the     
qualifying Intermediary's sales, assets and redemption rates and, the quality of
the Intermediary's relationship with CFS or its affiliates. CFS or its          
affiliates makes these payments to help defray the costs incurred by qualifying 
Intermediaries in connection with efforts to educate financial advisers about   
the Funds so they can make recommendations and provide services that are        
suitable and meet shareholder needs. CFS or its affiliates will, on an annual   
basis, determine the advisability of continuing these payments. CFS or its      
affiliates may also pay expenses associated with meetings that facilitate       
educating financial advisers and shareholders about the Funds that are conducted
by Intermediaries.                                                              

As of June 30, 2004, the Intermediaries that CFS and its affiliates 
anticipate will receive additional compensation include: A.G. Edwards & Sons,   
Inc., Capital Analyst Inc., Citigroup, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith    
Incorporated, National Financial Services, Raymond James & Associates, Security 
Benefit Life and UBS PaineWebber.                                               

 PURCHASING AND REDEEMING SHARES

37

P-->49740th�Page�of�75TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�40th
      Purchases and redemptions are discussed in the Funds' prospectus under the
headings "How Can I Buy Shares?" and "How Can I Sell Shares?" All of that       
information is incorporated herein by reference.                                

You may purchase or redeem shares of the Funds through certain      
Intermediaries. These Intermediaries may charge for their services. Any such    
charges could constitute a substantial portion of a smaller account, and may not
be in your best interest. You may purchase or redeem shares of the Funds        
directly from or with the Trust without any charges other than those described  
in the prospectus.                                                              

   An Intermediary, who accepts orders that are processed at the net asset
value next determined after receipt of the order by the Intermediary, accepts   
such orders as agent of the Trust. The Intermediary is required to segregate any
orders received on a business day after the close of regular session trading on 
the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") and transmit those orders separately   
for execution at the net asset value next determined after that business day. It
is the responsibility of the Intermediary to transmit purchase orders and       
redemption requests received by them to U.S. Bancorp Fund Services, LLC so they 
will be received in a timely manner.                                            

HOW TO PURCHASE SHARES 

  Shares of the Funds are sold through selected broker-dealers and banks
that have signed agreements with CFS, or may be purchased by check or wire as   
described below. The minimum initial investment by a shareholder in each Fund is
$1,000, except for Market Neutral Fund which is $10,000. For certain qualified  
retirement plans, such as individual retirement accounts, the minimum initial   
investment is $500. The minimum subsequent investment in any Fund is $50 or     
more. Each Fund reserves the right to waive or reduce the minimum initial or    
subsequent investment requirement for any omnibus account of any intermediary   
with whom Calamos Advisors has entered into an agreement, including without     
limitation, profit sharing or pension plans, Section 401(k) plans, Section      
403(b)(7) plans in the case of employees of public school systems and certain   
non-profit organizations, and certain other qualified retirement plans. Each    
Fund reserves the right to reject any order for the purchase of its shares in   
whole or in part, and to suspend the sale of its shares to the public in        
response to conditions in the securities markets or otherwise. Each purchase of 
shares is confirmed by a written statement mailed to the shareholder, without   
issuance of share certificates.                                                 

In addition, the Funds are required to comply with various federal  
anti-money laundering laws and regulations. Consequently, the Funds will request
the following information from all investors: full name, date of birth, Social  
Security number, and permanent street address. Corporate, trust, and other      
entity accounts require additional documentation. The Funds will use this       
information to verify your identity. The Funds will return your application if  
any of this information is missing, and may request additional information from 
you to assist in verifying your identity. In the event that the Funds are unable
to verify your identity, they reserve the right to redeem your account at the   
current day's net asset value. A Fund may be required to "freeze" the account of
a shareholder if the shareholder appears to be involved in suspicious activity  
or if certain account information matches information on government lists of    
known terrorists or other                                                       

38

P-->49741st�Page�of�75TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�41st
suspicious persons, or the Fund may be required to transfer the account or      
proceeds of the account to a government agency.                                 

OFFERING PRICE 

     Class A shares of each Fund are sold to investors at net asset value plus
a sales charge, which may be reduced or waived as described below. Class B      
shares are sold without an initial sales charge but are subject to higher       
ongoing expenses than Class A shares of the same Fund, and a contingent deferred
sales charge payable upon certain redemptions. Class C shares of each Fund are  
sold without an initial sales charge but are subject to higher ongoing expenses 
than Class A shares of the same Fund. When placing an order, you must specify   
whether the order is for Class A, Class B or Class C shares.                    

     The differences between Class A shares, Class B shares and Class C shares
lie primarily in their initial and contingent deferred sales charge structures  
and in their asset-based sales charges in the form of Rule 12b-1 distribution   
fees. These differences are summarized in the table below. See also "Expenses"  
and "How to Redeem Shares." Each class has distinct advantages and disadvantages
for different investors, and you may choose the class that best suits your      
circumstances and objectives.

*  On an investment of $1 million or more, CFS from its own resources pays      
the selling dealer a commission of .50% of the amount of the investment.  
If you purchase such shares without a sales charge (other than by         
reinvestment of dividends or distributions) and redeem them within two    
years, a contingent deferred sales charge will be imposed at the rate of  
1% on shares redeemed within one year after purchase, and, if you         
purchased shares after July 31, 2001, .50% on shares redeemed during the  
second year after purchase, determined on a first-in, first-out basis.    
However, CFS will waive the contingent deferred sales charge in the event 
that the selling dealer waives the .50% commission to which the dealer is 
entitled. Accordingly, if you are not charged an upfront sales charge or a
contingent deferred sales charge, the selling dealer will not receive a   
commission or finder's fee.                                               

      Each Fund receives the entire net asset value of all of its Class A shares
sold. CFS, the Funds' principal underwriter, retains the sales charge on sales  
of Class A shares from which it allows discounts from the applicable public     
offering price to investment dealers. The normal discount to dealers is set     
forth in the above table. Upon notice to all dealers with whom it has sales     
agreements, CFS may allow up to the full applicable sales charge, as shown in   
the above table, during periods and for transactions specified in such notice   
and such reallowances may be based upon attainment of minimum sales levels.     
Dealers who receive 90% or more of the sales charge may be deemed to be         
underwriters under the Securities Act of 1933. CFS retains the entire amount of 
any deferred sales charge on Class C shares redeemed within one year of         
purchase. CFS may from time to time conduct promotional campaigns in which      
incentives would be offered to dealers meeting or exceeding stated target sales 
of shares of a Fund. The cost of any such promotional campaign, including any   
incentives offered, would be borne entirely by CFS and would have no effect on  
either the public offering price of Fund shares or the percentage of the public 
offering price retained by the selling dealer.                                  

      CFS compensates firms for sales of Class B shares at the time of sale at a
commission rate of up to 4.00% of the amount of Class B shares purchased. CFS is
compensated by each Fund for services as distributor and principal underwriter  
for Class B shares. Class B shares of a Fund will automatically convert to Class
A shares of the same Fund eight years after issuance on the basis of the        
relative net asset value per share. The purpose of the conversion feature is to 
relieve holders of Class B shares from the 12b-1 fee when they have been        
outstanding long enough for CFS to have been compensated for distribution       
related expenses. For purposes of conversion to Class A shares, shares purchased
through the reinvestment of dividends and other distributions paid with respect 
to Class B shares in a shareholder's Fund account will be converted to Class A  
shares on a pro rata basis.                                                     

WHICH CLASS OF SHARES SHOULD YOU PURCHASE?                                      

     The decision as to which class of shares you should purchase depends on a
number of factors, including the amount and intended length of the investment.  
Investors making investments that qualify for reduced sales charges might       
consider Class A shares. Investors who prefer not to pay an initial sales charge
and who plan to hold their investment for more than eight years might consider  
Class B shares. Investors who prefer not to pay an initial sales charge but who 
plan to redeem their shares within eight years might consider Class C shares. No
order for Class B shares of any Fund may exceed $100,000 and no order for Class 
C shares of any Fund may exceed $1,000,000. For more information about the three
share classes, consult your financial representative or the call us toll free at
(800) 823-7386. Financial services firms may receive different compensation     
depending upon which class of shares they sell.

PURCHASES BY WIRE                                                               

  You may also purchase shares by wiring funds from your bank. To insure
proper credit to your account, please call the Funds at (800) 823-7386 before   
sending your wire. The wire should be sent to U.S. Bank, N.A.; ABA #075000022;  
for U.S. Bancorp Fund Services, LLC, P.O. Box 701, Milwaukee, WI 53201, bank    
account no. 112-952-137; FBO Calamos [fund name] Fund; [shareholder name and    
account number]. The applicable offering price for a purchase by wire is the    
offering price per share next determined after receipt of the wired funds.      
Receipt of a wire could be delayed by delays on the Federal Reserve wire system.
After you have wired funds, you must complete the application form and send it  
to CFS. A Fund will not honor redemption requests until the completed           
application has been received, and failure to submit a completed application may
result in backup withholding as required by the Code.                           

PURCHASES BY MAIL 

    You may also purchase shares of a Fund by sending a check payable to the
Fund, along with information identifying you and your account number to the     
Fund's transfer agent: U.S. Bancorp Fund Services, LLC, P.O. Box 701, Milwaukee,
WI 53201. An initial investment made by check must be accompanied by a completed
application. A subsequent investment may be made by detaching the stub from your
account statement and sending it with your check in the envelope provided with  
your statement. All checks must be drawn on a U.S. bank in U.S. funds. A check  
written by a third party will not be accepted. A charge ($25 minimum) may be    
imposed if any check submitted for investment does not clear. If you purchase   
shares by check, you will not be able to redeem the shares until the check has  
been collected, which may take 15 days.                                         

PURCHASES BY TELEPHONE                                                          

    You may purchase shares of a Fund by telephone once you have established
an account. Complete information regarding the telephone purchase privilege is  
included in the prospectus under "How Can I buy Shares?"

PURCHASES BY EXCHANGE 

    Effective June 1, 2004, you may purchase shares of a Fund by exchange of
shares from another Fund or by exchange of shares of Prime Obligations Fund, a  
portfolio of First American Funds (such shares are referred to as "Prime        
Obligations Shares") either by mail or by instructing your broker-dealer or     
other sales agent, who will communicate your order to the Trust's transfer      
agent. If you have a brokerage account with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &     
Smith Incorporated ("Merrill Lynch") that holds shares of Summit Cash Reserves  
Fund, a series of Financial Institution Series Trust (such shares are referred  
to as "Summit Fund Shares"), and the Summit Fund Shares were purchased by       
exchange from a Fund, you may purchase shares of a Fund through your Merrill    
Lynch broker by exchange of Summit Fund Shares. See "How to Redeem Shares -     
Redemption by Exchange." No sales charge is imposed on purchases of Class A     
shares by exchange of Class A shares from another Fund or by exchange of Prime  
Obligations Shares or Summit Fund Shares, previously purchased through use of   
the exchange privilege. Please review the information under "How to Redeem
Shares - Redemption by Exchange."

SALES CHARGE WAIVER 

 In addition to the sales charge waivers enumerated in the prospectus,
dividends and distributions paid on shares of a Fund will be reinvested in      
shares of the same class of that Fund at net asset value (without the payment of
any sales charge) unless you elect to receive dividends and distributions in    
cash. Additionally, proceeds of shares redeemed by a Fund within the previous 60
days also may be reinvested in shares of the same class of that Fund at net     
asset value without the payment of any sales charge.                            

RIGHTS OF ACCUMULATION                                                          

 The sales charges described above also apply on a cumulative basis to
Class A shares of the Funds and any other series of the Trust as to which a     
sales charge applies, and over any period of time. You may combine the value at 
the current public offering price of Class A, B and C shares of any fund already
owned with a new purchase of Class A shares of any fund to reduce the sales     
charge on the new purchase. To receive the cumulative quantity reduction, you   
must give CFS or your dealer notification of the prior purchases at the time of 
the current purchase.                                                           

    For purposes of determining which purchases may be combined to determine
the sales charge rate, you and your spouse can add together shares you purchase 
for your individual accounts (including IRAs and 403(b) plans), or for your     
joint accounts, or for trust or custodial accounts on behalf of your children   
under the age of 21. In addition, a fiduciary can count all shares purchased for
a trust, estate or other fiduciary account (including one or more employee      
benefit plans of the same employer) that has multiple accounts.                 

The Funds receive purchase orders through a variety of distribution 
channels, including financial intermediaries and cannot always identify accounts
that should be combined for purposes of assessing the amount of a sales charge. 
When you buy shares, be sure to specify to your intermediary any other accounts 
that may entitle you to a reduced sales charge.                                 

LETTER OF INTENT                                                                

      You may reduce the sales charges you pay on the purchase of Class A shares
by making investments pursuant to a letter of intent. The applicable sales      
charge then is based upon the indicated amount intended to be invested during a 
thirteen-month period in shares of the Funds as to which a sales charge would be
imposed and any other series of the Trust. You may compute the thirteen-month   
period starting up to ninety days before the date of execution of the letter of 
intent. Your initial investment must be at least 5% of the amount your letter of
intent indicates you intend to invest. Each investment made during the period   
receives the reduced sales charge applicable to the total amount of the intended
investment. During the term of the letter of intent, shares representing 5% of  
the indicated amount will be held in escrow. Shares held in escrow have full    
dividend and voting privileges. The escrowed shares will be released when the   
full amount indicated has been purchased. If the full indicated amount is not   
purchased during the term of the letter of intent, you will be required to pay  
CFS an amount equal to the difference between the dollar amount of the sales    
charges actually paid and the amount of the sales charges that you would have   
paid on your aggregate purchase if the total of such purchases

had been made at a single time, and CFS reserves the right to redeem shares from
your account if necessary to satisfy that obligation. A letter of intent does   
not obligate you to buy or a Fund to sell the indicated amount of the shares but
you should read it carefully before signing. Additional information is contained
in the letter of intent included in the application.                            

HOW TO REDEEM SHARES 

  Shares of the Funds will be redeemed at the respective net asset value
next determined after receipt of a redemption request in good form on any day   
the NYSE is open for trading. Requests received after the time for computation  
of a Fund's net asset value for that day will be processed the next business    
day.                                                                            

     If Class C shares, or Class A shares for which the initial purchase price
was $1 million or more, on which no initial sales charge was imposed are        
redeemed within one year after purchase (other than by reinvestment of dividends
or distributions), determined on a first-in, first-out basis, a contingent      
deferred sales charge of 1% of the purchase price will be imposed. A contingent 
deferred sales charge of .50% of the purchase price will be imposed on the      
redemption during the second year after purchase of Class A shares, where the   
initial purchase price was $1 million or more.                                  

REDEMPTION FEE ON SHARES HELD FIVE DAYS OR LESS 

     A redemption of shares of a Fund (except shares purchased with reinvested
dividends or distributions) held for five days or less may be subject to a      
redemption fee of 2% of the redemption proceeds that will be deducted from those
proceeds. The redemption fee is paid to the Fund and is intended to deter       
short-term trading. The redemption fee is also intended to offset portfolio     
transaction costs, market impact, and other costs associated with short-term    
trading. If the shares redeemed were purchased on different days, the shares    
held shortest will be redeemed first for purposes of determining whether the    
redemption fee applies.                                                         

For shares held through an Intermediary, the redemption fee will be 
charged in generally the same manner as for shares held directly with a Fund.   
However, due to operational requirements and/or limitations, certain            
Intermediaries' methods for tracking and calculating the fee may differ in some 
respects from those of the Funds. In addition, certain Intermediaries may not   
presently possess the operational capabilities to charge the fee. In those      
instances, a fee may not be able to be applied. The Funds cannot always monitor 
the imposition of redemption fees on shares that are purchased through          
Intermediaries or held in omnibus accounts. If you purchased shares through an  
Intermediary, you should contact the Intermediary for information on how the    
redemption fee may be applied to your shares.                                   

      Each Fund reserves the right to waive the redemption fee at its discretion
where such waiver is believed not to materially harm the Fund and is consistent 
with the Fund's efforts to deter abusive short-term trading. The Funds reserve  
the right to modify or eliminate the redemption fee or waivers at any time.

CONTINGENT DEFERRED SALES CHARGE--CLASS B SHARES                                

      A contingent deferred sales charge may be imposed upon redemption of Class
B shares. There is no such charge upon redemption of any share appreciation or  
reinvested dividends on Class B shares. The charge is computed at the following 
rates based on the lesser of the redemption price or purchase price excluding   
amounts not subject to the charge.                                              

                                                                [Download Table]

    The contingent deferred sales charge for Class B and Class C shares will
be waived: (a) in the event of the total disability (as evidenced by a          
determination by the Social Security Administration) of the shareholder         
(including a registered joint owner) occurring after the purchase of the shares 
being redeemed, (b) in the event of the death of the shareholder (including a   
registered joint owner), (c) for redemptions made pursuant to a systematic      
withdrawal plan (see "Systematic Withdrawal Plan" below), (d) for redemptions   
made pursuant to any IRA systematic withdrawal based on the shareholder's life  
expectancy including, but not limited to, substantially equal periodic payments 
described in Code Section 72(t)(2)(iv) prior to age 59-1/2 and (e) for          
redemptions to satisfy required minimum distributions after age 70-1/2 from an  
IRA account (with the maximum amount subject to this waiver being based only    
upon the shareholder's Calamos IRA accounts).                                   

CONTINGENT DEFERRED SALES CHARGE - GENERAL INFORMATION.                         

     The following example illustrates the operation of the Class B contingent
deferred sales charge:                                                          

      Assume that an individual opens an account and makes a purchase payment of
      $10,000 for 1,000 Class B shares of a Fund (at $10 per share) and that six
    months later the value of the investor's account for that Fund has grown
      through investment performance to $11,000 ($11 per share). If the investor
 should redeem $2,200 (200 shares), a contingent deferred sales charge
    would be applied against $2,000 of the redemption (the purchase price of
     the shares redeemed, because the purchase price is lower than the current
    net asset value of such shares ($2,200)). At the rate of 5%, the Class B
contingent deferred sales charge would be $100.                     

REDEMPTION BY MAIL 

     A written request for redemption must be received by the Trust's transfer
agent at its address shown under "Purchases by Mail" above to constitute a valid
redemption request.                                                             

Your redemption request must:                                       

44

1.    specify the Fund, your account number and the number of shares or dollar  
amount to be redeemed, if less than all shares are to be redeemed;  

2.    be signed by all owners exactly as their names appear on the account; and 

3.    include a signature guarantee for each signature on the redemption request
    by CFS, by a securities firm that is a member of the NYSE, or by a bank,
    savings bank, credit union, savings and loan association or other entity
that is authorized by applicable state law to guarantee signatures. 

    In the case of shares held by a corporation, the redemption request must
be signed in the name of the corporation by an officer whose title must be      
stated, and a certified bylaw provision or resolution of the board of directors 
authorizing the officer to so act may be required. In the case of a trust or    
partnership, the signature must include the name of the registered shareholder  
and the title of the person signing on its behalf. Under certain circumstances, 
before shares can be redeemed, additional documents may be required in order to 
verify the authority of the person seeking to redeem.                           

REDEMPTION BY WIRE OR TELEPHONE                                                 

     Broker-dealers or other sales agents may communicate redemption orders by
wire or telephone to the Trust's transfer agent. These firms may charge for     
their services in connection with your redemption request but the Funds do not  
impose any such charges. Additionally, if your shares are held for you by the   
Trust's transfer agent, you may redeem up to $50,000 worth of shares by         
telephone, as described in the prospectus under "How Can I Sell Shares?"
EXPEDITED REDEMPTION                                                            

      Unless share certificates have been issued to you, you may have redemption
proceeds of at least $5,000 wired directly to a domestic commercial bank account
or brokerage account that you have previously designated. Normally, such        
payments will be transmitted no later than the second business day following    
receipt of your redemption request (provided redemptions may be made under the  
general criteria set forth below). A $15 service charge for payment of          
redemption proceeds by wire will be deducted from the proceeds.                 

REDEMPTION BY EXCHANGE 

  You may redeem all or any portion of your shares of a Fund and use the
proceeds to purchase shares of any of the other Funds or Prime Obligations      
Shares (or Summit Fund Shares if your Fund shares are held in a brokerage       
account with Merrill Lynch and Merrill Lynch has commenced offering the exchange
program for Summit Fund Shares) if your signed, properly completed application  
is on file. AN EXCHANGE TRANSACTION IS A SALE AND PURCHASE OF SHARES FOR FEDERAL
INCOME TAX PURPOSES AND MAY RESULT IN CAPITAL GAIN OR LOSS. Before exchanging   
into Prime Obligations Shares (or Summit Fund Shares), you should obtain the    
prospectus relating to those shares from the First American Funds (or from      
Merrill Lynch, in the case of Summit Fund Shares) and read it carefully. The    
exchange privilege is not an offering or recommendation of Prime Obligations    
Shares or Summit Fund Shares. If you should redeem (and not exchange) your Prime
Obligations Shares (or Summit Fund Shares), you would pay the applicable        

45

P-->49748th�Page�of�75TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�48th
contingent deferred sales charge percentage. The registration of the account to 
which you are making an exchange must be exactly the same as that of the account
from which the exchange is made and the amount you exchange must meet any       
applicable minimum investment of the fund being purchased. An exchange may be   
made by following the redemption procedure described above under "Redemption by
Mail" and indicating the fund to be purchased, except that a signature guarantee
normally is not required. An exchange may also be made by instructing your      
broker-dealer or other sales agent, who will communicate your instruction to    
CFS. No sales charge is imposed on purchases by exchange into the same class of 
shares.                                                                         

TRANSACTION RESTRICTIONS                                                        

      The Funds reserve the right to reject any order for the purchase of shares
in whole or in part for any reason, and to suspend the sale of shares to the    
public in response to conditions in the securities markets or otherwise. The    
Funds are intended for long-term investment purposes only, and discourage       
short-term or excessive trading practices. These practices may disrupt portfolio
management strategies and may increase expenses, and thus harm fund performance.

     Each Fund may, in its discretion, suspend, and may permanently terminate,
the trading or exchange privileges of any investor who engages in trading       
activity that it believes would be disruptive to the Fund. Although each Fund   
will attempt to give prior notice of a suspension or termination of an exchange 
privilege when it is reasonably able to do so, the suspension or termination may
be effective immediately, thereby preventing any uncompleted exchange.          

     In addition, the Funds receive purchase and sale orders through financial
intermediaries and cannot always identify or reasonably detect short-term or    
excessive trading that may be facilitated by those intermediaries or by the use 
of omnibus accounts by those intermediaries. Omnibus accounts are comprised of  
multiple investors whose purchases and redemptions are aggregated and netted    
before being submitted to the Funds making it more difficult to locate and      
eliminate short-term or excessive trading. Certain intermediaries may not       
presently possess the same operational capabilities to track the number of      
purchase, redemption or exchange orders made by an individual investor as the   
Funds, or they may lack such capabilities entirely. Certain intermediaries may  
possess other capabilities to deter short-term or excessive trading upon which  
the Funds may rely. In general, the Funds cannot eliminate the possibility that 
short-term or excessive trading activity will occur in the Funds.               

 As noted above, the Funds reserve the right to reject or restrict any
purchase order (including exchanges) from any investor. To minimize harm to the 
Funds and their shareholders, the Funds may, at each Fund's sole discretion,    
exercise these rights if an investor has a history of excessive trading or if an
investor's trading, in the judgment of a Fund, has been or may be disruptive to 
such Fund. In making this judgment, a Fund may consider trading done in multiple
accounts under common ownership or control.                                     

GENERAL                                                                         

     A check for proceeds of a redemption will not be released until the check
used to purchase the shares has been collected, which is usually no more than 15
days after purchase. You may avoid this delay by purchasing shares through a    
wire transfer of funds. A Fund may                                              

46

P-->49749th�Page�of�75TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�49th
suspend the right of redemption under certain extraordinary circumstances in    
accordance with the rules of the SEC. Due to the relatively high cost of        
handling small accounts, each Fund reserves the right upon 30 days' written     
notice to involuntarily redeem, at net asset value, the shares of any           
shareholder whose account has a value of less than $500, unless the reduction in
value to less than $500 was the result of market fluctuation. PLEASE TELEPHONE  
THE FUNDS IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT REQUIREMENTS FOR A REDEMPTION BEFORE  
SUBMITTING A REQUEST. YOU MAY NOT CANCEL OR REVOKE YOUR REDEMPTION REQUEST ONCE 
YOUR INSTRUCTIONS HAVE BEEN RECEIVED AND ACCEPTED.                              
SHAREHOLDER ACCOUNTS                                                            

    Each shareholder of a Fund receives quarterly account statements showing
transactions in shares of the Fund and with a balance denominated in Fund       
shares. A confirmation will be sent to the shareholder upon purchase,           
redemption, dividend reinvestment, or change of shareholder address (sent to the
former address).                                                                

RETIREMENT PLANS                                                                

You may use the Funds as investments for your Individual Retirement 
Account ("IRA"), profit sharing or pension plan, Section 40l(k) plan, Section   
403(b)(7) plan in the case of employees of public school systems and certain    
non-profit organizations, and certain other qualified plans. A master IRA plan  
and information regarding plan administration, fees, and other details are      
available from CFS and authorized broker-dealers.                               

SYSTEMATIC WITHDRAWAL PLAN 

     You may request that a Fund periodically redeem shares having a specified
redemption value and send you a check for the proceeds. In order to initiate the
Systematic Withdrawal Plan, call (800) 823-7386 and request a Systematic        
Withdrawal form. Your account must have a share balance of $25,000 or more.     
Withdrawal proceeds are likely to exceed dividends and distributions paid on    
shares in your account and therefore may deplete and eventually exhaust your    
account. The periodic payments are proceeds of redemption and are taxable as    
such. The maximum annual rate at which Class B shares may be redeemed (and Class
C shares in their first year following purchase and Class A shares purchased in 
amounts of $1,000,000 or more) under a systematic withdrawal plan is 10% of the 
net asset value of the account. Because a sales charge is imposed on purchases  
of shares of the Funds, you should not purchase shares while participating in   
the Systematic Withdrawal Plan. You may modify or terminate your Systematic     
Withdrawal Plan by written notice to the transfer agent at least seven business 
days prior to the start of the month in which the change is to be effective.    

AUTOMATIC BANK DRAFT PLAN                                                       

   If you own shares of a Fund, you may purchase additional shares of that
Fund through the Automatic Bank Draft Plan. Under the Plan, the Trust will      
automatically debit your bank checking account on a monthly or semi-monthly     
basis in an amount ($50 or more) specified by you and invest the specified      
amount in additional shares of the Fund. To obtain an Automatic Bank Draft Plan 
form, call (800) 823-7386. The Plan is not available to clients of service      
organizations that offer similar investment services.

EXCHANGE PRIVILEGE                                                              

 You may exchange shares of any Fund for shares of another Fund or for
Prime Obligations Shares (or for Summit Fund Shares if your Fund shares are held
in a brokerage account with Merrill Lynch) or exchange Prime Obligations Shares 
or Summit Fund Shares for shares of a Fund, without payment of any sales charge 
as described above under "How to Purchase Shares - Purchase by Exchange" and    
"How to Redeem Shares - Redemption by Exchange."
NET ASSET VALUE                                                                 

In computing the net asset value of each Fund, portfolio securities,
including options, that are traded on a national securities exchange are valued 
at the last reported sales price. Securities quoted on the NASDAQ National      
Market System are valued at the Nasdaq Official Closing Price ("NOCP"), as      
determined by Nasdaq, or lacking an NOCP, the last current reported sale price  
as of the time of valuation. Securities traded in the over-the-counter market   
and listed securities for which no sales were reported are valued at the mean of
the most recently quoted bid and asked prices. Each outstanding futures contract
is valued at the official settlement price for the contract on the exchange on  
which the contract is traded, except that if the market price of the contract   
has increased or decreased by the maximum amount permitted on the valuation date
("up or down the limit"), the contract is valued at a fair value as described   
below. Short-term securities with maturities of 60 days or less are valued at   
amortized cost which approximates market value.                                 

      When market prices are not readily available or when the valuation methods
mentioned above are not reflective of a fair value of the security, the security
is valued at a fair value following procedures approved by the board of         
trustees. These procedures may utilize valuations furnished by pricing services 
approved by the board of trustees, which include market transactions for        
comparable securities and various relationships between securities that are     
generally recognized by institutional traders, a computerized matrix system, or 
appraisals derived from information concerning the securities or similar        
securities received from recognized dealers in those securities.                

     The markets in which non-U.S. securities trade are sometimes open on days
when the NYSE is not open and the Funds do not calculate their net asset values,
and sometimes are not open on days when the Funds do calculate their net asset  
values. Even on days on which both the foreign market and the NYSE are open,    
several hours may have passed between the time when trading in the foreign      
market closed and the NYSE closes and the Funds calculate their net asset       
values. The Funds monitor for significant events that may affect the value of a 
foreign security. A Fund may price a non-U.S. security it holds at a fair value 
determined according to procedures, or a systematic fair valuation model        
provided by a third party adopted by the board of trustees if it appears that   
the value of the security has been materially affected by events occurring      
between the close of the primary market or exchange on which the security is    
traded and the time for computing net asset value.                              

    Each Fund's net asset value is determined only on days on which the NYSE
is open for trading. That Exchange is regularly closed on Saturdays and Sundays 
and on New Year's Day, the third Mondays in January and February, Good Friday,  
the last Monday in May, Independence

Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving and Christmas. If one of these holidays falls on a 
Saturday or Sunday, the NYSE will be closed on the preceding Friday or the      
following Monday, respectively.                                                 

    Securities that are principally traded in a foreign market are valued as
of the close of the appropriate exchange or other designated time. Trading in   
securities on European and Far Eastern securities exchanges and over-the-counter
markets is normally completed at various times before the close of business on  
each day on which the NYSE is open. Trading of these securities may not take    
place on every NYSE business day. In addition, trading may take place in various
foreign markets on Saturdays or on other days when the NYSE is not open and on  
which the Fund's net asset value is not calculated. Therefore, such calculation 
does not take place contemporaneously with the determination of the prices of   
many of the portfolio securities used in such calculation and the value of the  
Fund's portfolio may be significantly affected on days when shares of the Fund  
may not be purchased or redeemed.                                               

REDEMPTION IN KIND                                                              

    The Funds have elected to be governed by Rule 18f-1 under the Investment
Company Act of 1940 pursuant to which they are obligated to redeem shares solely
in cash up to the lesser of $250,000 or 1% of the net asset value of a Fund     
during any 90-day period for any one shareholder. Redemptions in excess of these
amounts will normally be paid in cash, but may be paid wholly or partly by a    
distribution in kind of securities.                                             

 PERFORMANCE INFORMATION

TOTAL RETURN 

      From time to time the Funds may quote total return figures. "Total Return"
for a period is the percentage change in value during a period of an investment 
in Fund shares, including the value of shares acquired through reinvestment of  
all dividends and capital gains distributions. "Average Annual Total Return" is 
the average annual compounded rate of change in value represented by the Total  
Return for the period.                                                          

Average Annual Total Return will be computed as follows:            

ERV           =    P(1+T)(n)                              

        Where:        P    =   a hypothetical initial investment of $1,000

      T    =   average annual total return

n    =   number of years      

                    ERV  =   ending redeemable value of a hypothetical
                                  $1,000 investment made at the beginning of the
                        period, at the end of the period (or
               fractional portion thereof)

  The Funds may also quote after-tax total returns to show the impact of
assumed federal income taxes on an investment in the Funds. The Funds' total    
return "after taxes on distributions" shows the effect of taxable distributions,
but not any taxable gain or loss, on an                                         

49

P-->49752nd�Page�of�75TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�52nd
investment in shares of the Funds for a specified period of time. The Funds'    
total return "after taxes on distributions and sale of Fund shares" shows the   
effect of both taxable distributions and any taxable gain or loss realized by   
the shareholder upon the sale of fund shares at the end of a specified period.  
To determine these figures, all income, short-term capital gain distributions,  
and long-term capital gain distributions are assumed to have been taxed at the  
highest marginal individualized federal tax rate then in effect. Those maximum  
tax rates are applied to distributions prior to reinvestment and the after-tax  
portion is assumed to have been reinvested in the Fund. State and local taxes   
are ignored.                                                                    

    Actual after-tax returns depend on a shareholder's tax situation and may
differ from those shown. After-tax returns reflect past tax effects and are not 
predictive of future tax effects. Average Annual Total Return (After Taxes on   
Distributions) is computed as                                                   

follows:                                                                        

ATV(D)  = P(l+T)(n)                                               

Where: P = a hypothetical initial investment of $1,000                          

T = average annual total return (after taxes on distributions)    

n = number of years                                               

    ATV(D)  = ending value of a hypothetical $1,000 investment made at the
      beginning of the period, at the end of the period (or fractional portion
thereof), after taxes on fund distributions but not after taxes on
redemptions.                                                      

      Average Annual Total Return (After Taxes on Distributions and Sale of Fund
Shares) is computed as follows:                                                 

ATV(DR) = P(l+T)(n)                                             

Where:  P = a hypothetical initial investment of $1,000                         

 T = average annual total return (after taxes on distributions and
redemption)                                                     

n = number of years                                             

      ATV(DR) = ending value of a hypothetical $1,000 investment made at the
        beginning of the period, at the end of the period (or fractional portion
thereof), after taxes on fund distributions and redemption.     

YIELD                                                                           

    Each Fund other than Growth Fund, Blue Chip Fund and Value Fund may also
quote yield figures. The yield of a Fund is calculated by dividing its net      
investment income per share (a hypothetical figure as defined in SEC rules)     
during a 30-day period by the net asset value per share on the last day of the  
period. The yield formula provides for semiannual compounding, which assumes    
that net investment income is earned and reinvested at a constant rate and      
annualized at the end of a six-month period. The yield is not based on actual   
dividends paid.                                                                 

Yield will be computed as follows:                                  

YIELD =   2[((a-b/cd)+1)(6)-1]

      The figures quoted assume reinvestment of all dividends and distributions.
Quotations of Average Annual Total Return take into account the effect of any   
sales charge on the amount available for investment or redemption; quotations of
Total Return will indicate whether or not the effect of the sales charge is     
included. The figures will not necessarily be indicative of future performance. 
The performance of a Fund is a result of conditions in the securities markets,  
portfolio management, and operating expenses. Although information such as yield
and total return is useful in reviewing a Fund's performance and in providing   
some basis for comparison with other investment alternatives, it should not be  
used for comparison with other investments using different reinvestment         
assumptions or time periods.

 CFS has the exclusive right to distribute shares of the Funds through
affiliated and unaffiliated dealers. The obligation of CFS is an agency or "best
efforts" arrangement, which does not obligate CFS to sell any stated number of  
shares.                                                                         

In connection with the exchange privilege, CFS acts as a service    
organization for the Prime Obligations Fund, which is a portfolio of First      
American Funds.                                                                 

PORTFOLIO TRANSACTIONS

     Portfolio transactions on behalf of the Funds effected on stock exchanges
involve the payment of negotiated brokerage commissions. There is generally no  
stated commission in the case of securities traded in the over-the-counter      
markets, but the price paid by the Funds usually includes an undisclosed dealer 
commission or mark-up. In underwritten offerings, the price paid by the Funds   
includes a disclosed, fixed commission or discount retained by the underwriter  
or dealer.

In executing portfolio transactions, Calamos Advisors uses its best 
efforts to obtain for the Funds the most favorable combination of price and     
execution available. In seeking the most favorable combination of price and     
execution, Calamos Advisors considers all factors it deems relevant, including  
price, the size of the transaction, the nature of the market for the security,  
the amount of commission, the timing of the transaction taking into account     
market prices and trends, the execution capability of the broker-dealer and the 
quality of service rendered by the broker-dealer in other transactions.         

      The trustees have determined that portfolio transactions for the Funds may
be executed through CFS if, in the judgment of Calamos Advisors, the use of CFS 
is likely to result in prices and execution at least as favorable to the Funds  
as those available from other qualified brokers and if, in such transactions,   
CFS charges the Funds commission rates consistent with those charged by CFS to  
comparable unaffiliated customers in similar transactions. The board of         
trustees, including a majority of the trustees who are not "interested"         
trustees, has adopted procedures that are reasonably designed to provide that   
any commissions, fees or other remuneration paid to CFS are consistent with the 
foregoing standard. The Funds will not effect principal transactions with CFS.  

     In allocating the Funds' portfolio brokerage transactions to unaffiliated
broker-dealers, Calamos Advisors may take into consideration the research,      
analytical, statistical and other information and services provided by the      
broker-dealer, such as general economic reports and information, reports or     
analyses of particular companies or industry groups, market timing and technical
information, and the availability of the brokerage firm's analysts for          
consultation. Although Calamos Advisors believes these services have substantial
value, they are considered supplemental to Calamos Advisors' own efforts in the 
performance of its duties under the management agreement. As permitted by       
Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("1934 Act"), Calamos      
Advisors may pay a broker-dealer that provides brokerage and research services  
an amount of commission for effecting a securities transaction for a Fund in    
excess of the commission that another broker-dealer would have charged for      
effecting that transaction if the amount is believed by Calamos Advisors to be  
reasonable in relation to the value of the overall quality of the brokerage and 
research services provided. Other clients of Calamos Advisors may indirectly    
benefit from the availability of these services to Calamos Advisors, and the    
Funds may indirectly benefit from services available to Calamos Advisors as a   
result of transactions for other clients.                                       

     In certain cases, Calamos Advisors may obtain products or services from a
broker that have both research and non-research uses. Examples of non-research  
uses are administrative and marketing functions. These are referred to as "mixed
use" products. In each case, Calamos Advisors makes a good faith effort to      
determine the proportion of such products or services that may be used for      
research and non-research purposes. That determination is based upon the time   
spent by Calamos Advisors personnel for research and non-research uses. The     
portion of the costs of such products or services attributable to research usage
may be defrayed by Calamos Advisors through brokerage commissions generated by  
transactions of its clients, including the Funds. Calamos Advisors pays the     
provider in cash for the non-research portion of its use of these products or   
services.

TAXATION

   The following is only a summary of certain tax considerations affecting
the Funds and their shareholders. No attempt is made to present a detailed      
explanation of the tax treatment of the Funds or their shareholders, and the    
discussion here is not intended as a substitute for careful tax planning.       
Investors are urged to consult their tax advisers with specific reference to    
their own tax situations.                                                       

At the time of your purchase, a Fund's net asset value may reflect  
undistributed income, capital gains, or net unrealized appreciation of          
securities held by that Fund. A subsequent distribution to you of such amounts, 
although constituting a return of your investment, would be taxable either as a 
dividend or capital gain distribution.                                          

     Some of the Funds' investment practices are subject to special provisions
of the Code that, among other things, may (i) disallow, suspend or otherwise    
limit the allowance of certain losses or deductions, (ii) convert lower taxed   
long-term capital gain into higher taxed short-term capital gain or ordinary    
income, (iii) convert an ordinary loss or a deduction into a capital loss (the  
deductibility of which is more limited) and/or (iv) cause a Fund to recognize   
income or gain without a corresponding receipt of cash with which to make       
distributions in amounts necessary to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement  
and the distribution requirements for avoiding income and excise taxes. The     
Funds will monitor their transactions and may make certain tax elections to     
mitigate the effect of these rules and prevent disqualification of the Funds as 
a regulated investment companies.                                               

A Fund is permitted to invest in securities issued or purchased at a
discount. Tax rules could require a Fund to accrue and distribute income not yet
received. Depending upon particular circumstances, this treatment may also      
affect the tax character and amount of income required to be recognized by the  
Fund holding the security. A Fund could be required to sell securities in its   
portfolio that it otherwise might have continued to hold in order to generate   
sufficient cash to make these distributions.                                    

    Foreign currency gains and losses, including the portion of gain or loss
on the sale of debt securities attributable to foreign exchange rate            
fluctuations, are taxable as ordinary income. If the net effect to a Fund of    
those transactions is a gain, the income dividend paid by the Fund will be      
increased; if the result is a loss, the income dividend paid will be decreased. 

   Income received by a Fund from sources within various foreign countries
will be subject to foreign income taxes withheld at the source. Under the Code, 
if more than 50% of the value of a Fund's total assets at the close of its      
taxable year comprises securities issued by foreign corporations, the Fund may  
file an election with the Internal Revenue Service to "pass through" to its     
shareholders the amount of foreign income taxes paid by that Fund. Pursuant to  
that election, shareholders would be required to: (i) include in gross income,  
even though not actually received, their respective pro rata share of foreign   
taxes paid by the Fund; (ii) treat their pro rata share of foreign taxes as paid
by them; and (iii) either deduct their pro rata share of foreign taxes in       
computing their taxable income, or use it as a foreign tax credit against U.S.  
income taxes (but not both). No deduction for foreign taxes may be claimed by a 
shareholder who does not itemize deductions.

QUALIFICATION AS A REGULATED INVESTMENT COMPANY                                 

   Each Fund intends to continue to qualify, and elect to be treated, as a
regulated investment company under Subchapter M of the Code so as to be relieved
of federal income tax on its net investment income and capital gains that it    
currently distributes to shareholders.                                          

Each Fund must meet several requirements to maintain its status as a
regulated investment company. These requirements include the following: (1) at  
least 90% of the Fund's gross income must be derived from dividends, interest,  
payments with respect to securities loans, and gains from the sale or           
disposition of securities; and (2) at the close of each quarter of the Fund's   
taxable year, (a) at least 50% of the value of the Fund's total assets must     
consist of cash, U.S. Government securities, securities of other regulated      
investment companies, and other securities such that no more than 5% of the     
value of the Fund may consist of such other securities of any one issuer, and   
the Fund must not hold through such other securities more than 10% of the       
outstanding voting stock of any issuer, and (b) the Fund must not invest more   
than 25% of the value of its total assets in the securities of any one issuer   
(other than U.S. Government securities) or two or more issuers controlled by the
Fund and engaged in the same, similar, or related trades or businesses.         

EXCISE TAX ON REGULATED INVESTMENT COMPANIES                                    

  To avoid a 4% excise tax, each Fund will be required to distribute, by
December 31st of each year, at least an amount equal to the sum of (i) 98% of   
its ordinary income for such year and (ii) 98% of its capital gain net income   
(the latter of which generally is computed on the basis of the one-year period  
ending on October 31st of such year), plus any amounts that were not distributed
in previous taxable years. For purposes of the excise tax, a Fund will be       
treated as having distributed any ordinary income or capital gain net income    
retained by, and subject to federal income tax in the hands of, the Fund.       

ALLOCATION AMONG FUNDS

      The assets received by the Trust from the sale of shares of each Fund, and
all income, earnings, profits and proceeds thereof, subject only to the rights  
of creditors, are specifically allocated to that Fund, and constitute the       
underlying assets of that Fund. The underlying assets of each Fund are required 
to be segregated on the books of account, and are to be charged with the expense
in respect to that Fund and with a share of the general expenses of the Trust.  
Any general expenses of the Trust not readily identifiable as belonging to a    
particular Fund shall be allocated by or under the direction of the trustees in 
such manner as the trustees determine to be fair and equitable. Each share of   
each Fund represents an equal proportionate interest in that Fund with each     
other share and is entitled to such dividends and distributions out of the      
income belonging to that Fund as are declared by the trustees. Upon any         
liquidation of a Fund, shareholders thereof are entitled to share pro rata in   
the net assets belonging to that Fund available for distribution.

CUSTODIAN AND TRANSFER AGENT

delivering and receiving payment for securities sold by the Funds, receiving and
paying for securities purchased by the Funds, collecting income from investments

of the Trust. The custodian does not exercise any supervisory functions in such 
matters as the purchase and sale of securities by a Fund, payment of dividends  
or payment of expenses of a Fund.                                               

      U.S. Bancorp Fund Services, LLC, P.O. Box 701, Milwaukee, WI 53201, serves
as transfer agent and dividend paying agent for each Fund.                      

 Shares of any of the Funds may be purchased through certain financial
service companies who are agents of the Funds for the limited purpose of        
completing purchases and sales. For services provided by such a company with    
respect to Fund shares held by that company for its customers, the company may  
charge the Fund a fee of up to $6 per account for Network Level III accounts.   
For all other accounts, $16 per account or 0.15% of the account's average net   
assets for Class A shares and $19 per account for Class B and Class C shares.   

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

     Ernst & Young LLP, Sears Tower, 233 South Wacker Drive, Chicago, Illinois
60606, audits and reports on the Funds' annual financial statements, reviews    
certain regulatory reports and the Funds' federal income tax returns, and       
performs other professional accounting, tax and advisory services when engaged  
to do so by the Funds.                                                          

 GENERAL INFORMATION
SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION                                                         

 Each Fund is a series of Calamos Investment Trust (formerly named CFS
Investment Trust). As of March 18, 1996, all shares of each Fund then           
outstanding were re-designated as Class A shares of that Fund. Under the terms  
of the Agreement and Declaration of Trust, the trustees may issue an unlimited  
number of shares of beneficial interest without par value for each series of    
shares authorized by the trustees and the trustees may divide the shares of any 
series into two or more classes of shares of that series. As of the date of this
Statement of Additional

P-->49773rd�Page�of�75TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�73rd
Information, the Trust has eight series in operation. All shares issued will be 
fully paid and non-assessable and will have no preemptive or conversion rights. 
In the future, the board of trustees may authorize the issuance of shares of    
additional series and additional classes of shares of any series.               

    Each Fund's shares of a given class are entitled to participate pro rata
in any dividends and other distributions declared by the Fund's board of        
trustees with respect to shares of the Fund. All shares of the Fund of a given  
class have equal rights in the event of liquidation of that class.              

     Under Massachusetts law, the shareholders of the Trust may, under certain
circumstances, be held personally liable for the Trust's obligations. However,  
the Trust's Declaration of Trust disclaims liability of the shareholders,       
trustees, and officers of the Trust for acts or obligations of the Funds that   
are binding only on the assets and property of the Fund. The Declaration of     
Trust requires that notice of such disclaimer be given in each agreement,       
obligation, or contract entered into or executed by the Trust or the board of   
trustees. The Declaration of Trust provides for indemnification out of a Fund's 
assets of all losses and expenses of any Fund shareholder held personally liable
for the Fund's obligations. Thus, the risk of a shareholder incurring financial 
loss on account of shareholder liability is remote, because it is limited to    
circumstances in which the disclaimer is inoperative and the Fund itself is     
unable to meet its obligations.                                                 

VOTING RIGHTS                                                                   

     Each share has one vote and fractional shares have fractional votes. As a
business trust, the Trust is not required to hold annual shareholder meetings.  
However, special meetings may be called for purposes such as electing or        
removing trustees, changing fundamental policies or approving an investment     
advisory agreement.                                                             

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

      Audited financial statements for the Trust for the fiscal year ended March
31, 2004 are incorporated herein by reference from the Trust's annual report to 
shareholders.

APPENDIX--DESCRIPTION OF BOND RATINGS 

   A rating of a rating service represents the service's opinion as to the
credit quality of the security being rated. However, the ratings are general and
are not absolute standards of quality or guarantees as to the creditworthiness  
of an issuer. Consequently, Calamos Advisors believes that the quality of debt  
securities in which a Fund invests should be continuously reviewed. A rating is 
not a recommendation to purchase, sell or hold a security, because it does not  
take into account market value or suitability for a particular investor. When a 
security has received a rating from more than one service, each rating should be
evaluated independently. Ratings are based on current information furnished by  
the issuer or obtained by the ratings services from other sources that they     
consider reliable. Ratings may be changed, suspended or withdrawn as a result of
changes in or unavailability of such information, or for other reasons.         

    The following is a description of the characteristics of ratings used by
Moody's Investors Service, Inc. ("Moody's") and Standard & Poor's Corporation, a
division of The McGraw-Hill Companies ("S&P").                                  

MOODY'S RATINGS                                                                 

     Aaa--Bonds rated Aaa are judged to be of the best quality. They carry the
smallest degree of investment risk and are generally referred to as             
"gilt-edged." Interest payments are protected by a large or by an exceptionally 
stable margin and principal is secure. Although the various protective elements 
are likely to change, such changes as can be visualized are most unlikely to    
impair the fundamentally strong position of such bonds.                         

 Aa--Bonds rated Aa are judged to be of high quality by all standards.
Together with the Aaa group they comprise what are generally known as high grade
bonds. They are rated lower than the best bonds because margins of protection   
may not be as large as in Aaa bonds or fluctuation of protective elements may be
of greater amplitude or there may be other elements present that make the long  
term risk appear somewhat larger than in Aaa bonds.                             

    A--Bonds rated A possess many favorable investment attributes and are to
be considered as upper medium-grade obligations. Factors giving security to     
principal and interest are considered adequate, but elements may be present that
suggest a susceptibility to impairment sometime in the future.                  

  Baa--Bonds rated Baa are considered as medium-grade obligations, i.e.,
they are neither highly protected nor poorly secured. Interest payments and     
principal security appear adequate for the present, but certain protective      
elements may be lacking or may be characteristically unreliable over any great  
length of time. Such bonds lack outstanding investment characteristics and in   
fact have speculative characteristics as well.                                  

    Ba--Bonds rated Ba are judged to have speculative elements; their future
cannot be considered as well assured. Often the protection of interest and      
principal payments may be very moderate and thereby not well safeguarded during 
both good and bad times over the future. Uncertainty of position characterizes  
bonds in this class.                                                            

 A-1

P-->497Last�Page�of�75TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�75th
B--Bonds rated B generally lack characteristics of the desirable    
investment. Assurance of interest and principal payments or of maintenance of   
other terms of the contract over any long period of time may be small.          

      Caa--Bonds rated Caa are of poor standing. Such bonds may be in default or
there may be present elements of danger with respect to principal or interest.  

   Ca--Bonds rated Ca represent obligations that are speculative in a high
degree. Such bonds are often in default or have other marked shortcomings.      

S&P RATINGS                                                                     

   AAA--Bonds rated AAA have the highest rating. The obligor's capacity to
meet its financial commitment on the bond is extremely strong.                  

AA--Bonds rated AA differ from AAA bonds only in small degree. The  
obligor's capacity to meet its financial commitment on the bond is very strong. 

    A--Bonds rated A are somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of
changes in circumstances and economic conditions than bonds in higher rated     
categories. However, the obligor's capacity to meet its financial commitment on 
the bond is still strong.                                                       

 BBB--Bonds rated BBB exhibit adequate protection parameters. However,
adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to
a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the bond.

  BB--B--CCC--CC AND C--Bonds rated BB, B, CCC, CC and C are regarded as
having significant speculative characteristics. BB indicates the lowest degree  
of speculation among such bonds and C the highest degree of speculation. While  
such bonds will likely have some quality and protective characteristics, these  
may be outweighed by large uncertainties or major exposures to adverse          
conditions.

SUMMARY 

This summary of the Code of Ethics and Insider Trading Policy (the "Code") is   
provided for your convenience. It is not a substitute for reading and           
understanding the Code, and all personnel are responsible for complying with the
Code as a condition of continuing employment with Calamos Asset Management,     
Inc., ("CAM") its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, "Calamos").        

One of the most important assets that Calamos has is its reputation. Clients    
would not retain Calamos or invest in its products if they did not trust us, and
the Code is designed to establish certain standards and procedures that will    
ensure that their trust is well-placed. Most of the provisions of the Code      
mirror requirements of federal securities laws, or those of agencies that       
regulate our businesses, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission and the 
NASD. These provisions require Calamos to place the interests of its clients    
first at all times, and not to take inappropriate advantage of the trust which  
our clients and others place in us. The Code also is designed to assure that    
Calamos' investment decisions remain independent and are not influenced by      
personal considerations.                                                        

The Code addresses five main areas:                                             

-    Restrictions on the use of Material Nonpublic Information;       

   -    Confidentiality of information obtained in the course of employment;

-    Public disclosure of information about CAM;                      

   -    The buying and selling of securities by Calamos personnel (including
the buying and selling of securities of CAM itself); and    

-    Specific limitations on activity of Calamos personnel imposed by 
various regulations.                                        

The first four of these areas focus on the legal and regulatory obligations of  
Calamos and its personnel with respect to inside information and trading on or  
disclosing that information. The final area deals with regulatory limitations on
conduct by Calamos personnel that could potentially harm Calamos or its         
customers in other ways.                                                        

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT THE CODE 

   -    Provisions of the Code apply to all Calamos personnel, as well as to
their "Related Persons," which includes spouses.            

-    You may never buy or sell a security if you are aware of Material
   Nonpublic Information that is relevant to the transaction. This
        prohibition applies to transactions that you may authorize or advise
         for any Calamos customer or personal securities account that you own,
    in whole or part, or have control or substantial influence over.

     -    You may not buy or sell any security if that transaction could cause a
      conflict of interest or an appearance of a conflict of interest in
relation to your position with Calamos.                     

 -    You must pre-clear personal transactions involving publicly traded
         Covered Securities of individual companies not meeting the de minimis
exception.                                                  

-1- 

P-->EX-99.(P)5th�Page�of�28TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�5th
     -    The de minimis exception does not exist for purchases and sales of CAM
       securities. All transactions in CAM securities must be pre-cleared.

 -    Any investment in an open-end mutual fund advised or subadvised by
      Calamos must be held for at least 30 days. Exceptions must receive
   prior approval and will be limited to hardship or other unusual
circumstances.                                              

  -    You must pre-clear the purchase or sale of exchange traded funds as
  these securities are deemed to be Covered Securities under the
provisions of the Code.                                     

-    You may not purchase or sell exchange traded or OTC options or   
futures.                                                    

     -    Transactions and holdings reports are maintained in confidence, except
          to the extent necessary to implement and enforce the provisions of the
   Code or to comply with requests for information from government
agencies.                                                   

ASK FIRST 

If you have questions regarding the Code or any particular securities           
transaction, call a member of the Legal and Compliance Department before acting.

UNDERSTANDING AND APPLYING THE CODE 

PURPOSE 

The investment management, mutual funds and financial services industries are   
highly regulated. All are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations     
designed to protect investors. Similarly, publicly-traded companies are required
to meet strict standards to protect the integrity of the markets in which their 
securities trade.                                                               

Calamos Asset Management, Inc. ("CAM") is a publicly-traded company. Its        
subsidiaries and affiliated companies are primarily involved in the investment  
management, mutual funds and financial services industries. Predictably, CAM is 
subject to a wide variety of regulations. These regulations also apply to the   
directors, officers and employees of Calamos and its subsidiaries (unless       
otherwise indicated in this Code of Ethics and Insider Trading Policy (the      
"Code"), the term "Calamos" will mean CAM and its subsidiaries). The purpose of 
the Code is to explain certain of the responsibilities of Calamos and its       
personnel, and to establish standards to which all Calamos personnel are held.  
The Code supplements the CAM Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and the Calamos
Employee Handbook.                                                              

SCOPE 

The Code applies to all directors, officers and employees of Calamos and other  
businesses effectively controlled by Calamos, as well as to any outsiders,      
including agents and consultants, that have access through Calamos to Material  
Nonpublic Information.                                                          

The Code applies to all transactions in securities including but not limited to 
common stock, options and other derivative instruments (e.g. futures contracts) 
for common stock, debt securities, and any other securities that CAM or any     
other company may issue.                                                        

Questions regarding the Code or its application to specific transactions should 
be directed to the Chief Compliance Officer or General Counsel of Calamos.      

UNDERSTANDING THE TERMS 

Various securities laws make it illegal to buy or sell a company's securities   
when in possession of Material Nonpublic Information (as defined below) about   
the issuer or its securities. This conduct is known as "insider trading."       
Passing on Material Nonpublic Information to someone else who may buy or sell   
securities to which the information relates is also illegal. This conduct is    
known as "tipping."
"MATERIAL" INFORMATION                                                

Information should be regarded as material if it could be important to decisions
to buy, sell or hold a company's securities. Any information that could         
reasonably be expected to affect the price of company securities should be      
considered material. Material information can be positive or negative, and can  
relate to historical facts, projections, or future events. Material information 
can pertain to a company as a whole, or to divisions or subsidiaries of a       
company.                                                                        

During the course of their employment, Calamos personnel can learn material     
information about many companies, including CAM. Information dealing with the   
following subjects is likely to be found material in particular situations:

-    Stock repurchases                                      

-    Changes in debt ratings                                

-    Significant new equity or debt offerings               

Corporate Developments:                                     

       -    Proposals, plans or agreements, even if preliminary in nature,
        involving significant mergers, acquisitions, divestitures,
recapitalizations, or strategic alliances         

-    Major changes in directors or executive officers       

Product Related Subjects:                                   

-    Important new product offerings                        

          -    Significant developments related to a company's product offerings

     -    Significant developments related to a company's distribution
relationships                                     

  -    Significant developments related to intellectual property

Other Subjects:                                             

-    Developments regarding significant litigation          

-    Developments regarding government agency actions       

-    Execution or termination of significant contracts      

This list is only illustrative, and certainly is not all-encompassing. Many     
other types of information may be considered material. When in doubt about      
whether particular information about CAM or another company is material,        
exercise caution and consult with the Chief Compliance Officer or the General   
Counsel.                                                                        

"NONPUBLIC" INFORMATION                                               

Information about a company is considered nonpublic if it is not available to   
the general public. In order for information to be considered available to the  
general public, it must have been widely disseminated in a manner designed to   
reach investors. This is generally done by the company issuing a national press 
release or making a publicly-available filing with the Securities and Exchange  
Commission ("SEC"). The circulation of rumors, even if accurate and reported in 
the media, does not constitute effective public dissemination.                  

-4- 

P-->EX-99.(P)8th�Page�of�28TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�8th
Even after public disclosure of material information regarding a company, an    
insider with knowledge of the information must wait a period of two full trading
days after the publication for the information to be absorbed before that person
can treat the information as public.                                            

For purposes of the Code, a full trading day means from the opening of trading  
on NASDAQ to the closing of trading on NASDAQ on that day. Accordingly, if an   
announcement is made before the commencement of trading on a Tuesday, an        
employee in possession of such information may trade in Company securities      
starting on Thursday of that week (subject to any applicable blackout period and
assuming the employee is not aware of other Material Nonpublic Information at   
that time), because two full trading days would have elapsed by then (all of    
Tuesday and Wednesday). If the announcement is made on Tuesday after trading has
begun on NASDAQ, an employee in possession of the information may not trade in  
Company securities until Friday. If the announcement is made on Friday after    
trading begins, an employee may not trade in Company securities until Wednesday 
of the following week. NASDAQ holidays do not count as trading days and will    
impact this schedule.                                                           

"MATERIAL NONPUBLIC INFORMATION" 

Material Nonpublic Information is information that is not known to the general  
public, that, if known, could reasonably be expected to affect the price of a   
company's securities, or be considered important in deciding whether to buy,    
sell or hold a security. It is often referred to as "inside information."
"TIPPING" 

Tipping is the disclosure of Material Nonpublic Information to another person   
for the purpose of trading or other unauthorized purpose. Tipping can result in 
liability for both the tipper and tippee.                                       

"COVERED SECURITY" 

Covered Security means any stock, bond, future, investment contract, shares of  
closed-end mutual funds, shares of open-end mutual funds for which Calamos is   
the advisor or subadvisor, exchange traded funds, or any other instrument that  
is considered a "security" of the Investment Company Act of 1940. The term      
"Covered Security" is very broad and includes items you might not ordinarily    
think of as "securities," such as: options on securities, on indexes, and on    
currencies; limited partnerships; foreign unit trusts, foreign mutual funds;    
municipal securities, private investment funds, hedge funds, investment clubs;  
or any right to acquire any security such as a warrant or convertible. In       
addition, purchases and sale transactions in Covered Securities in any 401K     
plan, excluding percentage allocation changes or payroll deduction percentages, 
are considered transactions in Covered Securities. The term Covered Security    
does not include direct obligations of the U. S. government (U.S. treasury      
bills, notes and bonds), and money market instruments (including bank           
certificates of deposit, bankers' acceptances, commercial paper and repurchase  
agreements), shares of open-end mutual funds not advised or subadvised by       
Calamos and units in 529 College Savings Plans.                                 

"BENEFICIAL INTEREST" 

Beneficial Interest shall be interpreted in the same manner as it would be under
Rule 16a-1(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, in determining
whether a person is a beneficial owner of a security for the purposes of Section
16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and rules and regulations
thereunder. As a general matter, "Beneficial Interest" will be attributed to a  
covered person where the covered person (i) possesses the ability to purchase or
sell Covered Securities (or ability to                                          

-5- 

P-->EX-99.(P)9th�Page�of�28TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�9th
direct the disposition of the Covered Securities); (ii) possesses voting power  
(including the power to vote or to direct the voting) over such Covered         
Securities; or (iii) receives any benefits substantially equivalent to those of 
ownership.                                                                      

CONSEQUENCES OF FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH CODE 

EXTERNAL PENALTIES 

Legal penalties for trading on or tipping Material Nonpublic Information are    
severe. They include criminal fines, civil fines of several times the profits   
gained or losses avoided, imprisonment and private party damages. The penalties 
also may apply to anyone who directly or indirectly controlled the person who   
committed the violation, including the employer and its management and          
supervisory personnel. Significant penalties have been imposed even when the    
disclosing person did not profit from the trading.                              

ACTION BY CALAMOS 

In addition to these possible outside sanctions, Calamos personnel who violate  
prohibitions on insider trading or tipping will face additional action from     
Calamos itself, up to and including termination of employment.                  

Compliance with the provisions of the Code is a condition of employment of      
Calamos. Taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, management of    
Calamos will determine what action is appropriate for any breach of the         
provisions of the Code. Possible actions include letters of sanction, suspension
or termination of employment or removal from office.                            

The Boards of Trustees of any investment company for which Calamos Advisors LLC 
is the investment adviser (each, a "Fund") will determine what action is        
appropriate for any breach of the provisions of the Code by an Outside Trustee, 
which may include removal from the Boards. The Board of Directors of CAM will   
determine what action is appropriate for any breach of the provisions of the    
Code by an Outside Director, which may include removal from the Board.          

Transactions and reports filed pursuant to the Code will be maintained in       
confidence, except to the extent necessary to implement and enforce the         
provisions of the Code or to comply with request for information from government
agencies. Additional information may be required to clarify the nature of       
particular transactions.

RESTRICTIONS ON THE USE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION BY CALAMOS PERSONNEL 

GENERAL PROHIBITIONS 

Material Nonpublic Information is a legally very important type of confidential 
information, but it is only one type of confidential information. Our customers 
and suppliers entrust Calamos with important information relating to their      
personal and business matters. The nature of this relationship requires strict  
confidentiality and trust. In safeguarding the information received, Calamos    
earns the respect and further trust of our customers and suppliers. All         
employees will be required to sign a Confidentiality Agreement at the time they 
are hired and this agreement carries an obligation to maintain strict           
confidentiality, even after an employee's employment is terminated.             

Any violation of confidentiality seriously injures Calamos' reputation and      
effectiveness. Therefore, personnel are not to discuss confidential Calamos     
business with anyone who does not work for Calamos, and should never discuss    
business transactions with anyone who does not have a direct association with   
the transaction. Even casual remarks can be misinterpreted and repeated;        
therefore, employees should develop the personal discipline necessary to        
maintain confidentiality. If an employee becomes aware of anyone breaking this  
trust, they should report the incident to a member of management immediately.   

If someone outside Calamos or the employee's department asks questions regarding
confidential matters, you are not required to answer. Instead, you should refer 
the request to the department supervisor or a member of senior management.      

No one is permitted to remove or make copies of any Calamos records, reports or 
documents without prior approval from management.                               

MATERIAL NONPUBLIC INFORMATION ABOUT OTHER COMPANIES 

Calamos personnel may become aware of confidential information concerning       
another company. This information may be Material Nonpublic Information and, as 
noted above, trading of securities, including futures or options of the company 
based on this information is a violation of federal securities law. An employee 
cannot trade on this information. Because of its seriousness, trading on or     
tipping of confidential information about other companies will result in        
immediate termination of employment. Trading in open-end mutual funds, like the 
Calamos Mutual Funds, is generally permitted because the pricing of shares in   
these Funds is done daily, and has greater transparency than the pricing of     
other securities. However, there may be times when such trading would be        
improper based upon other information.                                          

MATERIAL NONPUBLIC INFORMATION ABOUT CALAMOS 

If a director, officer, employee, agent or consultant of Calamos has Material   
Nonpublic Information relating to CAM or its securities, it is CAM's policy that
neither that person nor any Related Person (as defined below) may buy, sell or  
recommend securities of CAM. The prohibition applies to market purchases and    
sales that are part of stock option exercises. It is the responsibility of each 
employee to make sure that transactions in any Covered Security by any Related  
Person complies with the provisions of the Code.                                

No director, officer, employee, agent or consultant of Calamos may disclose     
("tip") Material Nonpublic Information about CAM to any other person, including 
Related Persons, not authorized by Calamos to have such information.

In addition, no director, officer, employee, agent or consultant of Calamos may 
make recommendations or express opinions based on Material Nonpublic Information
regarding trading in CAM securities.                                            

CONFIDENTIALITY OF NONPUBLIC INFORMATION ABOUT CALAMOS 

Nonpublic information relating to Calamos is the property of Calamos and the    
unauthorized disclosure of such information is prohibited. Various laws and     
regulations govern the methods and timing of announcements of information to the
public. Unauthorized disclosures to select individuals or groups could result in
substantial liability for you and Calamos.                                      

PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION ABOUT CALAMOS AND ITS CLOSED-END FUNDS 

In the event any director, officer, employee, agent, or consultant of Calamos   
receives any inquiry from outside the company, such as from the media, a stock  
analyst or investors, for information that may be nonpublic information         
(particularly financial results or projections), the inquiry must be referred to
the Calamos Investor Relations Department. Since Calamos' closed-end funds are  
also publicly traded, the same restrictions apply to disclosure of information  
about those products. This department is responsible for coordinating and       
overseeing the release of such information to the media, investing public,      
analysts and others in compliance with applicable laws and regulations,         
including Regulation FD.                                                        

In communicating with analysts and the general public, Calamos and CAM will     
observe the following practices:                                                

    -    Communications to analysts or the general public regarding CAM should
          be made only by John P. Calamos, Sr., Nick P. Calamos, Pat Dudasik, or
by the Calamos Investor Relations Department of CAM.        

  -    CAM will not issue projections of, or comment on, future investment
      performance of itself or any of its products, including the mutual
funds.                                                      

  -    All disclosure of material information made by CAM about itself and
        the closed-end funds managed by Calamos will be broadly disseminated
to the public.                                              

-    Ordinary communications of material information by and about CAM 
          generally will be through press release, through regular channels. CAM
          will not issue materials regarding itself "for broker-dealer use only"
     or with similar restrictions; instead, any such materials will be
   distributed as press releases. If conference telephone calls to
        discuss material information are scheduled by CAM with analysts, CAM
      will provide adequate notice of the calls, and permit investors to
listen in by telephone or Internet web casting.             

If any Calamos employee inadvertently discloses Material Nonpublic Information  
to analysts or other market professionals about CAM, or the closed-end funds    
managed by Calamos, CAM is obligated to provide that information to the general 
public no later than 24 hours after the statement is made, or the commencement  
of the next day's trading on NASDAQ. The Investor Relations and the Legal       
Department must be notified immediately of any such inadvertent disclosure that 
comes to the attention of any Calamos personnel.

THE PURCHASE AND SALE OF SECURITIES BY CALAMOS PERSONNEL 

Persons employed throughout the financial services industry are subject to      
restrictions on the way in which they can buy and sell securities for their own 
accounts. These restrictions are imposed by the SEC and other regulators on the 
assumption that industry employees have a greater opportunity for access to     
Material Nonpublic Information than do employees in other types of businesses.  
There are additional restrictions imposed on the trading of Calamos personnel in
securities of CAM. Calamos has long had such restrictions on the personal       
securities trading activity of its personnel. Such limitations are designed to  
prevent violations of the securities laws, as well as to avoid even the         
appearance of impropriety in trading by Calamos personnel, and all personal     
trading must be done in a manner consistent with the provisions of this Code.   

TRADING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR NON-CAM SECURITIES 

REPORTING RULES 

As part of its obligations under the securities laws, Calamos is required to    
maintain information about the trading activity of its personnel.               

        INITIAL DISCLOSURE OF COVERED ACCOUNTS AND RELATED PERSONS

When a person begins employment with Calamos, he or she must disclose on an     
Initial Securities Holdings Form the following types of brokerage accounts, if  
any:                                                                            

    -    Accounts in your name, in whole or part, including any joint account,
family account and self-directed account, that hold covered 
securities;                                                 

    -    ACCOUNTS IN THE NAME OF YOUR SPOUSE AND MINOR CHILDREN LIVING IN YOUR

    -    Accounts of any other member of your household for which you exercise
control or substantial influence;

     partner) for which you exercise control or substantial influence;

or otherwise exercise substantial influence;                

    -    Trust accounts and similar arrangements which benefit you directly or
         indirectly (but excluding accounts for which you do not substantially
influence investment policy or other decisions, directly or

 -    Corporate accounts controlled, directly or indirectly, by you; and

  -    Accounts in the name of unrelated third parties, such as a civic or

UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS, ACCOUNT HOLDERS WHO FALL INTO THESE          
CATEGORIES ARE "RELATED PERSONS," AND ARE SUBJECT TO THE SAME RESTRICTIONS ON   
TRADING AS ACTUAL CALAMOS PERSONNEL. CALAMOS PERSONNEL ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR

No INVESTMENT PERSON, ACCESS PERSON or OUTSIDE TRUSTEE shall knowingly sell to  
or purchase from a client any security or other property except securities      
issued by that Client.                                                          

NO CONFLICTING TRANSACTIONS 

No INVESTMENT PERSON, ACCESS PERSON or OUTSIDE TRUSTEE shall purchase or sell   
for his or her own personal account and benefit, or for the account and benefit 
of any relative, any Covered Security (other than shares of a Fund) that the    
person knows or has reason to believe is being purchased or sold or considered  
for purchase or sale by a client, until the client's transactions have been     
completed or consideration of such transactions has been abandoned. A           
conflicting order is any order for the same security, or option on that order,  
that has not been fully executed. A purchase of a security is being "actively   
considered" (a) when a recommendation to purchase or sell has been made for the 
Client and is pending or (b) with respect to the person making the              
recommendation, when that person is seriously considering making the            
recommendation.                                                                 

Absent extraordinary circumstances, a personal securities transaction shall not 
be executed until the fifth business day after completion of any transaction for
a Client. The purchase and sale of shares of any Fund by an INVESTMENT PERSON,  
ACCESS PERSON, OUTSIDE TRUSTEE OR OUTSIDE DIRECTOR shall not be viewed as a     
conflicting transaction for the purpose of this section.                        

INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS 

No INVESTMENT PERSON or ACCESS PERSON shall acquire any security in an initial  
public offering.                                                                

PRIVATE PLACEMENTS 

No INVESTMENT PERSON or ACCESS PERSON shall acquire any security in a private   
placement without the express written prior approval of the President or Senior 
Executive Vice President of Calamos. In deciding whether that approval should be
granted, consideration will be given to whether the investment opportunity      
should be reserved for clients and whether the opportunity has been offered     
because of the                                                                  

-14-

P-->EX-99.(P)18th�Page�of�28TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�18th
person's relationship with Calamos or its clients. An INVESTMENT PERSON who has 
been authorized to acquire a security in a private placement must disclose that 
investment if he or she later participates in consideration of an investment in 
that issuer for a client's account. Any investment decision for the client      
relating to that security must be made by other Investment Persons.             

SHORT-TERM TRADING 

No INVESTMENT PERSON may profit from the purchase and sale, or sale and         
purchase, of the same (or equivalent) securities, other than shares of mutual   
funds, within 60 days if the same (or equivalent) securities have been held by a
Client during such 60-day period. Any profit so realized will be required to be 
donated to a charitable organization selected by Calamos.                       

EXCEPTIONS AND EXEMPTIONS 

DISCRETIONARY ACCOUNTS OF OUTSIDE TRUSTEES 

Purchases and sales of securities in an account in which an Outside Trustee or a
Related Person has a Beneficial Interest shall not be subject to the            
prohibitions of the Code if the account is managed by someone other than the    
Outside Trustee or Related Person, and the Outside Trustee or Related Person did
not have knowledge of the transactions until after they had been executed,      
provided the Outside Trustee has previously identified the account to Calamos'  
Chief Compliance Officer.                                                       

DE MINIMIS EXCEPTION 

Purchases or sales in an amount less than $10,000 in a Covered Security of an   
issuer (other than shares of mutual funds) that has a market capitalization of  
at least $5 billion are exempt from the prohibitions with respect to whether    
Calamos is trading the same security for the accounts of its clients of this    
Code, and are exempt from the pre-clearance requirements of the Code. However,  
please note that trades falling within this de minimis exception must be        
reported pursuant to the requirements of this Code.                             

This exception does not apply to transactions in securities of CAM regardless of
the dollar amount of the purchase or sale.                                      

HARDSHIPS 

Under unusual circumstances, such as a personal financial emergency, employee   
stock ownership plans, stock option plans and certain personal trusts, or when  
it is determined that no conflict of interest or other breach of duty is        
involved, application for an exemption to make a transaction may be made to the 
Chief Compliance Officer, which application may be denied or granted. To request
consideration of an exemption, submit a written request containing details on   
your circumstances, reasons for the exception and exception requested.          

The Chief Compliance Officer may, in unusual circumstances, approve exceptions  
from the Code of Ethics applicable to an individual, based on the unique        
circumstances of such individual and based on a determination that the          
exceptions can be granted (i) consistent with the individual's fiduciary        
obligations to Clients and (ii) pursuant to procedures that are reasonably      
designed to avoid a conflict of interest for the individual. Any such exceptions
shall be subject to such additional procedures, reviews and reporting as        
determined appropriate by the Chief Compliance Officer in connection with       
granting such exception. Any such exceptions will be reported to the Board of   
Directors of CAM at the meeting of the Board of Directors and the Boards of     
Trustees of the Funds, respectively, immediately following the grant of such    

-15-

P-->EX-99.(P)19th�Page�of�28TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�19th
exception, and such Board of Directors or Board of Trustees shall have the power
to revoke or modify any such exceptions prospectively.                          

POLICIES AND PROCEDURES REGARDING TRADING IN SECURITIES OF CAM 

The personal trading policies and procedures regarding securities of other      
companies are broadly designed to protect Calamos clients against potential     
misuse of Material Nonpublic Information by Calamos personnel that could        
disadvantage the client, or enrich Calamos personnel at the expense of clients. 

Additional restrictions apply to transactions in CAM securities by Calamos      
personnel. These restrictions are required under federal law to protect         
shareholders of Calamos from the potential misuse of Material Nonpublic         
Information about Calamos itself.                                               

Broadly speaking, the provisions of the Code with respect to the purchase and   
sale of securities of other companies apply equally to the purchase and sale of 
CAM securities. For example, covered accounts that hold CAM securities must be  
disclosed, duplicate confirmations and statements must be provided, and         
transactions in CAM securities must be pre-cleared. However, trading in CAM     
securities by CAM personnel and their Related Persons are limited to specific   
periods. Note that the de minimis exception applicable to securities of other   
companies does not apply to transactions in CAM securities by CAM personnel and 
their Related Persons. EVERY TRADE IN CAM SECURITIES MUST BE PRE-APPROVED.      

BLACKOUT PERIODS AND TRADING WINDOWS 

QUARTERLY BLACKOUT PERIODS 

The period leading up to CAM's announcement of its quarterly financial results  
is a particularly sensitive period of time for trading in CAM securities from   
the perspective of complying with applicable securities laws. During this       
period, directors, officers and certain employees and consultants may often     
possess Material Nonpublic Information about the expected financial results for 
the quarter. As a result, directors, officers and employees of CAM are          
prohibited from trading in CAM securities and entering into trading plans       
including but not limited to dividend reinvestments during the period beginning 
on the first day of the last fiscal month of each fiscal quarter and ending at  
the close of trading on the NASDAQ National Market ("NASDAQ") on the second full
trading day following the release of the quarterly financial results. The       
beginning and end of each such blackout period will be announced by the Chief   
Compliance Officer.                                                             

The exempt transactions described below under "Certain Exemptions" are          
permissible even during the quarterly blackout periods. However, entering into a
Rule 10b5-1 trading plan and setting up regularly scheduled plan transactions   
such as dividend reinvestment plan in CAM Securities are prohibited during      
blackout periods. Rule 10b5-1 trading plans are described further in that       
Section.                                                                        

RETIREMENT PLAN BLACKOUT PERIODS 

In the event that CAM shares are available in any Calamos retirement plan,      
directors and executive officers of Calamos are prohibited from purchasing,     
selling, acquiring or transferring Calamos shares and derivative securities     
acquired in connection with their service or employment during any blackout     
periods of more than three consecutive business days applicable to the          
participants in such retirement plan. Such blackout periods, while rare, usually
occur in connection with administrative changes to the plans and                

-16-

P-->EX-99.(P)20th�Page�of�28TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�20th
plan service providers. The retirement plan or its sponsor is required to give  
directors, executive officers and affected plan participants advance written    
notice of such retirement plan blackout periods.                                

These blackout periods are intended to conform to the current and any future    
requirements of and exceptions to Section 306 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002,
as amended ("Section 306"). This prohibition will be interpreted and implemented
in accordance with Section 306 and the regulations thereunder, as amended.      

EVENT SPECIFIC BLACKOUT PERIODS 

Calamos reserves the right to impose other trading blackouts from time to time  
on specified groups of its directors, officers, employees, agents or consultants
when, in the judgment of the CAM's General Counsel, a blackout period is        
warranted. Calamos will notify those affected by such a blackout of when the    
blackout begins and when it ends. Those affected should not disclose to others  
the fact of such trading suspension.                                            

TRADING WINDOWS 

To avoid even the appearance of impropriety, the most appropriate period for    
transactions in CAM securities by directors, officers, employees, agents and    
consultants who are routinely in possession of Material Nonpublic Information   
about CAM is the period beginning on the third full trading day through the     
twelfth trading day following each quarterly earnings release.                  

This trading window is based on the concept that CAM's disclosures to the       
investing public should be up to date and complete during that period. The      
securities markets also should have had a sufficient opportunity to digest the  
disclosures in the quarterly release.                                           

IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT EVEN DURING THE TRADING WINDOWS, ANY PERSON POSSESSING  
MATERIAL NONPUBLIC INFORMATION CONCERNING CAM SHOULD NOT ENGAGE IN ANY          
TRANSACTIONS IN CAM SECURITIES UNTIL SUCH INFORMATION HAS BEEN KNOWN PUBLICLY   
FOR AT LEAST TWO FULL TRADING DAYS, WHETHER OR NOT CAM HAS RECOMMENDED A        
SUSPENSION OF TRADING TO THAT PERSON. TRADING IN CAM SECURITIES DURING THE      
TRADING WINDOW SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A "SAFE HARBOR" FOR PURPOSES OF THE     
INSIDER TRADING LAWS. AND ALL DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES AND OTHER PERSONS  
SHOULD USE GOOD JUDGMENT AT ALL TIMES AND CONTACT THE CHIEF COMPLIANCE OFFICER  
OR GENERAL COUNSEL IF THERE ARE QUESTIONS.                                      

CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS 

The prohibitions against trading while in possession of Material Nonpublic      
Information and during blackout periods do not apply to the following types of  
transactions in CAM securities:                                                 

  -    Transactions pursuant to a binding contract, instruction or written
  plan that complies with the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 ("Rule
       10b5-1") under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
  "Act"). Any such contract, instruction or written plan must be
          presented to the Legal and Compliance Department for approval prior to
  entering into the first transaction under such an arrangement.

-    Rule 10b5-1 provides a defense from insider trading liability for
  trading contracts, instructions and plans that meet the rule's
         requirements. In general, a Rule 10b5-1 contract, instruction or plan
       must be entered into outside of blackout periods applicable to such
person and when the                                         

-17-

P-->EX-99.(P)21st�Page�of�28TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�21st
       person is not in possession of Material Nonpublic Information. Once
     the contract, instruction or plan is adopted, the person must not
          exercise any influence over the amount of securities to be traded, the
      price at which they are to be traded or the date of the trade. The
plan must either specify the amount, pricing and timing of  
         transactions when established or delegate discretion on these matters
to an independent third party, usually a broker.            

     -    Regularly scheduled and matching contributions to and withdrawals from
a CAM stock fund in a benefit plan when the contributions or
          withdrawals are put in place outside of blackout periods applicable to
such person and when not in possession of Material Nonpublic
Information;                                                

 -    Regularly scheduled purchases and reinvestments in and withdrawals
          from a dividend reinvestment plan when the purchases, reinvestments or
          withdrawals are put in place outside of blackout periods applicable to
such person and when not in possession of Material Nonpublic
       Information. However any such contract, instruction or written plan
        must be presented to the Compliance Department for approval prior to
entering into such an arrangement.                          

-    Bona fide gifts of CAM securities, unless there exists reason to 
          believe the recipient intends to sell the securities while you possess
Material Nonpublic Information;                             

-    Acceptance or vesting and any related stock withholding of stock 
          options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, phantom stock units
    or other grants issued under CAM's incentive compensation plans;

  -    Acquisition or disposition of stock in a stock split, reverse stock
          split, stock dividend, or other transaction affecting all shareholders
in a similar manner; and                                    

-    Any other transaction designated by the General Counsel of CAM as
exempt from the Code.                                       

PROHIBITIONS 

As an investment philosophy, CAM does not believe in speculation, and           
speculation often leads to insider trading issues. Accordingly, directors,      
officers and employees of CAM and its affiliates are prohibited from the        
following activities:                                                           

 -    Purchases or sales of exchange-listed or OTC options on CAM stock;

     -    The exercise of an option or right to purchase CAM shares, or the sale
        of CAM restricted stock which has vested, is generally not permitted
       if the final exercise date or the sale date falls within a blackout
          period, although certain transactions may be permitted, depending upon
specific circumstances.                                     

  -    Short term or day trading (i.e. purchases and sales within a 30 day
period) of CAM shares.                                      

-    Short sales of CAM shares, other than shorting against the box.  

Any exceptions to these restrictions must be approved in writing by both the    
Chief Compliance Officer and the General Counsel of CAM.                        

Although margining and pledging of CAM securities as collateral is not          
prohibited, it is strongly discouraged. In any margin or loan account, the      
securities used as collateral may be sold without your                          

-18-

P-->EX-99.(P)22nd�Page�of�28TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�22nd
consent to meet a margin call or to satisfy a loan. If such a sale occurs during
a blackout period, or when you have access to material non-public information,  
it may result in unlawful insider trading. Because of this danger, it is        
recommended that directors, officers, employees, agents and consultants of CAM  
not hold CAM stock in a margin account or pledge CAM stock as collateral for a  
loan.                                                                           

ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS 

Directors, including Outside Directors, and certain officers of CAM and its     
affiliated companies, as well as other personnel with regular access to CAM's   
financial information, must obtain prior clearance from the General Counsel of  
CAM before engaging in ANY transaction in CAM securities and securities of      
closed-end funds managed by CAM. This includes trades within the trading windows
described above. A request should be made at least two business days in advance 
of the proposed trade date, and the clearance will generally be good for 48     
hours. CAM personnel subject to this requirement are listed in Attachment A,    
which may be amended from time to time.                                         

In addition, initial participation in a dividend reinvestment plan of CAM stock 
must be pre-cleared by CAM's General Counsel and thereafter only for changes in 
reinvestment directions (e.g. change in the percent of the dividend amount being
reinvested). The following information must be provided initially for each      
dividend reinvestment plan of CAM stock you participate in: (i) the name of the 
plan and plan sponsor; (ii) the reinvestment directions give to the plan        
sponsor; and (iii) form of ownership (e.g. hold directly, jointly with spouse,  
through a trust, etc.). Typically, these transactions need to be reported to the
SEC within two business days after the execution of the transaction.            

Such persons also may trade in CAM securities and securities of closed-end funds
managed by CAM pursuant to the provisions of Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities      
Exchange Act of 1934. Rule 10b5-1 provides a defense from insider trading       
liability for trading contracts, instructions and plans that meet the rule's    
requirements by sharply limiting the discretion an insider has over the timing, 
amount and pricing of trades. In general, a Rule 10b5-1 contract, instruction or
plan must be entered into, in writing, outside of blackout periods applicable to
such person and when the person is not in possession of material nonpublic      
information. Once the contract, instruction or plan is adopted, the person must 
not exercise any influence over the amount of securities to be traded, the price
at which they are to be traded or the date of the trade. In short, it is similar
to regularly scheduled purchases and reinvestments in, or withdrawals from,     
dividend reinvestment plans or similar programs. The plan must either specify   
the amount, pricing and timing of transactions when established or delegate     
discretion on these matters to an independent third party, usually a broker.    
Such arrangements must be approved by the Legal & Compliance Department prior to
the first transaction.                                                          

SECTION 16 REPORTING AND PROHIBITIONS 

Under the requirements of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,    
certain parties are required to report any transactions in CAM securities       
including but not limited to dividend reinvestments on a regular basis. These   
persons include:                                                                

-    CAM's CEO                                                        

-    CAM's principal financial officer                                

     -    CAM's principal accounting officer (or, if there is no such accounting
officer, the controller)                                    

-    Any director of CAM, including Outside Directors                 

-19-

P-->EX-99.(P)23rd�Page�of�28TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�23rd
-    Any vice-president of CAM in charge of a principal business unit,
   division or function (such as sales, administration or finance)

 -    Any other officer of CAM who performs a policy-making function, or

     -    Any other person who performs similar policy-making functions for CAM.

Officers of CAM's parent(s) or subsidiaries shall be deemed officers of CAM if  
they perform such policy-making functions for CAM. In general such persons are  
deemed to have inside information by virtue of their positions within CAM.      

Transactions of immediate family members of the persons listed above also are   
generally subject to the reporting requirements, on the theory that the         
director, officer or principal shareholder will financially benefit from these  
transactions. For Section 16 purposes, "immediate family" means any child,      
stepchild, grandchild, parent, stepparent, grandparent, spouse, sibling,        
mother-in-law, father-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law, or   
sister-in-law, including adoptive relationships.                                

These persons, as well as any holder of more than 10% of CAM stock, must file   
initial reports of CAM share ownership on Form 3 and subsequent reports of      
transactions on Form 4. Although the Legal Department of CAM is prepared to     
assist these persons in preparing such filings, the responsibility for such     
filings, including notifying CAM of the transaction and seeking pre-clearance,  
is that of the person.                                                          

In addition to the periodic reporting requirements, directors, officers and     
principal shareholders of CAM are subject to the "short swing" trading          
provisions of Section 16. Subject to certain exceptions, an officer, director or
principal shareholder of CAM who engages in any combination of purchase and     
sale, or sale and purchase of a CAM security within any period of less than six 
months must turn over to CAM any profit realized or loss avoided by such a      
combination of transactions. This is an absolute penalty imposed by law, and it 
is imposed regardless of any intention on the part of the director, officer or  
owner.                                                                          

CAM's Legal Department is prepared to assist these persons in determining and   
satisfying their obligations under Section 16, but that assistance can be       
offered only if the transactions are reported to CAM's General Counsel for      
pre-approval.                                                                   

RULE 144 

Directors and executive officers of CAM are required to file Form 144 with the  
SEC and NASDAQ before making an open market sale of CAM shares. The Form 144    
notifies the SEC and NASDAQ of an intent to sell CAM shares. Although the Form  
144 is generally prepared and filed by the Calamos Legal Department, the        
reporting person retains responsibility for the timeliness and accuracy of      
reports. Again, that assistance can be offered only if the transactions are     
reported to CAM's General Counsel for pre-approval.                             

-20-

P-->EX-99.(P)24th�Page�of�28TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�24th
OTHER REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS 

Certain other restrictions are imposed upon Calamos personnel, other than       
Outside Trustees, Unaffiliated Trustees and Outside Directors, as a result of   
being in a highly regulated industry.                                           

OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT 

What employees do outside the office on their own time is their business as long
as it does not reflect negatively on the Company. However, for full-time        
employees of Calamos, it is expected that their position with the company is    
their primary employment. Any outside activity must not interfere with an       
employee's ability to properly perform his or her job responsibilities.         

Personnel contemplating a second job must notify their supervisor immediately.  
The supervisor will thoroughly discuss this opportunity with the employee to    
ensure it will not interfere with job performance at Calamos, nor pose a        
conflict of interest. All outside business activities must be approved by the   
Department Head and reported to the Chief Compliance Officer via the completion 
of the Notice of Outside Business Activities Form.                              

SERVICE AS A DIRECTOR OR OFFICER 

No INVESTMENT PERSON or ACCESS PERSON may serve as a member of the board of     
directors or trustees, or as an officer, of any publicly-held company without   
the prior written approval of the President or the Chief Compliance Officer,    
based on a determination that the board service would not be inconsistent with  
the interests of the clients of CAM. If an INVESTMENT PERSON is serving as a    
board member, that INVESTMENT PERSON shall not participate in making investment 
decisions relating to the securities of the company on whose board he or she    
sits. Because of the potential for real or apparent conflicts of interests, such
service is strongly discouraged.                                                

GIFTS 

Regulators require that Calamos monitor the receipt and giving of gifts. The    
regulatory concern is that the receipt or giving of gifts, or excessive         
entertainment or favors could interfere with fiduciary judgment.                

ACCEPTING GIFTS AND ENTERTAINMENT 

Except as otherwise specifically stated below, an INVESTMENT PERSON, ACCESS     
PERSON or his/her family members must not accept excessive gifts, entertainment 
or favors from current or prospective customers or suppliers of Calamos. Cash   
gifts and checks or gift certificates convertible into cash are always          
inappropriate and must never be accepted. Other gifts up to $100 in retail value
may be accepted if the INVESTMENT PERSON or ACCESS PERSON is certain that there 
is no conflict of interest or appearance of any conflict of interest raised by  
the gift(s). If an employee receives a gift, over a $100 retail value, the      
employee must submit a written report to the Chief Compliance Officer. Reports  
submitted to the Chief Compliance Officer must contain the following            
information: name of recipient; title or position; department; name of donor;   
description of gift; date received; actual or estimated value. Such reports are 
to be prepared and submitted immediately upon receipt of such gift. Senior      
Management reserves the right to require the person to return any gift if it    
determines such return is appropriate under the circumstances.                  

Invitations for excessive or extravagant entertainment must be declined. If such
entertainment is accepted inadvertently, it must be reported in writing in      
accordance with the above guidelines. Employees should only accept types of     
entertainment that they believe would be deemed appropriate. No gifts should be 

-21-

P-->EX-99.(P)25th�Page�of�28TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�25th
accepted by one employee from another employee if accepting such gifts would    
create a conflict of interest or the appearance thereof, if such gifts would be 
considered excessive, or if such gifts are inappropriate or in bad taste.       

PRESENTING GIFTS AND ENTERTAINMENT 

In situations where Calamos is to present a gift, entertainment, or other       
accommodation to a current or prospective customer or supplier, INVESTMENT      
PERSONS or ACCESS PERSONS must use careful judgment to determine that the matter
is handled in good taste and without excessive expense. All entertainment       
presented by Calamos or in the name of Calamos must be appropriate and in good  
taste. Employees presenting a gift, entertainment or accommodation must be      
certain that such gift, entertainment or accommodation they have selected would 
be appropriate. If there are any questions as to whether or not a particular    
form of gift, entertainment or accommodation is appropriate, such gift,         
entertainment or accommodation should not be presented. Prior approval from the 
Chief Compliance Officer is required before purchasing a gift with a retail     
value over $100 or the presentation of a gift combined with other gifts given to
the same client during the calendar year would exceed $100. Reports should      
include name of donor; title or position; department; name of recipient,        
description of gift; date presented; and actual value.                          

INVESTMENT PERSONS or ACCESS PERSONS sometimes obtain Calamos-owned tickets to  
sporting or cultural events, etc. When an INVESTMENT PERSON or ACCESS PERSON is 
accompanying a customer to the event using the Calamos-owned tickets, the use of
such tickets is considered to be customer entertainment. When an INVESTMENT     
PERSON or ACCESS PERSON presents such tickets to a customer, but does not attend
the event with the customer, the presentation of such Calamos-owned tickets is  
then considered a gift to the customer. In either event, care must be taken to  
ensure that such gift or entertainment is an appropriate business expense for   
Calamos. It is expected that Calamos-owned tickets would not be repeatedly used 
to entertain, or be presented as gifts to, the same customer.                   

IDENTIFYING ACTUAL OR POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST 

Calamos believes that the interests of Calamos and its clients can and should be
aligned, despite the potential for conflicts of interest in the investment      
adviser/client relationship. In addition to being in the best interests of our  
clients to avoid conflicts of interest, it is in the best interest of Calamos   
itself to avoid actual and even, if possible, potential conflicts of interest.  

In a company of our size and complexity, it can become difficult to identify    
conflicts of interest and other potential problems. But identification is the   
first and most necessary step in resolving those issues. Calamos believes that  
those dealing with the details of running its business operations are in just as
good a position - often a better one - as Calamos management to identify        
potential problems.                                                             

All Calamos employees have an interest in identifying and solving potential     
problems. Each employee should feel free to raise questions and analyze what he 
or she is doing. In the end, Calamos is paying all of us to think and use our   
best judgment, and that includes raising questions and joining the discussion   
that shapes our business policies and practices. If any employee is concerned   
about an apparent conflict of interest, or any other legal or ethical question  
involving our businesses, we want to hear from you so that we can take the      
appropriate action.                                                             

Calamos recognizes that some people may feel uncomfortable raising issues,      
especially if they question the propriety of something that is occurring.       
Although people should not be afraid to raise these points openly, as an        
alternative Calamos has established the EthicsPoint program for reporting and   
resolving issues under the Calamos Standards of Conduct, including conflicts of 
interest and other legal or ethical                                             

-22-

P-->EX-99.(P)26th�Page�of�28TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�26th
issues. Under the EthicsPoint program, any employee can report any type of      
actual or suspected violation on an anonymous, no retaliation basis. The        
EthicsPoint program, which is described more completely on the Calamos intranet 
site, has established a procedure for investigating and resolving such issues,  
and the same procedures will be used to resolve issues raised face-to-face,     
outside the EthicsPoint program.                                                

YEARLY CERTIFICATION 

Copies of the Code will be provided to all personnel at least yearly. They will 
be required to sign a certification that they have read and understand the      
provisions of the Code, and that they have abided by all of its provisions.     

RECORD RETENTION 

The Compliance Department shall maintain the records listed below for a period  
of five years in a readily accessible place:                                    

 -    A copy of each Code that has been in effect at any time during the
past five years;                                            

     -    A record of any violation of the Code and any action taken as a result
       of such violation for five years from the end of the fiscal year in

  -    A record of all written acknowledgements of receipt of the Code and
        amendments for each person who is currently, or within the past five

-    A record of any decision and supporting reasons for approving the
          acquisition of securities in limited offerings for at least five years
   after the end of the fiscal year in which approval was granted;

     -    A copy of each Initial Statement of Beneficial Ownership of Securities
  ( SEC Form 3), Statement of Changes of Beneficial Ownership of
          Securities ( SEC Form 4), and Annual Statement of Beneficial Ownership
of Securities ( SEC Form 5).                                

Effective Date: June 30, 2005                                                   

Revised: June 28, 2006

	Example





	This example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of investing in other mutual funds. The example assumes that you invest
	$10,000 in the Fund for the time periods indicated and then either redeem or do not redeem your shares at the end of the reflected time periods. The example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year, that all dividends and capital

	Portfolio Turnover





	The Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or turns over its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may
	result in higher taxes when Fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in the annual fund operating expenses or in the example, affect the Funds performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the
	Funds portfolio turnover rate was 56.6% of the average value of its portfolio.




	 




	CVPRO 03/13







	Calamos Convertible Fund





	 







	Principal Investment Strategies





	The Fund
	invests mainly in a diversified portfolio of convertible securities issued by both U.S. and foreign companies without regard to market capitalization. These convertible securities may be either debt securities or preferred stocks that can be
	exchanged for common stock. Under normal circumstances, the Fund invests at least 80% of its net assets (plus any borrowings) in convertible securities. The average term to maturity of the convertible securities purchased by the Fund will typically
	range from two to ten years.




	The Fund may invest up to 25% of its net assets in foreign securities, but generally will invest approximately 5% to 15% of
	net assets in foreign securities.




	In analyzing the appreciation potential of the underlying common stock and the default risk of the convertible
	security, the Fund generally considers the issuers financial soundness, ability to make interest and dividend payments, earnings and cash flow forecast and quality of management. The Funds investment adviser seeks to lower the risks of
	investing in stocks by using a top-down approach of diversification by company, industry, sector, country and currency and focusing on macro-level investment themes. Consistent with the Funds investment objective and principal
	investment strategies the Funds investment adviser views the strategies as low volatility equity strategies and attempts to achieve equity-like returns with lower than equity market risk by managing a portfolio that it believes will
	exhibit less volatility over full market cycles.








	Principal Risks





	An investment in the Fund is subject to risks, and you could lose money on your investment in the Fund. There can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objectives. The risks associated with an
	investment in the Fund can increase during times of significant market volatility. Your investment in the Fund is not a deposit in a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.
	The principal risks of investing in the Fund include:



	 





	




	 






	Convertible Securities Risk

	 The value of a convertible security is influenced by changes in interest rates, with investment value declining as
	interest rates increase and increasing as interest rates decline. The credit standing of the issuer and other factors also may have an effect on the convertible securitys investment value.






	 





	




	 






	Synthetic Convertible Instruments Risk

	  The value of a synthetic convertible instrument will respond differently to market fluctuations than a
	convertible security because a synthetic convertible instrument is composed of two or more separate securities, each with its own market value. In addition, if the value of the underlying common stock or the level of the index involved in the
	convertible component falls below the exercise price of the warrant or option, the warrant or option may lose all value.






	 





	




	 






	Foreign Securities Risk

	  Risks associated with investing in foreign securities include fluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currencies
	that may affect the U.S. dollar value of a security, the possibility of substantial price volatility as a result of political and economic instability in the foreign country, less public information about issuers of securities, different securities
	regulation, different accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards and less liquidity than in U.S. markets.






	 





	




	 






	Equity Securities Risk

	  The securities markets are volatile, and the market prices of the Funds securities may decline generally. The
	price of equity securities fluctuates based on changes in a companys financial condition and overall market and economic conditions. If the market prices of the securities owned by the Fund fall, the value of your investment in the Fund will
	decline.






	 





	




	 






	Interest Rate Risk

	  The value of fixed-income securities generally decreases in periods when interest rates are rising. In addition, interest
	rate changes typically have a greater effect on prices of longer-term fixed-income securities than shorter-term fixed-income securities.






	 





	




	 






	Credit Risk

	  An issuer of a fixed-income security could be downgraded or default. If the Fund holds securities that have been downgraded, or
	that default on payment, the Funds performance could be negatively affected.






	 





	




	 






	High Yield Risk

	  High yield securities and unrated securities of similar credit quality (commonly known as junk bonds) are subject
	to greater levels of credit and liquidity risks. High yield securities are considered primarily speculative with respect to the issuers continuing ability to make principal and interest payments.






	 





	




	 






	Portfolio Selection Risk

	  The value of your investment may decrease if the investment advisers judgment about the attractiveness, value
	or market trends affecting a particular security, issuer, industry or sector or about market movements is incorrect.






	 





	




	 






	Liquidity Risk

	  Liquidity risk exists when particular investments are difficult to purchase or sell. The Funds investments in illiquid
	securities may reduce the returns of the Fund because it may be unable to sell the illiquid securities at an advantageous time or price.











	Performance





	The following bar chart and table indicate the risks of investing in the Fund by
	showing changes in the Funds performance from calendar year to calendar year and how the Funds average annual total returns compare with those of a broad measure of market performance. All returns include the reinvestment of dividends
	and distributions. As always, please note that the Funds past performance (before and after taxes) cannot predict how it will perform in the future. Updated performance information is available at no cost by visiting www.calamos.com or by

	Average Annual Total Returns as of 12.31.12





	The following table shows how the Funds average annual performance (before and after taxes) for the one-, five- and ten-year periods ended December 31, 2012 and since the Funds inception compared
	with broad measures of market performance. Since Inception returns shown for each index are returns since the inception of the Funds Class A shares, or since the nearest subsequent month end when comparative index data is
	available only for full monthly periods. The after-tax returns show the impact of assumed federal income taxes on an investment in the Fund. Return After Taxes on Distributions shows the effect of taxable distributions, but assumes that
	you still hold the Fund shares at the end of the period and so do not have any taxable gain or loss on your investment. Return After Taxes on Distributions and Sale of Fund Shares shows the effect of taxable distributions and any taxable
	gain or loss that would be realized if the Fund shares were purchased at the beginning and sold at the end of the specified period.




	The after-tax
	returns are shown only for Class A shares, are calculated using the historical highest individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on an investors
	tax situation and may differ from those shown, and the after-tax returns shown are not relevant to investors who hold their Fund shares through tax-deferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts. After-tax returns for
	classes other than Class A will vary from returns shown for Class A. Return After Taxes on Distributions and Sale of Fund Shares may be higher than other returns for the same period due to a tax benefit of realizing a capital loss upon the sale
	of Fund shares.

GENERAL AGREEMENTS



A.   ADDITIONAL OFFICES OR EMPLOYEES--CONSOLIDATION OR MERGER--NOTICE


1.   Except as provided in paragraph 2 below, this Bond shall apply to any
additional office(s) established by the Insured during the Bond Period
and to all Employees during the Bond Period, without the need to give
notice thereof or pay additional premiums to the Underwriter for the
Bond Period.


2.   If during the Bond Period an Insured Investment Company shall merge or
consolidate with an institution in which such Insured is the surviving
entity, or purchase substantially all the assets or capital stock of
another institution, or acquire or create a separate investment
portfolio, and shall within sixty (60) days notify the Underwriter
thereof, then this Bond shall automatically apply to the Property and
Employees resulting from such merger, consolidation, acquisition or
creation from





the date thereof; provided, that the Underwriter may make such
coverage contingent upon the payment of an additional premium.


B.   WARRANTY


No statement made by or on behalf of the Insured, whether contained in the
Application or otherwise, shall be deemed to be an absolute warranty, but
only a warranty that such statement is true to the best of the knowledge of
the person responsible for such statement.


C.   COURT COSTS AND ATTORNEYS' FEES


The Underwriter will indemnify the Insured against court costs and
reasonable attorneys' fees incurred and paid by the Insured in defense of
any legal proceeding brought against the Insured claiming that the Insured
is liable for any loss, claim or damage which, if established against the
Insured, would constitute a loss sustained by the Insured covered under the
terms of this Bond; provided, however, that with respect to Insuring
Agreement A this indemnity shall apply only in the event that


1.   an Employee admits to having committed or is adjudicated to have
committed a Dishonest or Fraudulent Act or Theft which caused the
loss; or


2.   in the absence of such an admission or adjudication, an arbitrator or
arbitrators acceptable to the Insured and the Underwriter concludes,
after a review of an agreed statement of facts, that an Employee has
committed a Dishonest or Fraudulent Act or Theft which caused the
loss.


The Insured shall promptly give notice to the Underwriter of any such legal
proceeding and upon request shall furnish the Underwriter with copies of
all pleadings and other papers therein. At the Underwriter's election the
Insured shall permit the Underwriter to conduct the defense of such legal
proceeding in the Insured's name, through attorneys of the Underwriter's
selection. In such event, the Insured shall give all reasonable information
and assistance which the Underwriter shall deem necessary to the proper
defense of such legal proceeding.


If the amount of the Insured's liability or alleged liability in any such
legal proceeding is greater than the amount which the Insured would be
entitled to recover under this Bond (other than pursuant to this General
Agreement C), or if a Deductible Amount is applicable, or both, the
indemnity liability of the Underwriter under this General Agreement C is
limited to the proportion of court costs and attorneys' fees incurred and
paid by the Insured or by the Underwriter that the amount which the Insured
would be entitled to recover under this Bond (other than pursuant to this
General Agreement C) bears to the sum of such amount plus the amount which
the Insured is not entitled to recover. Such indemnity shall be in addition
to the Limit of Liability for the applicable Insuring Agreement.






THIS BOND, INCLUDING THE FOREGOING INSURING AGREEMENTS

AND GENERAL AGREEMENTS, IS SUBJECT TO THE FOLLOWING

PROVISIONS, CONDITIONS AND LIMITATIONS:



SECTION 1. DEFINITIONS


The following terms used in this Bond shall have the meanings stated in this

other than the Insured, except that if the Insured includes such other loss
in the Insured's proof of loss, the Underwriter shall consider its
liability therefor. As soon as practicable and not more than sixty (60)
days after discovery of any loss covered hereunder, the Insured shall give
the Underwriter written notice thereof and, as soon as practicable and

loss occurs, when the Insured


(1)  becomes aware of facts, or


(2)  receives notice of an actual or potential claim by a third party which
alleges that the Insured is liable under circumstances,


which would cause a reasonable person to assume that loss covered by this
Bond has been or is likely to be incurred even though the exact amount or
details of loss may not be known.


SECTION 6. VALUATION OF PROPERTY


For the purpose of determining the amount of any loss hereunder, the value
of any Property shall be the market value of such Property at the close of
business on the first business day before the discovery of such loss;
except that


(1)  the value of any Property replaced by the Insured prior to the payment
of a claim therefor shall be the actual market value of such Property
at the time of replacement, but not in excess of the market value of
such Property on the first business day before the discovery of the
loss of such Property;


(2)  the value of Securities which must be produced to exercise
subscription, conversion, redemption or deposit privileges shall be
the market value of such privileges immediately preceding the
expiration thereof if the loss of such Securities is not discovered
until after such expiration, but if there is no quoted or other
ascertainable market price for such Property or privileges referred to
in clauses (1) and (2), their value shall be fixed by agreement
between the parties or by arbitration before an arbitrator or
arbitrators acceptable to the parties; and


(3)  the value of books of accounts or other records used by the Insured in
the conduct of its business shall be limited to the actual cost of

aggregate value not to exceed the applicable Limit of Liability. If the
Underwriter shall make payment to the Insured for any loss of securities,
the Insured shall assign to the Underwriter all of the Insured's right,
title and interest in and to such Securities. In lieu of such payment, the
Underwriter may, at its option, replace such lost Securities, and in such
case the Insured shall cooperate to effect such replacement. To effect the
replacement of lost Securities, the Underwriter may issue or arrange for
the issuance of a lost instrument bond. If the value of such Securities
does not exceed the applicable Deductible Amount (at the time of the
discovery of the loss), the Insured will pay the usual premium charged for
the lost instrument bond and will indemnify the issuer of such bond against
all loss and expense that it may sustain because of the issuance of such
bond.


If the value of such Securities exceeds the applicable Deductible Amount
(at the time of discovery of the loss), the Insured will pay a proportion
of the usual premium charged for the lost instrument bond, equal to the
percentage that the applicable Deductible Amount bears to the value of such
Securities upon discovery of the loss, and will indemnify the issuer of
such bond against all loss and expense that


is not recovered from the Underwriter under the terms and conditions of
this Bond, subject to the applicable Limit of Liability.


SECTION 8. SALVAGE





If any recovery is made, whether by the Insured or the Underwriter, on
account of any loss within the applicable Limit of Liability hereunder, the
Underwriter shall be entitled to the full amount of such recovery to
reimburse the Underwriter for all amounts paid hereunder with respect to
such loss. If any recovery is made, whether by the Insured or the
Underwriter, on account of any loss in excess of the applicable Limit of
Liability hereunder plus the Deductible Amount applicable to such loss from
any source other than suretyship, insurance, reinsurance, security or
indemnity taken by or for the benefit of the Underwriter, the amount of
such recovery, net of the actual costs and expenses of recovery, shall be
applied to reimburse the Insured in full for the portion of such loss in
excess of such Limit of Liability, and the remainder, if any, shall be paid
first to reimburse the Underwriter for all amounts paid hereunder with
respect to such loss and then to the Insured to the extent of the portion
of such loss within the Deductible Amount. The Insured shall execute all
documents which the Underwriter deems necessary or desirable to secure to
the Underwriter the rights provided for herein.


SECTION 9. NON-REDUCTION AND NON-ACCUMULATION OF LIABILITY AND TOTAL LIABILITY


Prior to its termination, this Bond shall continue in force up to the Limit
of Liability for each Insuring Agreement for each Single Loss,
notwithstanding any previous loss (other than such Single Loss) for which
the Underwriter may have paid or be liable to pay hereunder; PROVIDED,
however, that regardless of the number of years this Bond shall continue in
force and the number of premiums which shall be payable or paid, the
liability of the Underwriter under this Bond with respect to any Single
Loss shall be limited to the applicable Limit of Liability irrespective of
the total amount of such Single Loss and shall not be cumulative in amounts
from year to year or from period to period.


SECTION 10. MAXIMUM LIABILITY OF UNDERWRITER; OTHER BONDS OR POLICIES


The maximum liability of the Underwriter for any Single Loss covered by any
Insuring Agreement under this Bond shall be the Limit of Liability
applicable to such Insuring Agreement, subject to the applicable Deductible
Amount and the other provisions of this Bond. Recovery for any Single Loss
may not be made under more than one Insuring Agreement. If any Single Loss
covered under this Bond is recoverable or recovered in whole or in part
because of an unexpired discovery period under any other bonds or policies
issued by the Underwriter to the Insured or to any predecessor in interest
of the Insured, the maximum liability of the Underwriter shall be the
greater of either (1) the applicable Limit of Liability under this Bond, or

(2) the maximum liability of the Underwriter under such other bonds or
policies.





SECTION 11. OTHER INSURANCE


Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if any loss covered by
this Bond shall also be covered by other insurance or suretyship for the
benefit of the Insured, the Underwriter shall be liable hereunder only for
the portion of such loss in excess of the amount recoverable under such
other insurance or suretyship, but not exceeding the applicable Limit of
Liability of this Bond.


SECTION 12. DEDUCTIBLE AMOUNT


The Underwriter shall not be liable under any Insuring Agreement unless the
amount of the loss covered thereunder, after deducting the net amount of
all reimbursement and/or recovery received by the Insured with respect to
such loss (other than from any other bond, suretyship or insurance policy
or as an advance by the Underwriter hereunder) shall exceed the applicable
Deductible Amount; in such case the Underwriter shall be liable only for
such excess, subject to the applicable Limit of Liability and the other
terms of this Bond.


No Deductible Amount shall apply to any loss covered under Insuring
Agreement A sustained by any Investment Company named as an Insured.


SECTION 13. TERMINATION


The Underwriter may terminate this Bond as to any Insured or all Insureds

bankruptcy or reorganization of the Insured, or assignment for the benefit
of creditors of the Insured.


Premiums are earned until the effective date of termination. The

accordance with the Underwriter's standard short rate cancellation tables
if this Bond is terminated by the Insured or pro rata if this Bond is

Upon the detection by any Insured that an Employee has committed any
Dishonest or Fraudulent Act(s) or Theft, the Insured shall immediately
remove such Employee from a position that may enable such Employee to cause
the Insured to suffer a loss by any subsequent Dishonest or Fraudulent
Act(s) or Theft. The Insured, within two (2) business days of such
detection, shall notify the Underwriter with full and complete particulars
of the detected Dishonest or Fraudulent Act(s) or Theft.

or supervisory employee of any Insured, who is not in collusion with such
Employee, becomes aware that the Employee has committed any Dishonest or
Fraudulent Act(s) or Theft.





This Bond shall terminate as to any Employee by written notice from the
Underwriter to each Insured and, if such Employee is an Employee of an
Insured Investment Company, to the Securities and Exchange Commission, in
all cases not less than sixty (60) days prior to the effective date of
termination specified in such notice.

any Insured, such Insured may, by written notice to the Underwriter, elect
to purchase the right under this Bond to an additional period of twelve

(12) months within which to discover loss sustained by such Insured prior
to the effective date of such termination and shall pay an additional
premium therefor as the Underwriter may require.


Such additional discovery period shall terminate immediately and without
notice upon the takeover of such Insured's business by any State or Federal
official or agency, or by any receiver or liquidator. Promptly after such
termination the Underwriter shall refund to the Insured any unearned
premium.


The right to purchase such additional discovery period may not be exercised
by any State or Federal official or agency, or by any receiver or
liquidator, acting or appointed to take over the Insured's business.


SECTION 15. CENTRAL HANDLING OF SECURITIES


The Underwriter shall not be liable for loss in connection with the central
handling of securities within the systems established and maintained by any
Depository ("Systems"), unless the amount of such loss exceeds the amount
recoverable or recovered under any bond or policy or participants' fund
insuring the Depository against such loss (the "Depository's Recovery"); in
such case the Underwriter shall be liable hereunder only for the Insured's
share of such excess loss, subject to the applicable Limit of Liability,
the Deductible Amount and the other terms of this Bond.


For determining the Insured's share of such excess loss, (1) the Insured
shall be deemed to have an interest in any certificate representing any
security included within the Systems equivalent to the interest the Insured
then has in all certificates representing the same security included within
the Systems; (2) the Depository shall have reasonably and fairly
apportioned the Depository's Recovery among all those having an interest as
recorded by appropriate entries in the books and records of the Depository
in Property involved in such loss, so that each such interest shall share
in the Depository's Recovery in the ratio that the value of each such
interest bears to the total value of all such interests; and (3) the
Insured's share of such excess loss shall be the amount of the Insured's
interest in such Property in excess of the amount(s) so apportioned to the
Insured by the Depository.


This Bond does not afford coverage in favor of any Depository or Exchange
or any nominee in whose name is registered any security included within the
Systems.


SECTION 16. ADDITIONAL COMPANIES INCLUDED AS INSURED


If more than one entity is named as the Insured:


A.   the total liability of the Underwriter hereunder for each Single Loss
shall not exceed the Limit of Liability which would be applicable if
there were only one named Insured, regardless of the number of Insured
entities which sustain loss as a result of such Single Loss,


B.   the Insured first named in Item 1 of the Declarations shall be deemed
authorized to make, adjust, and settle, and receive and enforce
payment of, all claims hereunder as the agent of each other Insured
for such purposes and for the giving or receiving of any notice
required or permitted to be





given hereunder; provided, that the Underwriter shall promptly furnish
each named Insured Investment Company with (1) a copy of this Bond and
any amendments thereto, (2) a copy of each formal filing of a claim
hereunder by any other Insured, and (3) notification of the terms of
the settlement of each such claim prior to the execution of such
settlement,


C.   the Underwriter shall not be responsible or have any liability for the
proper application by the Insured first named in Item 1 of the
Declarations of any payment made hereunder to the first named Insured,


D.   for the purposes of Sections 4 and 13, knowledge possessed or
discovery made by any partner, officer or supervisory Employee of any
Insured shall constitute knowledge or discovery by every named
Insured,


E.   if the first named Insured ceases for any reason to be covered under
this Bond, then the Insured next named shall thereafter be considered
as the first named Insured for the purposes of this Bond, and


F.   each named Insured shall constitute "the Insured" for all purposes of
this Bond.


SECTION 17. NOTICE AND CHANGE OF CONTROL


Within thirty (30) days after learning that there has been a change in
control of an Insured by transfer of its outstanding voting securities the
Insured shall give written notice to the Underwriter of:


A.   the names of the transferors and transferees (or the names of the
beneficial owners if the voting securities are registered in another
name), and


B.   the total number of voting securities owned by the transferors and the
transferees (or the beneficial owners), both immediately before and
after the transfer, and


C.   the total number of outstanding voting securities.


As used in this Section, "control" means the power to exercise a
controlling influence over the management or policies of the Insured.


SECTION 18. CHANGE OR MODIFICATION


This Bond may only be modified by written Rider forming a part hereof over
the signature of the Underwriter's authorized representative. Any Rider
which modifies the coverage provided by Insuring Agreement A, Fidelity, in
a manner which adversely affects the rights of an Insured Investment
Company shall not become effective until at least sixty (60) days after the
Underwriter has given written notice thereof to the Securities and Exchange
Commission, Washington, D.C., and to each Insured Investment Company
affected thereby.


IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Underwriter has caused this Bond to be executed on the
Declarations Page.

In consideration of the premium charged for this Bond, it is hereby understood
and agreed that notwithstanding Section 2.Q of this Bond, this Bond is amended
by adding an additional Insuring Agreement J as follows:


J.   COMPUTER SECURITY


Loss (including loss of Property) resulting directly from Computer Fraud;
provided, that the Insured has adopted in writing and generally maintains and
follows during the Bond Period all Computer Security Procedures. The isolated
failure of the Insured to maintain and follow a particular Computer Security
Procedure in a particular instance will not preclude coverage under this
Insuring Agreement, subject to the specific exclusions herein and in the Bond.


1.   Definitions. The following terms used in this Insuring Agreement shall
have the following meanings:


a.   "Authorized User" means any person or entity designated by the
Insured (through contract, assignment of User Identification, or
otherwise) as authorized to use a Covered Computer System, or any
part thereof. An individual who invests in an Insured Fund shall
not be considered to be an Authorized User solely by virtue of
being an investor.


b.   "Computer Fraud" means the unauthorized entry of data into, or
the deletion or destruction of data in, or change of data
elements or programs within, a Covered Computer System which:


(1)  is committed by any Unauthorized Third Party anywhere, alone
or in collusion with other Unauthorized Third Parties; and


(2)  is committed with the conscious manifest intent (a) to cause
the Insured to sustain a loss, and (b) to obtain financial
benefit for the perpetrator or any other person; and


(3)  causes (x) Property to be transferred, paid or delivered; or

(y) an account of the Insured, or of its customer, to be
added, deleted, debited or credited; or (z) an unauthorized
or fictitious account to be debited or credited.





c.   "Computer Security Procedures" means procedures for prevention of
unauthorized computer access and use and administration of
computer access and use as provided in writing to the
Underwriter.


d.   "Covered Computer System" means any Computer System as to which
the Insured has possession, custody and control.


e.   "Unauthorized Third Party" means any person or entity that, at
the time of the Computer Fraud, is not an Authorized User.


f.   "User Identification" means any unique user name (i.e., a series
of characters) that is assigned to a person or entity by the
Insured.


2.   Exclusions. It is further understood and agreed that this Insuring
Agreement J shall not cover:


a.   Any loss covered under Insuring Agreement A, "Fidelity," of this
Bond; and


b.   Any loss resulting directly or indirectly from Theft or
misappropriation of confidential or proprietary information,
material or data (including but not limited to trade secrets,
computer programs or customer information); and


c.   Any loss resulting from the intentional failure to adhere to one
or more Computer Security Procedures; and


d.   Any loss resulting from a Computer Fraud committed by or in
collusion with:


(1)  any Authorized User (whether a natural person or an entity);
or


(2)  in the case of any Authorized User which is an entity, (a)
any director, officer, partner, employee or agent of such
Authorized User, or (b) any entity which controls, is
controlled by, or is under common control with such
Authorized User ("Related Entity"), or (c) any director,
officer, partner, employee or agent of such Related Entity;
or


(3)  in the case of any Authorized User who is a natural person,

(a) any entity for which such Authorized User is a director,
officer, partner, employee or agent ("Employer Entity"), or

(b) any director, officer, partner, employee or agent of
such Employer Entity, or (c) any entity which controls, is
controlled by, or is under common control with such Employer
Entity ("Employer-Related Entity"), or (d) any director,
officer, partner, employee or agent of such Employer-Related
Entity;


and


e.   Any loss resulting from physical damage to or destruction of any
Covered Computer System, or any part thereof, or any data, data
elements or media associated therewith; and





f.   Any loss resulting from Computer Fraud committed by means of
wireless access to any Covered Computer System, or any part
thereof, or any data, data elements or media associated
therewith; and


g.   Any loss not directly and proximately caused by Computer Fraud
(including, without limitation, disruption of business and extra
expense); and


h.   Payments made to any person(s) who has threatened to deny or has
denied authorized access to a Covered Computer System or
otherwise has threatened to disrupt the business of the Insured.


For purposes of this Insuring Agreement, "Single Loss," as defined in Section

1.X of this Bond, shall also include all loss caused by Computer Fraud(s)
committed by one person, or in which one person is implicated, whether or not
that person is specifically identified. A series of losses involving
unidentified individuals, but arising from the same method of operation, may be
deemed by the Underwriter to involve the same individual and in that event shall
be treated as a Single Loss.


It is further understood and agreed that nothing in this Rider shall affect the
exclusion set forth in Section 2.0 of this Bond.


Coverage under this Insuring Agreement shall terminate upon termination of this
Bond. Coverage under this Insuring Agreement may also be terminated without
terminating this Bond as an entirety:


(a)  by written notice from the Underwriter not less than sixty (60) days
prior to the effective date of termination specified in such notice;
or


(b)  immediately by written notice from the Insured to the Underwriter.


Except as above stated, nothing herein shall be held to alter, waive or extend
any of the terms of this Bond.

In consideration of the premium charged for this Bond, it is hereby understood
and agreed that this Bond does not cover any loss resulting from or in
connection with the acceptance of any Third Party Check, unless


(1)  such Third Party Check is used to open or increase an account which is
registered in the name of one or more of the payees on such Third
Party Check, and


(2)  reasonable efforts are made by the Insured, or by the entity receiving
Third Party Checks on behalf of the Insured, to verify all
endorsements on all Third Party Checks made payable in amounts greater
than $100,000 (provided, however, that the isolated failure to make
such efforts in a particular instance will not preclude coverage,
subject to the exclusions herein and in the Bond),


and then only to the extent such loss is otherwise covered under this Bond.


For purposes of this Rider, "Third Party Check" means a check made payable to
one or more parties and offered as payment to one or more other parties.


It is further understood and agreed that notwithstanding anything to the
contrary above or elsewhere in the Bond, this Bond does not cover any loss
resulting from or in connection with the acceptance of a Third Party Check
where:


(1)  any payee on such Third Party Check reasonably appears to be a
corporation or other entity; or


(2)  such Third Party Check is made payable in an amount greater than
$100,000 and does not include the purported endorsements of all payees
on such Third Party Check.


It is further understood and agreed that this Rider shall not apply with respect
to any coverage that may be available under Insuring Agreement A, "Fidelity."


Except as above stated, nothing herein shall be held to alter, waive or extend
any of the terms of this Bond.

In consideration for the premium charged for this Bond, it is hereby understood
and agreed that, with respect to Insuring Agreement I only, the Deductible
Amount set forth in Item 3 of the Declarations ("Phone/Electronic Deductible")
shall not apply with respect to a Single Loss, otherwise covered by Insuring
Agreement I, caused by:

check to the Shareholder of Record at the address of record; or


(2)  a Phone/Electronic Redemption requested to be paid or made payable by
wire transfer to the Shareholder of Record's bank account of record,


provided, that the Limit of Liability for a Single Loss as described in (1) or

Insured shall bear the remainder of each such Loss. This Rider shall not apply
if the application of the Phone/Electronic Deductible to the Single Loss would
result in coverage of greater than $40,000 or more; in such case the
Phone-initiated Deductible and Limit of Liability set forth in Item 3 of the
Declarations shall control.


For purposes of this Rider, "Phone/Electronic Redemption" means any redemption
of shares issued by an Investment Company, which redemption is requested (a) by

Most property and casualty insurers, including ICI Mutual Insurance Company
("ICI Mutual"), are subject to the requirements of the Terrorism Risk Insurance
Act of 2002 (the "Act"). The Act establishes a Federal insurance backstop under
which ICI Mutual and these other insurers will be partially reimbursed for
future "INSURED LOSSES" resulting from certified "ACTS OF TERRORISM." (Each of
these BOLDED TERMS is defined by the Act.) The Act also places certain
disclosure and other obligations on ICI Mutual and these other insurers.


Pursuant to the Act, any future losses to ICI Mutual caused by certified "ACTS
OF TERRORISM" will be partially reimbursed by the United States government under
a formula established by the Act. Under this formula, the United States
government will reimburse ICI Mutual for 90% of ICI Mutual's "INSURED LOSSES" in
excess of a statutorily established deductible until total insured losses of all
participating insurers reach $100 billion. If total "insured losses" of all
property and casualty insurers reach $100 billion during any applicable period,
the Act provides that the insurers will not be liable under their policies for
their portions of such losses that exceed such amount. Amounts otherwise payable
under this bond may be reduced as a result.


This bond has no express exclusion for "ACTS OF TERRORISM." However, coverage
under this bond remains subject to all applicable terms, conditions and
limitations of the bond (including exclusions) that are permissible under the
Act. The portion of the premium that is attributable to any coverage potentially
available under the bond for "ACTS OF TERRORISM" is one percent (1%).

I, James S. Hamman, Jr., Secretary of Calamos Open-End Funds and Calamos
Closed-End Funds set forth in Annex A attached hereto (collectively, the
"Trusts"), having its principal offices and place of business in Naperville,
Illinois, hereby certify that the foregoing is a true and correct copy of the
resolutions adopted at the Board of Trustees meeting of the Trusts held on May

WHEREAS, the Trust is insured under an investment company blanket bond
of ICI Mutual Insurance Company (the "Bond") insuring the Trust and the
other Trusts in the Calamos complex (collectively, the "Trusts") against
loss in the cumulative aggregate amount of $9,000,000;


WHEREAS, it is proposed to increase the cumulative coverage amount to
$10,875,000;


WHEREAS, the Trust's board of trustees has considered the adequacy of
the Bond with due consideration to (1) the amount and type of coverage
provided by the Bond, (2) the value of the assets of each Trust to which
any person covered by the Bond might have access, (3) the type and terms of
the arrangements made by each Trust for the custody and safekeeping of the
assets of each of the Trusts, (4) the nature of the securities in each
Trust's portfolio, (5) the nature and method of conducting the operations
of each of the Trusts and (6) the accounting procedures and controls of
each of the Trusts;


WHEREAS, the Trust's board of trustees has considered the portion of
the premium on the Bond to be paid by the Trust with due consideration to:

(1) the number of other parties named as insureds; (2) the nature of the
business activities of such other parties named as insureds; (3) the amount
of the Bond; (4) the amount of the premium for such Bond; (5) the ratable
allocation of the premium among all parties named as insureds; (6) the
extent to which the share of the premium allocated to each of the Trusts is
less than the premium such Trust would have had to pay if it had provided
and maintained a single insured bond;


WHEREAS, the Trust's board of trustees has considered the fairness and
reasonableness of the allocations of premium for and proceeds of recovery
under the Bond in the proposed Fidelity Bond Insurance Allocation Agreement
(the "Fidelity Bond Allocation Agreement") in the form presented to this
meeting are equitable to the Trust; and





WHEREAS, the Trust's board of trustees is being asked to amend the
Liability Insurance Allocation Agreement (together with the Fidelity Bond
Allocation Agreement, the "Allocation Agreements") to add Calamos Global

as may be necessary for coverage to meet the minimum coverage amount

amended (the "Investment Company Act"), is determined to be a reasonable
amount of fidelity bond coverage to be maintained by the Trusts in
accordance the Investment Company Act.


FURTHER RESOLVED, that the form of the Bond is approved.


FURTHER RESOLVED, that the proposed premium for the Bond, based on
each of the Trusts' proportionate share of the premiums that would have
been paid if the coverage of the Bond were purchased separately by the
Trusts, is fair and reasonable to the Trust and is approved.


FURTHER RESOLVED, that, in the judgment of the trustees, the
allocation of the premium for and proceeds of recovery under the Bond in
the Fidelity Bond Insurance Allocation Agreement is equitable to the Trust
and is approved.


FURTHER RESOLVED, that the proposed Allocation Agreements, in the
forms presented to this meeting, are approved; any officer of the Trust is

the Trust, such approval to be evidenced by the officer's execution
thereof; and the Secretary shall file with the Trust's records copies of
the forms of Allocation Agreements presented to this meeting.


FURTHER RESOLVED, that the secretary of the Trust is designated as the
person to make the filings and to give the notices required by Rule
17g-1(g) under the Investment Company Act.

Exhibit 99.4




FIDELITY BOND INSURANCE ALLOCATION AGREEMENT



This Agreement is dated as of June 1, 2007 and is entered into by and
among:


Calamos Advisors Trust
Calamos Convertible and High Income Fund
Calamos Convertible Opportunities and Income Fund
Calamos Global Total Return Fund
Calamos Investment Trust
Calamos Strategic Total Return Fund
Calamos Global Dynamic Income Fund
Calamos Advisors LLC ("Calamos Advisors")
Calamos Asset Management, Inc.
Calamos Family Partners, Inc.
Calamos Financial Services LLC
Calamos Holdings LLC
Calamos Partners LLC
Calamos Profit Sharing 401(k) Plan
Calamos Wealth Management LLC


(each of such parties being referred to individually as a "PARTY" and
collectively as the "PARTIES").


In order to obtain joint-insureds fidelity bond insurance under an
insurance policy (the "POLICY") on favorable terms, and in consideration of the
mutual agreements set forth below, the Parties agree as follows:


1. THE POLICY. The Parties agree to secure and maintain a Policy, which
will insure each Party and, if such Party is an investment company (an
"investment company") registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended (the "Investment Company Act"), its respective portfolios.


2. PRIMARY COVERAGE. Each Party shall have "Primary Coverage" (i.e. minimum
insured coverage) under the Policy, under which they are insured, as set forth
in the Schedule to this Agreement, which Schedule may be amended from time to
time by the Parties. Each Party who is an investment company shall have Primary
Coverage in an amount at least equal to the amount required by applicable laws
and regulations. This Agreement applies to the initial Policy and any future
insurance policy insuring the same Insureds, all as modified from time to time.
Each Party shall promptly take action to increase its Primary Coverage amount,
which shall therefore increase the total amount (i.e. limit of liability) of the
Policy, whenever required to comply with applicable federal statutes and
regulations, including but not limited to Rule 17g-1 under the Investment
Company Act.


3. DEFINITIONS. As used in this Agreement, the following terms have the
following meanings:


(a) "AGENT" means Calamos Advisors or its successor, acting as agent
for the Parties.





(b) "COMMISSION" means the Securities and Exchange Commission.


(c) "INSURED" means, a Party and, for investment companies, any
portfolio of any Party and "Insureds" means all Parties and all portfolios
of the Parties.


(d) "INSURED LOSS" means a loss (including all related expenses) of an
Insured that is covered under the Policy (including any endorsement
thereof) or that would be so covered but for the exhaustion of the
applicable limit of liability and any applicable deductible.


(e) "POLICY PERIOD" means the period from the initial effective date
of the Policy through the next succeeding anniversary date or the period
from any anniversary date subsequent to the initial effective date through
the next succeeding anniversary date (or any modification of such period as
may be agreed to by the Parties and the insurer).


4. ALLOCATION OF PREMIUMS. Each Party shall pay that portion of the Policy
premium for any Policy Period equal to (i) the underwriter's estimate of
relative cost to that Insured of a single-insured policy providing coverage
similar to such policy but in an amount equal to the Primary Coverage allocated
to that Insured under this Agreement, as such amount may be amended from time to
time, in relation to (ii) the aggregate of the cost to all Insureds of such
single-insured policies.


5. ALLOCATION OF COVERAGES. The Policy is a "claims made" policy. Proceeds
paid under the Policy shall be allocated among the Insureds as follows.


(a) COVERAGE SUFFICIENT FOR ALL INSURED LOSSES. If the aggregate
Insured Losses of all Insureds relating to claims with respect to a
particular Policy Period are covered by proceeds of the Policy for that
Policy Period, such proceeds shall be allocated among the Insureds
according to their respective Insured Losses.


(b) ALLOCATION OF INSUFFICIENT COVERAGE. If the aggregate Insured
Losses of all Insureds relating to claims with respect to a particular
Policy Period exceed the aggregate proceeds of the Policy for Insured
Losses for that Policy Period, such proceeds shall be first allocated among
the Insureds who sustained such losses in proportion to their respective
Primary Coverages; and if, after such initial allocation, there are
remaining proceeds for Insured Losses relating to that Policy Period, such
remaining proceeds shall be further allocated among such Insureds whose
Insured Losses have not yet been paid in proportion to such respective
Primary Coverages of those Insureds (repeating this further allocation
procedure until all of such proceeds have been allocated).


(c) REALLOCATION. If all Insured Losses relating to a Policy Period
under the Policy are not paid at the same time, the Insureds who claim such
Insured Losses for that Policy Period shall make such provisions as they
deem suitable to the particular circumstances (taking into account the size
of any payments received, the size, nature and expected result of any
remaining claims, and all other relevant factors) to permit a later
reallocation of amounts first paid in accordance with this section 5.





6. NOTICES. Each Insured agrees promptly to give to the Insurer all notices
required under the Policy.


7. AGENT. The Agent is hereby appointed as the agent for the Insureds for
the purposes of seeking, negotiating and obtaining the Policy and of making,
adjusting, receiving and enforcing payment of all claims under the Policy and
otherwise dealing with the insurer with respect to the Policy. All expenses
incurred by the Agent in its capacity as agent for claims shall be shared by the
Parties and their respective Insureds on whose behalf the expenses were incurred
in proportion to their Insured Losses.


8. NOTIFICATION OF AGENT. Each Party shall promptly notify the Agent in
writing of any circumstance that may give rise to a claim by such Party or its
Insureds under the Policy.


9. FILING WITH THE COMMISSION. Each Party, as required by Rule 17g-1 under

Section 17(g) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, shall file a copy of this
Agreement and any amendment hereto with the Commission.


10. MODIFICATION AND TERMINATION. This Agreement may be modified or amended
from time to time by mutual written agreement among the Parties. It shall
terminate with respect to any Insured as of the date such Insured ceases to be
an insured under the Policy; provided that such termination shall not affect
that Insured's rights and obligations hereunder with respect to any claims or
Insured Losses relating to a period when that Insured was insured under the
Policy. This Agreement may be terminated by either Party by written notice to
the other Party given not less than 60 days prior to the date specified for
termination.


11. PRIOR AGREEMENTS. This Agreement shall supersede any prior agreement
among the Parties relating to the allocation of premiums and coverage under any
joint-insured policy bond providing fidelity coverage, and any such agreement is
hereby terminated.


12. FURTHER ASSURANCES. Each Party agrees to perform such further acts and

Investment Management
Insights, Strategies and Solutions
Our experienced professionals have expertise in a broad spectrum of traditional, alternative and non-financial assets.  We can work with you to develop and manage a portfolio tailored to your needs.






Portfolio Consulting
A collaborative dialogue with your portfolio manager
Your portfolio manager is a key member of your U.S. Trust relationship team and serves as your personal "chief investment officer." He or she will work with you to create an Investment Policy Statement, which serves as a blueprint for your portfolio by documenting your:

Objectives
Risk tolerance
Cash flow needs
 Tax situation
Wealth aspirations

Your portfolio manager's ongoing role is to incorporate our best strategic and tactical thinking, most relevant research analysis, current market insights and appropriate investment solutions into your portfolio. He or she will regularly monitor your portfolio to make sure it conforms to your Investment Policy Statement, which will be updated whenever there are significant changes in your life or goals.
Asset management
A more complete approach to asset allocation1
We analyze a wide range of asset classes, including hedge and private equity funds2 and global investment opportunities, as potential components of an asset allocation. In addition, we believe that true diversification requires managing for cash flows across and within asset classes in various market environments — not simply allocating according to a grid.
Your asset allocation will be based on the long-term expectations established for each asset class by our most senior investment professionals. Over the shorter term, however, your portfolio manager can adjust your portfolio tactically in response to emerging opportunities and risks, and reflecting U.S. Trust insights about trends and themes relevant to you.
How you own your assets — personally or in trusts; in taxable or tax-exempt solutions — can have a material impact on the overall performance of your portfolio. At U.S. Trust we focus on this wealth structuring aspect of your portfolio in conjunction with managing the assets themselves.
Alternative Investments
SOPHISTICATED SOLUTIONS TO MEET YOUR NEEDS2
Alternative investments at U.S. Trust focus on non-traditional assets such as:

Hedge funds
Private equity
Real estate and tangible assets

Because performance is often differentiated from equity and fixed income markets, alternative investments may be an ideal complement to traditional investments. 
Through our access to the industry's premier managers, we are able to offer solutions that provide options for all client segments. And we support you every step of the way with knowledge built on our experience in alternatives, including industry-leading research, rigorous due diligence, and cutting-edge portfolio construction.
Drawing from the experience, resources and expertise of the firm, you and your portfolio manager can explore alternative investments that can help you pursue what matters most to you.
Specialty asset management
Expertise in nonfinancial assets3
Specialty asset management at U.S. Trust focuses on nonfinancial assets such as:

Farm and ranch land
Timberland
Oil and gas properties
Private businesses
Real estate

Our Specialty Asset Management team can work with your portfolio manager and wealth strategist, as appropriate, to integrate these real assets into your overall plan and portfolio.
We can help you realize your objectives with assets you already own, or help you acquire specific assets to take advantage of their capital growth and diversification potential — whether you own these assets outright or they are held in trust.
Our team of specialists can provide complete turnkey services including identifying and purchasing real property and providing ongoing management.
Capital markets
Sophisticated market-linked solutions4
Through our access to the resources of Merrill Lynch, one of the world's leading capital markets participants, we can tailor approaches to risks and opportunities in the foreign exchange, interest rate, commodity and equity markets. Derivative-based transactions target the risks you seek to hedge, and are designed to dovetail with your overall portfolio and wealth management strategies.

1 Asset allocation and diversification do not ensure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.
2 Alternative Investments such as derivatives, hedge funds, private equity funds, and funds of funds can result in higher return potential but also higher loss potential. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely affect your investments. Before you invest in alternative investments, you should consider your overall financial situation, how much money you have to invest, your need for liquidity, and your tolerance for risk. Alternative investments are speculative and involve a high degree of risk.
3 Nonfinancial assets, such as closely-held businesses, real estate, oil, gas and mineral properties, and timber, farm and ranch land, are complex in nature and involve risks including total loss of value.  Special risk considerations include natural events (for example, earthquakes or fires), complex tax considerations, and lack of liquidity.  Nonfinancial assets are not suitable for all investors.  Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager, and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax, or estate planning strategy.
4 Brokerage services are provided by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, a registered broker-dealer, Member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation.
Certain U.S. Trust associates are registered representatives with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated ("MLPF&S") and may assist you with investment products and services provided through MLPF&S and other nonbank investment affiliates. MLPF&S is a registered broker-dealer, member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation ("BofA Corp."). U.S. Trust operates through Bank of America, N.A., and other subsidiaries of BofA Corp.

Wealth Structuring
Preservation and Transfer
Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.






Wealth Planning
Integrating your personal and financial affairs
By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.

U.S. Trust is the custodian of choice for many sophisticated investors with extensive and complex holdings. Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.

Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax or estate planning strategy.
