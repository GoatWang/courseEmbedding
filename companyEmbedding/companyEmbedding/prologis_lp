Prologis LP Key Developments

Prologis, Inc. and Prologis, L.P. Enter into Amended and Restated Senior Term Loan Agreement
May 8 17
On May 4, 2017, Prologis, Inc., Prologis, L.P. (the Operating Partnership") and various affiliates of the Operating Partnership entered into an Amended and Restated Senior Term Loan Agreement (the Loan Agreement") with various lenders and Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent. Pursuant to the Loan Agreement, the Operating Partnership and various affiliates thereof (collectively the Borrowers) may obtain loans in various currencies in an aggregate amount not to exceed $500,000,000 (subject to increase to up to $1,000,000,000 pursuant to the accordion feature included in the Loan Agreement). The Loan Agreement amends and restates the existing Senior Term Loan dated June 19, 2014, as amended by the First Amendment dated January 22, 2015 and permits the Borrowers to re-borrow, within a specified period of time, any amounts prepaid thereunder. The Loan Agreement is scheduled to mature on May 4, 2020, but the Operating Partnership may, at its option and subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions and payment of an extension fee, extend the maturity date of the Loan Agreement two times, in each case for a period of up to one year. Pricing under the Loan Agreement, including the spread over LIBOR, varies based upon the public debt ratings of the Operating Partnership as in effect from time to time. The Loan Agreement contains representations, covenants (including certain financial tests applicable to Prologis) and defaults (including a cross-acceleration to other recourse indebtedness of more than $100,000,000) that are substantially the same as the corresponding provisions of the other major unsecured credit facilities of Prologis and the Operating Partnership. Prologis has unconditionally guaranteed all obligations of each borrower under the Loan Agreement, and the Operating Partnership has unconditionally guaranteed all obligations of each other borrower under the Loan Agreement.


Prologis, Inc. and Prologis, L.P. Enter into an Amended and Restated Global Senior Credit Agreement
Apr 18 16
On April 14, 2016, Prologis, Inc., Prologis, L.P. and various affiliates of the Operating Partnership entered into an Amended and Restated Global Senior Credit Agreement with various lenders and Bank of America, N.A., as Global Administrative Agent. Pursuant to the Global Facility, the Operating Partnership and various affiliates thereof may obtain loans and/or procure the issuance of letters of credit in various currencies on a revolving basis in an aggregate amount not exceeding the U.S. Dollar equivalent (as of March 31, 2016) of $3,000,000,000 (subject to increase to not more than the U.S. Dollar equivalent of $3,750,000,000 (determined as of the effective date of such increase) pursuant to the accordion feature included in the Global Facility). As of the closing date, the Global Facility has three tranches: (i) a U.S. Dollar Tranche in the amount of $1,750,000,000, (ii) a Euro Tranche in the amount of €746,895,000, and (iii) a Yen Tranche in the amount of ¥45,032,000,001. The Global Facility is scheduled to mature on April 14, 2020, but the Operating Partnership may, at its option and subject to payment of an extension fee, extend the maturity date of the Global Facility for six months on two occasions (to October 14, 2020 and April 14, 2021, respectively). Pricing under the Global Facility, including the spread over the applicable LIBOR and the rates applicable to facility fees and letter of credit fees, varies based upon the public debt ratings of the Operating Partnership as in effect from time to time. As of the closing date, the spread was 90 basis points. The Global Facility contains customary representations, covenants (including certain financial tests applicable to Prologis) and defaults (including a cross-acceleration to other recourse indebtedness of more than $100,000,000).

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
