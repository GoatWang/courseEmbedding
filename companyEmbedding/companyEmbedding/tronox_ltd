Tronox Corporation logo


Tronox Limited (NYSE: TROX) is an American worldwide chemical company involved in the titanium products industry with approximately 3,500 employees. Following its acquisition of the mineral sands business formerly belonging to South Africa’s Exxaro Resources, Tronox is the largest fully integrated seller and marketer of titanium dioxide (TiO2) pigment, which provides brightness to applications such as coatings, plastics and paper. Tronox also sells titanium ore – the main feedstock of titanium dioxide - and zircon directly to customers.
Tronox is the third-largest titanium feedstock producer, with approximately 10% of global titanium ore production; and the second-largest producer of zircon, with approximately 20% of global production. The company also has an electrolytic and speciality chemicals business that services the paper and battery industries. Formerly a part of the Kerr-McGee Chemical Corporation and based in Oklahoma City since it was spun off from its parent in 2005, the company announced in June 2012 that it was moving its headquarters to Stamford, Connecticut.[1][2][3]
The company was spun off in part to offload its parent company Kerr-McGee's legacy of generations of environmental dumping of toxic waste across 22 states. According to one report, "Kerr-McGee, rather than pay for the environmental mess it created, decided to shift the liabilities between 2002 and 2006 into Tronox. Kerr-McGee, meanwhile, kept its valuable oil and gas assets."[4] Tronox did not reveal the massive hidden liabilities to investors, and after they became known, Tronox dropped to a penny stock in 2009. In response, shareholders sued Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (successor to Kerr-McGee) for keeping the scope of the environmental disaster a secret. In addition the US Federal Government sued Anadarko to pay for the cleanup, and in April 2014 settled on the largest environmental contamination settlement in American history, over $5 billion.[4]

History[edit]
The company went public in 2005, when Oklahoma City-based Kerr-McGee, which had previously owned the company entirely, issued shares via an IPO on November 21, 2005. It became an independent company in March 2006.[5][6]
In the first quarter of 2006, Tronox replaced Meade Instruments on the S&P SmallCap 600 index, when Kerr-McGee distributed the rest of its stock in Tronox under its former NYSE symbol TRX.B, a class B security. TRX.B started regular-way trading on March 31, 2006.
In 2008, the company's stock price declined significantly, and both classes of stock became penny stocks.
In September 2008, the company's stock moved from the NYSE to OTC.
On 14 January 2009, Tronox filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy. [7]It specified that this action did not include the company's non-USA operations.[8]
In 2009, shareholders of Tronox sued Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (successor to Kerr-McGee) for having misled investors about the large environmental and other debts Tronox would inherit from its parent corporation.[9][10][11][12] The environmental pollution included polluting Lake Mead in Nevada with rocket fuel, leaving behind radioactive waste piles throughout the territory of the Navajo Nation and dumping carcinogenic creosote in communities throughout the East, Midwest and South at its wood-treating facilities.[4]
In 2009, the Huntsman Corporation announced it would buy certain of Tronox's assets, such as its factories. In late 2009, Tronox terminated this deal.[13][14]
Tronox emerged from Chapter 11 Bankruptcy on February 14, 2011.
Tom Casey became CEO in October 2011.[15]
On June 15, 2012, Tronox announced that it had completed the acquisition of Exxaro Mineral Sands and combined both entities under Tronox Limited, an Australian holding company. Describing the benefits of the combination, Tronox Limited CEO Tom Casey said, "We now have the ability to sell into a lucrative titanium feedstock market while assuring our titanium dioxide customers that we have the supply to deliver quality products at reasonable prices.”[16]
In April 2014, the federal government reached a $5 billion settlement with Anadarko (successor to Kerr-McGee) in the largest environmental contamination case in American history.[4] According to one report, "Kerr-McGee, rather than pay for the environmental mess it created, decided to shift the liabilities between 2002 and 2006 into Tronox. Kerr-McGee, meanwhile, kept its valuable oil and gas assets." The cost to clean up the mess inherited by Tronox from Kerr-McGee was estimated by the courts to be over $5 billion.[4] There are contaminated sites in 22 states and the Navajo Nation. "Among the dozens of locations targeted for cleanup under the settlement is a former chemical manufacturing site in Nevada that has led to contamination in Lake Mead, abandoned uranium mines in and around the Navajo Nation, and a Superfund site in Gloucester, N.J., polluted by thorium."[4]

Kerr-McGee spin-off[edit]
Kerr-McGee spun off its chemical business circa 2005-6 after demands were made by corporate raider and major Kerr-McGee shareholder Carl Icahn.[17]
Among other things, Tronox inherited several radioactive waste sites from Kerr-McGee. These include the Cimarron Fuel Fabrication Site and the Rare Earths Facility. They are, as of 2014, still undergoing cleanup.[18][19]
It also inherited the Henderson, Nevada "BMI" site. This site had supplied Magnesium and other chemicals beginning around World War II. It eventually leaked perchlorate (used in rocket fuel) into the water table, which subsequently contaminated Lake Mead and the Colorado River, which supply water to millions of people.[20][21]
Exiting bankruptcy in February 2011, Tronox's Chapter 11 plan created the Anadarko litigation trust to pursue Tronox's lawsuit against Anadarko and Kerr-McGee. Tronox has transferred an 88% share of its interest in the lawsuit to the federal government.[22]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

Tronox

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Tronox Corporation logo


Tronox Limited (NYSE: TROX) is an American worldwide chemical company involved in the titanium products industry with approximately 3,500 employees. Following its acquisition of the mineral sands business formerly belonging to South Africa’s Exxaro Resources, Tronox is the largest fully integrated seller and marketer of titanium dioxide (TiO2) pigment, which provides brightness to applications such as coatings, plastics and paper. Tronox also sells titanium ore – the main feedstock of titanium dioxide - and zircon directly to customers.
Tronox is the third-largest titanium feedstock producer, with approximately 10% of global titanium ore production; and the second-largest producer of zircon, with approximately 20% of global production. The company also has an electrolytic and speciality chemicals business that services the paper and battery industries. Formerly a part of the Kerr-McGee Chemical Corporation and based in Oklahoma City since it was spun off from its parent in 2005, the company announced in June 2012 that it was moving its headquarters to Stamford, Connecticut.[1][2][3]
The company was spun off in part to offload its parent company Kerr-McGee's legacy of generations of environmental dumping of toxic waste across 22 states. According to one report, "Kerr-McGee, rather than pay for the environmental mess it created, decided to shift the liabilities between 2002 and 2006 into Tronox. Kerr-McGee, meanwhile, kept its valuable oil and gas assets."[4] Tronox did not reveal the massive hidden liabilities to investors, and after they became known, Tronox dropped to a penny stock in 2009. In response, shareholders sued Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (successor to Kerr-McGee) for keeping the scope of the environmental disaster a secret. In addition the US Federal Government sued Anadarko to pay for the cleanup, and in April 2014 settled on the largest environmental contamination settlement in American history, over $5 billion.[4]

History[edit]
The company went public in 2005, when Oklahoma City-based Kerr-McGee, which had previously owned the company entirely, issued shares via an IPO on November 21, 2005. It became an independent company in March 2006.[5][6]
In the first quarter of 2006, Tronox replaced Meade Instruments on the S&P SmallCap 600 index, when Kerr-McGee distributed the rest of its stock in Tronox under its former NYSE symbol TRX.B, a class B security. TRX.B started regular-way trading on March 31, 2006.
In 2008, the company's stock price declined significantly, and both classes of stock became penny stocks.
In September 2008, the company's stock moved from the NYSE to OTC.
On 14 January 2009, Tronox filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy. [7]It specified that this action did not include the company's non-USA operations.[8]
In 2009, shareholders of Tronox sued Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (successor to Kerr-McGee) for having misled investors about the large environmental and other debts Tronox would inherit from its parent corporation.[9][10][11][12] The environmental pollution included polluting Lake Mead in Nevada with rocket fuel, leaving behind radioactive waste piles throughout the territory of the Navajo Nation and dumping carcinogenic creosote in communities throughout the East, Midwest and South at its wood-treating facilities.[4]
In 2009, the Huntsman Corporation announced it would buy certain of Tronox's assets, such as its factories. In late 2009, Tronox terminated this deal.[13][14]
Tronox emerged from Chapter 11 Bankruptcy on February 14, 2011.
Tom Casey became CEO in October 2011.[15]
On June 15, 2012, Tronox announced that it had completed the acquisition of Exxaro Mineral Sands and combined both entities under Tronox Limited, an Australian holding company. Describing the benefits of the combination, Tronox Limited CEO Tom Casey said, "We now have the ability to sell into a lucrative titanium feedstock market while assuring our titanium dioxide customers that we have the supply to deliver quality products at reasonable prices.”[16]
In April 2014, the federal government reached a $5 billion settlement with Anadarko (successor to Kerr-McGee) in the largest environmental contamination case in American history.[4] According to one report, "Kerr-McGee, rather than pay for the environmental mess it created, decided to shift the liabilities between 2002 and 2006 into Tronox. Kerr-McGee, meanwhile, kept its valuable oil and gas assets." The cost to clean up the mess inherited by Tronox from Kerr-McGee was estimated by the courts to be over $5 billion.[4] There are contaminated sites in 22 states and the Navajo Nation. "Among the dozens of locations targeted for cleanup under the settlement is a former chemical manufacturing site in Nevada that has led to contamination in Lake Mead, abandoned uranium mines in and around the Navajo Nation, and a Superfund site in Gloucester, N.J., polluted by thorium."[4]

Kerr-McGee spin-off[edit]
Kerr-McGee spun off its chemical business circa 2005-6 after demands were made by corporate raider and major Kerr-McGee shareholder Carl Icahn.[17]
Among other things, Tronox inherited several radioactive waste sites from Kerr-McGee. These include the Cimarron Fuel Fabrication Site and the Rare Earths Facility. They are, as of 2014, still undergoing cleanup.[18][19]
It also inherited the Henderson, Nevada "BMI" site. This site had supplied Magnesium and other chemicals beginning around World War II. It eventually leaked perchlorate (used in rocket fuel) into the water table, which subsequently contaminated Lake Mead and the Colorado River, which supply water to millions of people.[20][21]
Exiting bankruptcy in February 2011, Tronox's Chapter 11 plan created the Anadarko litigation trust to pursue Tronox's lawsuit against Anadarko and Kerr-McGee. Tronox has transferred an 88% share of its interest in the lawsuit to the federal government.[22]

In April 2014, the federal government reached a $5 billion settlement with Anadarko (successor to Kerr-McGee) in the largest environmental contamination case in American history.[4] According to one report, "Kerr-McGee, rather than pay for the environmental mess it created, decided to shift the liabilities between 2002 and 2006 into Tronox. Kerr-McGee, meanwhile, kept its valuable oil and gas assets." The cost to clean up the mess inherited by Tronox from Kerr-McGee was estimated by the courts to be over $5 billion.[4] There are contaminated sites in 22 states and the Navajo Nation. "Among the dozens of locations targeted for cleanup under the settlement is a former chemical manufacturing site in Nevada that has led to contamination in Lake Mead, abandoned uranium mines in and around the Navajo Nation, and a Superfund site in Gloucester, N.J., polluted by thorium."[4]

Kerr-McGee spin-off[edit]
Kerr-McGee spun off its chemical business circa 2005-6 after demands were made by corporate raider and major Kerr-McGee shareholder Carl Icahn.[17]
Among other things, Tronox inherited several radioactive waste sites from Kerr-McGee. These include the Cimarron Fuel Fabrication Site and the Rare Earths Facility. They are, as of 2014, still undergoing cleanup.[18][19]
It also inherited the Henderson, Nevada "BMI" site. This site had supplied Magnesium and other chemicals beginning around World War II. It eventually leaked perchlorate (used in rocket fuel) into the water table, which subsequently contaminated Lake Mead and the Colorado River, which supply water to millions of people.[20][21]
Exiting bankruptcy in February 2011, Tronox's Chapter 11 plan created the Anadarko litigation trust to pursue Tronox's lawsuit against Anadarko and Kerr-McGee. Tronox has transferred an 88% share of its interest in the lawsuit to the federal government.[22]

Tronox

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Tronox Corporation logo


Tronox Limited (NYSE: TROX) is an American worldwide chemical company involved in the titanium products industry with approximately 3,500 employees. Following its acquisition of the mineral sands business formerly belonging to South Africa’s Exxaro Resources, Tronox is the largest fully integrated seller and marketer of titanium dioxide (TiO2) pigment, which provides brightness to applications such as coatings, plastics and paper. Tronox also sells titanium ore – the main feedstock of titanium dioxide - and zircon directly to customers.
Tronox is the third-largest titanium feedstock producer, with approximately 10% of global titanium ore production; and the second-largest producer of zircon, with approximately 20% of global production. The company also has an electrolytic and speciality chemicals business that services the paper and battery industries. Formerly a part of the Kerr-McGee Chemical Corporation and based in Oklahoma City since it was spun off from its parent in 2005, the company announced in June 2012 that it was moving its headquarters to Stamford, Connecticut.[1][2][3]
The company was spun off in part to offload its parent company Kerr-McGee's legacy of generations of environmental dumping of toxic waste across 22 states. According to one report, "Kerr-McGee, rather than pay for the environmental mess it created, decided to shift the liabilities between 2002 and 2006 into Tronox. Kerr-McGee, meanwhile, kept its valuable oil and gas assets."[4] Tronox did not reveal the massive hidden liabilities to investors, and after they became known, Tronox dropped to a penny stock in 2009. In response, shareholders sued Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (successor to Kerr-McGee) for keeping the scope of the environmental disaster a secret. In addition the US Federal Government sued Anadarko to pay for the cleanup, and in April 2014 settled on the largest environmental contamination settlement in American history, over $5 billion.[4]

History[edit]
The company went public in 2005, when Oklahoma City-based Kerr-McGee, which had previously owned the company entirely, issued shares via an IPO on November 21, 2005. It became an independent company in March 2006.[5][6]
In the first quarter of 2006, Tronox replaced Meade Instruments on the S&P SmallCap 600 index, when Kerr-McGee distributed the rest of its stock in Tronox under its former NYSE symbol TRX.B, a class B security. TRX.B started regular-way trading on March 31, 2006.
In 2008, the company's stock price declined significantly, and both classes of stock became penny stocks.
In September 2008, the company's stock moved from the NYSE to OTC.
On 14 January 2009, Tronox filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy. [7]It specified that this action did not include the company's non-USA operations.[8]
In 2009, shareholders of Tronox sued Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (successor to Kerr-McGee) for having misled investors about the large environmental and other debts Tronox would inherit from its parent corporation.[9][10][11][12] The environmental pollution included polluting Lake Mead in Nevada with rocket fuel, leaving behind radioactive waste piles throughout the territory of the Navajo Nation and dumping carcinogenic creosote in communities throughout the East, Midwest and South at its wood-treating facilities.[4]
In 2009, the Huntsman Corporation announced it would buy certain of Tronox's assets, such as its factories. In late 2009, Tronox terminated this deal.[13][14]
Tronox emerged from Chapter 11 Bankruptcy on February 14, 2011.
Tom Casey became CEO in October 2011.[15]
On June 15, 2012, Tronox announced that it had completed the acquisition of Exxaro Mineral Sands and combined both entities under Tronox Limited, an Australian holding company. Describing the benefits of the combination, Tronox Limited CEO Tom Casey said, "We now have the ability to sell into a lucrative titanium feedstock market while assuring our titanium dioxide customers that we have the supply to deliver quality products at reasonable prices.”[16]
In April 2014, the federal government reached a $5 billion settlement with Anadarko (successor to Kerr-McGee) in the largest environmental contamination case in American history.[4] According to one report, "Kerr-McGee, rather than pay for the environmental mess it created, decided to shift the liabilities between 2002 and 2006 into Tronox. Kerr-McGee, meanwhile, kept its valuable oil and gas assets." The cost to clean up the mess inherited by Tronox from Kerr-McGee was estimated by the courts to be over $5 billion.[4] There are contaminated sites in 22 states and the Navajo Nation. "Among the dozens of locations targeted for cleanup under the settlement is a former chemical manufacturing site in Nevada that has led to contamination in Lake Mead, abandoned uranium mines in and around the Navajo Nation, and a Superfund site in Gloucester, N.J., polluted by thorium."[4]

Kerr-McGee spin-off[edit]
Kerr-McGee spun off its chemical business circa 2005-6 after demands were made by corporate raider and major Kerr-McGee shareholder Carl Icahn.[17]
Among other things, Tronox inherited several radioactive waste sites from Kerr-McGee. These include the Cimarron Fuel Fabrication Site and the Rare Earths Facility. They are, as of 2014, still undergoing cleanup.[18][19]
It also inherited the Henderson, Nevada "BMI" site. This site had supplied Magnesium and other chemicals beginning around World War II. It eventually leaked perchlorate (used in rocket fuel) into the water table, which subsequently contaminated Lake Mead and the Colorado River, which supply water to millions of people.[20][21]
Exiting bankruptcy in February 2011, Tronox's Chapter 11 plan created the Anadarko litigation trust to pursue Tronox's lawsuit against Anadarko and Kerr-McGee. Tronox has transferred an 88% share of its interest in the lawsuit to the federal government.[22]

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search





Tronox Corporation logo


Tronox Limited (NYSE: TROX) is an American worldwide chemical company involved in the titanium products industry with approximately 3,500 employees. Following its acquisition of the mineral sands business formerly belonging to South Africa’s Exxaro Resources, Tronox is the largest fully integrated seller and marketer of titanium dioxide (TiO2) pigment, which provides brightness to applications such as coatings, plastics and paper. Tronox also sells titanium ore – the main feedstock of titanium dioxide - and zircon directly to customers.
Tronox is the third-largest titanium feedstock producer, with approximately 10% of global titanium ore production; and the second-largest producer of zircon, with approximately 20% of global production. The company also has an electrolytic and speciality chemicals business that services the paper and battery industries. Formerly a part of the Kerr-McGee Chemical Corporation and based in Oklahoma City since it was spun off from its parent in 2005, the company announced in June 2012 that it was moving its headquarters to Stamford, Connecticut.[1][2][3]
The company was spun off in part to offload its parent company Kerr-McGee's legacy of generations of environmental dumping of toxic waste across 22 states. According to one report, "Kerr-McGee, rather than pay for the environmental mess it created, decided to shift the liabilities between 2002 and 2006 into Tronox. Kerr-McGee, meanwhile, kept its valuable oil and gas assets."[4] Tronox did not reveal the massive hidden liabilities to investors, and after they became known, Tronox dropped to a penny stock in 2009. In response, shareholders sued Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (successor to Kerr-McGee) for keeping the scope of the environmental disaster a secret. In addition the US Federal Government sued Anadarko to pay for the cleanup, and in April 2014 settled on the largest environmental contamination settlement in American history, over $5 billion.[4]

History[edit]
The company went public in 2005, when Oklahoma City-based Kerr-McGee, which had previously owned the company entirely, issued shares via an IPO on November 21, 2005. It became an independent company in March 2006.[5][6]
In the first quarter of 2006, Tronox replaced Meade Instruments on the S&P SmallCap 600 index, when Kerr-McGee distributed the rest of its stock in Tronox under its former NYSE symbol TRX.B, a class B security. TRX.B started regular-way trading on March 31, 2006.
In 2008, the company's stock price declined significantly, and both classes of stock became penny stocks.
In September 2008, the company's stock moved from the NYSE to OTC.
On 14 January 2009, Tronox filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy. [7]It specified that this action did not include the company's non-USA operations.[8]
In 2009, shareholders of Tronox sued Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (successor to Kerr-McGee) for having misled investors about the large environmental and other debts Tronox would inherit from its parent corporation.[9][10][11][12] The environmental pollution included polluting Lake Mead in Nevada with rocket fuel, leaving behind radioactive waste piles throughout the territory of the Navajo Nation and dumping carcinogenic creosote in communities throughout the East, Midwest and South at its wood-treating facilities.[4]
In 2009, the Huntsman Corporation announced it would buy certain of Tronox's assets, such as its factories. In late 2009, Tronox terminated this deal.[13][14]
Tronox emerged from Chapter 11 Bankruptcy on February 14, 2011.
Tom Casey became CEO in October 2011.[15]
On June 15, 2012, Tronox announced that it had completed the acquisition of Exxaro Mineral Sands and combined both entities under Tronox Limited, an Australian holding company. Describing the benefits of the combination, Tronox Limited CEO Tom Casey said, "We now have the ability to sell into a lucrative titanium feedstock market while assuring our titanium dioxide customers that we have the supply to deliver quality products at reasonable prices.”[16]
In April 2014, the federal government reached a $5 billion settlement with Anadarko (successor to Kerr-McGee) in the largest environmental contamination case in American history.[4] According to one report, "Kerr-McGee, rather than pay for the environmental mess it created, decided to shift the liabilities between 2002 and 2006 into Tronox. Kerr-McGee, meanwhile, kept its valuable oil and gas assets." The cost to clean up the mess inherited by Tronox from Kerr-McGee was estimated by the courts to be over $5 billion.[4] There are contaminated sites in 22 states and the Navajo Nation. "Among the dozens of locations targeted for cleanup under the settlement is a former chemical manufacturing site in Nevada that has led to contamination in Lake Mead, abandoned uranium mines in and around the Navajo Nation, and a Superfund site in Gloucester, N.J., polluted by thorium."[4]

Kerr-McGee spin-off[edit]
Kerr-McGee spun off its chemical business circa 2005-6 after demands were made by corporate raider and major Kerr-McGee shareholder Carl Icahn.[17]
Among other things, Tronox inherited several radioactive waste sites from Kerr-McGee. These include the Cimarron Fuel Fabrication Site and the Rare Earths Facility. They are, as of 2014, still undergoing cleanup.[18][19]
It also inherited the Henderson, Nevada "BMI" site. This site had supplied Magnesium and other chemicals beginning around World War II. It eventually leaked perchlorate (used in rocket fuel) into the water table, which subsequently contaminated Lake Mead and the Colorado River, which supply water to millions of people.[20][21]
Exiting bankruptcy in February 2011, Tronox's Chapter 11 plan created the Anadarko litigation trust to pursue Tronox's lawsuit against Anadarko and Kerr-McGee. Tronox has transferred an 88% share of its interest in the lawsuit to the federal government.[22]

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Tronox Limited, incorporated on September 21, 2011, is engaged in the production and marketing of titanium bearing mineral sands and titanium dioxide (TiO2) pigment. The Company also produces natural soda ash. The Company operates through two segments: TiO2 and Alkali. Its TiO2 segment includes exploration, mining, and beneficiation of mineral sands deposits; production of titanium feedstock, including chloride slag, slag fines, synthetic rutile and leucoxene, pig iron and zircon; production and marketing of TiO2, and electrolytic manganese dioxide manufacturing and marketing, which is primarily focused on battery materials and specialty boron products. Its Alkali segment includes dry mining of trona ore underground at its Westvaco facility; secondary recovery of trona from previously dry mined areas underground at its Westvaco and Granger facilities through solution mining; refining of raw trona ore into soda ash and specialty sodium alkali products, and marketing, sale and distribution of alkali products.The Company's TiO2 is used in a range of products in the manufacturing of paint and other coatings, plastics and paper, and in a range of other applications, including inks, fibers, rubber, food, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. The Company's soda ash products are used by customers in the glass, detergent and chemicals manufacturing industries. The Company has operations in North America, Europe, South Africa and the Asia-Pacific region. Within its TiO2 segment, the Company operates three pigment production facilities at locations, such as Hamilton, Mississippi; Botlek, the Netherlands, and Kwinana, Western Australia. It also operates three separate mining operations: KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) Sands and Namakwa Sands both located in South Africa, and Cooljarloo located in Western Australia.The Company's KwaZulu-Natal Sands operations located in South Africa consists of the Fairbreeze mine, a concentration plant, a mineral separation plant and a smelter complex.

Tronox Stock Sees Short Interest Move 53% Higher
The most recent short interest data has been released for the 03/15/2017 settlement date, which shows a 1,528,589 share increase in total short interest for Tronox Ltd , to 4,415,049, an increase of 52.96% since 02/28/2017.

Tronox Corporation logo


Tronox Limited (NYSE: TROX) is an American worldwide chemical company involved in the titanium products industry with approximately 3,500 employees. Following its acquisition of the mineral sands business formerly belonging to South Africa’s Exxaro Resources, Tronox is the largest fully integrated seller and marketer of titanium dioxide (TiO2) pigment, which provides brightness to applications such as coatings, plastics and paper. Tronox also sells titanium ore – the main feedstock of titanium dioxide - and zircon directly to customers.
Tronox is the third-largest titanium feedstock producer, with approximately 10% of global titanium ore production; and the second-largest producer of zircon, with approximately 20% of global production. The company also has an electrolytic and speciality chemicals business that services the paper and battery industries. Formerly a part of the Kerr-McGee Chemical Corporation and based in Oklahoma City since it was spun off from its parent in 2005, the company announced in June 2012 that it was moving its headquarters to Stamford, Connecticut.[1][2][3]
The company was spun off in part to offload its parent company Kerr-McGee's legacy of generations of environmental dumping of toxic waste across 22 states. According to one report, "Kerr-McGee, rather than pay for the environmental mess it created, decided to shift the liabilities between 2002 and 2006 into Tronox. Kerr-McGee, meanwhile, kept its valuable oil and gas assets."[4] Tronox did not reveal the massive hidden liabilities to investors, and after they became known, Tronox dropped to a penny stock in 2009. In response, shareholders sued Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (successor to Kerr-McGee) for keeping the scope of the environmental disaster a secret. In addition the US Federal Government sued Anadarko to pay for the cleanup, and in April 2014 settled on the largest environmental contamination settlement in American history, over $5 billion.[4]

History[edit]
The company went public in 2005, when Oklahoma City-based Kerr-McGee, which had previously owned the company entirely, issued shares via an IPO on November 21, 2005. It became an independent company in March 2006.[5][6]
In the first quarter of 2006, Tronox replaced Meade Instruments on the S&P SmallCap 600 index, when Kerr-McGee distributed the rest of its stock in Tronox under its former NYSE symbol TRX.B, a class B security. TRX.B started regular-way trading on March 31, 2006.
In 2008, the company's stock price declined significantly, and both classes of stock became penny stocks.
In September 2008, the company's stock moved from the NYSE to OTC.
On 14 January 2009, Tronox filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy. [7]It specified that this action did not include the company's non-USA operations.[8]
In 2009, shareholders of Tronox sued Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (successor to Kerr-McGee) for having misled investors about the large environmental and other debts Tronox would inherit from its parent corporation.[9][10][11][12] The environmental pollution included polluting Lake Mead in Nevada with rocket fuel, leaving behind radioactive waste piles throughout the territory of the Navajo Nation and dumping carcinogenic creosote in communities throughout the East, Midwest and South at its wood-treating facilities.[4]
In 2009, the Huntsman Corporation announced it would buy certain of Tronox's assets, such as its factories. In late 2009, Tronox terminated this deal.[13][14]
Tronox emerged from Chapter 11 Bankruptcy on February 14, 2011.
Tom Casey became CEO in October 2011.[15]
On June 15, 2012, Tronox announced that it had completed the acquisition of Exxaro Mineral Sands and combined both entities under Tronox Limited, an Australian holding company. Describing the benefits of the combination, Tronox Limited CEO Tom Casey said, "We now have the ability to sell into a lucrative titanium feedstock market while assuring our titanium dioxide customers that we have the supply to deliver quality products at reasonable prices.”[16]
In April 2014, the federal government reached a $5 billion settlement with Anadarko (successor to Kerr-McGee) in the largest environmental contamination case in American history.[4] According to one report, "Kerr-McGee, rather than pay for the environmental mess it created, decided to shift the liabilities between 2002 and 2006 into Tronox. Kerr-McGee, meanwhile, kept its valuable oil and gas assets." The cost to clean up the mess inherited by Tronox from Kerr-McGee was estimated by the courts to be over $5 billion.[4] There are contaminated sites in 22 states and the Navajo Nation. "Among the dozens of locations targeted for cleanup under the settlement is a former chemical manufacturing site in Nevada that has led to contamination in Lake Mead, abandoned uranium mines in and around the Navajo Nation, and a Superfund site in Gloucester, N.J., polluted by thorium."[4]

Kerr-McGee spin-off[edit]
Kerr-McGee spun off its chemical business circa 2005-6 after demands were made by corporate raider and major Kerr-McGee shareholder Carl Icahn.[17]
Among other things, Tronox inherited several radioactive waste sites from Kerr-McGee. These include the Cimarron Fuel Fabrication Site and the Rare Earths Facility. They are, as of 2014, still undergoing cleanup.[18][19]
It also inherited the Henderson, Nevada "BMI" site. This site had supplied Magnesium and other chemicals beginning around World War II. It eventually leaked perchlorate (used in rocket fuel) into the water table, which subsequently contaminated Lake Mead and the Colorado River, which supply water to millions of people.[20][21]
Exiting bankruptcy in February 2011, Tronox's Chapter 11 plan created the Anadarko litigation trust to pursue Tronox's lawsuit against Anadarko and Kerr-McGee. Tronox has transferred an 88% share of its interest in the lawsuit to the federal government.[22]

About Tronox Alkali
Tronox Alkali operates a multi-faceted mining and production facility in Green River, Wyoming, supplying some of the best-known products used around the globe. We are the world’s largest producer of natural soda ash and strive to harness the latest technological innovations to better serve our customers.
Tronox Alkali employs approximately 950 people at eight processing plants and an underground mining operation that is 1,600 feet (488 meters) below the Earth’s surface. We are proud of employing several generations of reliable, hard-working families over many decades and are determined to maintain a culture of safety as a core value.
About Tronox Alkali – Trifold Brochure
Tronox Alkali Product Literature
50 Million Years of History
The Green River story began some 50 million years ago, when this Wyoming site was at the bottom of a 1,000 square-mile body of water called Lake Gosiute. Over millions of years, runoff from the surrounding mountains carried sodium-rich compounds into the lake. That sodium reacted with carbon dioxide to form the mineral called trona. In time, this reaction created the largest trona deposit in the world, and, as Lake Gosiute dried up, an estimated 130 billion short tons (1.18 billion metric tons) of trona were deposited across the Green River Basin.
Trona ore is naturally occurring sodium sesquicarbonate.  Since discovery of the trona beds in 1938, the Green River Basin has become the preferred source of high quality soda ash and other sodium products that ship worldwide.
Vital to Everyday Products
From trona ore we make soda ash, sodium bicarbonate, S-Carb®, Sesqui™ and sodium hydroxide.  Soda ash is an essential component in making glass, fiberglass, detergents, tableware, lighting, and display screens for consumer electronics.  Sodium bicarbonate, commonly known as baking soda, has countless applications including those in foods, an array of consumer products, and pharmaceuticals.  S-Carb® is the preferred ingredient in animal feed to balance rumen pH and provide electrolytes for poultry and swine.  Sesqui™ sodium sesquicarbonate provides the silky clean feeling in bath salts and many cleaning compounds.
The Green River operation has been mining trona for roughly seven decades and today produces more than 4 million short tons (3.63 million metric tons) annually. Tronox Alkali ships approximately 40,000 railcars and 5,000 truck orders of trona each year. And we do it all more efficiently and economically, on a delivered basis, than synthetic competitors anywhere in the world. Tronox Alkali has its corporate offices in Philadelphia.
