Adoption of Updated EDGAR Filer Manual



Document Number: 2017-15862    

Type: Rule    

Date: 2017-07-28    

Agency: Securities and Exchange Commission, Agencies and Commissions    


    The Securities and Exchange Commission (``the Commission'') is adopting revisions to the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval System (``EDGAR'') Filer Manual and related rules to reflect updates to the EDGAR system. The updates are being made primarily to reflect amendments made to several forms under the Securities Act of 1933 (``Securities Act'') and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act'') to effectuate inflation adjustments and other technical amendments required under Titles I and III of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (``JOBS'') Act; support recent updates to Form C and Form D; includes instructions for hyperlinking to exhibits included with certain Securities Act and Exchange Act forms and makes certain corrective changes to previously revised sections. The revised EDGAR Filer Manual also announces updates to the technical specifications for the ABS-EE schema and terminates support for US-GAAP-2015, EXCH-2015, CURRENCY-2014, and COUNTRY-2013 taxonomies. The EDGAR system is scheduled to be upgraded on July 17, 2017.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The
following is a summary of the
application. The complete application
may be obtained via the Commission’s
Web site by searching for the file
number, or an applicant using the
Company name box, at http://
www.sec.gov/search/search.htm or by
calling (202) 551–8090.
Applicants’ Representations
1. The Fund is a continuously offered
closed-end management investment
company registered under the Act and
organized as a Delaware statutory trust.
The Fund currently serves as the master
fund in a master-feeder structure with
one feeder fund.1 If the requested relief
is granted, the feeder fund will be
dissolved promptly and the Fund will
no longer operate within a master-feeder
structure.2 The Fund’s investment
objective is to seek to generate
consistent, total returns while
minimizing the risk of loss. The Fund
intends to pursue its investment
objective by investing primarily in debt
and equity securities, loans, trade
claims and derivative instruments of
leveraged or financially distressed
companies. In addition, the Fund will
typically take long and short positions
in securities, loans and derivatives.
2. The Adviser, a Delaware limited
liability company, is registered as an
investment adviser under the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940
(‘‘Advisers Act’’). The Adviser serves as
investment adviser to the Fund.
Foreside Fund Services, LLC, a brokerdealer registered under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (‘‘1934 Act’’), acts
as the distributor of the Fund.
3. The Fund continuously offers its
Shares 3 to investors that represent that
they are ‘‘qualified clients’’ within the
meaning of Rule 205–3 under the
Advisers Act (‘‘Qualified Clients’’).
Shares of the Fund are not listed on any
securities exchange and do not trade on
an over-the-counter system such as
NASDAQ. Applicants do not expect that
any secondary market will develop for
the Shares.
4. The Fund currently offers a single
class of Shares (the ‘‘Initial Class’’) at
net asset value per share without a sales
load and without an annual asset-based
1 The feeder fund is Ramius Archview Credit and
Distressed Feeder Fund.
2 In accordance with the organizational
documents of the feeder fund and Delaware
statutory trust law, no shareholder vote is required
to liquidate and dissolve the feeder fund.
3 ‘‘Shares’’ includes any other equivalent
designation of a proportionate ownership interest of
the Fund.

service and/or distribution fee. The
Fund proposes to issue multiple classes
of Shares and specifically proposes to
offer a new Share class (the ‘‘New
Class’’): (1) Only to Qualified Clients; (2)
at net asset value plus a front-end sales
load of up to 3%; and (3) subject to an
annual distribution/shareholder fee of
0.75%. The front-end sales load and
annual distribution/shareholder
servicing fee to be charged to the New
Class Shares will be the same as those
currently charged to the feeder fund
Shares. The Fund intends to continue to
offer Initial Class Shares, without a sales
load and without a service and/or
distribution fee.
5. In order to provide a limited degree
of liquidity to shareholders, the Fund
may from time to time offer to
repurchase Shares, in an amount not to
exceed 25% of the Fund’s net asset
value, at their then current net asset
value in accordance with rule 13e–4
under the 1934 Act pursuant to written
tenders by shareholders.4 Repurchases
will be made at such times, in such
amounts and on such terms as may be
determined by the Fund’s board of
trustees (‘‘Board’’), in its sole
discretion.5 Repurchases will not
commence for at least six months
following the date of the initial closing
for subscriptions for Shares. Following
such date, the Adviser will recommend
to the Board (subject to its discretion)
that the Fund offer to repurchase Shares
from shareholders on a quarterly basis.
6. Applicants request that the order
also apply to any other continuously
offered registered closed-end
management investment company
existing now or in the future for which
the Adviser or any entity controlling,
controlled by, or under common control
with the Adviser acts as investment
adviser and which provides periodic
liquidity with respect to its Shares
through tender offers conducted in
compliance with rule 13e–4 under the
1934 Act.6
4 Likewise, the feeder fund’s repurchase offers are
conducted pursuant to rule 13e–4 under the 1934
Act.
5 Shares are subject to an Early Repurchase Fee
at a rate of 2% of the net asset value of any Shares
repurchased by the Fund that were held for less
than one year. The Early Repurchase Fee will
equally apply to all shareholders of the Fund,
regardless of class, consistent with section 18 of the
Act and rule 18f–3 under the Act. To the extent the
Fund determines to waive, impose scheduled
variations of, or eliminate the Early Repurchase Fee,
it will do so consistently with the requirements of
rule 22d–1 under the Act as if the Early Repurchase
Fee were a CDSC and as if the Fund were an openend investment company, and the Fund’s waiver of,
scheduled variation in, or elimination of, the Early
Repurchase Fee will apply uniformly to all
shareholders of the Fund.
6 The Fund and any other investment company
relying on the requested relief will do so in a

7. Applicants represent that any assetbased service and/or distribution fees
will comply with the provisions of rule
2830(d) of the Conduct Rules of the
National Association of Securities
Dealers, Inc. (‘‘NASD Conduct Rule
2830’’) as if that rule applied to the
Fund.7 Applicants also represent that
the Fund will disclose in its prospectus,
the fees, expenses and other
characteristics of each class of Shares
offered for sale by the prospectus as is
required for open-end multiple class
funds under Form N–1A. As is required
for open-end funds, the Fund will
disclose its expenses in shareholder
reports, and disclose any arrangements
that result in breakpoints in or
elimination of sales loads in its
prospectus.8 The Fund will also comply
with any requirements that may be
adopted by the Commission or FINRA
regarding disclosure at the point of sale
and in transaction confirmations about
the costs and conflicts of interest arising
out of the distribution of open-end
investment company shares, and
regarding prospectus disclosure of sales
loads and revenue sharing arrangements
as if those requirements applied to the
Fund and the Distributor.9 The Fund
will contractually require that the
Distributor and any other distributor of
the Fund’s Shares comply with such
requirements in connection with the
distribution of Shares of the Fund.
8. The Fund will allocate all expenses
incurred by it among the various classes
of Shares based on the net assets of the
Fund attributable to each class, except
that the net asset value and expenses of
each class will reflect distribution fees,
service fees, and any other incremental
expenses of that class. Expenses of the
Fund allocated to a particular class of
Shares will be borne on a pro rata basis
manner consistent with the terms and conditions of
the application. Applicants represent that any
person presently intending to rely on the requested
relief is listed as an applicant.

include any successor or replacement rule that may
be adopted by the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority (‘‘FINRA’’).

by each outstanding Share of that class.
Applicants state that the Fund will
comply with the provisions of rule 18f–
3 under the Act as if it were an openend investment company.
9. In the event the Fund imposes a
CDSC, the applicants will comply with
the provisions of rule 6c-10 under the
Act, as if that rule applied to closed-end
management investment companies.
With respect to any waiver of,
scheduled variation in, or elimination of
the CDSC, the Fund will comply with

were an open-end investment company.
Applicants’ Legal Analysis

asabaliauskas on DSK3SPTVN1PROD with NOTICES

Multiple Classes of Shares
1. Section 18(c) of the Act provides,
in relevant part, that a closed-end
investment company may not issue or
sell any senior security if, immediately
thereafter, the company has outstanding
more than one class of senior security.
Applicants state that the creation of
multiple classes of Shares of the Fund
may be prohibited by section 18(c).
2. Section 18(i) of the Act provides
that each share of stock issued by a
registered management investment
company will be a voting stock and
have equal voting rights with every
other outstanding voting stock.
Applicants state that permitting
multiple classes of Shares of the Fund
may violate section 18(i) of the Act
because each class would be entitled to
exclusive voting rights with respect to
matters solely related to that class.
3. Section 6(c) of the Act provides that
the Commission may exempt any
person, security or transaction or any
class or classes of persons, securities or
transactions from any provision of the
Act, or from any rule under the Act, if
and to the extent such exemption is
necessary or appropriate in the public
interest and consistent with the
protection of investors and the purposes
fairly intended by the policy and
provisions of the Act. Applicants
request an exemption under section 6(c)
from sections 18(c) and 18(i) to permit
the Fund to issue multiple classes of
Shares.
4. Applicants submit that the
proposed allocation of expenses and
voting rights among multiple classes is
equitable and will not discriminate
against any group or class of
shareholders. Applicants submit that
the proposed arrangements would
permit the Fund to facilitate the
distribution of its Shares and provide
investors with a broader choice of
shareholder options. Applicants assert
that the proposed closed-end
investment company multiple class

Jkt 238001

structure does not raise the concerns
underlying section 18 of the Act to any
greater degree than open-end
investment companies’ multiple class
structures that are permitted by rule
18f–3 under the Act. Applicants state
that the Fund will comply with the
provisions of rule 18f–3 as if it were an
open-end investment company.
CDSCs
Applicants believe that the requested
relief meets the standards of section 6(c)
of the Act. Rule 6c–10 under the Act
permits open-end investment
companies to impose CDSCs, subject to
certain conditions. Applicants state that
any CDSC imposed by the Fund will
comply with rule 6c–10 under the Act
as if the rule were applicable to closedend investment companies. The Fund
also will disclose CDSCs in accordance
with the requirements of Form N–1A
concerning CDSCs as if the Fund were
an open-end investment company.
Applicants further state that the Fund
will apply the CDSC (and any waivers,
scheduled variations or eliminations of
the CDSC) uniformly to all shareholders
in a given class and consistently with
the requirements of rule 22d–1 under
the Act.
Asset-Based Service and/or Distribution
Fees
1. Section 17(d) of the Act and rule
17d–1 under the Act prohibit an
affiliated person of a registered
investment company or an affiliated
person of such person, acting as
principal, from participating in or
effecting any transaction in connection
with any joint enterprise or joint
arrangement in which the investment
company participates unless the
Commission issues an order permitting
the transaction. In reviewing
applications submitted under section
17(d) and rule 17d–1, the Commission
considers whether the participation of
the investment company in a joint
enterprise or joint arrangement is
consistent with the provisions, policies
and purposes of the Act, and the extent
to which the participation is on a basis
different from or less advantageous than
that of other participants.
2. Rule 17d–3 under the Act provides
an exemption from section 17(d) and
rule 17d–1 to permit open-end
investment companies to enter into
distribution arrangements pursuant to
rule 12b–1 under the Act. Applicants
request an order under section 17(d) and
rule 17d–1 under the Act to permit the
Fund to impose asset-based service and/
or distribution fees. Applicants have
agreed to comply with rules 12b–1 and

PO 00000

Frm 00091

Fmt 4703

Sfmt 4703

17d–3 as if those rules applied to
closed-end investment companies.
Applicants’ Condition
The applicants agree that any order
granting the requested relief will be
subject to the following condition:
Applicants will comply with the
provisions of rules 6c–10, 12b–1, 17d–
3, 18f–3 and 22d–1 under the Act, as
amended from time to time or replaced,
as if those rules applied to closed-end
management investment companies,
and will comply with NASD Conduct
Rule 2830, as amended from time to
time, as if that rule applied to all closedend management investment
companies.

Investment Management, under delegated
authority.

Applicants' Representations

    1. The Fund is a continuously offered closed-end management 
investment company registered under the Act and organized as a Delaware 
statutory trust. The Fund currently serves as the master fund in a 
master-feeder structure with one feeder fund.\1\ If the requested 
relief is granted, the feeder fund will be dissolved promptly and the 
Fund will no longer operate within a master-feeder structure.\2\ The 
Fund's investment objective is to seek to generate consistent, total 
returns while minimizing the risk of loss. The Fund intends to pursue 
its investment objective by investing primarily in debt and equity 
securities, loans, trade claims and derivative instruments of leveraged 
or financially distressed companies. In addition, the Fund will 
typically take long and short positions in securities, loans and 
derivatives.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ The feeder fund is Ramius Archview Credit and Distressed 
Feeder Fund.
    \2\ In accordance with the organizational documents of the 
feeder fund and Delaware statutory trust law, no shareholder vote is 
required to liquidate and dissolve the feeder fund.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    2. The Adviser, a Delaware limited liability company, is registered 
as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 
(``Advisers Act''). The Adviser serves as investment adviser to the 
Fund. Foreside Fund Services, LLC, a broker-dealer registered under the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``1934 Act''), acts as the distributor 
of the Fund.
    3. The Fund continuously offers its Shares \3\ to investors that 
represent that they are ``qualified clients'' within the meaning of 
Rule 205-3 under the Advisers Act (``Qualified Clients''). Shares of 
the Fund are not listed on any securities exchange and do not trade on 
an over-the-counter system such as NASDAQ. Applicants do not expect 
that any secondary market will develop for the Shares.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ ``Shares'' includes any other equivalent designation of a 
proportionate ownership interest of the Fund.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    4. The Fund currently offers a single class of Shares (the 
``Initial Class'') at net asset value per share without a sales load 
and without an annual asset-based service and/or distribution fee. The 
Fund proposes to issue multiple classes of Shares and specifically 
proposes to offer a new Share class (the ``New Class''): (1) Only to 
Qualified Clients; (2) at net asset value plus a front-end sales load 
of up to 3%; and (3) subject to an annual distribution/shareholder fee 
of 0.75%. The front-end sales load and annual distribution/shareholder 
servicing fee to be charged to the New Class Shares will be the same as 
those currently charged to the feeder fund Shares. The Fund intends to 
continue to offer Initial Class Shares, without a sales load and 
without a service and/or distribution fee.
    5. In order to provide a limited degree of liquidity to 
shareholders, the Fund may from time to time offer to repurchase 
Shares, in an amount not to exceed 25% of the Fund's net asset value, 
at their then current net asset value in accordance with rule 13e-4 
under the 1934 Act pursuant to written tenders by shareholders.\4\ 
Repurchases will be made at such times, in such amounts and on such 
terms as may be determined by the Fund's board of trustees (``Board''), 
in its sole discretion.\5\ Repurchases will not commence for at least 
six months following the date of the initial closing for subscriptions 
for Shares. Following such date, the Adviser will recommend to the 
Board (subject to its discretion) that the Fund offer to repurchase 
Shares from shareholders on a quarterly basis.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ Likewise, the feeder fund's repurchase offers are conducted 
pursuant to rule 13e-4 under the 1934 Act.
    \5\ Shares are subject to an Early Repurchase Fee at a rate of 
2% of the net asset value of any Shares repurchased by the Fund that 
were held for less than one year. The Early Repurchase Fee will 
equally apply to all shareholders of the Fund, regardless of class, 
consistent with section 18 of the Act and rule 18f-3 under the Act. 
To the extent the Fund determines to waive, impose scheduled 
variations of, or eliminate the Early Repurchase Fee, it will do so 
consistently with the requirements of rule 22d-1 under the Act as if 
the Early Repurchase Fee were a CDSC and as if the Fund were an 
open-end investment company, and the Fund's waiver of, scheduled 
variation in, or elimination of, the Early Repurchase Fee will apply 
uniformly to all shareholders of the Fund.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    6. Applicants request that the order also apply to any other 
continuously offered registered closed-end management investment 
company existing now or in the future for which the Adviser or any 
entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the 
Adviser acts as investment adviser and which provides periodic 
liquidity with respect to its Shares through tender offers conducted in 
compliance with rule 13e-4 under the 1934 Act.\6\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ The Fund and any other investment company relying on the 
requested relief will do so in a manner consistent with the terms 
and conditions of the application. Applicants represent that any 
person presently intending to rely on the requested relief is listed 
as an applicant.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    7. Applicants represent that any asset-based service and/or 
distribution fees will comply with the provisions of rule 2830(d) of 
the Conduct Rules of the National Association of Securities Dealers, 
Inc. (``NASD Conduct Rule 2830'') as if that rule applied to the 
Fund.\7\ Applicants also represent that the Fund will disclose in its 
prospectus, the fees, expenses and other characteristics of each class 
of Shares offered for sale by the prospectus as is required for open-
end multiple class funds under Form N-1A. As is required for open-end 
funds, the Fund will disclose its expenses in shareholder reports, and 
disclose any arrangements that result in breakpoints in or elimination 
of sales loads in its prospectus.\8\ The Fund will also comply with any 
requirements that may be adopted by the Commission or FINRA regarding 
disclosure at the point of sale and in transaction confirmations about 
the costs and conflicts of interest arising out of the distribution of 
open-end investment company shares, and regarding prospectus disclosure 
of sales loads and revenue sharing arrangements as if those 
requirements applied to the Fund and the Distributor.\9\ The Fund will 
contractually require that the Distributor and any other distributor of 
the Fund's Shares comply with such requirements in connection with the 
distribution of Shares of the Fund.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ All references to NASD Conduct Rule 2830 include any 
successor or replacement rule that may be adopted by the Financial 
Industry Regulatory Authority (``FINRA'').
    \8\ See Shareholder Reports and Quarterly Portfolio Disclosure 
of Registered Management Investment Companies, Investment Company 
Act Release No. 26372 (Feb. 27, 2004) (adopting release) (requiring 
open-end investment companies to disclose fund expenses in 
shareholder reports); and Disclosure of Breakpoint Discounts by 
Mutual Funds, Investment Company Act Release No. 26464 (June 7, 
2004) (adopting release) (requiring open-end investment companies to 
provide prospectus disclosure of certain sales load information).
    \9\ See, e.g., Confirmation Requirements and Point of Sale 
Disclosure Requirements for Transactions and Certain Mutual Funds 
and Other Securities, and Other Confirmation Requirement Amendments, 
and Amendments to the Registration Form for Mutual Funds, Investment 
Company Act Release No. 26341 (Jan. 29, 2004) (proposing release).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    8. The Fund will allocate all expenses incurred by it among the 
various classes of Shares based on the net assets of the Fund 
attributable to each class, except that the net asset value and 
expenses of each class will reflect distribution fees, service fees, 
and any other incremental expenses of that class. Expenses of the Fund 
allocated to a particular class of Shares will be borne on a pro rata 
basis

[[Page 37656]]

by each outstanding Share of that class. Applicants state that the Fund 
will comply with the provisions of rule 18f-3 under the Act as if it 
were an open-end investment company.
    9. In the event the Fund imposes a CDSC, the applicants will comply 
with the provisions of rule 6c-10 under the Act, as if that rule 
applied to closed-end management investment companies. With respect to 
any waiver of, scheduled variation in, or elimination of the CDSC, the 
Fund will comply with rule 22d-1 under the Act as if the Fund were an 
open-end investment company.

Applicants' Legal Analysis

Multiple Classes of Shares

    1. Section 18(c) of the Act provides, in relevant part, that a 
closed-end investment company may not issue or sell any senior security 
if, immediately thereafter, the company has outstanding more than one 
class of senior security. Applicants state that the creation of 
multiple classes of Shares of the Fund may be prohibited by section 
18(c).
    2. Section 18(i) of the Act provides that each share of stock 
issued by a registered management investment company will be a voting 
stock and have equal voting rights with every other outstanding voting 
stock. Applicants state that permitting multiple classes of Shares of 
the Fund may violate section 18(i) of the Act because each class would 
be entitled to exclusive voting rights with respect to matters solely 
related to that class.
    3. Section 6(c) of the Act provides that the Commission may exempt 
any person, security or transaction or any class or classes of persons, 
securities or transactions from any provision of the Act, or from any 
rule under the Act, if and to the extent such exemption is necessary or 
appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection 
of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and 
provisions of the Act. Applicants request an exemption under section 
6(c) from sections 18(c) and 18(i) to permit the Fund to issue multiple 
classes of Shares.
    4. Applicants submit that the proposed allocation of expenses and 
voting rights among multiple classes is equitable and will not 
discriminate against any group or class of shareholders. Applicants 
submit that the proposed arrangements would permit the Fund to 
facilitate the distribution of its Shares and provide investors with a 
broader choice of shareholder options. Applicants assert that the 
proposed closed-end investment company multiple class structure does 
not raise the concerns underlying section 18 of the Act to any greater 
degree than open-end investment companies' multiple class structures 
that are permitted by rule 18f-3 under the Act. Applicants state that 
the Fund will comply with the provisions of rule 18f-3 as if it were an 
open-end investment company.

 CDSCs

    Applicants believe that the requested relief meets the standards of 
section 6(c) of the Act. Rule 6c-10 under the Act permits open-end 
investment companies to impose CDSCs, subject to certain conditions. 
Applicants state that any CDSC imposed by the Fund will comply with 
rule 6c-10 under the Act as if the rule were applicable to closed-end 
investment companies. The Fund also will disclose CDSCs in accordance 
with the requirements of Form N-1A concerning CDSCs as if the Fund were 
an open-end investment company. Applicants further state that the Fund 
will apply the CDSC (and any waivers, scheduled variations or 
eliminations of the CDSC) uniformly to all shareholders in a given 
class and consistently with the requirements of rule 22d-1 under the 
Act.

Asset-Based Service and/or Distribution Fees

    1. Section 17(d) of the Act and rule 17d-1 under the Act prohibit 
an affiliated person of a registered investment company or an 
affiliated person of such person, acting as principal, from 
participating in or effecting any transaction in connection with any 
joint enterprise or joint arrangement in which the investment company 
participates unless the Commission issues an order permitting the 
transaction. In reviewing applications submitted under section 17(d) 
and rule 17d-1, the Commission considers whether the participation of 
the investment company in a joint enterprise or joint arrangement is 
consistent with the provisions, policies and purposes of the Act, and 
the extent to which the participation is on a basis different from or 
less advantageous than that of other participants.
    2. Rule 17d-3 under the Act provides an exemption from section 
17(d) and rule 17d-1 to permit open-end investment companies to enter 
into distribution arrangements pursuant to rule 12b-1 under the Act. 
Applicants request an order under section 17(d) and rule 17d-1 under 
the Act to permit the Fund to impose asset-based service and/or 
distribution fees. Applicants have agreed to comply with rules 12b-1 
and 17d-3 as if those rules applied to closed-end investment companies.

Applicants' Condition

    The applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief 
will be subject to the following condition:
    Applicants will comply with the provisions of rules 6c-10, 12b-1, 
17d-3, 18f-3 and 22d-1 under the Act, as amended from time to time or 
replaced, as if those rules applied to closed-end management investment 
companies, and will comply with NASD Conduct Rule 2830, as amended from 
time to time, as if that rule applied to all closed-end management 
investment companies.

    For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, 
under delegated authority.
Robert W. Errett,
Deputy Secretary.

the date specified in this tableRamius Archview Credit and Distressed Fund (the “Fund”), in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth herein, is offering to purchase from shareholders of the Fund (“Shareholders”) shares of the Fund (“Shares”).  (As used in this Schedule TO, the term “Shares” refers to the shares of beneficial interest in the Fund constituting the class of security which is the subject of this Offer (as defined below).)  Specifically, the Fund is offering to purchase Shares in an amount up to 25% of the Fund’s net asset value, calculated as of the Valuation Date, and each Share tendered for purchase will be purchased at the net asset value per Share calculated as of such date.  (Net asset value per Share is equal to (a) the difference between the value of the Fund’s assets and the value of the Fund’s
liabilities, divided by (b) the number of Shares outstanding, and less (c) any Repurchase Fee (as defined below).)  Shareholders desiring to tender Shares for purchase must do so by 11:59 PM, Eastern time, on the Notice Date.  Shareholders have the right to change their minds and withdraw any tenders of their Shares until 11:59 PM, Eastern time, on the Notice Date.  After the Notice Date, the Fund in its discretion may permit the withdrawal of tenders at any time prior to the Valuation Date.If the Fund accepts the tender of the Shareholder’s Shares, the Fund will make payment for the Shares it purchases from one or more of the following sources:  cash on hand, the proceeds of the sale of portfolio securities held by the Fund or borrowings.Shareholders desiring to tender Shares for purchase must do so by 11:59 PM, Eastern time, on the Notice Date.  The Offer to Shareholders remains
revocable until 11:59 PM, Eastern time, on the Valuation Date.  Until the Notice Date, Shareholders have the right to change their minds and withdraw any tenders of their Shares.  Shares withdrawn may be re-tendered, however, provided that such tenders are made before the Notice Date by following the tender procedures described herein.  If the Fund has not yet accepted a Shareholder’s tender of Shares on or before the Acceptance Date, a Shareholder will also have the right to withdraw its tender of its Shares after such date.If a Shareholder would like the Fund to purchase any of its Shares, it should complete, sign, and either (i) mail (via certified mail, return receipt requested) or otherwise deliver a Letter of Transmittal to the Fund at either of the following addresses:3Overnight
Delivery:                    Regular Mail:Ramius Funds                    Ramius Fundsc/o BNY Mellon Investment Servicing            c/o BNY Mellon Investment Servicing4400 Computer Drive                PO Box 9888Westborough, MA 01581                 Providence, RI
02940-9888            or (ii) fax it to the Fund at (508) 599-4263, so that it is received before 11:59 PM, Eastern time, on the Notice Date.  If a Shareholder chooses to fax the Letter of Transmittal, it should mail the original Letter of Transmittal to BNY Mellon Investment Servicing promptly after it is faxed (although the original does not have to be received by the Notice Date). Note that, notwithstanding the foregoing, certain Shareholders may be required to deliver their Letter of Transmittal to their financial consultant (instead of directly to BNY Mellon Investment Servicing).  All Shareholders tendering Shares should carefully review their Letter of Transmittal and
follow the delivery instructions therein.The value of the Shares may change between the Prior NAV Calculation Date and the Valuation Date.  Shareholders desiring to obtain the estimated net asset value of their Shares may contact Ramius shareholder services by calling (212) 201-4870 or emailing ClientServices@ramius.com or contact BNY Mellon Investment Servicing at (866) 858-4420 Monday through Friday (except holidays), from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Eastern time. IMPORTANT NOTE:  An estimated net asset value provided by the Fund or BNY Mellon Investment Servicing (if any) may be provided to
Shareholders for convenience only and not pursuant to any obligation on the part of the Company.  Neither the Company nor BNY Mellon Investment Servicing can give any assurances as to the accuracy of such information; nor can either give any assurance that the next regularly computed, monthly net asset value will not differ (sometimes significantly) from such estimated net asset value.  Moreover, estimated information cannot be read as superseding any regularly computed, monthly net asset value.Please note that, just as each Shareholder has the right to withdraw its tender, the Fund has the right to cancel, amend, or postpone this Offer at any time before 11:59 PM, Eastern time, on the Valuation Date.  Also realize that if a Shareholder desires to tender Shares for purchase, it must do so by the Notice Date.  A Shareholder tendering all of its Shares will remain a Shareholder of the Fund through the Valuation Date, when the
net asset value of the Shareholder’s Shares is calculated, notwithstanding the Fund’s acceptance of the Shareholder’s Shares for purchase.If a Shareholder tenders its Shares and the Fund purchases those Shares, the Fund will issue the Shareholder a non-interest bearing, non-transferable promissory note (the “Note”) representing the Fund’s obligation to pay for repurchased Shares.  The Note will entitle the Shareholder to receive a payment in cash or in kind equal to the unaudited value of the Shares tendered by the Shareholder that are accepted for purchase by the Fund (the “Payment”), less any Repurchase Fee due to the Fund in connection with the repurchase.  The Payment will be made within 30 days of the Valuation Date and will be wire-transferred directly to an account designated by the Shareholder.  The Note will be held by BNY Mellon Investment Servicing on the Shareholder’s behalf.  Upon a written request
by a Shareholder, BNY Mellon Investment Servicing will mail the Note to the Shareholder at the address of the Shareholder as maintained in the books and records of the Fund. 4A Shareholder who tenders for purchase only a portion of such Shareholder’s Shares will be required to maintain an account balance equal to at least $10,000.  The Company reserves the right to purchase all of the Shareholder’s Shares if the Shareholder has requested a partial repurchase that would cause the Shareholder’s account to have less than the required minimum balance.A “Repurchase Fee” of 2.0% of the tendered Shares will be charged by the Fund on any repurchase of Shares from a Shareholder at any time prior to the day immediately preceding the one-year anniversary of the Shareholder’s purchase of
the Shares. Partial Shares will be repurchased on a “first in-first out” basis (i.e., the portion of the Shares repurchased will be deemed to have been taken from the earliest capital contribution made by such Shareholder (adjusted for subsequent appreciation and depreciation) until that capital contribution is decreased to zero, and then from each subsequent capital contribution made by such Shareholder (as adjusted) until such capital contribution is decreased to zero).ITEM 2.ISSUER INFORMATION(a)    The name of the issuer is Ramius Archview Credit and Distressed Fund.  The Fund is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “1940 Act”)
as a closed-end, non-diversified, management investment company.  It is organized as a Delaware statutory trust.

See Item 4(a)(1)(v) below.Subject to the discussion
below in Item 4(a)(1)(ix), each Shareholder may tender any of its Shares for repurchase by the Fund. A Shareholder who tenders for purchase only a portion of such Shareholder’s Shares will be required to maintain an account balance equal to at least $10,000.  The Company reserves the right to purchase all of the Shareholder’s Shares if the Shareholder has requested a partial repurchase that would cause the Shareholder’s account to have less than the required minimum balance.(iii)    Shareholders desiring to tender Shares for purchase must do so by 11:59 PM, Eastern time, on the Notice Date Shareholders have the right to change their minds and withdraw any tenders of their Shares before 11:59 midnight, Eastern time, on the Notice Date.  After the Notice Date, the Fund in its discretion may permit the withdrawal of tenders at any time prior to the Valuation Date.(iv)    Not
applicable.(v)    The Fund reserves the right, at any time and from time to time, up to and including the Valuation Date:  (a) to cancel the Offer in the circumstances set out in Section 8 of the Offer to Purchase dated as of the Commencement Date, and, in the event of such cancellation, not to purchase, or pay for, any Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer; (b) to amend the Offer; or (c) to postpone the acceptance of Shares.  If the Fund determines to amend the Offer or to postpone the acceptance of Shares tendered, it will, to the extent necessary, extend the period of time during which the Offer is open as provided above and will promptly notify Shareholders.(vi)    In accordance with the terms set forth in the Fund’s Prospectus dated November
20, 2015 (as it may be amended, modified, or otherwise supplemented from time to time, the “Prospectus”), a tender of Shares made pursuant to this Offer may be withdrawn at any time before 11:59 PM, Eastern time, on the Notice Date.  Pursuant to Rule 13e-4(f)(2)(ii) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “1934 Act”), if the Fund has not yet accepted a Shareholder’s tender of Shares on or before the Acceptance Date, a Shareholder will also have the right to withdraw its tender of its Shares after such date.(vii)    Shareholders wishing to tender Shares pursuant to the Offer should send or deliver a completed and executed Letter of Transmittal to the Fund, at the address set out on the first page of the Letter of Transmittal, or fax a completed and executed Letter of Transmittal 6to
the Fund, at the fax number set out on the first page of the Letter of Transmittal.  The completed and executed Letter of Transmittal must be received by the Fund, either by mail or by fax, no later than 11:59 PM, Eastern time, on  Notice Date.  The Fund recommends that all documents be submitted to the Fund by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by facsimile transmission. A Shareholder choosing to fax a Letter of Transmittal must also send or deliver the original completed and executed Letter of Transmittal to BNY Mellon Investment Servicing promptly thereafter.  Note that, notwithstanding the foregoing, certain Shareholders may be required to deliver their Letter of Transmittal to their financial consultant (instead of directly to BNY Mellon Investment Servicing).  All Shareholders tendering Shares should carefully review their Letter of Transmittal and follow the delivery instructions therein.Any Shareholder tendering
Shares pursuant to the Offer may withdraw its tender as described above in Item 4(a)(1)(vi).  To be effective, any notice of withdrawal must be timely received by the Fund at the address or fax number set out on the first page of the Letter of Transmittal or must be otherwise accepted by the Fund prior to the Valuation Date.  A tender of Shares properly withdrawn shall not thereafter be deemed to be tendered for purposes of the Offer.  Shares withdrawn may be re-tendered, however, provided that such tenders are made before the Notice Date by following the tender procedures described above.(viii)    For purposes of the Offer, the Fund will be deemed to have accepted a Shareholder’s tender of Shares as, if, and when it gives written notice to the tendering Shareholder of its acceptance of such Shareholder’s tender of such Shares.(ix)    If
Shares in excess of 25% of the net asset value of the Fund are duly tendered to the Fund (and not withdrawn) on or before the Notice Date, the Fund, in its sole discretion, may do any of the following:  (a) accept the additional Shares permitted to be accepted pursuant to Rule 13e-4(f)(3) under the 1934 Act; and (b) accept Shares tendered (and not withdrawn) on or before the Notice Date for payment on a pro rata basis based on the aggregate net asset value of tendered Shares.  The Offer may be amended or canceled in various other circumstances described in Item 4(a)(1)(v) above.(x)    The purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer will have the effect of increasing the proportionate interest in the Fund of Shareholders not tendering Shares.  Shareholders retaining their Shares may be subject to increased risks which may possibly result
from the reduction in the Fund’s aggregate assets due to the Fund’s payment for the Shares tendered.  These risks include the potential for greater volatility due to decreased diversification.  The Fund believes that this result is unlikely, however, given the nature of the Fund’s investment program.  A reduction in the aggregate assets of the Fund may result in those Shareholders not tendering Shares bearing higher costs to the extent that certain relatively fixed expenses borne by the Fund may not decrease if assets decline.  These effects may be reduced or eliminated to the extent that additional subscriptions for Shares are made by new and existing Shareholders from time to time.(xi)    Not applicable.(xii)    The following discussion is a general summary of the federal income tax consequences
of the purchase of Shares by the Fund from Shareholders pursuant to the Offer.  7Shareholders should consult their own tax advisors for a complete description of the tax consequences to them of a purchase of their Shares by the Fund pursuant to the Offer.In general, a Shareholder from which the Fund purchases Shares will be treated either as having engaged in a “sale or exchange” of such Shares or having received a distribution from the Fund potentially subject to treatment as a “dividend.”  See Section 10 of Exhibit B below for further details regarding the possibility of alternative tax treatment in connection with the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer.  Section 10 of Exhibit B also discusses the tax treatment of Non-U.S. resident Shareholders. (2)    Not
applicable.(b)    Any Shares to be purchased from any affiliate, officer, or member of the Board of Trustees, of the Fund will be on the same terms and conditions as any other purchase of Shares.ITEM 5.PAST CONTRACTS, TRANSACTIONS, NEGOTIATIONS, AND AGREEMENTSThe Prospectus provides that the Board of Trustees has the discretion to determine whether the Fund will purchase Shares from Shareholders from time to time pursuant to written tenders.  The Prospectus also states that the Advisor expects that it will recommend to the Board of Trustees that the Fund purchase Shares from Shareholders quarterly. The Fund commenced
operations on January 4, 2016. The Fund is not aware of any contract, arrangement, understanding, or relationship (whether or not legally enforceable) relating directly or indirectly to the Offer between (i) the Fund, the Advisor, Sub-Advisor, the Board of Trustees, or any person controlling the Fund, the Advisor, the Sub-Advisor or the Board of Trustees and (ii) any other person, with respect to the Shares.ITEM 6.PURPOSES OF THIS TENDER OFFER AND PLANS OR PROPOSALS(a)    As contemplated by, and in accordance with, the procedures set out in the Prospectus, the purpose
of the Offer is to provide liquidity to Shareholders.(b)    Shares tendered to the Fund in connection with this Offer will be retired, although the Fund offers Shares in a continuous public offering, conducted pursuant to an effective Registration Statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, in accordance with the Prospectus.  Shares may be purchased on a monthly basis at the Fund’s then current net asset value per Share.(c)    None of the Fund, the Advisor, the Sub-Advisor and the Board of Trustees has any plans or proposals which relate to, or would result in:  (1) the acquisition by any person of additional Shares (other than the Fund’s intended continued acceptance of subscriptions for Shares on a monthly basis and from time to time) or the disposition of Shares (other than through
periodic purchase offers, including this Offer); (2) an extraordinary transaction involving the Fund, such as a merger, reorganization, or liquidation; (3) any material change in the present indebtedness, capitalization, or distribution policy of the Fund; (4) any change in the present Board of Trustees or in the management of the Fund including without limitation any change in the number or the term of 8members of the Board of Trustees, the filling of any existing vacancy on the Board of Trustees, or any change in any material term of the employment contract of any executive officer; (5) a purchase, sale, or transfer of a material amount of assets of the Fund (other than as the Board of Trustees determines may be necessary or appropriate to fund all or a portion of the purchase amount for Shares acquired pursuant to the Offer
or in connection with the ordinary portfolio transactions of the Fund); (6) any other material change in the Fund’s corporate structure or business, including any material change in any of its investment policies, for which a vote would be required by Section 13 of the 1940 Act; or (7) any change in the Declaration of Trust or other governing instruments or any other action which could impede the acquisition of control of the Fund.  Because Shares are not traded in any market, paragraphs (6), (7), and (8) of Regulation M-A § 229.1006(c) are not applicable to the Fund.ITEM 7.SOURCE AND AMOUNT OF FUNDS OR OTHER CONSIDERATION(a)    The Fund expects that the amount
offered for the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer, which will not exceed 25% of the net asset value of the Fund (unless the Fund elects to purchase a greater amount), will be paid from one or more of the following sources:  (i) cash on hand; (ii) the proceeds of the sale of securities and portfolio assets held by the Fund; and (iii) possibly borrowings, as described in paragraph (d) below. (b)    There are no material conditions to the financing of the transaction.  There are currently no alternative financing plans or arrangements for the transaction.(c)    Not applicable.(d)    None of the Fund, the Advisor, the Sub-Advisor and the Board of Trustees has determined at this time to borrow funds
to purchase Shares tendered in connection with the Offer.  Depending on the dollar amount of Shares tendered and prevailing general economic and market conditions, however, the Fund, in its sole discretion, may decide to seek to borrow money to fund all or a portion of the purchase amount for Shares, subject to compliance with applicable law.  The Fund expects that the repayment of any amounts borrowed will be financed from additional funds contributed to the Fund by new or existing Shareholders or from proceeds of the sale of securities and portfolio assets held by the Fund.ITEM 8.INTEREST IN SECURITIES OF THE ISSUER(a)    Ramius Advisors, LLC provided seed
capital to the Fund, and, as of the Prior NAV Calculation Date, it and its affiliates owned $10,157,400 of the value of the Shares, representing approximately 79% of the Fund’s net assets. John Humphrey and Jeffrey Jacob, the founding principals of Archview Investment Group LP, also provided seed capital to the Fund.  As of the Prior NAV Calculation Date, Mr. Humphrey and Mr. Jacob owned, in the aggregate, $2,052,000 of the value of the Shares, representing approximately 16% of the Fund’s net assets.(b)    There have been no transactions involving Shares effected during the past 60 days by the Fund, the Advisor, the Sub-Advisor any member of the Board of Trustees, or any person controlling the Fund, the Advisor or the Sub-Advisor.9ITEM
9.PERSONS/ASSETS RETAINED, EMPLOYED, COMPENSATED, OR USEDNo persons have been directly or indirectly employed or retained, or are to be compensated, by the Fund to make solicitations or recommendations in connection with the Offer.ITEM 10.FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(a)    (1)    Not applicable. (2)    The Fund is not required to, and does not, file quarterly unaudited financial statements under the 1934 Act.(3)    Not
applicable.(4)    See (a)(1) above.(b)    The Fund’s assets will be reduced by the amount of the tendered Shares purchased by the Fund pursuant to this Offer.

the “Prospectus”), the purpose of this Offer is to provide liquidity to Shareholders.  The Prospectus which was provided to each Shareholder in advance of subscribing for Shares provides that the Board of Trustees has the discretion to determine whether the Fund will purchase Shares from time to time from Shareholders pursuant to written tenders.  The Fund expects that the Board of Trustees will authorize the Fund to purchase Shares from Shareholders quarterly. The Fund commenced operations on January 4, 2016. Because there is no secondary trading market for Shares, the Board of Trustees has determined to cause the Fund to make this Offer, after consideration of various matters, including without limitation those set out in the Prospectus and the recommendations of the Advisor.  The Advisor intends to recommend to the Board of Trustees that the Fund offer to purchase
Shares on a quarterly basis each year, but the Board of Trustees may determine not to accept such recommendations from time to time.The purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer will have the effect of increasing the proportionate interest in the Fund of Shareholders not tendering Shares.  Shareholders retaining their Shares may be subject to increased risks which may possibly result from the reduction in the Fund’s aggregate assets due to the Fund’s payment for the Shares tendered.  These risks include the potential for greater volatility due to decreased diversification.  The Fund believes that this result is unlikely, however, given the nature of the Fund’s investment program.  A reduction in the aggregate assets of the Fund may result in those Shareholders not tendering Shares bearing higher costs to the extent that certain relatively fixed expenses borne by the Fund may not decrease if assets decline.  These effects may
be reduced or eliminated to the extent that additional subscriptions for Shares are made by new and existing Shareholders from time to time. Payment for any Shares purchased pursuant to this Offer may also require the Fund to liquidate portfolio holdings earlier than the Advisor would otherwise have caused these holdings to be liquidated, potentially resulting in losses or increased investment-related expenses.Valuation Date 12/31/2016        B-6Shares tendered to the Fund in connection with this Offer will be retired, although the Fund offers Shares in a continuous public offering, conducted pursuant to an effective Registration Statement under the Securities Act of 1933, in accordance with the Prospectus.  Shares may be purchased monthly at the Fund’s then current net asset value per Share.The
tender of Shares by a Shareholder will not affect the record ownership of such Shareholder for purposes of voting or entitlement to any distributions payable by the Fund unless and until such Shares are purchased.  You should also realize that the Offer is set to expire on the Notice Date and that, if you desire to tender Shares for purchase, you must do so by the Notice Date.  With respect to the Shares you are tendering which are accepted for purchase by the Fund, you remain a Shareholder of the Fund through the Valuation Date, when the net asset value of your Shares is calculated.3.OFFER TO PURCHASE AND PRICE.The Fund will, on the terms, and subject to the conditions, of the
Offer, purchase an amount of Shares up to 25% of the net asset value of the Fund, tendered by Shareholders, by 11:59 PM, Eastern time, on the Notice Date and not withdrawn (as provided in Section 6 below) before 11:59 PM, Eastern time, on the Notice Date).  After the Notice Date, the Fund in its discretion may permit the withdrawal of tenders at any time prior to the Valuation Date.  The Fund reserves the right to amend or cancel the Offer as described in Sections 4 and 8 below.  The value of each Share tendered for purchase will be the net asset value per Share as of the Valuation Date, payable as set out in Section 7.  The determination of the net asset value per Share as of the Valuation Date is subject to adjustment based upon the results of the next annual audit of the Fund’s financial statements.4.AMOUNT
OF TENDER.Subject to the limitations set out below, Shareholders may tender some or all of their Shares.  Each Shareholder tendering less than all of its Shares should keep in mind that the Fund reserves the right to repurchase all of a Shareholder’s Shares at any time if the aggregate value of such shareholder’s Shares is, at the time of such compulsory repurchase, less than $10,000.  (This right of the Fund to repurchase Shares compulsorily maybe a factor which Shareholders may wish to consider when determining the extent of any tender for purchase by the Fund).  The Offer is being made to all Shareholders of the Fund and is not conditioned on any minimum amount of Shares being tendered.If the amount of Shares properly tendered pursuant to the Offer and not withdrawn pursuant to Section 6 below
is less than or equal to 25% of the net asset value of the Fund (or such greater amount as the Fund may elect to purchase pursuant to the Offer), the Fund will, on the terms, and subject to the conditions, of the Offer, purchase all of the Shares so tendered unless the Fund elects to cancel or amend the Offer or to postpone acceptance of tenders made pursuant to the Offer, as provided in Section 8 below.  If Shares in excess of 25% of the net asset value of the Fund are duly tendered to the Fund (and not withdrawn) on or before the Notice Date pursuant to Section 6 below, the Fund, in its sole discretion, may do any of the following:  (a) accept the additional Shares permitted to be accepted pursuant to Rule 13e-4(f)(3) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “1934 Act”); and (b) accept Shares tendered (and not withdrawn) on or before the Notice Date for payment on a pro rata basis based on the aggregate
net asset value of tendered Valuation Date 12/31/2016        B-7Shares.  The Offer may be amended or canceled in various other circumstances described in Section 8 below.5.PROCEDURE FOR TENDERS.Shareholders wishing to tender Shares pursuant to this Offer to Purchase should send or deliver by the Notice Date a completed and executed Letter of Transmittal to the Fund, at the address set out on the first page of the Letter of Transmittal, or fax a completed and executed Letter of Transmittal to the Fund, at the fax number set out on the first
page of the Letter of Transmittal.  The completed and executed Letter of Transmittal must be received by the Fund, either by mail or by fax, no later than 11:59 PM, Eastern time, on the Notice Date.  A Shareholder choosing to fax a Letter of Transmittal must also send or deliver the original completed and executed Letter of Transmittal to BNY Mellon Investment Servicing promptly thereafter.  Note that, notwithstanding the foregoing, certain Shareholders may be required to deliver their Letter of Transmittal to their financial consultant (instead of directly to BNY Mellon Investment Servicing).  All Shareholders tendering Shares should carefully review their Letter of Transmittal and follow the delivery instructions therein.The Fund recommends that all documents be submitted to the Fund by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by facsimile transmission.  Shareholders wishing to confirm receipt of a Letter of Transmittal
may contact the Fund at the address or telephone number set out on the first page of the Letter of Transmittal.  The method of delivery of any documents is at the election, and complete risk, of the Shareholder tendering Shares, which may include without limitation the failure of the Fund to receive any Letter of Transmittal or other document submitted by facsimile transmission.  All questions as to the validity, form, eligibility (including time of receipt), and acceptance of tenders will be determined by the Fund, in its sole discretion, and such determination will be final and binding.  The Fund reserves the absolute right to reject any or all tenders determined by it not to be in appropriate form or the acceptance of, or payment for, which would, in the opinion of counsel for the Fund, be unlawful.  The Fund also reserves the absolute right to waive any of the conditions of the Offer or any defect in any tender with respect to any particular Shares or any particular
Shareholder, and the Fund’s interpretation of the terms and conditions of the Offer will be final and binding.  Unless waived, any defects or irregularities in connection with tenders must be cured within such time as the Fund will determine.  Tenders will not be deemed to have been made until the defects or irregularities have been cured or waived.  None of the Fund, the Advisor, the Sub-Advisor or the Board of Trustees will be obligated to give notice of any defects or irregularities in tenders, nor will any of them incur any liability for failure to give such notice.6.WITHDRAWAL RIGHTS.The Prospectus provides that a tender of Shares may be withdrawn by a Shareholder at any time
before 11:59 PM, Eastern time, on the Notice Date.  After the Notice Date, the Fund in its discretion may permit the withdrawal of tenders at any time prior to the Valuation Date.  Shares withdrawn may be re-tendered, however, provided that such tenders are made before the Notice Date by following the tender procedures described in Section 5.  Pursuant to Rule 13e‑4(f)(2)(ii) of the 1934 Act, if the Fund has not yet accepted a Shareholder’s tender of Shares on or before the Acceptance Date, a Shareholder will also have the right to withdraw its tender of its Shares after such date.  To Valuation Date 12/31/2016        B-8be effective, any notice of withdrawal must be timely received by the Fund at the address or fax number set out on the first page of the Letter of Transmittal
or must be otherwise accepted by the Fund prior to the Valuation Date.  All questions as to the form and validity (including time of receipt) of notices of withdrawal will be determined by the Fund, in its sole discretion, and such determination will be final and binding.  A tender of Shares properly withdrawn will not thereafter be deemed to be tendered for purposes of the Offer.7.PURCHASES AND PAYMENT.For purposes of the Offer, the Fund will be deemed to have accepted a Shareholder’s tender of tendered Shares as, if, and when it gives written notice to the tendering Shareholder of its acceptance of such Shareholder’s tender of such Shares.  As stated in
Section 3 above, the amount offered for the Shares tendered by Shareholders will be the net asset value thereof as of the Valuation Date.  The value of the Fund’s net assets is determined as of the close of the Fund’s business at the end of each month in accordance with procedures as may be determined from time to time in accordance with the valuation policies and procedures adopted by the Board of Trustees.  The Fund will not pay interest on the purchase amount.The Fund will make payment for Shares it purchases pursuant to the Offer from one or more of the following sources:  (a) cash on hand; (b) the proceeds of the sale of securities and portfolio assets held by the Fund; and (c) possibly borrowings.  None of the Fund, the Advisor, the Sub-Advisor or the Board of Trustees has determined at this time to borrow funds to purchase Shares tendered in connection with the Offer.  Depending on the dollar amount of Shares tendered
and prevailing general economic and market conditions, however, the Fund, in its sole discretion, may decide to fund any portion of the amount offered for the purchase of Shares, subject to compliance with applicable law, through borrowings.  The Fund expects that the repayment of any amounts so borrowed will be financed from additional funds contributed to the Fund by new and existing Shareholders or from the proceeds of the sale of securities held by the Fund.8.CERTAIN CONDITIONS OF THE OFFER.The Fund reserves the right, at any time and from time to time up to and including the Valuation Date:  (a) to cancel the Offer in the circumstances set out in the following paragraph, and,
in the event of such cancellation, not to purchase, or pay for, any Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer; (b) to amend the Offer; or (c) to postpone the acceptance of Shares.  If the Fund determines to amend the Offer or to postpone the acceptance of Shares tendered, it will, to the extent necessary, extend the period of time during which the Offer is open as provided above and will promptly notify Shareholders.The Fund may cancel the Offer, amend the Offer, or postpone the acceptance of tenders made pursuant to the Offer, if: (a) the Fund would not be able to liquidate portfolio securities in an orderly manner consistent with the Fund’s investment objectives and policies in order to purchase Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer; (b) there is, in the judgment of the Board of Trustees, any (i) legal action or proceeding instituted or threatened challenging the Offer or otherwise materially adversely affecting the Fund, (ii)
declaration of a banking moratorium by federal or state authorities, or suspension of payment by banks in the United States or New York State, which is material to the Valuation Date 12/31/2016        B-9Fund, (iii) limitation imposed by federal or state authorities on the extension of credit by lending institutions, (iv) suspension of trading on any organized exchange or over-the-counter market where the Fund has a material investment, (v) commencement of war, armed hostilities, or other international or national calamity directly or indirectly involving the United States which is material to the Fund, (vi) material decrease in the net asset value of the Fund from the net asset value of the Fund most recently calculated as of the Commencement Date, or (vii) other event or condition which would have a material adverse effect
on the Fund or its Shareholders if Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer were purchased; or (c) the Board of Trustees determines that it is not in the best interest of the Fund to purchase Shares pursuant to the Offer.9.CERTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT THE FUND.The Fund is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”) as a closed-end, non-diversified, management investment company.  It was organized as a Delaware statutory trust on March 11, 2015.  The Fund’s principal office is located at 599 Lexington Avenue, 19th Floor, New
York, NY 10022, and its telephone number is (877) 672-6487.  Shares are not traded on any established trading market and are subject to strict restrictions on transferability pursuant to the Declaration of Trust.None of the Fund, the Advisor, the Sub-Advisor or the Board of Trustees has any plans or proposals which relate to, or would result in:  (1) the acquisition by any person of additional Shares (other than the Fund’s intended continued acceptance of subscriptions for Shares on a monthly basis and from time to time) or the disposition of Shares (other than through periodic purchase offers, including this Offer); (2) an extraordinary transaction involving the
Fund, such as a merger, reorganization, or liquidation; (3) any material change in the present indebtedness, capitalization, or distribution policy of the Fund; (4) any change in the present Board of Trustees or in the management of the Fund, including without limitation any change in the number or the term of members of the Board of Trustees, the filling of any existing vacancy on the Board of Trustees, or any change in any material term of the employment contract of any executive officer; (5) a purchase, sale, or transfer of a material amount of assets of the Fund (other than as the Board of Trustees determines may be necessary or appropriate to fund all or a portion of the amount offered for the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer or in connection with the ordinary portfolio transactions of the Fund); (6) any other material change in the Fund’s corporate structure or business, including any material change in any of its investment policies, for which a vote would
be required by Section 13 of the 1940 Act; or (7) any change in the Declaration of Trust or other governing instruments or any other action which could impede the acquisition of control of the Fund.There have been no transactions involving Shares that were effected during the past 60 days by the Fund, the Advisor, Sub-Advisor, any member of the Board of Trustees, or any person controlling the Fund, the Advisor or the Sub-Advisor.10.CERTAIN FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES.The following discussion is a general summary of the federal income tax consequences of the purchase of Shares by the Fund from Shareholders pursuant to the Offer.  Shareholders
should consult their own tax advisors with respect to the specific tax consequences applicable to them Valuation Date 12/31/2016        B-10associated with a purchase of their Shares by the Fund pursuant to the Offer, including the effect and applicability of state, local, foreign and other tax laws and the possible effects of changes in federal or other tax laws.In general, the purchase of Shares from a Shareholder pursuant to the Offer will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, either as a “sale or exchange,” or under certain circumstances, as a “dividend.” Under Section 302(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), a purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer generally will be treated as a “sale or exchange”
if the receipt of cash by the Shareholder in exchange for the Shares: (a) results in a “complete termination” of the Shareholder's interest in the Fund, (b) is “substantially disproportionate” with respect to the Shareholder, or (c) is “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” with respect to the Shareholder. In determining whether any of these tests has been met, Shares actually owned, as well as Shares considered to be owned by the Shareholder by reason of certain constructive ownership rules set forth in Section 318 of the Code, generally must be taken into account. If any of these three tests for “sale or exchange” treatment is met, a Shareholder will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the price paid by the Fund for the Shares repurchased in the Offer and the Shareholder's adjusted tax basis in such Shares. If such Shares are held as a capital asset, the gain or loss will generally be capital gain or loss. The maximum
tax rate applicable to capital gains recognized by individuals and other non-corporate taxpayers is generally (i) the same as the applicable ordinary income rate for capital assets held for one year or less or (ii) either 15% or 20% for capital assets held for more than one year, depending on whether the individual’s income exceeds certain threshold amounts. If the requirements of Section 302(b) of the Code are not met, amounts received by a Shareholder in exchange for the Shares repurchased pursuant to the Offer will be taxable to the Shareholder as a “dividend” to the extent of such Shareholder’s allocable portion of the Fund’s current or accumulated earnings and profits. To the extent that amounts received exceed a Shareholder’s allocable portion of the Fund’s current and accumulated earnings and profits, such excess will constitute a non-taxable return of capital (to the extent of such Shareholder’s then adjusted
tax basis in the Shares), and any amounts in excess of such Shareholder’s adjusted tax basis will constitute taxable capital gain. Any remaining adjusted tax basis in the Shares tendered to the Fund will be transferred to any remaining Shares held by such Shareholder. In addition, if a purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer is treated as a “dividend” to a tendering Shareholder, a constructive dividend under Section 305(c) of the Code may result to a non-tendering Shareholder whose proportionate interest in the earnings and assets of the Fund has been increased by such tender.The Fund generally will be required to withhold tax at the rate of 28% (“backup withholding”) from any payment to a tendering Shareholder that is an individual (or certain other non-corporate persons) if the Shareholder fails to provide its correct taxpayer identification number to the Fund or otherwise establish an exemption from the backup
withholding tax rules. Backup withholding is not an additional tax, and any amounts withheld may be credited against a Shareholder’s U.S. federal income tax liability.The U.S. federal income taxation of a Non-U.S. resident Shareholder arising from a purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer depends on whether this transaction is “effectively connected” with a Valuation Date 12/31/2016        B-11trade or business carried on in the U.S. by the Non-U.S. resident Shareholder (and if an income tax treaty applies, on whether the Non-U.S. resident Shareholder maintains a U.S. permanent establishment) as well as the tax characterization of the transaction as either a sale of the Shares or a dividend distribution by the Fund, as discussed above. If the purchase of Shares pursuant to
the Offer is not so effectively connected (or, if an income tax treaty applies, a Non-U.S. resident Shareholder does not maintain a U.S. permanent establishment) and if such purchase is subject to “sale or exchange” rather than dividend treatment, any gain realized by a Non-U.S. resident Shareholder upon the tender of Shares pursuant to the Offer will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax or to any U.S. tax withholding; provided, however, that such a gain will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the rate of 30% (or such lower rate as may be applicable under an income tax treaty) if the Non-U.S. resident Shareholder is a non-resident alien individual who is physically present in the United States for more than 183 days during the taxable year of the sale. If, however, a Non-U.S. resident Shareholder is considered, for the reasons described above, to have received a distribution potentially subject to treatment as a dividend from the Fund with respect to
Shares tendered, the portion of the distribution treated as a dividend to the Non-U.S. resident Shareholder would be subject to a U.S. withholding tax at the rate of 30% (or such lower rate as may be applicable under an income tax treaty) if the dividend is not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by the Non-U.S. resident Shareholder.  If the amount realized on the tender of Shares by a Non-U.S. resident Shareholder is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by the Non-U.S. resident Shareholder (and, if an income tax treaty applies, and the Non-U.S. resident Shareholder maintains a U.S. permanent establishment), regardless of whether the tender is characterized as a sale or as giving rise to a dividend distribution from the Fund for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the transaction will be treated and taxed in the same manner as if the Shares involved were tendered by a U.S. Shareholder.  Any
dividends received by a corporate Non-U.S. resident Shareholder that are effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business in which the corporate shareholder is engaged (and if an income tax treaty applies, are attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the corporate Non-U.S. resident Shareholder) also may be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a 30% rate, or lower applicable treaty rate.Non-U.S. resident Shareholders should provide the Fund with a properly completed Form W-8BEN, Form W-8BEN-E, Form W-8IMY, Form W-8ECI, Form W-8EXP or other applicable U.S. nonresident withholding tax certification in order to avoid backup withholding on the cash they receive from the Fund regardless of how they are taxed with respect to the Shares purchased pursuant to the Offer.  A foreign financial institution or non-financial foreign entity that tenders Shares that are accepted for purchase pursuant to the Offer
will generally be subject to withholding tax imposed under Sections 1471 to 1474 of the Code (such Code sections commonly referred to as the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, or “FATCA”) and applicable U.S. Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder at a rate of 30% of the gross proceeds payable to such foreign financial institution or non-financial foreign entity unless such foreign financial institution or non-financial foreign entity provides to the applicable withholding agent a properly completed Form W-8BEN, Form W-8BEN-E, Form W-8IMY, Form W-8ECI, Form W-8EXP or other applicable U.S. nonresident withholding tax certification demonstrating that FATCA withholding is not required. If the applicable withholding agent withholds tax under FATCA, it will not also withhold the 30% U.S. federal income Valuation Date 12/31/2016        B-12tax
described above.  Non-U.S. resident Shareholders are urged to consult their own tax advisors to determine the effect, if any, of FATCA on their participation in the Offer.11.MISCELLANEOUS.The Offer is not being made to, nor will tenders be accepted from, Shareholders in any jurisdiction in which the Offer or its acceptance would not comply with the securities or other laws of such jurisdiction.  The Fund is not aware of any jurisdiction in which the Offer, or tenders pursuant thereto, would not be in compliance with the laws of such jurisdiction.  The Fund reserves the right, however, to exclude Shareholders from the Offer in any jurisdiction in which it is asserted that the Offer
cannot lawfully be made.  The Fund believes such exclusion is permissible under applicable laws and regulations, provided that the Fund makes a good faith effort to comply with any state law deemed applicable to the Offer.The Fund has filed an Issuer Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which includes certain information relating to this Offer.  A free copy of such statement may be obtained by contacting the Fund at the address and telephone number set out on the first page of the Letter of Transmittal or from the Securities and Exchange Commission’s internet website, http://www.sec.gov.

Applicants' Representations
1. The Fund is a continuously offered closed-end management investment company registered under the Act and organized as a Delaware statutory trust. The Fund currently serves as the master fund in a master-feeder structure with one feeder fund.[1] 
           If the requested relief is granted, the feeder fund will be dissolved promptly and the Fund will no longer operate within a master-feeder structure.[2] 
           The Fund's investment objective is to seek to generate consistent, total returns while minimizing the risk of loss. The Fund intends to pursue its investment objective by investing primarily in debt and equity securities, loans, trade claims and derivative instruments of leveraged or financially distressed companies. In addition, the Fund will typically take long and short positions in securities, loans and derivatives.
2. The Adviser, a Delaware limited liability company, is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (“Advisers Act”). The Adviser serves as investment adviser to the Fund. Foreside Fund Services, LLC, a broker-dealer registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“1934 Act”), acts as the distributor of the Fund.
3. The Fund continuously offers its Shares [3] 
           to investors that represent that they are “qualified clients” within the meaning of Rule 205-3 under the Advisers Act (“Qualified Clients”). Shares of the Fund are not listed on any securities exchange and do not trade on an over-the-counter system such as NASDAQ. Applicants do not expect that any secondary market will develop for the Shares.
4. The Fund currently offers a single class of Shares (the “Initial Class”) at net asset value per share without a sales load and without an annual asset-based service and/or distribution fee. The Fund proposes to issue multiple classes of Shares and specifically proposes to offer a new Share class (the “New Class”): (1) Only to Qualified Clients; (2) at net asset value plus a front-end sales load of up to 3%; and (3) subject to an annual distribution/shareholder fee of 0.75%. The front-end sales load and annual distribution/shareholder servicing fee to be charged to the New Class Shares will be the same as those currently charged to the feeder fund Shares. The Fund intends to continue to offer Initial Class Shares, without a sales load and without a service and/or distribution fee.
5. In order to provide a limited degree of liquidity to shareholders, the Fund may from time to time offer to repurchase Shares, in an amount not to exceed 25% of the Fund's net asset value, at their then current net asset value in accordance with rule 13e-4 under the 1934 Act pursuant to written tenders by shareholders.[4] 
           Repurchases will be made at such times, in such amounts and on such terms as may be determined by the Fund's board of trustees (“Board”), in its sole discretion.[5] 
           Repurchases will not commence for at least six months following the date of the initial closing for subscriptions for Shares. Following such date, the Adviser will recommend to the Board (subject to its discretion) that the Fund offer to repurchase Shares from shareholders on a quarterly basis.
6. Applicants request that the order also apply to any other continuously offered registered closed-end management investment company existing now or in the future for which the Adviser or any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Adviser acts as investment adviser and which provides periodic liquidity with respect to its Shares through tender offers conducted in compliance with rule 13e-4 under the 1934 Act.[6] 

7. Applicants represent that any asset-based service and/or distribution fees will comply with the provisions of rule 2830(d) of the Conduct Rules of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (“NASD Conduct Rule 2830”) as if that rule applied to the Fund.[7] 
           Applicants also represent that the Fund will disclose in its prospectus, the fees, expenses and other characteristics of each class of Shares offered for sale by the prospectus as is required for open-end multiple class funds under Form N-1A. As is required for open-end funds, the Fund will disclose its expenses in shareholder reports, and disclose any arrangements that result in breakpoints in or elimination of sales loads in its prospectus.[8] 
           The Fund will also comply with any requirements that may be adopted by the Commission or FINRA regarding disclosure at the point of sale and in transaction confirmations about the costs and conflicts of interest arising out of the distribution of open-end investment company shares, and regarding prospectus disclosure of sales loads and revenue sharing arrangements as if those requirements applied to the Fund and the Distributor.[9] 
           The Fund will contractually require that the Distributor and any other distributor of the Fund's Shares comply with such requirements in connection with the distribution of Shares of the Fund.
8. The Fund will allocate all expenses incurred by it among the various classes of Shares based on the net assets of the Fund attributable to each class, except that the net asset value and expenses of each class will reflect distribution fees, service fees, and any other incremental expenses of that class. Expenses of the Fund allocated to a particular class of Shares will be borne on a pro rata basis Start Printed Page 37656by each outstanding Share of that class. Applicants state that the Fund will comply with the provisions of rule 18f-3 under the Act as if it were an open-end investment company.
9. In the event the Fund imposes a CDSC, the applicants will comply with the provisions of rule 6c-10 under the Act, as if that rule applied to closed-end management investment companies. With respect to any waiver of, scheduled variation in, or elimination of the CDSC, the Fund will comply with rule 22d-1 under the Act as if the Fund were an open-end investment company.
Applicants' Legal Analysis
Multiple Classes of Shares
1. Section 18(c) of the Act provides, in relevant part, that a closed-end investment company may not issue or sell any senior security if, immediately thereafter, the company has outstanding more than one class of senior security. Applicants state that the creation of multiple classes of Shares of the Fund may be prohibited by section 18(c).
2. Section 18(i) of the Act provides that each share of stock issued by a registered management investment company will be a voting stock and have equal voting rights with every other outstanding voting stock. Applicants state that permitting multiple classes of Shares of the Fund may violate section 18(i) of the Act because each class would be entitled to exclusive voting rights with respect to matters solely related to that class.
3. Section 6(c) of the Act provides that the Commission may exempt any person, security or transaction or any class or classes of persons, securities or transactions from any provision of the Act, or from any rule under the Act, if and to the extent such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Applicants request an exemption under section 6(c) from sections 18(c) and 18(i) to permit the Fund to issue multiple classes of Shares.
4. Applicants submit that the proposed allocation of expenses and voting rights among multiple classes is equitable and will not discriminate against any group or class of shareholders. Applicants submit that the proposed arrangements would permit the Fund to facilitate the distribution of its Shares and provide investors with a broader choice of shareholder options. Applicants assert that the proposed closed-end investment company multiple class structure does not raise the concerns underlying section 18 of the Act to any greater degree than open-end investment companies' multiple class structures that are permitted by rule 18f-3 under the Act. Applicants state that the Fund will comply with the provisions of rule 18f-3 as if it were an open-end investment company.
 CDSCs
Applicants believe that the requested relief meets the standards of section 6(c) of the Act. Rule 6c-10 under the Act permits open-end investment companies to impose CDSCs, subject to certain conditions. Applicants state that any CDSC imposed by the Fund will comply with rule 6c-10 under the Act as if the rule were applicable to closed-end investment companies. The Fund also will disclose CDSCs in accordance with the requirements of Form N-1A concerning CDSCs as if the Fund were an open-end investment company. Applicants further state that the Fund will apply the CDSC (and any waivers, scheduled variations or eliminations of the CDSC) uniformly to all shareholders in a given class and consistently with the requirements of rule 22d-1 under the Act.
Asset-Based Service and/or Distribution Fees
1. Section 17(d) of the Act and rule 17d-1 under the Act prohibit an affiliated person of a registered investment company or an affiliated person of such person, acting as principal, from participating in or effecting any transaction in connection with any joint enterprise or joint arrangement in which the investment company participates unless the Commission issues an order permitting the transaction. In reviewing applications submitted under section 17(d) and rule 17d-1, the Commission considers whether the participation of the investment company in a joint enterprise or joint arrangement is consistent with the provisions, policies and purposes of the Act, and the extent to which the participation is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants.
2. Rule 17d-3 under the Act provides an exemption from section 17(d) and rule 17d-1 to permit open-end investment companies to enter into distribution arrangements pursuant to rule 12b-1 under the Act. Applicants request an order under section 17(d) and rule 17d-1 under the Act to permit the Fund to impose asset-based service and/or distribution fees. Applicants have agreed to comply with rules 12b-1 and 17d-3 as if those rules applied to closed-end investment companies.
Applicants' Condition
The applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief will be subject to the following condition:
Applicants will comply with the provisions of rules 6c-10, 12b-1, 17d-3, 18f-3 and 22d-1 under the Act, as amended from time to time or replaced, as if those rules applied to closed-end management investment companies, and will comply with NASD Conduct Rule 2830, as amended from time to time, as if that rule applied to all closed-end management investment companies.
