This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations includes a number of forward-looking statements that reflect
Management's current views with respect to future events and financial
performance. You can identify these statements by forward-looking words such as
"may" "will," "expect," "anticipate," "believe," "estimate" and "continue," or
similar words. Those statements include statements regarding the intent, belief
or current expectations of us and members of its management team as well as the
assumptions on which such statements are based. Prospective investors are
cautioned that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future
performance and involve risk and uncertainties, and that actual results may
differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements.



17






Readers are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made
by us in this report and in our other reports filed with the SEC. Important
factors currently known to Management could cause actual results to differ
materially from those in forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation
to update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect changed assumptions,
the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes in the future operating
results over time. We believe that its assumptions are based upon reasonable
data derived from and known about our business and operations and the business
and operations of the Company. No assurances are made that actual results of
operations or the results of our future activities will not differ materially
from its assumptions. Factors that could cause differences include, but are not
limited to, expected market demand for the Company's services, fluctuations in
pricing for materials, and competition.



Overview



We currently specialize in contracting services offering communications,
security and audio-visual infrastructure through its Suisun City Operations. We
previously announced that we launched the Texas Operations in San Antonio, Texas
in January 2016 and then commenced operations in Dallas, Texas in April 2016.
During the year ended April 30, 2017, the Texas Operations generated
approximately $1,006,000 in revenue, while incurring approximately $1,980,000 in
cost of revenue and selling, general and administrative expenses in starting
these two offices. During November 2016, we instituted some changes and cost
reductions in the Texas Operations staffing and related expenses to better align
our operational costs with short-term projected revenue expectations. We
initially anticipated expending approximately $750,000 to develop these markets
and the Texas Operations were taking longer than anticipated to begin generating
the expected level of revenue to warrant continued operation. Therefore, in late
December 2016, we decided to close the Texas Operations and, at the end of
February 2017, the San Antonio and Dallas offices were closed.



During the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we sold our joint venture interest in
the former China Operations and therefore, the financial results of the China
Operations for the year ended April 30, 2016, are included in the results from
discontinued operations in our financial statements.



Our Suisun City Operations communication infrastructure services offers low
voltage communications infrastructure contracting services to the public
services, healthcare, energy and corporate enterprise markets. We provide an
integrated approach to project coordination that creates cost-effective
solutions. Corporations, government entities, healthcare organizations and
educational institutions depend on the reliability and accuracy of voice, data
and video communications. However, the potential for this new technology cannot
be realized without the right infrastructure to support the convergence of
technology. In this regard, we create integrated building systems, including the
installation of advanced structured cabling systems. We specialize in wireless
technology and a combination of various technologies to develop a cost-effective
network for a customer's wireless communication requirements. This includes
Wi-Fi networks, point-to-point systems, cellular networks, in-building systems
and two-way communication systems. We support the integration of
telecommunications, life safety, security and HVAC and design for future growth
by building in additional capacity for expansion as new capabilities are added.



For the fiscal years ended April 30, 2017 and 2016, we generated revenues from
continuing operations of $16,737,000 and $14,555,000, respectively. Our backlog
at April 30, 2017 was $14,596,000 as compared to $13,200,000 at April 30, 2016.



Company Strategy



During the past two fiscal years, our strategy in the contracting services
segment included divesting certain operations through the sale of our China
Operations and closing of our Texas Operations.



18






We divested and/or closed these operations either because they were not
profitable, or were part of our plan to reduce expenses and liabilities, improve
operational performance, as well as to generate cash for working capital and
general corporate purposes.



Meanwhile, our ongoing plan continues to be to strengthen our balance sheet as
well as to increase revenue, profit and cash flow at our Suisun City Operations
and seeking viable acquisition and/or merger candidate(s).




After completing our restructuring plan in fiscal year 2016, we launched a
series of initiatives targeting revenue enhancement, including:
  · Strengthening our operations team with proven audio-visual professionals;
  · Uniformly deploying full-service low voltage capabilities for developing,
    installing and servicing structured cabling, audio-visual and security systems
    in our California market; and,




  · Developing strategic alliances with contractors who have significant presence
    in our geographic operating area.




We believe that these initiatives have the potential to improve the our business
and provide more opportunities for growth.




Historically, our Suisun City Operations operated primarily as a subcontractor
for low-voltage structured cabling systems, which were generally secured through
the competitive bidding process. We were not adequately positioned with the
resources to deliver a fully integrated offering to include audio-visual and
security. As a result, such opportunities had either been lost, or had to be
subcontracted to others. However, with the recent additions we have instituted,
we are now able to offer a full turnkey service in our Suisun City Operations
that will allow us to be fully engaged with our customers well after an initial
installation is completed.



In addition to broadening our contracting revenue potential and offering higher
margin recurring service capabilities, we are also pursuing and securing more
corporate affiliations and strategic alliances that have the potential to create
more direct relationships capable of advancing our business opportunities even
further.



Furthermore, we continue to aggressively explore other viable growth
opportunities.
Current Operating Trends and Financial Highlights




Management currently considers the following events, trends and uncertainties to
be important in understanding our results of operations and financial condition
during the current fiscal year:



19






With regards to our financial results from continuing operations for the year
ended April 30, 2017, we generated revenue of approximately $16,737,000 as
compared to revenue of $14,555,000 for the same period last year. This
$2,182,000 increase in revenue was due primarily to a $1,177,000 increase in
revenue attributable to our Suisun City Operations and a $1,005,000 increase in
revenue attributable to our Texas Operations (as previously mentioned, we have
closed our Texas Operations in the fourth quarter of 2017).



We generated a net loss to common stock shareholders for the year ended April
30, 2017 of approximately $2,256,000, or $.76 per share of common stock, which
includes approximately $1,037,000 of non-cash beneficial conversion dividends on
the Series H-2 Shares and the Series H-3 Shares. The non-cash dividends have no
impact on our operating income or cash flows. The net loss also includes a
$580,000 of non-cash compensation expense associated with the issuance of stock
options.



The net loss to common stock shareholders for the year ended April 30, 2017
compares to a net loss of approximately $8,270,000, or $3.61 per share of common
stock for the year ended April 30, 2016, which includes approximately $4,743,000
of non-cash dividends on Series F-1 and G-1 Preferred Stock and $744,000 of
non-cash beneficial conversion dividends on the Series H-1 Shares. The non-cash
charges were offset by $400,000 in non-cash gains recorded on Section 16
settlements. The non-cash charges and gains have no impact on our operating
income or cash flows. The net loss also includes a $838,000 gain loss from
discontinued operations from the sale of our China Operations.



The markets we serve in public services, healthcare, and energy continue to
afford opportunities to grow our business. Two of our most important economic
indicators for measuring our future revenue producing capability and demand for
our services continue to be our backlog and bid list. For comparative purposes,
our backlog and bid list for prior periods only includes our continuing
operations. Our backlog of unfilled orders was approximately $14,596,000 at
April 30, 2017, compared to backlog of $13,200,000 for the same period last
year. Our goal is to convert more items on our bid list into contract awards
which will increase our backlog in the quarters ahead.



We believe that our low voltage communication infrastructure contracting
services for public services, healthcare, energy and corporate enterprise
markets will create additional opportunities. We believe that the ability to
provide comprehensive communications infrastructure contracting services gives
us a competitive advantage. In regard to strategic development, our focus is on
organic growth opportunities and we feel optimistic about the markets we serve
as evidenced by our new contract awards and customers continuing to seek bids
from us, due to our experience in these markets.

Operating Loss



We had an operating loss of approximately $2,545,000 for year ended April 30,
2017. This operating loss was comprised primarily of $1,043,000 in operating
income from Suisun City Operations and which was offset by approximately
$2,602,000 of corporate overhead expenses, of which approximately $580,000
related to non-cash compensation expense recognized on the issuance of employee
stock options, and a $986,000 loss from the startup of our Texas Operations.



For the year ended April 30, 2016, we had an operating loss of approximately
$4,032,000 which was comprised primarily of $1,064,000 in operating income from
Suisun City Operations which was offset by approximately $4,813,000 of corporate
overhead expenses, of which approximately $2,439,000 related to non-cash
compensation expense recognized upon the issuance of employee stock options, a
$237,000 in expenses from the startup of our Texas Operations and a write-off of
our remaining Trenton Operations' assets of $47,000. The details of the
operating loss are as follows:



Revenue



Revenue for the year ended April 30, 2017, increased by approximately
$2,182,000, or 15%, to approximately $16,737,000, as compared to approximately
$14,555,000 for same period last year. The increase in revenue was due primarily
to a $1,177,000 increase in revenue in Suisun City Operations and a $1,005,000
increase in revenue from our Texas Operations. (We closed our Texas Operations
in the fourth quarter of 2017 and do not expect to have any further revenue from
that operation). The increased sales in the Suisun City Operations is due to an
increase in the number of contracts rather than adding a single large contract.



21






Cost of Revenue



Cost of revenue, which consists of direct costs on contracts: materials, direct
labor, third party subcontractor services, union benefits and other overhead
costs increased by approximately $1,323,000, or 11%, to approximately
$12,894,000, or 77% of revenue, for the year ended April 30, 2017, as compared
to approximately $11,570,000, or 79.5% of revenue, for the same period in 2016.
The decrease in the cost of revenue as a percentage of sales was due primarily
to attracting new contracts with lower subcontracting costs in the Suisun City
Operations.



Selling, General and Administrative Expenses




For the year ended April 30, 2017, total selling, general and administrative
expenses decreased by approximately $680,000, or 10%, to approximately
$6,272,000 as compared to $6,952,000 for the year ended April 30, 2016. The
decrease was primarily due to lower: (i) non-cash stock compensation expense of
approximately $1,859,000 for stock options issued; (ii) accounting and legal
fees of approximately $335,000; and (iii) various miscellaneous costs of
approximately $101,000, all of which were partially offset by higher: (i)
expenses in our Texas Operations of approximately $975,000; (ii) salary expenses
of approximately $354,000 and (iii) various miscellaneous costs of approximately
$334,000.



Depreciation and Amortization
For the year ended April 30, 2017, depreciation and amortization increased by
approximately $50,000, or 77%, to approximately $115,000 as compared to
approximately $65,000 for same period in 2016. The increase in expense was due
to the addition of computer equipment, automobiles and office furniture in the
San Antonio and Dallas offices.




Loss from Continuing Operations




We had a net loss from continuing operations of approximately $1,219,000 for the
year ended April 30, 2017 as compared to a net loss from continuing operations
of approximately $3,631,000 for the same period in 2016. Loss from continuing
operations is determined by adjusting the operating loss by the following items:



Interest Expense



For the years ended April 30, 2017 and 2016, interest expense was approximately
$7,000 and $3,000, respectively. The increase in interest expense in 2017 as
compared to the same period in 2016 is attributable to interest on automobile
loans.



Income from Section 16 Settlement




For the year ended April 30, 2016, we received income from Section 16
settlements of $400,000. This income was comprised of forgiveness of certain
promissory notes and receipt of cash as part of the settlements with certain
note holders who were defendants named in a Section 16 litigation brought by a
shareholder of the Company. These settlements resolved all issues related to
this litigation. There was no income from Section 16 settlements for the year
ended April 30, 2017.



Income from Arbitration and Other Settlements
During the year ended April 30, 2017, we received approximately $1,150,000 in
connection with a global settlement agreement and mutual release to resolve all
existing disputes and claims regarding the construction of the Cooper Medical
School at Rowan University, located in Camden, New Jersey, in which we served as
an electrical prime contractor.




During the year ended April 30, 2017, we received approximately $30,000 in
connection with a settlement of an outstanding contract in our Suisun City
Operations.



22






Other Income



For the years ended April 30, 2017 and 2016, other income was approximately
$143,000 compared to approximately $5,000, respectively. The increase in other
income in 2017 is primarily due to the negotiation and eventual reduction of
certain accounts payable balances.




Net Loss Attributable to WPCS Common Shareholders




We incurred a net loss attributable to WPCS common stock shareholders of
approximately $2,256,000 for the year ended April 30, 2017 as compared to a net
loss attributable to WPCS common stock shareholders of approximately $8,270,000
for the same period in 2016. The following items are the adjustments to the loss
from continuing operations that result in determining the net loss attributable
to WPCS common stock shareholders.




Gain from Discontinued Operations




As a result of the sale of our China Operations, we have recorded all activity
related to that subsidiaries as income from discontinued operations (see Note 13
- Discontinued Operations). The cumulative effect is net income of approximately
$865,000 for the year ended April 30, 2016. There was no activity from
discontinued operations for the year ended April 30, 2017.




Dividends Declared on Preferred Stock




As a result of the issuance of preferred stock, we declared dividends,
make-whole dividends, and deemed dividends of approximately $1,037,000 for the
year ended April 30, 2017 as compared to approximately $5,487,000 for the same
period in 2016. These dividends are non-cash and were either paid in shares of
common stock or result due to the calculation of a beneficial conversion feature
upon the issuance of preferred stock.



Effects of Inflation



Inflation has not had a material impact on our business.
Liquidity and Capital Resources as of April 30, 2017




As of April 30, 2017, we had a working capital surplus of approximately
$2,862,000, which consisted of current assets of approximately $6,811,000 and
current liabilities of approximately $3,949,000. The current liabilities as
presented in the audited balance sheet at April 30, 2017 primarily consist of
approximately $1,790,000 of accounts payable and accrued expenses, approximately
$2,106,000 of billings in excess of contract costs and approximately $52,000 of
short-term vehicle loans.



Our cash and cash equivalents balance at April 30, 2017 was approximately
$2,159,000 of which approximately $500,000 is classified as restricted cash.
Our operating activities used approximately $1,367,000 of cash for the year
ended April 30, 2017. The major components of the net cash used in operating
activities were the loss from operations of approximately $1,219,000, the
increase in accounts receivable of approximately $1,314,000, the reduction of
accounts payable of approximately $282,000 offset by an increase in the billings
in excess of costs of approximately $748,000 and the non-cash charge associated
with the issuance of stock options of approximately $602,000.




Our investing activities used cash of approximately $77,000, for the year ended
April 30, 2017, due to the purchase of equipment of approximately $77,000.
Our financing activities provided cash of approximately $1,368,000 for the
year ended April 30, 2017, primarily from the issuance of the Series H-2 Shares
and the Series H-3 Shares offset by payment to satisfy obligations under our
loan payable agreements.



Our future plans and growth are dependent on our ability to increase revenues
and continue our business development efforts surrounding our contract award
backlog. If we continue to incur losses and revenues do not generate from the
backlog as expected we may need to raise additional capital to continue as a
going concern. We currently anticipate that our cash and cash equivalents will
be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements, fund our operating
losses and capital expenditures for at least 12 months from the date of filing
this annual report. If in the future our plans or assumptions change or prove to
be inaccurate, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private
debt or equity offerings, financings, corporate collaborations, or other means.
We may also be required to reduce operating expenditures or investments in
its
infrastructure.



In addition, our Suisun Operations has a $1.0 million operating line of credit
which expires on August 15, 2017. It is our plan to renew that line of credit
for one year from the expiration date but there is no assurance that the line
will be renewed.



23






Backlog



As of April 30, 2017, we had a backlog of unfilled orders of approximately
$14,596,000 as compared to approximately $13,200,000 at April 30, 2016. We
define backlog as the value of work-in-hand to be provided for customers as of a
specific date where the following conditions are met (with the exception of
engineering change orders): (i) the price of the work to be done is fixed; (ii)
the scope of the work to be done is fixed, both in definition and amount; and
(iii) there is a written contract, purchase order, agreement or other
documentary evidence which represents a firm commitment by the customer to pay
us for the work to be performed. These backlog amounts are based on contract
values and purchase orders and may not result in actual receipt of revenue in
the originally anticipated period or at all.



We have experienced variances in the realization of our backlog because of
project delays or cancellations resulting from external market factors and
economic factors beyond our control and we may experience such delays or
cancellations in the future. Backlog does not include new firm commitments that
may be awarded to us by our customers from time to time in future periods. These
new project awards could be started and completed in this same future period.
Accordingly, our backlog does not necessarily represent the total revenue that
could be earned by us in future periods.




Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements other than operating lease
commitments.
Critical Accounting Policies
Included below is a discussion of critical accounting policies used in our
preparation of the financial statements. While all these significant accounting
policies impact our financial condition and results of operations, we view
certain of these policies as critical. Policies determined to be critical are
those policies that have the most significant impact on our consolidated
financial statements and require management to use a greater degree of judgment
and estimates. Actual results may differ from those estimates.



24






The accounting policies identified as critical are as follows:



Use of Estimates



In preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America, management is required to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting
period. The most significant estimates relate to the calculation of
percentage-of-completion on uncompleted contracts, allowance for doubtful
accounts, realization of deferred tax assets, and valuation of equity
instruments. Actual results could differ from those estimates.



Revenue Recognition



We generate our revenue by offering communications infrastructure contracting
services. Our contracting services report revenue pursuant to customer contracts
that span varying periods of time. We report revenue from contracts when
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, fees are fixed or determinable,
and collection is reasonably assured.



We record revenue and profit from long-term contracts on a
percentage-of-completion basis, measured by the percentage of contract costs
incurred to date to the estimated total costs for each contract. Contracts in
process are valued at cost plus accrued profits less earned revenues and
progress payments on uncompleted contracts. Contract costs include direct
materials, direct labor, third party subcontractor services and those indirect
costs related to contract performance. Contracts are generally considered
substantially complete when engineering is completed and/or site construction is
completed.



We have numerous contracts that are in various stages of completion. Such
contracts require estimates to determine the appropriate cost and revenue
recognition. Cost estimates are reviewed monthly on a contract-by-contract
basis, and are revised periodically throughout the life of the contract such
that adjustments to profit resulting from revisions are made cumulative to the
date of the revision. Significant management judgments and estimates, including
the estimated cost to complete projects, which determines the project's percent
complete, must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in the
accounting period. Current estimates may be revised as additional information
becomes available. If estimates of costs to complete long-term contracts
indicate a loss, provision is made currently for the total loss anticipated.



The length of our contracts varies. Assets and liabilities related to long-term
contracts are included in current assets and current liabilities as they will be
liquidated in the normal course of contract completion, although this may
require more than one year.



Accounts Receivable



Accounts receivable are due within contractual payment terms and are stated at
amounts due from customers net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. Credit is
extended based on evaluation of a customer's financial condition. Accounts
outstanding longer than the contractual payment terms are considered past due.
We determine our allowance by considering a number of factors, including the
length of time trade accounts receivable are past due, our previous loss
history, the customer's current ability to pay its obligation to the us, and the
condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole. We write off
accounts receivable when they become uncollectible, and payments subsequently
received on such receivables are credited to the allowance for doubtful
accounts.




Fair Value of Financial Instruments




Our material financial instruments at April 30, 2017 and for which disclosure of
estimated fair value is required by certain accounting standards consisted of
cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, account payable, notes, common
stock warrants and loans payable. The fair values of cash and cash equivalents,
accounts receivable, and accounts payable are equal to their carrying value
because of their liquidity and short-term maturity. We believe that the fair
values of the loans payable do not differ materially from their aggregate
carrying values in that substantially all the obligations bear variable interest
rates that are based on market rates or interest rates that are periodically
adjustable to rates that are based on market rates.




Share Based Compensation




We estimate the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes valuation
model. Key input assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options
include the exercise price of the award, the expected option term, the expected
volatility of the Company's stock over the option's expected term, the risk-free
interest rate over the option's term, and the Company's expected annual dividend
yield. The Company has adopted ASU 2016-09 as of April 30, 2017, and has elected
to recognize forfeitures as they occur rather than estimate their forfeiture
rate.



Income Taxes



We determine deferred tax liabilities and assets at the end of each period based
on the future tax consequences that can be attributed to net operating loss
carryovers and differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of
existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, using the tax
rate expected to be in effect when the taxes are actually paid or recovered. The
recognition of deferred tax assets is reduced by a valuation allowance if it is
more likely than not that the tax benefits will not be realized. The ultimate
realization of deferred tax assets depends upon the generation of future taxable
income during the periods in which those temporary differences become
deductible.




At April 30, 2017, our net deferred tax assets are fully offset by a valuation
allowance. We will continue to evaluate the realization of our deferred tax
assets and liabilities on a periodic basis, and will adjust such amounts in
light of changing facts and circumstances.




We consider past performance, expected future taxable income and prudent and
feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the amount of the valuation
allowance. Our forecast of expected future taxable income is based over such
future periods that we believe can be reasonably estimated. Changes in market
conditions that differ materially from our current expectations and changes in
future tax laws in the U.S. may cause us to change our judgments of future
taxable income. These changes, if any, may require us to adjust our existing tax
valuation allowance higher or lower than the amount we have recorded.



25






Adoption of Recent Accounting Standards




In August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU")
2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a
Going Concern, that requires management to evaluate whether there are conditions
and events that raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue
as a going concern within one year after the financial statements are issued or
available to be issued on both an interim and annual basis. Management is
required to provide certain footnote disclosures if it concludes that
substantial doubt exists or when its plans alleviate substantial doubt about the
Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The Company adopted ASU
2014-15 as of January 31, 2017, and its adoption did not have any significant
impact on the Company's financial statements.



In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of
Deferred Taxes. ASU 2015-17 requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be
classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. ASU
2015-17 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early
adoption is permitted. The Company adopted this guidance as of January 31, 2017
on a prospective basis, and its adoption did not have any significant impact on
the Company's consolidated financial statements.



In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15 Statement of Cash Flows -
Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, which addresses
specific cash flow classification issues where there is currently diversity in
practice including debt prepayment and proceeds from the settlement of insurance
claims. ASU 2016-15 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15,
2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company elected to early adopt ASU
2016-15 effective as of January 31, 2017. The adoption of ASU 2016-15 did not
impact our results of operations or cash flows.



In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18 Statement of Cash Flows -
Restricted Cash, which requires entities to show the changes in the total of
cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in the
statement of cash flows. As a result, entities will no longer present transfers
between cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and restricted cash
equivalents in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-18 is effective for annual
periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The
Company elected to early adopt ASU 2016-18 including retrospective adoption for
all prior periods. The impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-18 is the addition of
a reconciliation of the totals in the statement of cash flows to the related
captions in the balance sheet and was not material to the results.



Stock Compensation



In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation
(Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. The
amendment is to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based
payment transactions including the income tax consequences, classification of
awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of
cash flows. For public entities, the amendments in ASU 2016-09 are effective for
interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The
Company adopted this guidance as of April 30, 2017, and its adoption did not
have any significant impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.

        Most investors just check the WPCS International stock price, and WPCS International historical stock prices before investing.  While share price is an important factor, one should also look at financials and valuation metrics like the WPCS International PE ratio chart.  Below is a brief explanation of common balance sheet terms: Assets: An asset is a resource that a corporation like WPCS International owns and has economic value.  The two major types of assets are: fixed assets like real estate, plant and machinery and current assets like cash, marketable securities and inventory.  The total asset value for WPCS stock as of year is $5.8M.  Its easy to associate the term with manufacturing companies, which invest a lot in factories and equipment.  However, the same cannot be said about tech stocks.

Students at the Widener Partnership Charter School (WPCS) will benefit from a $10,000 scholarship gift made by the Norristown-based Gretz Beer Co. that will help pay for private high school tuition.
The donation, presented recently at the school, came as a gift to the Business Leadership Organized for Catholic Schools (BLOCS) program.
BLOCS is an independent charitable organization supported by individuals, companies, firms and foundations of all sizes in the five-county Philadelphia region. It seeks to give children access to high-quality, values-based education in Philadelphia-area Catholic schools through need-based scholarships.
Nancy Shaw, WPCS director of administration, advancement, and outreach, recognized the donation with a group of eighth grade students planning to attend Cardinal O'Hara High School in Springfield and Archbishop John Carroll High School in Radnor this fall.
The school is committed to the long-term success of students, she said, and that BLOCS scholarships give them additional educational options.
Jim Downey, development manager for BLOCS, said approxi mately $400,000 is needed to assist about 140 WPCS alumni who are attending private high schools. The school promoted 40 students last week.
The Gretz gift combines with more than $19 million brought in this year to help kids at WPCS, said Downey.
"We've always felt education is the most important thing we should be focused on," company President Michael J. Gretz said. "We couldn't be prouder to be a part of this program."© Copyright (c) 2017 The Spirit, All rights reserved., source Blogs

Is WPCS International Incorporated (WPCS) Financially Strong Enough To Weather A Storm?



Sebastian Eder 


            				May 19, 2017			        


 Small-cap companies such as WPCS International Incorporated (NASDAQ:WPCS) with its market cap of USD $4 Million, benefit the most from improving economic conditions due to the growth potential, but on the other hand they also are highly prone to a downturn, thus making their financial strength an important factor in filtering out the risky ones. Although WPCS’s low debt-to-equity ratio of 8.6% indicates financial strength, there’s more to it than just one ratio. 
 One of the major reasons that they are highly affected by a downturn in the country’s economy or an industry in the region is the lack of geographic diversification. So, investors often choose small-cap funds. While savvy investors aren’t wrong in looking for singular blockbuster opportunities and trying to achieve diversification on their own by allocating a small part of their portfolio capital to small-caps, that doesn’t make these investments less risky individually. However, to help you reduce that risk, I’m going to provide you with few basic aspects other than debt-to-equity ratio to gauge a ballpark estimate on how financially strong is the company. See our latest analysis for WPCS 
Has WPCS International got enough cash to weather a storm?
 Even the most successful companies face downturn as competitors, consumers and disruptors keep reshaping markets, but they survive due to their strong liquidity position (and also the ability to adjust quickly). Comparing WPCS International’s liquid assets to its debt would let me know if it’s resilient enough. WPCS’s short-term assets ($6 Million) cover its total debt ($0 Million), so the company’s debt is not a major concern during adverse circumstances
 

 WPCS International (NasdaqCM:WPCS) Historical Debt May 19th 17
 
Can WPCS service its debt comfortably?
 While operating cash flows are vital, earnings tell how profitable is the company, after also accounting for its gains and losses in non-core ventures and non-cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization. When a company earns enough to service its debt comfortably, this reflects its profitability and financial strength.If a company’s earnings are greater than 5x its interest expense, it indicates sound financial strength as the company earns way more than its debt obligations. In WPCS’s case, the company has no debt.
 

 WPCS International (NasdaqCM:WPCS) Net Worth May 19th 17


Conclusion
 WPCS International impresses with its such low debt-to-equity ratio and strong enough earnings to easily cover interest costs. But the company’s operating cash flows are still not up to the mark. Now when you know whether you should keep the debt in mind as a risk factor when putting together your investment thesis, I recommend you check out our latest free analysis report on WPCS International to see what are WPCS’s growth prospects and whether it could be considered an undervalued opportunity.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
