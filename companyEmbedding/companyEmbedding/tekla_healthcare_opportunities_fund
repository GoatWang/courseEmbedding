Tekla Healthcare Opportunities Fund Paid Distribution






Business Wire




Jun 30, 2017 2:42 PM EDT













 




























































  On June 30, 2017, Tekla Healthcare Opportunities Fund paid a monthly stock distribution of $0.1125 per share. It is currently estimated that this distribution is derived from net investment income, short-term capital gains and long-term capital gains. The composition of this and subsequent distributions may vary from month to month because it may be materially impacted by future realized gains and losses on securities. The aggregate of the net unrealized appreciation of portfolio securities and net realized gains on sale of securities is $69,950,534, of which $44,758,727 represents net unrealized appreciation of portfolio securities.  The following table sets forth the estimated amounts of the current distribution, paid on June 30, 2017, and the cumulative distributions paid this fiscal year-to-date from the following sources: net investment income, net realized short-term capital gains, net realized long-term capital gains, return of capital or other capital source. All amounts are expressed per common share.                 Current  Distribution           Percentage  Breakdown of  Current Distribution           Total Cumulative Distributions for the   Fiscal Year to Date  1            Percentage Breakdown  of the Total Cumulative Distributions for the  Fiscal Year to Date  1      Net Investment Income           $0.0301           27   %                   $0.1242           12   %             Net Realized ST Cap Gains           $0.0638           57   %                   $0.0881           9   %             Net Realized LT Cap Gains           $0.0186           16   %                   $0.8002           79   %             Return of Capital or Other Capital Source           $0.0000           0   %                   $0.0000           0   %             TOTAL (per common share):           $0.1125           100   %                   $1.0125           100   %                                                                          The table below includes information relating to the Fund's performance based on its NAV for certain periods.                                    Average annual return at NAV for the period from inception through May 31, 2017 2            7.74    %             Annualized current distribution rate expressed as a percentage of NAV as of May 31, 2017            7.19    %              Cumulative total return at NAV for the fiscal year, through May 31, 2017 3            3.54    %              Cumulative fiscal year-to-date distribution rate expressed as a percentage of NAV as of May 31, 2017 1            5.39    %              You should not draw any conclusions about the Fund's investment performance from the amount of this distribution or from the terms of the Fund's managed distribution policy.

Please note: Closed end funds are subject to the risk of their underlying assets and investment strategy. Unlike open end funds, closed end funds trade on an exchange at a price which is often a discount to their net asset value (NAV). The market price may experience periods of increased volatility due to the use of leverage as well as market and fund illiquidity. Important information you should know about investing in closed-end funds.

More about Portfolio Composition








*The Overall Morningstar RatingTM for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and ten-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a funds monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads and redemption fees, if applicable), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.)The performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted. Distributions are not guaranteed and the amount of distributions will vary depending on a number of factors. Market prices and investment return will vary, therefore you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. Click on the "Performance & Risk" link to view quarter-end performance. All performance data is for the common shares of the fund. Total distribution rate (at market or NAV) may include unknown combinations of income, capital gains and return of capital.Cumulative total returns are reported as of the period indicated. Life of fund figures are reported as of the commencement date to the period indicated. ^Premium/Discount to NAV represents the percentage by which the funds market price exceeds or is less than net asset value (NAV). Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a market price that is a discount to their NAV.Top holdings are as of the date indicated and may not be representative of the funds current or future investments.
