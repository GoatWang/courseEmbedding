RISKSInvestment, Market, and Price Risk: Closed-end fund shares are subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of the entire principal amount that you invest.  Common shares frequently trade at a discount to their NAV.  At any point in time, your common shares may be worth less than you paid, even after considering the reinvestment of fund distributions.Interest Rate Risk: Fixed-income securities such as bonds, preferred, convertible and other debt securities will decline in value if market interest rates rise.Credit Risk: Debt or preferred securities held by the fund may fail to make dividend or interest payments when due.  Investments in securities below investment grade credit quality are predominantly speculative and subject to greater volatility and risk of default.  Unrated securities are evaluated by fund managers using industry data and their own analysis processes that may be similar to that of a nationally recognized rating agency; however, such internal ratings are not equivalent to a national agency credit rating. Counterparty credit risk may arise if counterparties fail to meet their obligations, should the fund hold any derivative instruments for either investment exposure or hedging purposes.Leverage Risk: The fund’s use of leverage may cause higher volatility for the fund’s per share NAV, market price, and distributions.  Leverage typically magnifies the total return of the fund’s portfolio, whether that return is positive or negative. Leverage is intended to increase common share net income, but there is no assurance that the fund’s leveraging strategy will be successful.  Different forms of leverage, including swaps, may introduce additional credit or interest rate risk. Leverage may also increase a fund’s liquidity risk, as the fund may need to sell securities at inopportune times to stay within fund or regulatory limits.Inverse Floater Risk: The fund invests in inverse floaters. Due to their leveraged nature, these derivative investments can greatly increase a fund’s exposure to interest rate risk and credit risk, including counter-party credit risk. In addition, investments in inverse floaters involve the risk that the fund could lose more than its original principal investment.Tax Risk: The tax treatment of fund distributions may be affected by future changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation by the Internal Revenue Service or state tax authorities.Call Risk or Prepayment Risk: Issuers may exercise their option to prepay principal earlier than scheduled, forcing the fund to reinvest in lower-yielding securities.Low-Quality Bond Risk: The fund concentrates a large portion of its investments in low-quality bonds (sometimes called “junk bonds”), which have greater credit risk and generally are less liquid and have more volatile prices than higher quality securities.Hedging Risk: The fund may use derivative instruments for hedging purposes, but there is no assurance that the fund’s hedging strategy will be successful.  Derivatives may involve a high degree of financial risk, including the risk that the loss on a derivative may be greater than the principal amount invested.Municipal Bond Market Liquidity Risk: Inventories of municipal bonds held by brokers and dealers have decreased in recent years, either due to broker-dealer choices or to federal banking regulations, reducing their ability to make a market in these securities. This may decrease the fund’s ability to buy or sell bonds, and may increase bond price volatility and trading costs, particularly during periods of economic or market stress. As a result, the fund may be forced to sell a security at a lower price than desired, to sell other securities to raise cash, or to give up an investment opportunity, any of which could have a negative effect on performance. Large block sales could further reduce bond prices and hurt fund performance.
NOTES


					** The premium/discount is calculated as (most recent price/most recent NAV) -1.






				Income may be subject to state and local income taxes and the alternative minimum tax. Capital gains, if any, will be subject to capital gains tax.

†† INCOME ONLY DISTRIBUTIONS

				Distributions are sourced entirely from net investment income, unless noted otherwise.
				
						
							Distribution rates represent the latest declared regular distribution, annualized, relative to the most recent market price and NAV. Special distributions, including special capital gains distributions, are not included in the calculation.
						
					
			
1 Taxable Equivalent Yield

				Taxable equivalent yield is the yield or distribution rate needed from a taxable investment to be economically equal to receiving the stated tax-free yield from a municipal bond investment. Please note that the income levels shown in the calculator do not reflect (i) any federal or state limitations on the amounts of allowable itemized deductions, phaseouts of personal or dependent exemption credits or other allowable credits, (ii) any local taxes imposed, or (iii) any alternative minimum taxes or any taxes other than personal income taxes. The user is responsible for selecting the applicable federal and, as applicable, state tax rates. The stated federal tax rates for joint incomes over $250,000 include the 3.8% medicare tax imposed on the net investment income of certain taxpayers with higher incomes. This calculator is for illustrative purposes only and is not intended to represent actual performance, or to predict future performance, of any Nuveen Investments product. Certain taxpayers may find their effective marginal tax rates to be greater than those shown in the calculator. In that case, the taxable equivalent yield may be even higher.
			

				Income may be subject to state and local taxes, as well as the federal alternative minimum tax. There is no assurance that tax rates will remain unchanged; the rates used are believed to be correct for tax year 2016.

Nuveen’s Closed-End Muni Fund Mergers Near Completion

It's taken a while, but Nuveen Asset Management's efforts to merge a bunch of its national closed-end municipal bond funds into two large funds is nearing completion. The consolidation, which involves eight funds, was approved by fund boards last August. The first shareholder vote was last November, but it took until early March, before both sets of mergers were approved by the required number of shareholders. In late March, Nuveen announced the dates the merging funds would be making their final distributions in early April and early May before being consolidated.  Jim Robinson, portfolio manager of the Robinson Tax Advantaged Income (ROBAX), a mutual fund made up of closed-end muni funds, is a fan of the two remaining Nuveen funds. They should benefit from better trading efficiency, scale and the current discounts should narrow over time, he says.  Nuveen Dividend Advantage Municipal Income Fund (NVG) and Nuveen Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund 3 (NZF) both have 9% discounts currently -- wider than the current average discount for closed-end municipal bond funds. “Mergers historically have been a sticky solution to a chronic discount problem,” says Robinson. He isn't surprised it took a while to round up the necessary number of votes from the funds shareholder base of individual investors. Also, the mergers tweak the characteristics of the acquiring funds a bit. Both have their investment mandates broadened to allow them to buy more lower rated bonds. NVG also becomes entirely exempt from securities subject to the alternative minimum tax (AMT). (More details on the mergers are available in a Q&A on the Nuveen website). The mergers will also increase the total costs by a few basis points, but not enough to outweigh the benefits, says Robinson. To be folded into NZF, which will be renamed Nuveen Enhanced Municipal Credit Opportunities Fund, are:   Nuveen Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund 2 (NXZ)  Nuveen Municipal Advantage Fund (NMA)  Nuveen Premium Income Municipal Fund 4 (NPT)  To be folded into NVG, which will be renamed Nuveen Enhanced AMT-Free Municipal Credit Opportunities Fund are:   Nuveen Quality Municipal Fund (NQI)  Nuveen Quality Income Municipal Fund (NQU)  Nuveen Municipal Opportunity Fund (NIO)

CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nuveen Investments, a leading global provider of investment services to 
      individual investors and their financial advisors, today announced that 
      the reorganizations of eight national municipal closed-end funds were 
      completed prior to the open of the New York Stock Exchange on April 11, 
      2016. Additionally, the acquiring funds, Nuveen Dividend Advantage 
      Municipal Fund 3 (NYSE:NZF) and Nuveen Dividend Advantage 
      Municipal Income Fund (NYSE:NVG) have been renamed Nuveen 
      Enhanced Municipal Credit Opportunities Fund and Nuveen Enhanced 
      AMT-Free Municipal Credit Opportunities Fund, respectively. The funds 
      will continue to trade under the symbols NZF and NVG.
    

      As part of the previously

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Nuveen Closed-End Funds' Board Approves Fund Mergers And Portfolio Repositionings






Business Wire




Aug 26, 2015 9:00 AM EDT













 




























































  Nuveen Investments, a leading global provider of investment services to institutions as well as individual investors, today announced that the Board of Trustees of the Nuveen closed-end funds approved a plan to merge eight national municipal closed-end funds and to reposition the portfolios of the two acquiring funds. The funds will hold special shareholder meetings later this year to seek approval for those aspects of the plan that require shareholder approval.  The goal of the proposals is to enhance the funds' competitiveness and investor appeal and thereby improve the market price at which the common shares trade relative to net asset value. The proposals seek to accomplish this by:   Improving fund net earnings potential through a broader investment mandate;   Creating significantly larger funds that offer greater liquidity and ease of trading; and   Eliminating overlapping products and enhancing fund differentiation.    The proposed fund mergers are as follows:     Acquired Fund           Symbol           Acquiring Fund           Symbol     Nuveen Premium Income Municipal Fund 4, Inc.           NPT            Nuveen Dividend AdvantageMunicipal Fund 3, to be renamed Nuveen Enhanced Municipal Credit Opportunities Fund           NZF     Nuveen Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund 2       NXZ               Nuveen Municipal Advantage Fund, Inc.           NMA                         Nuveen Municipal Opportunity Fund, Inc.

NQI               Nuveen Quality Income Municipal Fund, Inc.           NQU                          A Nuveen Municipal Bond Closed-End Funds Q&A posted on Nuveen's web site provides a summary of the proposed mergers. Detailed information on the proposals will be contained in the proxy materials expected to be filed in the near future.  Nuveen Investments provides high-quality investment services designed to help secure the long-term goals of institutional and individual investors as well as the consultants and financial advisors who serve them. Nuveen Investments markets a wide range of specialized investment solutions which provide investors access to capabilities of its high-quality boutique investment affiliates—Nuveen Asset Management, LLC, Symphony Asset Management LLC, NWQ Investment Management Company, LLC, Santa Barbara Asset Management, LLC, Tradewinds Global Investors, LLC, Winslow Capital Management, LLC and Gresham Investment Management LLC, all of which are registered investment advisers and independent investment subsidiaries of Nuveen Investments, Inc. Funds distributed by Nuveen Securities, LLC, a subsidiary of Nuveen Investments, Inc. Nuveen Investments operates as a separate subsidiary within TIAA-CREF, which is a leading provider of retirement and financial services in the academic, research, medical and cultural fields. In total, Nuveen Investments managed approximately $230 billion as of June 30, 2015. For more information, please visit the Nuveen Investments website at www.nuveen.com.  The funds expect to file proxy statements with the SEC in connection with the proposed merger and repositioning. Investors are urged to read the proxy statement and any other relevant documents when they become available because they will contain important information about the proposals. After they are filed, free copies of the proxy statements will be available on the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov.  This communication is not a solicitation of a proxy from any fund shareholder. The funds, Nuveen Fund Advisors and certain of their respective directors/trustees, officers and affiliates may be deemed under the rules of the SEC to be participants in the solicitation of proxies from shareholders in connection with the proposals. Information about the directors/trustees and officers of the funds may be found in their respective annual reports and annual proxy statements previously filed with the SEC and will be contained in the proxy statement when available.
