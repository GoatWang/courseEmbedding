Technology Entrepreneur Dana Waldman Joins Cleartronic as Board Chairman and CEO
Download PDF

BOCA RATON, FL -- (MARKET WIRE) -- 07/11/11 -- 
  Adding the entrepreneurial leadership of a proven technology innovator, Cleartronic, Inc. (OTCBB: CLRI) today announced the appointment of Mr. Dana Waldman as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors.


Founder and CEO Larry Reid will hand the CEO reins to Mr. Waldman, but will continue serving as chief financial officer. "For the past five years," noted Mr. Reid, "I held both the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer positions. During much of that time, we were developing as an early-stage technology company, so these dual responsibilities were manageable. We are now at an important crossroads that requires full-time leadership from a dedicated and visionary CEO. We have found that person in Dana Waldman. At the same time, the strategic re-direction of our company requires the financial oversight of a full-time CFO, which is a familiar role for me."


Mr. Reid continued, "I welcome the decision by Mr. Waldman to lead Cleartronic. His broad experience and understanding of technology applications, as well as his diverse background in public company leadership bring significant management assets to our company. He has evaluated the Company's core technology for approximately twelve months, analyzing how we might more completely exploit and capitalize on our intellectual property in other market applications."


"I am excited by the opportunity to help shape the direction of Cleartronic," Mr. Waldman commented. "There are several potential applications for the Company's core technology that we want to explore. Each one of them addresses one or more large market opportunities where we believe Cleartronic has significant competitive advantages, including in machine-to-machine markets, cloud communications, and 'smart grid' energy applications."


"Over the next several weeks and months," Waldman continued, "our R&D efforts will aim to better define Cleartronic's realistic opportunities, but we are excited by both the challenges and the promise. More immediately, we will soon launch a new Cleartronic corporate website. It will serve as a valuable public resource for news, information, and updates on our corporate goals and milestones."


Waldman has over 25 years' experience in building and leading businesses in the communications, signal processing, software, and other technology areas. He has created and led companies that were competitive in both government and commercial sectors, and has worked in start-up enterprises, as well as in Fortune 500 environments.


Mr. Waldman spent 13 years in various management roles at Ford Aerospace, Loral Corporation, and Lockheed Martin. He played major roles with those companies by creating entrepreneurial opportunities, including the adaptation of military technology to commercial applications. His product development efforts have included satellite communications, laptop computers, network management, and medical imaging systems, among other technologies.


As founder and CEO, Waldman led a spinout of technology from Lockheed Martin, raised over $200 million in venture capital from leading private equity firms, and created an international business that achieved a market valuation in excess of $1 billion.


Mr. Waldman holds a B.S. in Electrical Engineering from Tulane University and an MBA from Golden Gate University. He has been featured in numerous technology and financial publications, including Fortune magazine, and has appeared on several television news segments. He is a member of the Adjunct Faculty at Golden Gate University in San Francisco, teaching MBA courses in leadership and other subjects, while also serving as that institution's Chairman of the Board of Trustees.

Cleartronic, Inc. (OTC: CLRI) Breaking News -  
June 10th, 2016
 
Cleartronic, Inc. (CLRI) Signs Letter 
of Intent to Acquire iStream Network, Inc.
 
Boca Raton, FL-- (Marketwired) -- 06/10/16 -- 
CLEARTRONIC, INC. (OTC PINK: 
CLRI) executed a Letter of Intent with iStream Network, Inc. to acquire 
and “spin-off” iStream Network as its own separate trading entity by filing a 
Form 10 with the Securities and Exchange Commission with Cleartronic 
shareholders retaining a (12%) percent interest in the issued and outstanding 
stock of iStream. Should a spin-off occur, iStream would obtain its own CUSIP, 
be assigned its own trading symbol and be an independent company with a 
registered class of stock. 

iStream Network operates a number of web streaming websites including: 
www.musicianstream.com www.churchstreamnetwork.com www.sportstreamnetwork.com


iStream broadcasts and deliver content globally from a multitude of venues as 
well as through relationships with entertainment companies including 
www.proselect.com , a content provider which recently executed an exclusive 
delivery agreement with iStream network. Proselect works with some of the top 
artists in the world and their events have been viewed by millions worldwide.
“There are great synergies between the two companies”, said Larry Reid, CEO of 
Cleartronic, “we envision using iStream technology in many facets of our 
business, and if the spin-off occurs we anticipate distributing Cleartronic’s 
iStream shares to our shareholders of record as a special dividend.” 

It just makes sense that two companies of like-mindedness work together in 
achieving their goals, we couldn’t imagine a better opportunity than working 
together with Cleartronic.” Said Jory Staton, CEO of iStreamNetwork, Inc.

Larry Reid will be the featured guest on long running show “YOUR MONIES WORTH, 
hosted by Mick Bazsuly and Cynthia E. Ferguson LIVE from the Beasley Studios. 
The show will be today at 5pm and can be heard on 1470am South Florida as well 
as worldwide on the internet on Amp2.TV and the stations website 
www.wwnnradio.com .
