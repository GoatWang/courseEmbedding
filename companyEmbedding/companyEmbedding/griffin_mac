Griffin Review: The Guide Cable Management Set Will Keep Your Desk Organized
Wednesday November 25, 2015 1:34 pm PST by Juli Clover
Griffin's Guide Magnetic Cable Management Set was first announced at CES in January of 2015, but it didn't become available for purchase until September. We went hands-on with the Guide to see if it was worth the wait as a cable management solution.The Guide Cable Management Set is modular and consists of three weighted bases and three magnetic aluminum cable anchors that attach to the bases. Each base is made from a polished stainless steel with a shiny finish while the anchors, available in three sizes from small to large, are made from an anodized copper-colored aluminum.Together, the Guide system looks great on a desk, but it is only available in the polished steel and copper colorway, which doesn't match any iOS devices and while neutral, may not match all office and room decors. I liked the design of the Guide, but I did wish it was available in a wider selection of colors.Each of the three bases is the same size, measuring in at 2.28 x 1.98 inches, but the magnetic cable anchors come in a range of sizes to fit different cords. The smallest of the three anchors is sized to fit a single iPhone cable, while the middle one can hold several iPhone-sized cables or a couple of larger cables, and the biggest anchor can hold thicker cables like those for cameras and other electronics. The weight of the Guide bases will keep them in place, but there's also a non-skid material on the bottom to provide even more traction.Because the anchors attach to each base using magnets, they can be arranged in multiple ways. One anchor can be used per base or multiple

Review: Griffin's WatchStand for Apple Watch Keeps All That Extra Cable Hidden
Thursday June 4, 2015 12:44 pm PDT by Juli Clover
With its WatchStand, accessory maker Griffin has come up with a unique take on an Apple Watch charging dock, incorporating a cord management feature that sets it apart from the many other stands on the market. Made of plastic instead of aluminum or wood, Griffin's stand is also one of the more affordable options available.I've been testing the Griffin WatchStand for the past week and have been impressed with the level of functionality vs. the price, but there are a few drawbacks that might not make it the best stand choice depending on which Apple Watch you own.When it comes to looks, the Griffin WatchStand is not quite as attractive as some other options on the market. Its black plastic design doesn't complement the Apple Watch and other Apple devices, it feels overly tall, and it doesn't blend into a range of different decors as well as aluminum or wood.Griffin WatchStand next to Twelve South HiRise for Apple Watch Aesthetic preferences vary heavily by person, so the form and material of the WatchStand may not be a negative for some. Though it's made of plastic, the WatchStand doesn't really look cheap and there are no flaws in its construction -- it has a wide, heavy rubber-bottomed base for stability and the part of the stand that holds the Apple Watch charger is well-designed and at an ideal viewing angle.

Griffin's New iTrip Clip Adapter Makes Wired Headphones Work Wirelessly
Tuesday August 30, 2016 8:10 am PDT by Joe Rossignol
Just days before Apple is expected to announce the iPhone 7 without a headphone jack, Griffin Technology has introduced a new iTrip Clip clippable adapter that enables any pair of wired headphones with a 3.5mm jack to function as wireless headphones via Bluetooth.To use the iTrip Clip with Apple's wired EarPods, for example, an iPhone user would simply plug the headphones into the adapter and pair the accessory with the smartphone via Bluetooth 4.1. The self-powered adapter also works with AUX cables for Bluetooth audio in the car.iTrip Clip has play/pause, volume, and track controls, and a built-in mic that can be used to make phone calls or Siri voice commands.The adapter's rechargeable 800 mAh battery lasts up to 6 hours for music playback or 180 hours in standby. A micro-USB charging cable is included in the box.iTrip Clip will be available in September for

Griffin’s $40 BreakSafe Power Cable Brings MagSafe to the 12-Inch MacBook Starting April 25
Thursday April 21, 2016 9:42 am PDT by Joe Rossignol
Griffin Technology has announced that its BreakSafe Magnetic USB-C Power Cable for the 12-inch Retina MacBook, including the new Early 2016 model introduced earlier this week, will start shipping on Monday, April 25.BreakSafe is a magnetic breakaway power cable for USB-C laptops such as the 12-inch MacBook which, unlike the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro, does not feature Apple's proprietary MagSafe technology first introduced in 2006.The cable, originally announced at CES 2016, has a quick-release magnetic connector that plugs into the 12-inch MacBook's USB-C port and safely disconnects from the rest of the cable when under stress or strain, such as tripping over the power cord.BreakSafe's magnetic connector is 12.8mm deep, while the USB-C cable is six feet (1.8m) long. The cable, compatible with USB Power Delivery and rated up to 60 watts, is for charging power only and does not support data and video.BreakSafe can be ordered now for $39.99 on Griffin's website ahead of April 25

CES 2016: Griffin Debuts Travel Power Bank and New Bands for Apple Watch
Monday January 4, 2016 9:20 am PST by Juli Clover
Griffin today announced several accessories for the Apple Watch as part of its CES 2016 offerings, including an assortment of Apple Watch bands and the Travel Power Bank, a new compact Apple Watch charger designed for on-the-go charging while traveling.The Travel Power Bank is an all-in-one travel solution with a built-in Apple Watch charger. Unlike most Apple Watch charging solutions, it's small enough to be attached to a keychain, and with its built-in 800 mAh battery, it can charge the Apple Watch when away from a power source. According to Griffin, the Travel Power Bank is able to deliver up to 4 full charges to an Apple Watch before needing to be recharged via an included micro-USB cable.Though portable, the Travel Power Bank isn't cheap. When it becomes available for purchase in the second quarter of 2016, it will retail for $69.99.Griffin has also announced two new sets of bands designed for the Apple Watch, both of which will be debuting in several months during the third quarter of 2016. The Uptown Leather Band features a design similar to the Hermés Double Tour, with a double-wrap band that winds around the wrist twice.Available in toffee, black, ecru, or seafoam, each band will come with a metal buckle to match one of the Apple Watch Stainless Steel or Apple Watch Sport colors. Toffee pairs with yellow gold, black and seafoam pair with silver, and ecru pairs with rose gold. Each band uses silver lugs.The Uptown Leather Band is available exclusively for the smaller 38mm Apple Watch and it adjusts to fit wrists between 5.1 and 7 inches.

Griffin Introduces BreakSafe Magnetic USB-C Power Cable for 12-Inch MacBook
Monday January 4, 2016 8:07 am PST by Joe Rossignol
Griffin Technology has announced a new BreakSafe Magnetic USB-C Power Cable for the Retina MacBook, which makes up for the lack of Apple's own MagSafe technology on the 12-inch notebook. The six-foot cable is also compatible with other USB-C notebooks like the Chromebook Pixel and will be available in April for $39.99. BreakSafe has a patented quick-release magnetic connector that plugs into the Retina MacBook and safely disconnects from the rest of the cable when put under stress or strain -- for example, if someone trips over the power cord. The 12.8mm connector is small enough that it can be left in the USB-C port without using much space.The Nashville-based accessory maker also unveiled a wider range of USB-C adapters and three-foot cables, including a USB-C to USB-A adapter ($19.99), USB-C to USB-A cable ($19.99), USB-C to Micro USB cable and USB-C to USB-C cable ($29.99). The adapters and cables are available now through Griffin's website.Last, Griffin’s iMic USB-C audio interface will be available for $49.99 in Q2

Griffin's 'Survivor Play' Case for Apple TV Siri Remote Now Available
Thursday December 10, 2015 11:04 am PST by Juli Clover
Back in September, Griffin announced its first product for the fourth-generation Apple TV, a silicone case designed to protect the Apple TV Siri Remote. As of today, Griffin's Survivor Play remote control case is available for purchase.The Survivor Play mimics the design of sleeves for the hand-held Wii Remote, wrapping the Siri Remote in a soft textured silicone that adds grip and padding that may save it from breaking should it be dropped on accident. The Siri Remote slips easily into the sleeve, which protects the back, the sides, and part of the front while still leaving the buttons, the built-in touch pad, and the Lightning port available for use.At the back, there's a thick but ergonomic grip included, which Griffin says makes the Survivor Play easy and comfortable to hold on to even during long gameplay sessions.Given that there have already been multiple reports from people who have broken the glass touch area on their Apple TV Siri Remotes, the Survivor Play is a useful accessory that could prove to be quite popular with Apple TV owners. Because it leaves the Lightning port open, it can be paired with a Remote Loop for even more peace of mind.Griffin's Survivor Play for the Siri Remote can be purchased from the Griffin website for

Griffin Launches New Combination Apple Watch and iPhone Charging Station
Thursday October 22, 2015 9:07 am PDT by Mitchel Broussard
Third-party accessory manufacturer Griffin today announced a new combination Apple Watch and iPhone charging stand called the "WatchStand Powered Charging Station." The dock takes the original design of the company's WatchStand dock and adds on a new section that acts as a landing pad to charge an iPhone or iPad next to the Apple Watch.The new version of the WatchStand comes with a built-in power supply and two dedicated USB charging ports so the cable clutter is visually reduced trailing out from the back of the dock. The WatchStand's underside provides multiple cable management opportunities to ensure that the cords for the Apple Watch and iPhone don't become unruly when both are placed on the stand.Just as with the original WatchStand, the new version supports all bands for the Apple Watch and can even adapt to horizontal and vertical positions, giving users the option to try out new WatchOS 2 features like Nightstand mode. The base of the WatchStand lets users place their iPhone either on the top of a flat, felt surface or angled against the piece that holds up the Apple Watch, to watch videos while the iPhone charges.The WatchStand Powered Charging Station is available to purchase from Griffin's official website for $59.99 starting

Griffin Unveils 'Survivor Play' Case for Apple TV Siri Remote
Tuesday September 15, 2015 11:50 am PDT by Juli Clover
Griffin today debuted its first accessory for the Apple TV, introducing a new case designed for the Siri Remote. The Survivor Play for Siri Remote aims to add protection to keep it safe from scratches and dings when dropped and it adds a non-slip grip to make it easier to hold when playing motion-based games that require a lot of movement.The Survivor Play, which is made of a soft, textured silicone, fits around the back of the Siri Remote and is similar to the wide variety Wii Remote skins that make the Nintendo controller easier to hold during gameplay. According to Griffin, the Survivor Play was designed primarily with gameplay in mind, adding extra thick grips to make it more comfortable to hold.Now that Apple TV has added gaming, your Siri Remote will be working harder than ever. Survivor Play was designed with gaming in mind. Its easy-to grip shape surrounds the remote's back and edges with impact-absorbing silicone. So just in case things get rowdy while you're playing Beat Sports, your Siri Remote stays safe.The case also adds cushioning and protection for the edges and the corners of the Siri Remote, the places most likely to be damaged should the remote be dropped or flung across the room during a heated gameplay session. Because it wraps around the back, the Survivor Play leaves the Siri Remote buttons, touchscreen, microphones, and Lightning port easily accessible.When it launches later this fall, the Griffin Survivor Play for the Siri Remote will be priced at

Griffin Expands Survivor Lineup With Two New iPhone 6 and 6 Plus Cases
Thursday September 3, 2015 7:00 am PDT by Juli Clover
Griffin today announced an expansion of its popular Survivor case lineup for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, introducing the new Survivor Summit and the Survivor Journey. Like its existing Survivor cases, both the Summit and the Journey offer military grade protection for Apple's iPhones.The Survivor Summit is Griffin's most protective Survivor case yet, featuring a sealed weatherproof design that's resistant to dust, rain, mud, and snow. It includes a screen shield that both serves as a stand and protects the touchscreen and home button from grime.With rubber bumpers and a built-in impact resistance system that suspends and cushions the iPhone within the case, the Summit can survive 10-foot drops onto concrete. According to Griffin, despite the high level of protection, the Summit is "slim enough to easily slide into pockets."The Survivor Journey is not as protective as the Survivor Summit, but it's thinner and sleeker. Described by Griffin as "ultra-thin, ultra-tough," the Journey is a one piece snap-on shell that deflects and absorbs impacts to survive a 6.6 foot drop onto concrete.The Journey includes Griffin's "Impact Dispersion System" that includes multiple layers, housing the iPhone inside a rigid, shatterproof shell coated in a material that's easy to grip. Survivor Summit and Journey take our best-selling case line to a whole new level with sleek, slim designs that continue to offer the extreme protection users have grown to love from our Survivor cases," said Aaron Jones, Survivor Category Manager at Griffin Technology.The Survivor Summit is

Griffin Debuts Cove Recharging Center for Charging Five iOS Devices at Once
Tuesday April 14, 2015 6:15 am PDT by Juli Clover
Griffin today launched an Indiegogo campaign for its upcoming Cove Recharging Center, a new charging management and device storage system designed to be used in the home. The Griffin Cove is able to store and charge up to five tablets, smartphones, or other electronic devices at one time in one compact location.To develop its charging station, Griffin visited people in their homes to discover pain points with their current charging systems and used that data to design a product that people will want to use. Griffin’s aim with the Cove was to develop a central hub that could accommodate the devices of the entire family, as one of the the most requested features was the ability to charge multiple devices at once. The Cove has a neutral, modern design that’s meant to fit in with a wide range of home decor styles, with a shell that features wood veneering at the top and wool lining on each of the three shelf layers. There are slots for charging five USB devices at once, and on the left, there’s a box that contains all cables, cords, and power sources, keeping them organized and out of site. The entire box has a pull-down lid that keeps devices and cords alike hidden from view, and the front lid can also be used as a stand.It has five 12-watt USB ports, so it can offer speedy charging for devices like the iPhone and the iPad. It includes a ChargeSensor circuit that detects what type of device is being plugged in, what power it needs, and whether it’s an Apple device or an Android. That way it directs the right amount of power wherever it needs to go.It

Griffin Announces Charging 'WatchStand' for Apple Watch
Tuesday March 10, 2015 7:06 am PDT by Mitchel Broussard
Griffin yesterday announced the WatchStand, which the company calls the first entry into its "new line of products for Apple Watch."The stand is set to be a nightly solution for more easily charging the Apple Watch. Like other Griffin products, the stand itself doesn't include its own charging cable, but users will need to snake in their own MagSafe charger through the stand during the initial set-up of the device.“The introduction of the Apple Watch ushers in what is bound to be the next generation of wearable technology,” said Mark Rowan, President of Griffin Technology. “Griffin has long been at the forefront of developing solutions for Apple’s newest devices and we’re continuing that legacy with our WatchStand charging dock for Apple Watch.” Griffin notes that the stand is compatible with all versions of the Apple Watch and provides an "easy viewing angle" when charging. The pedestal will also accommodate both a vertical and horizontal orientation, allowing personal preference to each user laying their Watch on the stand to charge.Although there is no in-house storage for an iPhone cable, the WatchStand does provide a small dock underneath the Watch pedestal to store a user's iPhone, providing a neat and organized solution to charging and displaying both devices. Unfortunately, the Griffin WatchStand won't be available on the Apple Watch's April 24 launch date, but has been given a more general "Summer 2015" release window. The company did note, however, that the stand will retail for $29.99 when it

Can I connect two iMics? Will they work at the same time? (PC)
INPUT
 
You can connect them, Windows should see both iMics, and you can choose between them. You cannot currently Input from both simultaneously.
OUTPUT
 
The popularity of DJ software has resulted in an increasing number of programs that will allow you to use the iMic Output as a Cue device. Those programs allow you to select both iMic USB Audio system and VIA Audio (WAVE) and assign them separately. Currently that is only possible in programs that have been configured to do so.

I think I've installed it correctly, but I can't get sound. (PC)
Go to Start>Control Panel and open Sounds and Audio Devices. Click on Audio and verify you’ve selected iMic USB audio system under sound Playback. Be sure you have your computer’s internal speakers selected as your output, or playback device. If you’re having problems recording, also verify you’ve selected the iMic under Sound Recording.
If you’re still not getting sound, go to Start> Programs>Accessories>Entertainment and open Sound Recorder. Choose New under File, click the red Record button and speak into your microphone. You should see the green line move in Sound Recorder (actually, the representation of the waveform). Click on Play and listen to what you’ve recorded. You can also double check your audio settings by going to Audio Properties under Edit.
At this point, you’ve verified the iMic is working. If you’re having further problems, check your software manual or contact the manufacturer.

When using my USB hub, the iMic disappears! (Mac and PC)
Every manufacturer of USB gear wants you to plug their product directly into the computer, and they usually state the device may or may not work well with all USB hubs. In general, the way to troubleshoot hub problems is to remove the hub, make sure the device is working, and then reconnect to the hub. Generally, a powered hub (which has its own AC power supply) will work fine.

What is the iMic? Is it a microphone? (Mac)
iMic is not a microphone, but rather an Input/Output device using a 3.5mm jack, that lets you connect standard audio products such as microphones, headphones, home stereo equipment, VCRs, musical instruments and virtually any other line-level or mic-level audio device. It’s basically a “sound card on a cable” that allows you to record and play digital audio using your USB-equipped computer. Some computers (like the Macintosh iBook, G4 Cube, Titanium PowerBook, and numerous PC laptops) rely on USB for complete audio support; others have limited or no audio hardware. For these computers, iMic can be used for audio input and output.

Is the iMic a digital input? Is it 24-bit, 48KHz? (Mac)
The iMic is an A/D (analog to digital) converter, and a very good one for the price. It will convert your analog input signal to digital, and vice versa on output. The iMic itself does all internal processing at 24bit resolution but the Mac OS currently has a more narrow range of options, topping out at 16bit/48KHz. Third party USB ASIO drivers will allow the iMic to support up to 24-bit resolution.

What Macs can I use the iMic with? (Mac)
The iMic is compatible with any Mac that has built-in USB ports and is running Mac OS 10.3.9 or later. As for earlier versions of OS X, the iMic will probably work, but you may need an earlier version of Final Vinyl or other recording software (Contact us if you need a version of Final Vinyl not available on the iMic Support page.)
Note: USB Audio should be supported from OS 9.0.4 on. We’ve had reports of successes and failures in 9.0.4, and you may or may not be able to accomplish what you want in that version.

Does the iMic support input and output at the same time? (Mac and PC)
The iMic’s inputs and outputs always work at the same time, so no configuration is necessary.

What software drivers do I install for the iMic? (Mac)
You do not need to load ANY external drivers for the iMic to work in OS X. All of the software that drives the iMic is built right into the Mac OS, so no other software is required for it to be seen by the operating system. There is no software in the iMic that transfers to your computer.

What kind of software can I use with it? (Mac)
Virtually any software capable of playing or recording audio on your Mac should be compatible since the iMic uses the Mac’s built-in audio drivers. Most Mac audio applications support these drivers and should work normally. Programs that work include Final Vinyl, Logic, GarageBand, Audacity, Ableton Live, Reason, etc.

How Do I Use the iMic in GarageBand? (Mac)
1. iMic Setup:
To select the iMic as an Input device, go to System Preferences and choose Sound. Click on the input tab and select the iMic. Then connect your microphone and speak into it. If you do not see the input level move, try pushing the switch toward “mic” to enable the internal preamp.
Once you see a level, click on the output tab and choose “Built-In Audio” if you want to hear the audio through your computer speakers. If you are going to be listening to headphones or speakers connected to the iMic’s output, select the iMic as the output device instead.
2. Audio MIDI Setup:
Open Audio MIDI Setup (Applications > Utilities). In the System Settings, Default Input pop-up menu, select iMic USB audio system. In the Properties For pop-up menu, select iMic USB audio system. Under Audio Input, make sure that Format is set to 44100.0Hz, 2ch-16bit.
3. In GarageBand:
Open GarageBand and select Preferences from the GarageBand menu. Click the Audio/MIDI icon in the Preferences window. Select iMic USB audio system in the Audio Input pop-up menu and close the Preferences window. Select New Track from the Track menu.
Click the Real Instrument tab, then select Basic Track > No Effects (alternately, select the type of instrument you want to record as well as whatever effects are available).
Set the Format to Stereo, and set the Monitor to On if you want to monitor your audio as you are recording. Click OK and start recording!

How do I use a stereo microphone with the iMic? (Mac and PC)
Stereo microphones can be confusing because there is such a wide range available, from inexpensive camcorders to professional audio models. They usually come in two major connection types, either two separate connectors or a single stereo plug. Generally, if yours has two connectors (XLR or 1/4″), you’ll need to route them through a mixer, microphone pre-amp, tape deck, etc. to properly amplify the signal. That signal is then sent to the iMic using stereo Line Out. If your microphone has a single stereo plug, it may or may not need pre-amplification. Be sure to read the microphone manual or contact the manufacturer to determine if your particular model requires pre-amping. If it does, treat it as if it had two connections – connect it to a mixer, pre-amp, tape deck, etc, and route it to the iMic through the stereo Line Out. If it doesn’t require pre-amplification, simply connect it to the iMic.

I've plugged in my $150 mic and it doesn't work. (Mac and PC)
The iMic was configured for Mic and Line Level devices, such as standard computer microphones and tape decks. Those devices (and there are many types) typically are high impedance products that connect via unbalanced cables. Many, if not most, professional or higher end microphones are low impedance products that connect via balanced cables. Those types of devices require preamplification to bring them up to Line Level. This can be accomplished by using the pre-amps of mixing consoles or by using an impedance matching transformer. If you don’t have a mixer, the transformers are readily available at electronic supply houses and consumer outlets such as Radio Shack.

How Do I Get the Songs I've Recorded into iTunes? Burn a CD? (Mac)
If iTunes has not been set up to burn discs as Audio discs, it might be making a disc of mp3s instead, which will play fine in a DVD player or computer, but not in a simple CD player.
To make sure that iTunes is configured to burn audio CDs, open iTunes and then iTunes preferences, which you can access from the iTunes menu in the menu bar, or by holding down Apple and pressing , (comma). Click on the Advanced tab and choose the Import tab. Click click on the Burning tab and make sure iTunes is set to burn an Audio disc.
To get an audio file that you’ve saved to your desktop into iTunes, choose Import from the File menu and import the track. Make a new playlist and drag the track from the Library to the playlist, then select the playlist and click “burn disc.”
Or, you could drag your audio file into iTunes directly, onto the word “Library.” Create a new playlist and drag your recorded songs from the Library to your new playlist, then click “burn disk.”

Why can't I play the burned disc of my recordings? (Mac)

I want to use the iMic, but my cables are too short. (Mac and PC)
There are various ways to extend your reach when using the iMic. You can use a high-quality USB extension cable to increase the distance between the computer and the iMic. You can use 1/8″ extension cables between your input device (for example, a microphone) and the iMic’s input jack. Other solutions would be the use of USB hubs acting as repeaters or special types of USB extension cables that have an “amplifier” built in so they can be made much longer than normal USB cables.

Why use iMic if I my Mac has Line-In? (Mac)
You certainly can use your built-in audio, but you may get better results with the iMic. The Mac’s built-in audio hardware typically does not perform at professional quality levels, introducing noise and distortion. The inside of a computer is a very noisy place electrically; the power supplies are full of transient noise from the CPU, hard drives, CD drives and other computer components. The built-in Mac audio hardware can transfer that noise into the audio I/O (input/output). The iMic stays outside of your noisy computer system, attaching via the external USB interface. Normally this will provide improved performance for audio recording and playback.

I have a PCI USB card in my older Mac; can I use the iMic?
Not as far as we know. Apple says that USB Audio is only supported on machines that have built-in USB ports. A USB card installed in older Macs may support other USB functions, but according to Apple it won’t support USB Audio.

What about Apple PlainTalk mics? (Mac)
The PlainTalk connector is an older proprietary connector used only by Apple. There have been only a handful of microphone models made that use the PlainTalk connection, and it appears Apple will use USB Audio for future offerings. Therefore, we decided to make the iMic with the 1/8″ connection accepted as standard for the thousands of other microphone models on the market.

What are the exact technical specifications on the iMic? (Mac and PC)
$40!
We’re not trying to be flip here (well, maybe a little bit,) but there’s a reason. In order for us to develop and supply a $40 audio device, it was necessary for that product to be specification independent. Because it’s not a professional device (which would require exact specs for demanding pros), but rather a consumer device that fills a very definite need and price for non-professionals, we have to be able to adjust to changes in the raw materials markets. Otherwise, the extremely low price of the iMic could potentially fluctuate and we might have to deal with unnecessary shortages. So our engineers made the decision to keep the iMic within certain basic parameters and not release a detailed spec sheet. The iMic will always do 24 bit A/D and D/A conversion internally, and it will record and playback at 16 bit, 48 kHz. The quality of the iMic has never before been available at anywhere near its price, and we’re extremely proud of it. Having said that, we feel if exact specifications are that crucial to your project, you might be better served with one of the products costing hundreds of dollars more.

What drivers do I install for the iMic? (PC)
There aren’t drivers necessary for the iMic. If your operating system is USB Audio aware (XP does this best), your Mixer will see the iMic as an Input/Output device. Simply go to Sounds and Audio Devices in your Control Panel and select the iMic as your recording device and your computer’s sound card as your playback device.

What software can I use with the iMic? (PC)
The iMic is fully compatible with XP versions of many audio software programs. It appears in the Mixer and can be utilized for Input and Output by all XP compatible programs, such as the included Sound Recorder and Windows Movie Maker. Or, go to the Sounds and Audio Devices icon in Control Panel and simply choose the iMic as your recording device and your computer’s sound card as your playback device. Then you can use the iMic with many software applications, such as Audacity, Sound Forge, Cakewalk Pro Audio, Steinberg, Cubase VST32, Emagic Logic Audio, Syntrillium Cool Edit Pro, and SEK’D Samplitude Studio to name a few.

Is the iMic a digital input? Is it 24-bit, 48KHz? (PC)
The iMic is an A/D (analog to digital) converter, and a very good one for the price. It will convert your analog input signal to digital, and vice versa on output. The iMic itself does all internal processing at 24bit resolution but the OS currently has a more narrow range of options, topping out at 16bit/48KHz. If you’re using the iMic with a standard Windows compatible program, your optimum recording resolution will be at 16-bit/48KHz. Third party USB ASIO drivers will allow the iMic to support up to 24-bit resolution.

What is the iMic? Is it a microphone? (PC)
The iMic is not a microphone, but rather an Input/Output device using a 3.5mm jack, that lets you connect standard audio products such as microphones, headphones, home stereo equipment, VCRs, musical instruments and virtually any other line-level or mic-level audio device. It’s basically a “sound card on a cable”, which allows you to record and play digital audio using your USB-equipped PC. Some Windows machines rely on USB for complete audio support; others (such as some laptops) have limited or no audio hardware. In these cases, the iMic can be used for audio input and output.

I have a PCI USB card. Can I use the iMic? (PC)
The iMic works with PCI USB cards. The question of compatibility is not between the iMic and the card, but rather between the iMic and the version of Windows. XP is recommended for Windows users.

I'm hearing a low hum coming from my turntable.
This is probably evidence of a grounding issue. Make sure you have the computer and turntable plugged into different outlets or power strips. If there’s a grounding wire hanging off the back of the turntable, try attaching this to the grounding screw that is on the back of most amplifiers. This can also be wrapped around a metal chair or table leg. This should properly ground the turntable and eliminate the hum.

The recordings sound like chipmunks when played back in iTunes.
Check your Audio/MIDI Setup. Open your Applications folder from the Finder, and scroll through the applications, down to “Utilities.” Select that, and then choose “Audio/Midi.” From here, set the “Properties For” or “Settings For” to iMic USB Audio System. Then set both the input and the output to 16bit 2 channel 44100Hz.

When launching Final Vinyl, it just bounces in the dock.
If you are unable to open Final Vinyl successfully, it usually indicates you are missing a Java or QuickTime update on your computer. Go to System Preferences, click on Software Update, and run all the available updates, even those that you think you don’t need. Restart your computer and try to launch Final Vinyl one more time.

There seems to be a delay in the sound coming out of the computer.
Currently most, if not all, USB Audio devices seem to suffer a small amount of “latency,” a delay from the time audio is input until the time audio is output from the computer. This delay is measured in milliseconds, and varies slightly depending on the configuration of your Mac. Generally, disabling Virtual Memory and File Sharing will shorten the delay significantly. But even with reduced latency, you may not be able to do real-time monitoring and recording. If you don’t require real-time monitoring (recording from VCR, turntable, etc.), latency is of no concern.
Using iMic to record with minimum latency is possible through the use of an external mixer. The mixer doesn’t have to be fancy, but it will need at least three, preferably four, outputs. Brand name mixers such as Midiman or Samson can be purchased for less than $125.
Here’s how to handle latency:

Plug the “Main Outs” of the mixer into your receiver or powered speakers.
Plug your instrument (keyboard, guitar, microphone, etc.) into the mixer (i.e., “Input 1” or, if stereo, “Inputs 1 & 2”) and route the signal to the main output of the mixer. You should be able to play and hear your instrument as you do when you’re playing live.
Plug iMic’s “Audio Out” into the mixer. You might have to use an adapter on the cable to make this work. It’s recommended that you buy a dedicated cable with the right connections, as adapters are prone to all sorts of problems.
Assign the input(s) that your instrument is on to a “submaster(s)” (i.e., submaster 1 or 1&2). If your mixer doesn’t have a submaster, you could use an “auxiliary send” such as the one you would use to send a signal to a reverb or delay unit. Any way that you can get out of your mixer WITHOUT using the “main outs” will work. Whatever output you choose, connect it using the appropriate cable to iMic’s input.
In the Sound control panel, set the input to “iMic USB Audio”. Make sure you turn off the Sound Playthrough or Passthrough in your audio recording software. That way you won’t hear your input as it comes out of the computer. You don’t want to hear the sound from that source because it will be delayed and you’ll be out of sync with your pre-recorded material. Instead, because you have assigned your instrument to play directly out of the mixer, you are playing in real time with the pre-recorded material. All tracks will be in sync on playback.


I can't get my iMic to work with Skype. (MAC and PC)
MAC:

If you are using a headset mic then you first need to connect the mic and speaker cable into the IN and OUT ports on the iMic.
Toggle the iMic to MIC.
Go to your System Preferences/Sound Preferences. On both the INPUT and OUTPUT tabs, select iMic from the list of devices.
Open your SKYPE PREFERENCES and choose AUDIO.
Select the iMic as both the audio input and output. (The same applies if you are only using a computer desk mic with no headset. The difference is that you choose the BUILT IN AUDIO for the System Preferences/Sound and SKYPE OUTPUT)

PC:

If you are using a headset mic then you first need to connect the mic and speaker cable into the IN and OUT ports on the iMic.
Toggle the iMic to MIC.
Go to your SOUNDS AND AUDIO DEVICES. On both the AUDIO and VOICE tabs, select iMic from the list of devices for the SOUND PLAYBACK and SOUND RECORDING.
Open SKYPE and choose TOOLS drop down box and select OPTIONS.
Choose SOUND DEVICES select the iMic as both the AUDIO IN and OUT. (The same applies if you are only using a computer desk mic with no headset. The difference is that you choose the computers internal speakers for the SOUNDS AND AUDIO DEVICES and SKYPE OUTPUT)


Can I use the iMic with a Cisco server?
This is not a supported use of the iMic, and has not been tested by Griffin. However, the Griffin iMic USB sound card continues to be supported by Cisco for use as an MOH live feed source with Cisco CallManager Release 3.3(5) and later, and with Microsoft Windows 2000 (OS 2000 version 2.7 or later). Cisco supports the iMic on all Cisco MCS-78xxH or MCS-78xxI servers with 3.0 GHz or greater processor.
For help on using the iMic in these environments, please contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or Cisco customers can contact the TAC at one of the following numbers:
USA: 1-800-553-2447
Australia: 1-800-805-227

I get an error when trying to record using Final Vinyl.
You will probably need to reinstall Final Vinyl and repair your Disk Permissions to get rid of this error.
In Mac OS 10.4 (Tiger):

In your Applications folder, throw Final Vinyl into the trash.
In you home directory (where the house icon is next to your name), go to Library/Preferences and search for a file labeled “com.griffintechnology.finalvinyl.plist”. Throw that into the trash.
In your home directory, go to Library/Application Support and throw away the “Final Vinyl” folder, if there is one.
Go to your Music folder and see if there is a folder labeled “FV Project”. Throw that in the trash.
Go to Applications->Utilities->Disk Utility.
Select your Hard Drive and click Repair Disk Permissions.
Empty your trash and restart your computer.
Finally, download a fresh copy of Final Vinyl from our website and reinstall.

In Mac OS 10.5 (Leopard):

In your Applications folder, throw Final Vinyl into the trash.

 

In you home directory (where the house logo is next to your name), go to Library/Preferences and search for a file labeled “com.griffintechnology.finalvinyl.plist”, throw that into the trash.
In your home directory, go to Library/Application Support and throw away the “Final Vinyl” folder, if there is one.
In your home directory, go to Library/Caches/ and throw away the Final Vinyl folder.
Empty your trash, unplug the iMic and restart your computer.
Finally, download a fresh copy of Final Vinyl from our website and reinstall.

 

Can you explain, in plain English, how to record LPs onto my PC?
First, connect your device (let’s say it’s a turntable) to iMic’s input.
Then flip iMic’s switch to the “line” position, if you’re using a line-out of your receiver (that would be the red and white RCA type connectors) or to the “mic” position if you’re connecting the wires directly from the turntable. “Mic” mode engages iMic’s internal preamp, which you’ll probably need to boost the signal of the turntable. Plug iMic into a USB port on your computer.
In your Control Panel, go to Sounds/Audio Devices. Make your soundcard your playback device and iMic your recording device.
Next, you’ll need some recording software. For PC users, we recommend a program called Audacity, which you can download here. Once you’ve downloaded and installed Audacity, open the program and go to Preferences, which you’ll find under Edit in the menu bar, or you can just hold down the Control key and press P. Click on the Audio I/O tab and make your soundcard your playback device and iMic your recording device. Choose 2 channel stereo, and be sure to check the box that says “software playthrough.” Close Preferences. Now you’re ready.
If you click PAUSE and then click RECORD, you should be able to now hear audio come through your computer speakers and you can cue up your tape, record, etc.
The controls in Audacity are pretty simple; red circle is Record, brown box is Stop, etc. Just be sure that when you save a file, you actually choose “export” under File and export it as a WAV. Audacity will ask you to name the file and say where you want it to be saved. We recommend that you save it to the desktop, so that you can just drag it to iTunes if you want to burn a disc.

My iMic will not work in Vista!
The iMic hardware is not compatible with the Microsoft Vista operating system.
 

Does the iMic work in Mac OS 10.5?
Yes, it works with our latest version of Final Vinyl, version 2.5, which you can download here. The iMic is also compatible with many other recording programs, such as GarageBand and Audacity.

When choosing my device in Final Vinyl, I don't see the iMic (Final Vinyl 2.5.1).
If you do not see the iMic as a device option in Final Vinyl’s preferences, just quit Final Vinyl and reopen it. When making a recording with the iMic in Final Vinyl 2.5.1, the iMic needs to be selected as the recording device in the Final Vinyl preferences. If you do not plug the iMic in before opening Final Vinyl, it will not appear under preferences. You can see a full demonstration on how to setup the iMic here.

When should I use EQ and other filters in Final Vinyl?
In Final Vinyl, EQ and other filters should only be used after the recording is finished. If you try to use those filters before or during a recording, they will have no effect.

I can no longer cut, copy, or paste in Final Vinyl 2.0!
Unfortunately, Final Vinyl 2.0 was broken by an update to a key component of the software. If you are runing Mac OS 10.4 or later, we recommend updating to Final Vinyl 2.5.1, available from the iMic support page.
If you’re running Mac OS 10.3.9, then we recommend that you check out Audacity, a fantastic open source recording program that we’ve recommended for our PC users for years.

Can I use Final Vinyl in Lion, Mac OS 10.7?
Final Vinyl is not currently supported for use in Lion. Apple’s AU audio effects do not appear to be working properly when Final Vinyl is run in OS 10.7. Other than those specific effects, though, the other basic functions of Finyl Vinal work just fine in Lion. These include recording, editing, and exporting audio files. Final Vinyl’s own effects and filters, such as EQ, Volume, and Normalize also work.

I've downloaded Final Vinyl, but Mountain Lion says it can't be opened!
Mountain Lion includes a security feature called Gatekeeper, which prevents certain applications downloaded from the internet from being installed or opened. To bypass Gatekeeper so that you can use Final Vinyl, find Final Vinyl in your Applications folder, then hold the Control key and click on the Final Vinyl icon. Select “Open” from the menu that appears. You’ll get a message from Mountain Lion asking you to verify that you want to open Final Vinyl. Choose “Open”. You may have to enter your password at this point. Final Vinyl will now open normally.
You’ll only have to complete this process once. This will add Final Vinyl to Gatekeeper’s exceptions list, and you can now open Final Vinyl just like any other application.
