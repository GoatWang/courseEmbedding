Opportunistic Credit Fund
Investment Objective
The Fund’s investment objective is to seek high total investment return by providing a high level of current income and the potential for capital appreciation. The Fund cannot assure you that it will achieve its investment objective.
Philosophy
The Fund may invest in debt securities and income-producing investments of any kind, including, without limitation, residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securitites, U.S Government securities, corporate debt, international sovereign debt, and short-term investments. The Fund’s investment advisor, DoubleLine Capital LP allocated the Fund’s assets among market sectors, and among investments within those sectors, in an attempt to construct a portfolio providing a high level of current income and the potential for capital appreciation consistent with what DoubleLine considers an appropriate level of risk in light of market conditions prevailing at the time.

DBL is a non-diversified fund designed primarily as a long-term investment and not as a trading tool. The Fund should not constitute a complete investment program. Due to the uncertainty in all investments, there can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objectives. Investing in the Fund involves risks, including the risk that you may receive little or no return on your investment or that you may lose part or all of your investment. The values of securities held by the Fund may move up or down, sometimes rapidly and unpredictably. Your common shares (“Common Shares”) at any point in time may be worth less than your original investment, even after taking into account any reinvestment of dividends and distributions. Closed-end funds (CEF) do not continuously offer shares for sale as open-end mutual funds do. The shares trade on a secondary market after the initial public offering. Investors who wish to buy or sell fund shares of a CEF need to place orders through an intermediary, or broker, who will buy or sell fund shares on the stock exchange in a process identical to the purchase or sale of any other listed stock. A closed-end fund is not required to buy its shares back from investors upon request. The share price of a closed-end fund is based on the market value. Additional risks and uncertainties may also adversely affect and impair the Fund. This Web site is for information purposes only and is not intended as a solicitation to sell or buy any security.

Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Investments in debt securities typically decline in value when interest rates rise. This risk is usually greater for longer-term debt securities. Investments in asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities include additional risks that investors should be aware of including credit risk, prepayment risk, possible illiquidity and default, as well as increased susceptibility to adverse economic developments. The Fund may invest in foreign securities which involve greater volatility and political, economic and currency risks and differences in accounting methods. These risks are greater for investments in emerging markets. Investments in lower rated and non-rated securities present a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher rated securities. Investment strategies may not achieve the desired results due to implementation lag, other timing factors, portfolio management decision-making, economic or market conditions or other unanticipated factors. The Fund is a “non-diversified” investment company and therefore may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a limited number of issuers than funds that are “diversified.” Accordingly, the Fund is more susceptible to risks associated with a single economic, political or regulatory occurrence than a diversified fund might be. In addition, the Fund may invest in other asset classes and investments such as, among others, REITs, credit default swaps, short sales, derivatives and smaller companies which include additional risks.
The Fund's investment objectives, risks, charges and other expenses must be considered carefully before investing. You can obtain the Fund's most recent periodic reports and certain other regulatory filings by calling 1(877)354-6311 / 1(877)DLINE11, or Clicking here. You should read these reports and other filings carefully before investing.For our Funds that are no-load mutual funds, management fees and other expenses will apply.

Shiller Enhanced CAPE®
2017 – AWARDED LIPPER “Best Fund Over 3 Years Large Cap Value Funds” as of 11/30/2016. The Fund was ranked #1 out of 106 funds in the category.1
Video & Related Media
Webcast – Shiller Enhanced CAPE® Fund Webcast – Jeffrey Sherman (February 2017)
Reprint – Shiller CAPE® Fund – Investment News (4/7/2015)
Investment Objective
The Fund’s objective is to seek total return which exceeds the total return of its benchmark index, the Shiller CAPE® US Sector TR USD Index (the “Index”), which had a start date of September 9, 2012.
Investment Philosophy
Maintain a core portfolio of debt instruments that focuses on global fixed income sector rotation while simultaneously obtaining exposure to US Equity sector rotation strategy via the Index. The index aims to identify undervalued sectors based on a modified CAPE® Ratio, and then uses a momentum factor to seek to mitigate the effects of potential value traps. By using both a value indicator and a momentum indicator, the Index aims to provide more stable and improved risk adjusted returns. The CAPE® Ratio is used to assess equity markets valuations and averages ten years of reported earnings to account for earnings and market cycles. US sectors are represented by a sector exchange-traded fund (“ETF”). Each month, the Index ranks ten US sectors based on a modified CAPE® ratio and 12-month price momentum factor. The index selects five US sectors with the lowest modified CAPE® ratio or undervalued based on the ratio. The sector with the least favorable 12-month price momentum is rejected and the Index is comprised of the remaining four sectors for the given month.
