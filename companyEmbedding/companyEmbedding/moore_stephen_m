RULEBOOK

RuleBook from Moore Stephens is the combination of a powerful ‘rules engine’ and an underwriting desktop which can cater for even the most complex lines of specialty insurance business.

An award-winning, market-leading pricing, underwriting and distribution tool, RuleBook allows carriers to change the way in which they price and distribute products and enables them to place business more efficiently. 

Designed to be used by underwriters, actuaries, brokers and management executives, RuleBook can cater to all parties involved in the underwriting process.

RuleBook's core capabilities can be split into three distinct areas:

 
Price. Underwrite. Distribute.







 

PRICE
Provides the tools with which to create your own pricing models.

RuleBook provides a central platform that gives one version of the truth that can easily resolve many of the major problems associated with pricing, such as sharing pricing models, the use of disparate systems, loss of MI and lack of control. 

Entering large amounts of data, creating amendments and adjustments, control and compliance, bordereaux production and rate sharing can all be facilitated by RuleBook in one user-friendly application.


RuleBook presents the first viable alternative to Excel spreadsheets for pricing all lines of insurance business. It combines the immediate usability of a spreadsheet with the surety and auditability of an enterprise-level application, giving confidence in and control of the models.

RuleBook’s ‘Authoring’ tools are highly accessible, allowing actuaries and business analysts within your own organisation to effect and maintain their own pricing models and reduce their reliance on third party vendors. 

Its dynamic ‘rules engine’ is capable of embracing both exposure and experience-based rating models and has been validated across all major classes of business. 


The built-in testing module gives security throughout the process, reducing the time taken and the risk associated with creating new or changing existing products.

RuleBook delivers the agility to drive profitable business growth and allows you to learn from your pricing data to build a competitive advantage.
            

            
        






 

UNDERWRITE
Utilises a web interface to enable your team to quote and bind business wherever they are.

RuleBook brings together all of the information required by underwriters and places it at their fingertips, improving efficiency and enabling better underwriting decisions to be made. The ease of policy and account generation allows a quicker reaction to changing market conditions.


RuleBook utilises a web interface to enable your team to quote and bind multiple lines of business. It integrates with existing platforms and can call upon third party web services to transfer bound risks into other relevant systems, avoiding the need for re-entering information and, in turn, driving down costs.


RuleBook allows easy sharing of information. Pricing models created in the RuleBook platform can be distributed to underwriters within your organisation, allowing them to quote and bind business more accurately. 

Underwriters can also grant access to and share, based on authority level, individual risks with their brokers, coverholders and affiliates. A powerful underwriting guide facilitates the sharing of knowledge with colleagues and third parties, providing the scope for cross-selling and up-selling opportunities whilst improving customer relationships.

RuleBook’s extensive reporting system provides full visibility of all data and MI. A responsive dashboard can track tasks and workloads, assisting with the monitor and control of rate changes and benchmarking. Its database captures all quote - as well as bound policy - information entered into the system, allowing underwriters and actuaries a full analysis of all business; even if it is not yet taken up. 

RuleBook also renders an ‘out-of-the-box’ underwriting workflow capability within its core functions, which tracks current tasks and workloads. Supporting users through new business, mid-term adjustments and renewals, it can be updated and extended to provide for any business or product-specific variance. 

RuleBook’s built-in, state of the art document generator delivers highly customisable and polished policy documentation in real-time, branded to your or your partners' needs. 

Built using the latest technologies, it has been designed to work across a range of devices, including tablets and smartphones, in any language and any currency, providing underwriters with the most advanced toolset currently on the market. 
 







 

DISTRIBUTE

The intricate and completely modifiable ‘rules’ component enables business to be delegated to authorised third parties.
 
To remain competitive in a global market, companies need to be able to write business overseas in a cost effective and efficient manner.

RuleBook harnesses the power of its pricing and underwriting components, delivering products to third parties via websites or interfaces directly to coverholders or brokers. There is control over changes and, once agreed, they are instantly applied across the entire network, wherever they are in the world.

The distribution model enforces rules at point of sale so any specified referral, declinature or other rules are flagged up, ensuring the relevant risks are passed to underwriters for approval.  

RuleBook's real time access to distributed business provides MI for quotes, bound business and renewals.
 
Brokers and coverholders can access the latest product information and can price adjust to match clients’ needs, improving the quantity and quality of business sold.

About this book
In the 12 years since publication of Invertebrates, Second Edition, fundamental shifts have occurred in our understanding of the origins and evolutionary relationships among protists and animals. These changes are largely due to the explosion of molecular phylogenetics and evo-devo research, emergence of the new field of animal genomics, major fossil discoveries in China, Australia, and elsewhere, and important new embryological and ultrastructural studies. As a result:- New phyla have been described (e.g., Micrognathozoa, Xenacoelomorpha).- Old phyla have been collapsed into others (e.g., Sipuncula and Echiura are now placed within Annelida; acanthocephalans are now known to be highly modified, parasitic rotifers).- Phyla once thought to be deuterostomes are now part of the protostome clade (e.g., Chaetognatha, Phoronida, Bryozoa, Brachiopoda).- The Protostomia has been reorganized into two major clades known as Ecdysozoa and Spiralia.For each of the 32 currently recognized phyla, Invertebrates, Third Edition presents detailed classifications, revised taxonomic synopses, updated information on general biology and anatomy, and current phylogenetic hypotheses, organized with boxes and tables, and illustrated with abundant line drawings and new color photos. The chapters are organized around the “new animal phylogeny”, while introductory chapters provide basic background information on the general biology of invertebrates. Two new coauthors have been added to the writing team, and 22 additional invertebrate zoologists have contributed to chapter revisions. This benchmark volume on our modern views of invertebrate biology should be in every zoologist’s library."I am so thrilled that we finally getting a third edition of Invertebrates! I've been teaching invertebrate zoology for over 15 years and this text is superior to any other on the market!"– Tamara J. Cook, Sam Houston State University

Biography
Richard C. Brusca is Director of Conservation and Research at the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum, and also holds adjunct research positions at the University of Arizona and CIAD (Centro de Investigacion en Alimentacion y Desarrollo), Mexico. He earned a B.S. at California State Polytechnic University, an M.Sc. at California State University (Los Angeles), and a Ph.D. at the University of Arizona. The author of over 100 research publications, including six books, Dr. Brusca is a widely recognized invertebrate zoologist, marine biologist, and Sea of Cortez and Sonoran Desert naturalist. He is a Fellow in both the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the Linnean Society (London). Dr. Brusca has been the recipient of research grants from numerous organizations, including the National Science Foundation, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the National Geographic Society.Wendy Moore is Assistant Professor in the Department of Entomology at the University of Arizona and Curator of the University of Arizona Insect Collection. Her degrees were earned at Vanderbilt University (B.S., General Biology), the College of Charleston (M.S., Marine Biology), and the University of Arizona (Ph.D., Entomology/Ecology and Evolutionary Biology). Dr. Moore's long-term research interest is the evolution of biotic diversity – especially the evolution of symbiotic lifestyles and how major biotic, climatic, and tectonic events may have influenced the timing and patterns of diversification. Much of her current research is on the carabid beetle subfamily Paussinae, many species of which are obligate symbionts with ants. She is also deeply committed to collections care and enhancement, and the use of bioinformatics to make collections-based data widely available to diverse user communities.Stephen M. Shuster is Professor of Invertebrate Zoology and Curator of Marine Invertebrates and Molluscs at Northern Arizona University. He earned a B.S. in Zoology from the University of Michigan, an M.S. in Biology from the University of New Mexico, and a Ph.D. in Zoology from the University of California, Berkeley. The author or coauthor of over 75 journal articles, encyclopedia entries, book reviews, and contributed book chapters, Dr. Shuster collaborated with Michael J.

Education[edit]
Moore grew up in New Trier Township, Illinois. He attended Saints Faith Hope & Charity School in Winnetka and graduated from New Trier High School in 1978.[6] He received a B.A. from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and an M.A. from George Mason University in economics.[7]
Career[edit]
From 1983 through 1987, Moore served as the Grover M. Hermann Fellow in Budgetary Affairs at the Heritage Foundation. In 1987, Moore was research director of President Reagan's Privatization Commission.[8] Moore spent ten years as a fellow of the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank.[9][10] Moore was the senior economist of the U.S. Congress Joint Economic Committee under Chairman Dick Armey of Texas, where Moore "was instrumental in creating the FairTax proposal".[9]
Moore founded the Club for Growth in 1999. Moore was ousted by the group's board in December 2004, and subsequently announced his resignation.[11] After his ouster from the Club for Growth, Moore founded the 501(c)(4) Free Enterprise Fund with other former Club for Growth members including Arthur Laffer and Mallory Factor.[11] In 2005, Moore left the Free Enterprise Fund to serve on the editorial board of the Wall Street Journal.[10] Moore is a partner in the econometrics firm Arduin, Laffer & Moore Econometrics.[12] On January 21, 2014, the Heritage Foundation announced that Moore would rejoin the think tank as chief economist.[13] Moore is a contributing editor for National Review.[12]
In a 2014 Kansas City Star opinion piece entitled "What's the matter with Paul Krugman?" Moore responded to Krugman's opinion piece entitled "Charlatans, Cranks and Kansas."[14][15] In his piece, Moore claimed that job creation had been superior in low-taxation states during the five years following the recession ending June 2009. After substantial factual errors were uncovered in Moore's opinion piece, the Kansas City Star indicated that it would no longer print Moore's work without "thorough factchecking." [16][17][18] Miriam Pepper, editor of the Kansas City Star, decided to stop publication of Moore's work due to inaccurate statements.[19] Jonathan Chait, in his New York magazine column, in response to Moore's February 15, 2015 Washington Times column on Obamacare, stated "Perhaps the most revealing aspect of Moore’s column is the fact that, five years after its [Obamacare's] passage, the chief economist of the most influential conservative think tank in the United States [the Heritage Foundation] lacks even a passing familiarity with its [Obamacare's] fiscal objectives".[20]
In May 2015, Moore cofounded the Committee to Unleash American Prosperity with Arthur Laffer, Larry Kudlow, and Steve Forbes with the stated mission of, "persuading the presidential hopefuls in both parties to focus on the paramount challenge facing our country: slow growth and stagnant incomes."[21]
Moore served as one of the top economic advisers to Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.[22]
After President-elect Donald Trump answered a congratulatory phone call from democratically elected President of Taiwan Tsai Ing-wen on December 2, 2016,[23][24][25][26] Stephen Moore said "We gotta stand by Taiwan. We see what's happening in China the way they're saber-rattling out there in the East, it's about time we do what Reagan did, we stand up to these bullies, we say we're not gonna let you do this." He emphasized Taiwan is a country deserved greater American support because of its democratic system and "We ought to back our ally, and if China doesn't like it, screw 'em."[27][28]
In February, 2016 Stephen Moore joined 32 Advisors as a Strategic Partner for the firm's Economic Advisory practice.[29]
Personal life[edit]
Moore has three sons.[30]

From 1983 through 1987, Moore served as the Grover M. Hermann Fellow in Budgetary Affairs at the Heritage Foundation. In 1987, Moore was research director of President Reagan's Privatization Commission.[8] Moore spent ten years as a fellow of the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank.[9][10] Moore was the senior economist of the U.S. Congress Joint Economic Committee under Chairman Dick Armey of Texas, where Moore "was instrumental in creating the FairTax proposal".[9]
Moore founded the Club for Growth in 1999. Moore was ousted by the group's board in December 2004, and subsequently announced his resignation.[11] After his ouster from the Club for Growth, Moore founded the 501(c)(4) Free Enterprise Fund with other former Club for Growth members including Arthur Laffer and Mallory Factor.[11] In 2005, Moore left the Free Enterprise Fund to serve on the editorial board of the Wall Street Journal.[10] Moore is a partner in the econometrics firm Arduin, Laffer & Moore Econometrics.[12] On January 21, 2014, the Heritage Foundation announced that Moore would rejoin the think tank as chief economist.[13] Moore is a contributing editor for National Review.[12]
In a 2014 Kansas City Star opinion piece entitled "What's the matter with Paul Krugman?" Moore responded to Krugman's opinion piece entitled "Charlatans, Cranks and Kansas."[14][15] In his piece, Moore claimed that job creation had been superior in low-taxation states during the five years following the recession ending June 2009. After substantial factual errors were uncovered in Moore's opinion piece, the Kansas City Star indicated that it would no longer print Moore's work without "thorough factchecking." [16][17][18] Miriam Pepper, editor of the Kansas City Star, decided to stop publication of Moore's work due to inaccurate statements.[19] Jonathan Chait, in his New York magazine column, in response to Moore's February 15, 2015 Washington Times column on Obamacare, stated "Perhaps the most revealing aspect of Moore’s column is the fact that, five years after its [Obamacare's] passage, the chief economist of the most influential conservative think tank in the United States [the Heritage Foundation] lacks even a passing familiarity with its [Obamacare's] fiscal objectives".[20]
In May 2015, Moore cofounded the Committee to Unleash American Prosperity with Arthur Laffer, Larry Kudlow, and Steve Forbes with the stated mission of, "persuading the presidential hopefuls in both parties to focus on the paramount challenge facing our country: slow growth and stagnant incomes."[21]
Moore served as one of the top economic advisers to Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.[22]
After President-elect Donald Trump answered a congratulatory phone call from democratically elected President of Taiwan Tsai Ing-wen on December 2, 2016,[23][24][25][26] Stephen Moore said "We gotta stand by Taiwan. We see what's happening in China the way they're saber-rattling out there in the East, it's about time we do what Reagan did, we stand up to these bullies, we say we're not gonna let you do this." He emphasized Taiwan is a country deserved greater American support because of its democratic system and "We ought to back our ally, and if China doesn't like it, screw 'em."[27][28]
In February, 2016 Stephen Moore joined 32 Advisors as a Strategic Partner for the firm's Economic Advisory practice.[29]
Personal life[edit]
Moore has three sons.[30]

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
