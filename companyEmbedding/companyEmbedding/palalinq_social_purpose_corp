That is 100.00 % of the financing offer. The total private financing amount was $200,000. The offering form was filed on 2016-01-05. The reason for the financing was: unspecified. 
 Pala-Linq Social Purpose is based in Washington. The filler’s business is Other Technology. The form was filed by Daniela Luzi Tudor CEO. The company was incorporated in 2014.

Analysis of Pala-Linq Social Purpose Offering
On average, companies in the Other Technology sector, sell 85.80 % of the total offering size. Pala-Linq Social Purpose sold 100.00 % of the offering. Could this mean that the trust in Pala-Linq Social Purpose is high? The average offering amount for companies in the Other Technology industry is $1.54 million. The offering was 87.01 % smaller than the average of $1.54 million. Of course this should not be interpreted as negative. Companies raise funds for a variety of reasons and needs. The minimum investment for this financing is set at $100000. If you know more about the reasons for the financing, please comment below.
What is Form D? What It Is Used For
Form D disclosures could be used to track and understand better your competitors. The information in Form D is usually highly confidential for ventures and startups and they don’t like revealing it. This is because it reveals amount raised or planned to be raised as well as reasons for the financing. This could help competitors. Entrepreneurs usually want to keep their financing a ‘secret’ so they can stay in stealth mode for longer.
Why Fundraising Reporting Is Good For Pala-Linq Social Purpose Also
The Form D signed by Daniela Luzi Tudor might help Pala-Linq Social Purpose Corp’s sector. First, it helps potential customers feel more safe to deal with a firm that is well financed. The odds are higher that it will stay in the business. Second, this could attract other investors such as venture-capital firms, funds and angels. Third, positive PR effects could even bring leasing firms and venture lenders.
