                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements of Mack-Cali Realty Corporation and Mack-Cali Realty, L.P. and the notes thereto (collectively, the "Financial Statements"). Certain defined terms used herein have the meaning ascribed to them in the Financial Statements.  Executive Overview  Mack-Cali Realty Corporation together with its subsidiaries, (collectively, the "General Partner"), is one of the largest real estate investment trusts (REITs) in the United States. Mack-Cali Realty, L.P. (the "Operating Partnership") has been involved in all aspects of commercial real estate development, management and ownership for over 60 years and the General Partner has been a publicly traded REIT since 1994.  The Operating Partnership conducts the business of providing leasing, management, acquisition, development, construction and tenant-related services for its General Partner. The Operating Partnership, through its operating divisions and subsidiaries, including the Mack-Cali property-owning partnerships and limited liability companies, is the entity through which all of the General Partner's operations are conducted. Unless stated otherwise or the context requires, the "Company" refers to the General Partner and its subsidiaries, including the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries. The Company owns or has interests in 248 properties (collectively, the "Properties"), consisting of 119 office and 110 flex properties, primarily class A office and office/flex buildings, totaling approximately 26.6 million square feet, leased to approximately 1,600 commercial tenants and 19 multi-family rental properties containing 5,614 residential units. The Properties are located primarily in the Northeast, some with adjacent, Company-controlled developable land sites able to accommodate up to 5.2 million square feet of additional commercial space and approximately 10,340 apartment units.  The Company's historical strategy has been to focus its operations, acquisition and development of office properties in high-barrier-to-entry markets and sub-markets where it believes it is, or can become, a significant and preferred owner and operator. In September 2015, the Company announced a three-year strategic initiative to transform into a more concentrated owner of New Jersey Hudson River waterfront and transit-oriented office properties and a regional owner of luxury multi-family residential properties. As part of this plan, over the past year, the Company has sold or has contracted to sell multiple properties, primarily commercial office, which it believes do not meet its long-term goals.  As an owner of real estate, almost all of the Company's earnings and cash flow are derived from rental revenue received pursuant to leased space at the Properties. Key factors that affect the Company's business and financial results include the following:  * the general economic climate;  * the occupancy rates of the Properties;  * rental rates on new or renewed leases;  * tenant improvement and leasing costs incurred to obtain and retain tenants;  * the extent of early lease terminations;  * the value of our office properties and the cash flow from the sale of such properties;  * operating expenses;  * anticipated acquisition and development costs for office and multi-family rental properties and the revenues and earnings from these properties;  * cost of capital; and  * the extent of acquisitions, development and sales of real estate, including the execution of the Company's current strategic initiative.  Any negative effects of the above key factors could potentially cause a deterioration in the Company's revenue and/or earnings. Such negative effects could include: (1) failure to renew or execute new leases as current leases expire; (2) failure to renew or execute new leases with rental terms at or above the terms of in-place leases; and (3) tenant defaults.  A failure to renew or execute new leases as current leases expire or to execute new leases with rental terms at or above the terms of in-place leases may be affected by several factors such as: (1) the local economic climate, which may be adversely impacted by business  Table of Contents  layoffs or downsizing, industry slowdowns, changing demographics and other factors; and (2) local real estate conditions, such as oversupply of the Company's product types or competition within the market.  Of the Company's core office markets, most have recently shown signs of improvement, while others have stabilized. The percentage leased in the Company's consolidated portfolio of stabilized core operating commercial properties aggregating 21.0 million, 24.0 million and 25.0 million square feet at December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, was 90.6 percent leased at December 31, 2016, as compared to 89.1 percent leased at December 31, 2015 and 84.2 percent leased at December 31, 2014 (after adjusting for properties identified as non-core at the time). Percentage leased includes all leases in effect as of the period end date, some of which have commencement dates in the future and leases that expire at the period end date. Leases that expired as of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 aggregate 151,655, 69,522 and 205,220 square feet, respectively, or 0.7, 0.3 and 0.8 percentage of the net rentable square footage, respectively. Rental rates (including escalations) on the Company's commercial space that was renewed (based on first rents payable) during the year ended December 31, 2016 (on 1,559,046 square feet of renewals) increased an average of 10.9 percent compared to rates that were in effect under the prior leases, as compared to a 0.2 percent increase during 2015 (on 2,513,087 square feet of renewals) and a 4.7 percent decrease in 2014 (on 1,649,145 square feet of renewals). Estimated lease costs for the renewed leases in 2016 averaged $4.04 per square foot per year for a weighted average lease term of 5.1 years, estimated lease costs for the renewed leases in 2015 averaged $2.85 per square foot per year for a weighted average lease term of 3.6 years and estimated lease costs for the renewed leases in 2014 averaged $2.33 per square foot per year for a weighted average lease term of 4.0 years. The Company has achieved positive leasing results in its core markets recently. It believes that commercial vacancy rates may decrease and commercial rental rates may increase in some of its markets in 2017 and possibly beyond. As of December 31, 2016, commercial leases which comprise approximately 15.2 and 14.2 percent of the Company's annualized base rent are scheduled to expire during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018, respectively. With the positive leasing results the Company has achieved in many of its markets recently, the Company believes that rental rates on new leases will generally be, on average, not lower than rates currently being paid. Although the Company has recently achieved positive leasing activity, primarily in its core markets, if the recent leasing results do not prove to be sustaining during 2017 and beyond, the Company's rental rates it may achieve on new leases may be lower than the rates currently being paid, resulting in the potential for less revenue from the same space.  The Company believes that there is a potential for Moody's or Standard & Poor's to lower their current investment grade ratings on the Company's senior unsecured debt to sub-investment grade. Amongst other things, any such downgrade by both Moody's and Standard & Poor's will increase the current interest rate on outstanding borrowings under the Company's current $600 million unsecured revolving credit facility (which was amended in January 2017) from LIBOR plus 120 basis points to LIBOR plus 155 basis points and the annual credit facility fee it pays will increase from 25 to 30 basis points. Additionally, any such downgrade would increase the current interest rate on each of the Company's $350 million unsecured term loan and $325 million unsecured term loan from LIBOR plus 140 basis points to LIBOR plus 185 points. In the event of a downgrade, the Company could elect to utilize the leverage grid pricing available under the unsecured revolving credit facility and both unsecured term loans. This would result in an interest rate of LIBOR plus 130 basis points for the Company's unsecured revolving credit facility and 25 basis points for the facility fee and LIBOR plus 155 basis points for both unsecured term loans at the Company's current total leverage ratio. In addition, a downgrade in its ratings to sub-investment grade would result in higher interest rates on senior unsecured debt that the Company may issue in the future as compared to issuing such debt with investment grade ratings.  The remaining portion of this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should help the reader understand our:  * recent transactions;  * critical accounting policies and estimates;  * results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015;  * results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014; and  * liquidity and capital resources.

(c) This acquisition was funded using available cash and through borrowings under the Company's unsecured revolving credit facility.  On January 11, 2017, the Company acquired three office properties totaling approximately 280,000 square feet located in Red Bank, New Jersey, for approximately $26.8 million, which was funded primarily through borrowings under the Company's unsecured revolving credit facility.  On February 2, 2017, the Company agreed to acquire six office properties totaling approximately 1.1 million square feet, located in Short Hills and Madison, New Jersey for approximately $368 million, subject to certain conditions. The acquisitions are expected to be completed in March 2017.  On February 27, 2017, the Company reached an agreement to acquire all joint venture partner interests in Monaco, a 523-apartment, two-tower, stabilized community located in Jersey City, New Jersey. The transaction, valued at $315 million, is expected to close in the second quarter of 2017.

As of December 31, 2016, the Company anticipates additional costs of approximately $9.7 million, which will be funded from the construction loan.  Consolidations  On January 5, 2016, the Company, which held a 50 percent subordinated interest in the unconsolidated joint venture, Overlook Ridge Apartment Investors LLC, a 371-unit multi-family operating property located in Malden, Massachusetts, acquired the remaining interest for $39.8 million in cash plus the assumption of a first mortgage loan secured by the property with a principal balance of $52.7 million. The cash portion of the acquisition was funded primarily through borrowings under the Company's unsecured revolving credit facility. Upon acquisition, the Company consolidated the asset and accordingly, remeasured its equity interests, as required by the FASB's consolidation guidance, at fair value (based upon the income approach using current rates and market cap rates and discount rates). As a result, the Company recorded a gain on change of control of interests of $10.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. On January 19, 2016, the Company repaid the assumed loan and obtained a new loan secured by the property in the amount of $72.5 million, which bears interest at 3.625 percent and matures in February 2023. See Note 9: Mortgages, Loans Payable and Other Obligations.  During the second quarter 2016, the Company, which held a 38.25 percent subordinate interest in the unconsolidated Portside Apartment Developers, L.L.C., a joint venture which owns a 175-unit operating multi-family property located in East Boston, Massachusetts, acquired the remaining interests of its joint venture partners for $39.6 million in cash plus the assumption of a mortgage loan secured by the property with a principal balance of $42.5 million. The cash portion of the acquisition was funded primarily through borrowings under the Company's unsecured revolving credit facility. Upon acquisition, the Company consolidated the asset and accordingly, remeasured its equity interests, as required by the FASB's consolidation guidance, at fair value (based upon the income approach using current rates and market cap rates and discount rates). As a result, the Company recorded a gain on change of control of interests of $5.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. On July 8, 2016, the Company repaid the assumed loan  Table of Contents  and obtained a new loan secured by the property in the amount of $59 million, which bears interest at 3.44 percent and matures in August 2023.

(e) The Company recorded impairment charges of $9.8 million on these properties during the year ended December 31, 2015.  (f) The Company recorded impairment charges of $1.0 million on these properties during the year ended December 31, 2015.

(h) The Company transferred the deed for this property to the lender in satisfaction of its obligations.  (i) The Company recorded impairment charges of $66.5 million on these properties during the year ended December 31, 2015.  (j) The Company recorded an impairment charge of $4.2 million on this property during the year ended December 31, 2015.  Rental Property Held for Sale, Net  During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company signed agreements to sell eight office properties totaling approximately 750,000 square feet, subject to certain conditions, and identified them as held for sale as of December 31, 2016. The properties are located in Princeton, Cranford and Bridgewater, New Jersey. The Company determined that the carrying value of one of the office properties was not expected to be recovered from estimated net sales proceeds and accordingly recognized an unrealized loss allowance of $7.7 million at December 31, 2016. In January and February 2017, the Company completed the disposition of these properties for net sales proceeds of approximately $45.8 million.  Unconsolidated Joint Venture Activity  On April 1, 2016, the Company bought out its partner PruRose Riverwalk G, L.L.C. for $11.3 million and increased its subordinated interest in Riverwalk G Urban Renewal, L.L.C. from 25 percent to 50 percent using borrowings on the Company's unsecured credit facility. Riverwalk G Urban Renewal, L.L.C., owns a 316-unit operating multi-family property located in West New York, New Jersey. Concurrent with the refinancing in October 2016, the Company executed an agreement with the remaining partner which converted the 50 percent subordinated interest to 22.5 percent pari passu interest.  Table of Contents  On May 26, 2016, the Company sold its 50 percent interest in Port Imperial South 15, L.L.C. ("RiversEdge") and its 20 percent interest in Port Imperial South 13 Urban Renewal, L.L.C. ("RiverParc"), joint ventures that own the 236-unit and the 280-unit multi-family operating properties, respectively, located in Weehawken, New Jersey for $6.4 million. The Company realized a gain on the sale of $5.7 million.  On January 31, 2017, the Company sold its interest in KPG-P 100 IMW JV, LLC, Keystone-Penn and Keystone-Tristate joint ventures that own operating properties, located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania for a combined sales price of $9.7 million.  On February 3, 2017, the Operating Partnership issued 42,800 shares of a new class of 3.5 percent Series A Preferred Limited Partnership Units of the Operating Partnership (the "Preferred Units"). The Preferred Units were issued to the Company's partners in the Plaza VIII & IX Associates L.L.C. joint venture that owns a development site adjacent to the Company's Harborside property in Jersey City, New Jersey as consideration for their approximate 37.5 percent interest in the joint venture. Concurrent with the issuance of the Preferred Units, the Company purchased from other partners in the Plaza VIII & IX Associates L.L.C. joint venture their approximate 12.5 percent interest for approximately $14.3 million in cash. The results of these transactions increased the Company's interests in the joint venture from 50 percent to 100 percent.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  The accompanying consolidated financial statements include all accounts of the Company, its majority-owned and/or controlled subsidiaries, which consist principally of the Operating Partnership and variable interest entities for which the Company has determined itself to be the primary beneficiary, if any. See Note 2: Significant Accounting Policies - Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures - to the Financial Statements, for the Company's treatment of unconsolidated joint venture interests. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.  Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 810, Consolidation, provides guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights ("variable interest entities" or "VIEs") and the determination of which business enterprise, if any, should consolidate the VIEs. Generally, the consideration of whether an entity is a VIE applies when either:  On January 1, 2016, the Company adopted accounting guidance under ASC 810, Consolidation, modifying the analysis it must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities. The guidance does not amend the existing disclosure requirements for variable interest entities or voting interest model entities. The guidance, however, modified the requirements to qualify under the voting interest model. Under the revised guidance, the Operating Partnership will be a variable interest entity of the parent company, Mack-Cali Realty Corporation. As the Operating Partnership is already consolidated in the balance sheets of Mack-Cali Realty Corporation, the identification of this entity as a variable interest entity has no impact on the consolidated financial statements of Mack-Cali Realty Corporation. There were no other legal entities qualifying under the scope of the revised guidance that were consolidated as a result of the adoption.  The Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and . . .
