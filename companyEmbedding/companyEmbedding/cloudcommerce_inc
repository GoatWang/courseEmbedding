Data Feeds


Have your own in-house E-Commerce platform? We can help you by providing you with a one stop shop for product data. We provide you with managed product data that is the best in the industry, and we give you the ability to place orders to all suppliers in a single place and format.

Connect to Retailers and Manufacturers. Our OBN Data Managment & Feed program allows your retailers to easily access your data and load it into their store system. Our one click to ship feature allows Retailers to easily send orders into your system for fulfillment. If you don’t already have a B2B online ordering system, ask us how we can help.





B2B E-Commerce


We make your relationship with the retailer tighter. By connecting you and the retailer directly it builds the retailers sales and makes it easy for them to submit orders directly to you. We manage the technology, so you don’t have to. They sell more, you sell more…everyone wins.
Learn More






Data Management


Your product data needs work. You have buyers managing images and warehouse workers typing in product names, why? We work together with our in house data team and the manufacturers to ensure that the product data retailers get from you is efficient and effective online.
Learn More





Distributors and Retailers are constantly asking you for product data. We know that, and we have a better way to deliver it. Our Data Management & Feed system allows you to work together with us and distributors to build and manage your product data for online commerce. We have been known to build some slick manufacturer websites as well.





B2B E-Commerce


Our CloudCommerce platform supports both B2B and B2C sales. It is easily customized and supports multiple price levels. A major benefit of working with our platform is the ability to allow retailers to sync your products through our Data Management system.
Learn More






Data Managment


When a retailer comes to you and asks you for product data to help him sell, what is your answer? “Copy it from my website.” WRONG! We help you build out your product data and manage its flow to sell more and represent your brand properly in all channels.

MARKET



The Explosive Growth of Commerce in the Cloud
Back in the year 2000, online shopping was something that tech-savvy people did, while courageously entering their credit card information on a website far, far away. Today, everyone from teenagers to grandparents purchase products and services on the Internet, everyday.
Powered by lower cost and more scalable web hosting technologies on the cloud, smarter mobile devices and faster Internet connections, e-commerce has become an indispensible way of life, and business. With the growth of new economies such as China and India, commerce on the cloud is a global opportunity with an exponential growth curve.

Business-To-Consumer (B2C) Sales
Internet e-commerce was pioneered by B2C companies such as Amazon and eBay, which have forever transformed the retail industry. Total worldwide B2C e-commerce sales were $1.5 trillion in 2014, and are projected by eMarketer to grow to $2.4 trillion by 2017. B2C sales in the United States are projected to be almost $500 billion by 2018.


Business-To-Business (B2B) Sales
Internet e-commerce was pioneered by B2C companies such as Amazon and eBay, which have forever transformed the retail industry. Total worldwide B2C e-commerce sales were $1.5 trillion in 2014, and are projected by eMarketer to grow to $2.4 trillion by 2017. B2C sales in the United States are projected to be almost $500 billion by 2018.

Mobile Commerce
According to eMarketer, there were 1.06 billion smartphone users in 2012. By the end of 2015, there will be over 2 billion smartphone users, growing to 2.73 billion users by 2018. This availability and accessibility of powerful Internet connected mobile devices, in the hands of nearly half of the world’s population, further drives up B2B and B2C transaction volumes. In fact, in mid-2014, the percentage of mobile retail traffic exceeded desktop traffic.  Retailers and businesses are finding themselves in a race to constantly satisfy the always-on customers – on the desktop and mobile.  This is great news for solutions providers, like CloudCommerce, Inc.

SOLUTIONS


Cloud-Driven E-Commerce And Mobile Commerce Solutions
Whether it is selling products or services online, or making business processes available on the cloud, we deliver solutions that maximize user experience with real-time integration to enterprise applications.
We focus intently on four areas of expertise: great front-end user experience, robust back-end integration, effective digital marketing and analytics, and complete solutions management.


Optimal Front-End User Experience
Without a optimal user interface, even the most technically advanced solution will not achieve great business results. Therefore, we design our solutions with the end-user first. From fast loading webpages, to user-friendly navigation, to high quality graphic designs, to useful organization of information, we apply industry best practices along with our deep internal expertise to deliver solutions that delight the customers in their online experience of a company’s brand.


Robust Back-End Enterprise Application Integration
In an increasingly omni-channel world, seamless integration between web channels, mobile channels, and brick-and-mortar channels, are critical in serving the demanding and technically savvy customers of the 21st century. For example, an e-commerce site without real-time inventory data will frustrate customers with backorders, impedes a company’s growth, and erodes brand loyalty. These channels can integrate to each other through the cloud, or centrally through cloud-connected back-end business systems. Whether the back-end system is a full-blown ERP software like SAP and Oracle, or a medium size system such as Brightpearl, our expert teams can customize a solution using best-of-breed middleware, or custom engineering, to achieve any level of integration our customers desire.


Effective Digital Marketing And Analytics
Once a solution is deployed, regardless of whether it’s for business-to-consumer (B2C) or business-to-business (B2B) transactions, effective digital marketing and analytics are absolutely essential to ensuring online success. Our teams can perform a myriad of digital marketing services such as, search engine optimization, e-mail campaign creation, or social promotions. In addition to digital marketing services, we also apply data analytics to help businesses understand the behavior of their online customers to derive actionable refinements to business or marketing programs.


Complete Solutions Management
Our mission is to be a full service provider of cloud commerce solutions to medium, large, and global enterprises. From front-end design, to back-end integration, to digital marketing, our solutions are as complete as our customers want them to be. In addition to development, we can also fully manage our client solutions with services such as technology consulting, ongoing maintenance, hosting infrastructure build out and management. We are constantly expanding our base of talents and expertise to deliver a full range of solutions such as social, mobile, e-commerce, and e-business.
For commerce on the cloud, CloudCommerce makes it happen.

CloudCommerce Launches New Digital Marketing Division


The Company broadens its cloud commerce services offerings to include the rapidly growing digital marketing services segment, which supports the needs of leading brands
SANTA BARBARA, CA--(Marketwired - June 27, 2017) -  CloudCommerce, Inc. (OTCQB: CLWD), a global provider of cloud commerce services to leading brands, today announced the launch of its new digital marketing division.This new division will provide services such as Content Marketing, Marketing Automation, Social Media Strategy/Marketing, Search Marketing, Account-Based Marketing, Sales Enablement, Data Analytics, and Brand Strategy/Brand Experiences. CloudCommerce intends to expand into these areas of focus through direct sales efforts to existing clients, prospective clients and joint partnerships, as well as through the strategic acquisition of digital marketing services firms.According to a research project conducted by the Content Marketing Institute, over 50% of all the businesses they surveyed claimed that their content marketing efforts were negatively affected because not enough time was devoted to it. That market deficiency allows companies like CloudCommerce, which offer content marketing strategy and services at competitive prices, to augment and provide these services to meet the needs of these target customers.The sheer size of the digital marketing industry is substantial, and industry analysts have forecasted tremendous growth over the next few years; PQ Media estimates that by 2019, global content marketing spending will hit around $300 Billion, and Borrell Associates estimates that SEO related spending in the U.S. alone will reach approximately $80B by 2020. This will include spending for both in-house experts as well as outsourced or contracted firms such as CloudCommerce. "The world has gone digital," commented CloudCommerce's CEO Andrew Van Noy. "The ways in which we access information, consume content, engage with brands, and make purchasing decisions have been revolutionized by the myriad of digital touchpoints we encounter throughout our daily lives. What was once a luxury to be able to communicate and interact with customers via digital devices has now become a necessity. It is no longer sufficient to simply have a 'one-size fits all' desktop or mobile website."Van Noy continued, "Your audience expects to receive a customized experience catered to their specific situation. The first touchpoint with a customer when they become aware of your brand, products or services is crucial. Providing relevant content and information about your brand, product or services in their decision-making journey requires dedication, consistency and creativity. Engaging with customers through blogs, newsletters, emails and various forms of social media can turn that customer into a brand advocate and loyal customer for life.""While conceptually understanding this process is relatively easy, it can be very complicated to successfully execute on a digital marketing plan, and our clients need a trusted partner to help guide them through this process." Van Noy concluded, "We are excited about the launch of this new division to serve our clients' needs in this vital area."About CloudCommerceCloudCommerce, Inc. (CLWD) provides advanced cloud commerce services to leading brands. Our customers depend on us to help them compete effectively in the $1.6 trillion worldwide e-commerce market. Our comprehensive services include: (1) development of highly customized and sophisticated online stores, (2) real-time integration to other business systems, (3) digital marketing and data analytics, (4) complete and secure site management, and (5) integration to physical stores.
